[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, our first episode
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.120]   from the brand new brick-twit house.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.880]   And this is actually the first time
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.520]   we've done a show at the round table with everybody on video.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.200]   So this is kind of fun.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.960]   I'll start from my left, Gina Trapani,
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.320]   is here back from China.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.160]   Welcome back, Gina.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.080]   Thank you so much.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.880]   I missed you guys.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.040]   We missed you so much.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.160]   I've changed.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.800]   You're going to share.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.200]   You go away for a few weeks, and I'm sitting in a chair.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.600]   What happened?
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.000]   Everything's different.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.360]   How was China?
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.560]   Congratulations on the move.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.200]   Thank you.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.120]   China was incredible.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.960]   It was a great trip.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.920]   I'm really, really glad to be back.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.160]   Actually, I wrote up my travel log
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.320]   with a bunch of pictures on my blog to check it out.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.720]   But I thought one good story that was appropriate to Twig
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.920]   is Facebook is blocked in China.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.920]   But on my flight from Beijing to Shanghai,
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.560]   they showed the social network on the plane.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.480]   You're kidding.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.040]   Go figure.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.320]   We don't know what this is, but if we could use it,
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.960]   we'd probably like it.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.160]   Can you get on Google Plus or can you?
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.000]   Google Plus was blocked for me, the web app, unless I
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.680]   proxied.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.040]   I was able to proxy through-- oh, and the mobile app worked.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.400]   The mobile app worked.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.400]   I found that with Twitter when I was in China,
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.320]   I could tweet, but only on my phone.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.160]   Yeah, right.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.280]   So I did a lot on my Android phone.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.560]   But I had trouble getting a SIM, so I didn't do as much
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.800]   posting as I'd like.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.840]   Hey, I see that stranger over to my right.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.360]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis is also here.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.920]   He is home with a glass of wine because we had
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.880]   so many technical difficulties earlier.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.560]   We had to move our record time a little bit later in the day.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.680]   Sun's gone over the yard.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.200]   Nice coat drone.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.360]   Looks delicious.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.800]   That is?
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.640]   I'm a big fan of the coat drone myself.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.400]   So welcome to Jeff and Gina.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.640]   And let's introduce a third person today, actually a third
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.240]   and fourth person today.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.400]   Dr. Kiki is here.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.040]   Dr. Kirsten Sanford, our host of This Week in Science,
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.280]   Dr. Kiki's Science Hour on the network and her baby Kai,
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.320]   I think, is right there, right?
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.400]   He is down here.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.480]   I just put him down for a second.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.640]   Oh, show us Kai.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.400]   He'll come back up again.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.880]   Oh, I want to see Kai.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.120]   OK, here comes the baby, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.720]   I'm so impressed by Dr. Kiki.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.800]   Look at that.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   Oh, he's just--
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.960]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.240]   This Week in Babies.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.600]   She brought Kai to the studio a few weeks ago,
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.720]   and he's about the sweetest baby I've ever met.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.760]   I mean, just adorable.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.000]   He's coming tomorrow.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I mean, studio tomorrow.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.920]   So the reason that we asked you to join us--
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.000]   and stick around as long as you want it, Kiki,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   but this is really the hottest topic right now, at least
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.800]   on Google Plus.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.200]   And I think in the Google-- and really in the internet
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.000]   in general is this ban on handles and fake names,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.400]   number of people have been kicked off.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.160]   It started with the brand Bruhaha.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.760]   So people were upset about Mashable, for instance,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.680]   even though Google Plus had said no brands on Google Plus,
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.360]   Mashable and others, Ford, created brands on Google Plus,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.720]   and Mashable gained over 100,000 followers.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.120]   Google started booting some brands on Google Plus,
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.240]   so Mashable changed its name to Pete Cashmore.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.440]   And stayed on, kept all its followers.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.720]   Same exact content changed the name.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.680]   Then Google went after the handles
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.560]   and started banning people who didn't have real names,
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.920]   including one Dr. Kiki.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.600]   Are you still off Google Plus?
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.200]   I am still off Google Plus.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.320]   Have you appealed?
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.600]   Is there a process?
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.040]   There is.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.720]   There's a form you can fill out to give documentation
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.320]   if you have a license or something that
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.960]   has the name that you want to use on it.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.840]   You can submit that to Google.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.200]   Additionally, you can submit websites
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.040]   like a Facebook profile or a Twitter profile, anything.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.240]   If you've been interviewed and had a name
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.760]   used in an interview online--
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.760]   Show.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.960]   --of a documented journalistic entry--
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.640]   Having, for instance, a internet show
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.720]   called Dr. Kiki's Science Hour, wouldn't that qualify?
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.320]   You would think, right?
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.080]   And I actually tried using that as one of my pieces
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.320]   of documentation in the appeals process.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.800]   I got an email today from a nice Jeff at Google.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.920]   And he said that it had been denied
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.280]   and that if I would like to continue to use Google Plus
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.040]   and have my profile, I have to get rid of the doctor.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.480]   So there are no professional titles that are allowed.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.640]   So doctor or professor is not allowed.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.280]   So my wanting to go by Dr. Kiki, which
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.640]   is how many people recognize me and will search for me,
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.240]   isn't allowed.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.400]   I have to go by just Kiki or Kirsten Sanford.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.280]   At least you're not completely unknown by Kirsten Sanford.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.480]   Yeah, what do you think about that?
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.800]   Yeah, I know I'm not completely unknown by that.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.160]   But at the same time, that's not how I want to be known.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.280]   And I'm actually in the middle of trying
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.400]   to decide whether or not to change my profile.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.720]   I'm actually considering not being a part of Google Plus
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.800]   right now, simply just to take a stand.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.120]   Good for you, because that's what I do.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.240]   It makes me sad, because I really
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.560]   want to be a part of the community.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.280]   Let me ask you Kiki, what about having--
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.360]   One thing that Karina Fakes said is, if you had two fields,
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.840]   if you had a real name field and a known as field,
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.040]   and people could find you either way,
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.920]   since you are already-- you're not
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.360]   being synonymous for a redesign of security or anything.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.200]   Would you be OK with that?
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.600]   I am OK with that.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.800]   I mean, they've got a nickname section
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.720]   or an also known as section.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.880]   So I could put in Kiki or Kirsten Sanford
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.960]   and then Dr. Kiki in my nicknames.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.560]   However, for me, this is the question
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.160]   where it comes to brand versus identity.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.000]   And for me personally, how I want to be known online,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.120]   that is my brand.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.160]   I am my brand.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.560]   My brand is me.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.160]   So to try and be searchable-- and Google
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.320]   should understand this more than anybody
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.920]   as the largest search engine--
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.480]   I want to be searchable and have my primary search results
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.240]   come from Dr. Kiki.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.120]   And so I think that the name that I
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.760]   would choose to have in my profile,
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.360]   when I looked for my guest who's going to be on Dr. Kiki
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.280]   Science Hour tomorrow, Vincent Racken-Yellow,
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.760]   that his Google profile comes up in the search results
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.800]   for him on Google.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.120]   So that's his name.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.360]   So I want that name Dr. Kiki to come up as my search--
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.080]   I'm just looking.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.640]   I mean, this is part of the problem with Google,
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.200]   is that all of these enforcements,
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.960]   including the brands-- I guess because it's big.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.840]   I mean, they got 18 million people or whatever, right here.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.320]   But just do a search for DR, period.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.480]   And I've got Dr. Ashu Goyle, Dr. Vivek Andrews, Dr. Robert
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.960]   Kargle, Dr. Kaling Spock, Dr. Moik.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.320]   And there's a lot of doctors on here.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.640]   Are they all going to get knocked off?
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.160]   Probably.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.000]   If not, then I just wonder what Google's doing.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.080]   If they don't go after everybody evenly in the same way.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.720]   Yeah, it's a huge question.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:20.000]   I wonder what Google is getting from this hard-handed,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.600]   you have to do it the way we tell you to do it attitude,
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.160]   as opposed to letting the community dictate the way
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.280]   that they want to use the social network.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.000]   I agree.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.520]   Well, I mean, what about chatroom says, Dr. Phil?
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.960]   I don't even know Phil's last name.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.920]   Dr. Laura.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.240]   Dr. Laura, Dr. Ruth, Dr. John.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.440]   Are you not going to let these people on there?
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.840]   Yeah, or I mean, if it's Dr. Drew,
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.640]   does he have to be Drew Pinsky?
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.800]   If it's Dr. Laura, does she have to be Laura Schleschinger?
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.280]   Let's keep it going.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.640]   And why does Vittysen get to be Vittysen?
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.120]   What do we get to say?
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.880]   So it's pretty obvious that--
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.240]   Or Fittysen, exactly.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.120]   It's pretty obvious.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.240]   And we were talking before the show, Gina.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.280]   And I think that you wrote a piece about this.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.800]   It's pretty obvious that on the one hand,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.680]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.640]   I think in principle, it's a great idea.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.760]   People use their real names.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.760]   They're accountable for what they say.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.040]   You get a higher tone of conversation.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.000]   The problem is when you start to implement it,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.320]   you realize we got a problem here.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.240]   Because who's Lady Gaga?
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.400]   Yes, it.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:25.920]   Who's--
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   You want to say Lady Gaga?
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.560]   I mean, there's issues of brands and their issues
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.680]   of folks who really don't benefit from using their real name.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.760]   And the piece that I wrote--
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.680]   I always think back to when I was in high school,
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.040]   and I was not out of the closet, I
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:45.920]   was not going to sign my real name to certain bits.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.840]   I was trying to find a student group at my college.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.120]   And one of the requirements to get a charter from the school
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.440]   and to get funding was you had to get a list of--
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.960]   it was a gang lesbian, transgender, queer student group.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.800]   You have to get a list of names in student IDs.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.920]   And no one in my circle of friends was willing to do that.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.280]   And so actually, I think--
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.280]   I forget-- we have the link.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.200]   There's a geek feminism wiki that lists
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:15.320]   all the groups of people for whom this real name's policy really
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.000]   harms them.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.280]   And it's generally people who are activists
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.800]   and have their risks associated with revealing
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.960]   their full identity.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.120]   Beyond even brands, I think I added it to the--
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.840]   the Gondotra, I guess, talk to Scoble.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.320]   And I think a piece, some people--
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.400]   although I was told real name is not Vikkundotra.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.760]   So I don't--
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.000]   I mean, it just seems to me that this is such a slippery slope.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.120]   You can't enforce what Google wants to enforce.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.280]   I understand the desire to do that.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.280]   But not only are there good reasons for anonymity,
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.600]   there are plenty of people known by their brand,
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.560]   not by their name, who are damaged by this.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.760]   Shouldn't we judge people by their behavior online,
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.040]   not by their handle online?
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.120]   I'm sympathetic to both sides on this,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.880]   because I think we do want a space online where we have
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.040]   some real identity and know that.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.560]   But I think that there's also-- it's not a question of there
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.320]   being a single identity.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.480]   I think Katerina Fakes started down the line
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.440]   of having a good taxonomy of this.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.480]   That there are people who I think could come in and say,
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.640]   this is my name.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.440]   And in fact, if you're a celebrity or something,
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.640]   this is my name that Google verifies.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.720]   And this is the name that I claim.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.400]   And then this is my pseudonym, but I
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.720]   will tell you my real name at the same time.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.680]   Or this is my pseudonym.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.640]   I don't want to tell you my real name.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.040]   And there could be a taxonomy of that that could be enabled.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.560]   It's complex, but hey, so is life.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.440]   So what if Google plus made the also known as field,
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.240]   the field that you decide is the public--
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.760]   That's a good idea.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.640]   --name that shows at the top of your profile
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.080]   and is the name that gets returned in search results,
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.760]   but your full name isn't necessarily--
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.080]   I don't know.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.600]   Right, you know.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.840]   So that you have the choice.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.320]   Right.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.760]   Both could be searchable.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.240]   Yes, you say.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.080]   But by the Kiki, in your case, people
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.240]   who know you in other forms of life
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.680]   might also want to search in your real name.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.720]   They should be able to find you under either, right?
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.240]   And that would-- for Kiki, that's an easy solution.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.720]   But there's plenty of people who--
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.080]   That would solve my issue, yeah.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:16.920]   Can you hide?
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.920]   That doesn't solve all the issues.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.760]   Can you hide your real name and say,
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.120]   I want to use it the AKA, but Google can know my real name
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.640]   and do you trust Google with your real name?
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.520]   And is that a solution?
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.880]   Well, this is the issue with China,
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.520]   but this is the issue with Iran and Iraq and China
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.000]   and Egypt and so on.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.440]   I'm sympathetic to Facebook saying, listen,
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.200]   we are a service about real names and real relationships
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:38.960]   and real identities.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.000]   And that's what we are.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.480]   And if you want to have a made up identity, use Twitter.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.760]   But that's what we are.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.960]   And at some level, I think it's OK for the creator
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.880]   of the platform to have some say in that.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.480]   But then Kiki is absolutely right.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.120]   At some point, you lose control of the platform to its users.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.000]   You've got to figure out where your line is.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.520]   And Google has laid down-- has created this rule
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.400]   that Google profiles are public.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:02.880]   That's it.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.040]   There's no way to have a private Google profile, right?
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.840]   So to me, it's like you can't have both.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.200]   You have to be a user.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.600]   It's the option to say, I want my name to appear as this
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.440]   in my public Google profile if it has to be public.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.000]   On Facebook, you can have a private profile page
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.920]   and only show it to certain people.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.720]   So it's going to make me sad that Google+ then can only
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.320]   be used by people who are willing to have their name known
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   in public.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.000]   Is that right?
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.720]   Is that how we show it?
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.760]   Let's talk about the rationale behind that.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.760]   That's what I'm trying to figure out is that if your Google--
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.360]   why is it that they're starting--
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.080]   this is their starting point, do we think?
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.800]   I think it's--
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.240]   You heard the rumor going--
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:42.760]   Go ahead.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.720]   Have you heard the rumor going around that suggests
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.120]   it's for advertising purposes.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.360]   Having a real name connected to an identity that is connected
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.240]   across the Google properties could be sold for--
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.760]   that information could be sold--
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.560]   I don't buy that--
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.120]   --of money to advertisers.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.120]   I don't know if I buy it myself, but I'm just--
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.440]   I think that that's exactly what Google would run away from.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.200]   Part of the advantage of online advertising
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.920]   and cookie online advertising is that it doesn't have PII
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.400]   attached.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.320]   It doesn't need to.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:17.120]   And that it doesn't need to, as opposed to an axiom database
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.360]   of magazine subscribers, does have your real name attached.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.920]   And online hasn't been strong enough in selling that
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.040]   as an advantage, is that you're just a computer and not
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.920]   a person.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.760]   I think it strikes me as it was just ill thought out
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.000]   on Google's part, that they--
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.120]   just off the top of their heads, as I might think,
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.960]   if I started a forum-- because Google Plus is really just a forum--
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.800]   I'm going to make people use their real names.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.360]   Because when people use their real names,
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.360]   they're more civil, they're accountable,
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.560]   the conversation, the level of tone and everything,
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.600]   the conversation's better.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.680]   So I'm just going to make people use their real names.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.160]   But they didn't go far enough down the road to think, oh,
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.320]   but what about Dr. Keke?
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.280]   What about Fittyscent?
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.760]   What about Lady Gaga?
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.000]   What about activists who are in China or Iran
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.840]   and don't want their name--
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.520]   What about Well-Gonim?
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.040]   Right.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.400]   You could find--
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.000]   Yeah, that's not his real name, right?
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.400]   They could go to him.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.920]   And he's a Google employee.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.680]   This is the guy, of course, who started the Arab Spring
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.960]   with the Egyptian Revolt and did it in public,
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.840]   but not with his real name.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.120]   Of course, he tried not to have things--
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.760]   Yeah, you got arrested.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.000]   You can establish a whole new Google account
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.200]   with a new Gmail address that goes by all their rules,
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.880]   no doctor in the name and all that stuff,
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.320]   and set up a Google Plus account, right?
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.680]   I mean, they're not verifying names through credit cards
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.400]   or phone numbers, right?
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.520]   So the problem with Dr. Keke--
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:36.760]   What about this?
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.640]   --that just says, "Doctor," right?
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.080]   If I say, "My name is Lady Gaga," that's my name.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.320]   First name lady, last name Gaga.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.080]   What do they do about that?
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:48.360]   Right.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:48.720]   I mean--
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.360]   Yeah, I guess somebody questions you.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.120]   Even Katarina, whose last name is fake,
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.280]   she has a great screenshot--
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:54.840]   Her reel.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.840]   --of what registering for--
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.360]   Her reel?
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.680]   --a registering for some airline or something,
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.360]   putting Katarina fake, and it said, sorry,
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.640]   you got to use your real name.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.120]   What about poor John Doe?
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.200]   He needs to be using arbitrary rules, arbitrary rules.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.600]   But we talked about this, I think, last week.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.440]   There's also the question that Google has talked about.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.880]   There's speculation about their celebrity strategy.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.840]   And that one contemplation said the report
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.200]   was that they were considering having celebrities fax them
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.280]   their driver's license.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:25.780]   Yeah.
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.680]   Probably what they'll do instead is have
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.960]   their agents and managers verify their identities
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.880]   to be a celebrity, which, listen, I understand that too.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.280]   Because you don't want to be the fake lady Gaga.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.520]   Google wants to be able to say, we know this is Lady Gaga.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.000]   We know--
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.080]   Or William Shatner.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:41.880]   Exactly.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.960]   Which who they kicked off.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.160]   Now, obviously, Twitter's figured out a solution for this.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.440]   They have verification.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.000]   They verified me without asking.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.400]   I don't know how they verified me.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.080]   They verify very few people.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.880]   And that's an issue too, is that you can have fake people
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.720]   and it becomes an issue.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.840]   I think there's a huge business opportunity
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.080]   here in verified identity.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.480]   And that the way I would see this going in the long run
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.400]   is a separate independent company we trust.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.520]   I don't know who that would be.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.920]   It's not Microsoft.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:14.920]   It's not the Post Department.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.800]   But somebody, we say, OK, you can verify my identity.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.720]   Google accepts that.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.600]   Twitter accepts that.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.800]   And we can have a verified identity.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.600]   Or, choose not to use the verified identity.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.240]   And I can come into Google+, and have an experience only
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.200]   with verified people.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   That's a good idea.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.440]   So have a switch that says, I'm only
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.040]   going to talk to people who's verified.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.040]   That eliminates spam.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:35.400]   That eliminates--
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.880]   You want to motivate people to be verified with identities
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.960]   that are verified in some way.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.880]   They should do it with a carrot, not a stick.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.520]   But they're doing it with a fence.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.000]   Right.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Right.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:47.600]   Interesting.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.840]   Isn't the best solution, though, for this really, just to say,
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.040]   oops, we made a mistake.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.920]   There's a problem doing this.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.560]   Why don't we just judge people by their behavior online?
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.440]   And if you're a jerk--
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.280]   Is that scale Leo?
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.400]   Well, this doesn't scale either.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:03.920]   That's a problem.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.800]   This doesn't scale either.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.840]   I mean, this is what happens.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.560]   The only way that this works is by community enforcing it.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.400]   That's why Bill Shatner gets kicked off,
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.280]   because a bunch of people say, that's not him, that's not him.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.360]   And Google's automated Python script
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.880]   said it's not him and killed him.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.380]   Right.
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.360]   I think that is the solution.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.160]   I actually think Twitter has handled this pretty well.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.600]   The folks who are famous enough to have impersonators
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.840]   have a way to get verified, but most people are not verified.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.760]   I just-- I feel like with social software,
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.480]   you're given the opportunity to identify yourself.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:31.980]   Right?
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.560]   I mean, we're all given the opportunity
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.840]   to identify ourselves in life and call ourselves
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.560]   what we want and tell stories about who we are,
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.360]   the way that we want.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.920]   Social software should enable that.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.640]   And it just seems weird and strange to have arbitrary rules.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.880]   This seems like just a programmer.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.960]   It was like some programmers.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.200]   Like, this seems like a good idea.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.280]   It's like the Zuckerberg idea.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.520]   It's like, everyone should just use their full names.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.200]   And that's it.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.760]   But just life just is not that simple.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.680]   There's a great post.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.400]   I just added it to the rundown.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.680]   It's called Falsud's Programmers Believe About Names.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.040]   And it's a list of like 40 things.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.800]   And the first one is people have exactly one canonical full name.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.320]   People have one full name, which they go by.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.640]   People have at this point in time exactly one name.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.160]   And it goes on.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:12.920]   The list goes on.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.280]   But I mean, think the reality is,
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.560]   is that names are personal and they're complicated.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.520]   And they're not always John Smith.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:18.880]   Right.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.000]   Programmers would call this a namespace problem.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:22.680]   Yes.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.520]   That's the problem.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.440]   Is the programmers think that way?
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.040]   And there's a canonical name for any object.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:28.400]   Right.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.400]   And it never changes.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:29.600]   It's a deal.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:29.920]   Right.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.400]   Right.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:30.560]   Right.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.480]   People get married.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.280]   They move.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.640]   They use different languages.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.000]   I mean, there's all sorts of situations where names change
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.560]   and where names get complicated.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.560]   So it works for two years.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:38.760]   You're right.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.920]   You'll probably get to this.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.560]   Go ahead.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.360]   We'll get to this later.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:46.000]   But in thinking about hashtags, which I'm sure we'll get to later.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.960]   But the advantage of a hashtag that struck me
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.840]   is that it is not like a canonical namespace.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.360]   Right.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.640]   That no one owns it.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.560]   You don't have to borrow it.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.400]   You don't have to rent it.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.320]   You don't have to buy it.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.200]   You don't have to get permission for it.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.520]   And that's a thing that programmers
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.600]   I think kind of realizes they look at the world like DNS.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.160]   Kiki, this is her--
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.760]   Ultimately, this hurts your feelings,
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.280]   most more than anything else, right?
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.080]   I mean--
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.200]   Yeah, it does hurt my feelings.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.440]   I'd love to be able to just be in Google+
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.400]   and a part of the community as the identity that I choose to use.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.040]   And it's not like Dr. Kiki is totally different from my real name.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.960]   Dr. Kiki, I have a PhD.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.880]   That works.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.320]   Kiki comes from Kirsten.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.920]   It's all part and parcel.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:37.120]   But I'd love to not have this be a problem.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.040]   And unfortunately, it is.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.360]   But I'd also understand this is beta application.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.800]   Google is still working on how they're going to apply rules,
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.520]   what the rules actually are.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.480]   And so they're going to come up against this particular issue
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.120]   and hopefully make adjustments to it
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.720]   based on everything that people are writing.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.640]   There's time to fix it.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.120]   But when you have 18 million people on here,
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:01.680]   there's--
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.200]   It's already so many people.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.400]   And look at Mashable was able to--
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.440]   analogous to this brand issue they've had,
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.160]   Mashable got huge value out of breaking the rules.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.120]   It got away with it.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.320]   You can call it a field trial.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.240]   You can call it a beta.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.400]   But there's value here.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.680]   And there's lots of people here.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.320]   And you miss out because of their policy,
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.680]   regardless of whether it's a field trial or not.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.080]   You lose.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.640]   I think you could make a case.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.480]   They're causing you commercial harm.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.800]   And that is kind of the way I feel about it.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.440]   I mean, I feel that way too because you work for me.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.400]   It worked-- one of the things you do works for me.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.240]   And it's called Dr. Kiki Science Hour.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.880]   And you can't promote it on Google Plus because they don't
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.320]   want you to be Dr. Kiki.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.480]   Anyway, we let Kai's getting fussy and probably doesn't want
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.120]   mom to be on the car.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.160]   He is getting fussy.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.320]   He wants playtime.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.480]   Go ahead.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.720]   Kirk, here's what I'm glad you could come on and talk about this.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.280]   Kirsten Sanford will be back tomorrow
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.720]   with Dr. Kiki Science Hour.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.640]   And Kai will be in the other room in our child care facility.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.640]   That's right.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.600]   Before I go, I just wanted to make one final point
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.080]   that I find it interesting that Google has even
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.160]   embarked on this in the first place
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.560]   because it seems as though the way that the whole system has
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.560]   been set up with circles and you choosing who you're
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.080]   going to follow in different circles,
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.960]   that that inherently gets you with the community of people
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.440]   that you want to be hearing from.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.720]   And so people that you're going to follow,
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.560]   you choose to follow certain people.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.800]   And so you're going to be following people that you trust
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.320]   and that you want to follow anyway who aren't trolls, who
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.600]   don't have bad behavior.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.400]   So the system kind of supports itself.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.000]   And with that, I will leave you to discuss.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Thank you, Kiki.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.320]   And that's how Facebook operates.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.060]   Yeah.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.080]   And the community is doing great.
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:53.880]   Thank you very much for having me on.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.040]   I really appreciate it.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:55.600]   Bye, Dr. Kiki.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.280]   Bye, Dr. Kiki.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.280]   Bye, bye, Jeff.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.240]   I wanted to take care.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.680]   I wanted to get somebody on who's really
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.200]   been affected by this because I think it's
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.880]   easy to talk about it in an abstract,
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.880]   but real people are affected by this.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.160]   And definitely.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160]   It's not-- I don't think it's--
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.880]   I think Google mishandles badly.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.080]   But I mean, it's their site to screw up.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.320]   Well, they're not really screwing.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.360]   I mean, it's doing really well otherwise, right?
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.760]   I mean, this name thing has been an issue.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.680]   The brand thing I'm totally on Google's side.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.200]   I am, too.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.240]   I feel like that makes a lot of sense.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.440]   But that's also a difficult thing to enforce,
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.040]   because what if Pete Cashmore takes over the Mashable
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.360]   account?
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.680]   Now what?
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.880]   And he has, right?
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:36.040]   He did.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.040]   He took over the Mashable account
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.880]   that he shouldn't have created because it
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.000]   had 100,000 followers.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.680]   So he got away with it?
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.960]   Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.400]   Well, I mean, but he changed the name to Pete.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.400]   And now he's--
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.560]   It's the same content.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.400]   Same feed.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:48.960]   Yeah, right.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.800]   It's the same content.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.440]   And by the way, Boing Boing did that.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.800]   They have an intern posting.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.920]   Was it CBS did that?
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.880]   They have an intern posting.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.240]   It's the same account.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.920]   And Google let them just kind of transfer it over.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.400]   So--
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.880]   Yeah, that's frustrating.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.560]   For those people who said, OK, well, wait.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.680]   Yeah, that is frustrating.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.240]   I guess I care only because I love Google.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.880]   Plus, I wanted to succeed.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.240]   But you see how mistakes like this with Buzz,
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.120]   you could see how mistakes like this can kill you very
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.720]   early on out of the box if you get a backlash.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.120]   Yes.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:21.920]   What do you think about--
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.840]   What do you think about Google separating out
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.560]   the business accounts from the people?
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.600]   I like that.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.240]   Even Boing.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.800]   I like that a lot.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.200]   And I think as a brand, I like it.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:33.640]   I do, too.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.920]   I even like that idea as a brand.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.400]   So I have Twit.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.000]   I have a Twit profile waiting for them.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And you know, I entered the--
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.200]   whatever, put it-- but my name in the Google Spreadsheets
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.280]   so that we could be a brand.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.560]   There will be advantages, I presume.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.080]   And I think they've indicated this to brands.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.360]   And the way a brand page is handled is different.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.960]   I think that's good to make that distinction.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.240]   If people don't want to follow brands,
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.080]   they shouldn't have to follow brands.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.880]   I don't think this is--
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.600]   I think that that's OK.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.560]   That doesn't bother me.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.400]   The suit on it is--
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.320]   Yeah, that seems like it will benefit brands and users.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:06.840]   Sorry, Leo.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.640]   I keep talking over you.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.560]   I don't know if it's the layer.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.280]   No, we're having-- it's because it's a part of our audio
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.440]   issues.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.040]   Don't worry.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.040]   When Kiki left, I crashed.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:17.720]   But I'm back.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.400]   Yes, that's another problem we know about.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.320]   But at least we didn't get the feedback.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.200]   That's another problem.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.360]   Upgrades are fun.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.640]   Welcome to the new studio.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.560]   I apologize to everybody.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.440]   It's beautiful.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.520]   Well, if I were a brand, if I were CBS,
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.920]   I would have had this studio up and running for a month
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.280]   without going on the air.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.640]   We would have worked all these kinks out
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.680]   and said we do it live on the air.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.240]   But that's kind of part of my ethos.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.480]   But Leo, that's what the guys were saying when you had
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.280]   the hangout is that's exactly what makes
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:47.920]   you you.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.120]   It's what we're doing.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:49.680]   Well, it's fun.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.120]   Absolutely.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:50.760]   It's fun.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.240]   It's fun.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.360]   I mean, why shouldn't you get to see this?
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.160]   And if it's frustrating, you will tune back in a month.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.840]   We'll have it all fixed.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.960]   That's just the way it is.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.320]   Yeah, for them.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.280]   Oh, speaking of which, we're going to talk about hashtags.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.360]   Good segway.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.440]   With Mr. Jess Jarvis, who lit a fire, baby.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.640]   What did you call it?
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.960]   The Tinder was there.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.960]   You just set the flame.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.360]   The spark of the Tinder.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.960]   I love it.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.480]   We're going to talk about the profane Jeff Jarvis.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.800]   Yeah, I said you were cranky last week.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.400]   I just didn't know how cranky.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.080]   You were right.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:23.560]   You were right.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.800]   I was thinking about that today.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.200]   I've been a rotten mood actually.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.280]   Yes, you're absolutely right.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.440]   I love it.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.840]   Jeff Jarvis and a rotten mood.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.160]   I mean, they compared to the Howard Beale on CBS,
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.080]   the guy at Network is, I'm mad as hell.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.000]   And I'm not going to take it anymore.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.600]   I'm not going to take it anymore.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.480]   You know, this happened right when I got back from China.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.800]   And I'd been thinking a lot about the sort of the freedoms
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.920]   that I enjoy every day being an American.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.000]   I really appreciated so much about China.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   But I actually found myself feeling more patriotic than ever.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.080]   And then I came home and saw that Jeff had started this hashtag.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.320]   And I was like, yes.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.760]   Yes.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.800]   And it made me very proud.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.480]   So thank you, Jeff.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.480]   When you said, Gina, you are far too polite to use it yourself.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.960]   You are.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.000]   Not the ones I would have chosen, but you wouldn't have lit up.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.760]   Well, it lit up the way that it did.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.680]   Right.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.880]   And by the way, that's the main reason it travels.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.200]   Because then when you get home, you
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.280]   appreciate what we have here in the US.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:16.520]   Right.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.840]   Dagnat it wouldn't work.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.280]   Make sure you're a patriot.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.080]   I remember Gina when I left East Berlin
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.480]   after spending some time there.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:27.240]   The one I wanted more than anything else was a choice of colas.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:31.240]   In the old days, they had the worst fake cokes
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.200]   in the Eastern Bloc.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.120]   I had one in Czechoslovakia.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:35.840]   Kamikola.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.600]   Yeah, Kamikola, it had cinnamon.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.200]   On the bottom of the coat, you'd get
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.920]   there'd be dregs of cinnamon.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:42.920]   It was funny.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.560]   I spent the first few days like, I'm
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.920]   going to just have this whole experience and just green tea
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.840]   for me.
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.040]   And then by day two, I was like, oh, God, just a Diet Coke.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:52.560]   Just please.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.480]   The good news is--
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.080]   The Chinese love Coca-Cola.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.560]   And Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.200]   It's everywhere.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.120]   Yes.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:58.760]   Everywhere.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.240]   Everywhere.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.360]   And Coke was everywhere too.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.760]   So it was fine, but I was humbled by my very American
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.720]   cravings.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.840]   The Chinese don't even drink green tea all the time.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.520]   That's an American thing.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.600]   Chinese are drinking the slug and the Coke.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.320]   We're going to take a break.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:12.820]   Come back.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.880]   Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trapani.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.160]   Don't you love this?
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.200]   Don't you love this?
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.520]   This is like-- I feel like you're here.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:18.920]   I just--
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.800]   It's a great setup.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.040]   It's so fun.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:21.720]   More with them--
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.200]   Full screen, baby.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.120]   Full screen.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.080]   Your head's bigger than mine, though.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.880]   We got to work on that.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.600]   Jeff's the right size.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.640]   Now Jeff, you could be the--
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.320]   Oh, the other one.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.120]   Gina is so big.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.120]   We'll be back in just a minute.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.720]   I want to talk a little bit about our friends
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.640]   at Netflix.com/twit.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.760]   If you're not yet a Netflix member-- and I know you all
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.400]   are, who isn't?
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.800]   But every night-- I think--
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.440]   every night I go home, I think the Lord,
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.080]   I don't live in a commie nation.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.640]   I live in a country where I could come home
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.440]   and I can watch great TV like this.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.280]   Well, there's a lot of places you can't do this.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.840]   And in fact, I know there are a lot of people who watch.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.840]   I shouldn't be silly about this because about 30% of you
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.160]   live outside the US who watch this show
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.200]   and can't get Netflix.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.920]   But if you can, you just--
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.720]   You just be grateful.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.560]   You just be grateful.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.240]   Netflix.com/twit.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.560]   The streaming is what I like.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.040]   This is the best deal in entertainment.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:23.080]   $7.99 a month for thousands of movies, TV shows too.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.520]   There's your glee.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.280]   You can watch your glee.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.480]   Nice.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.440]   Seasons 1 and 2.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.200]   I'm sure the rest of them will be on soon.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.560]   Great movies.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.960]   I've been going through the old office episodes with Abby.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.960]   That's been so much fun because she was in France.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.840]   She missed a whole season.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.440]   So we just said, well, let's start all over.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:41.960]   I love it.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.320]   If you-- oh, marathon, man.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.600]   That is a great movie.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.240]   It does just often.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.520]   He just added Mad Men, by the way.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.680]   Yeah, where is Mad Men?
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.440]   Abby, I mean, Rivera producer is a Mad Men fanatic.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.320]   I love Mad Men.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.720]   Great show.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.200]   I was told it was just added.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:54.640]   Let me look.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.080]   Let me look.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:55.520]   Let me look.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.840]   Mad Men.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.360]   Mad Men.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.360]   So you do a search right here.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.160]   This is the watch instantly.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.080]   There it is.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:01.720]   Mad Men.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.040]   Yup.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.560]   You can watch it instantly.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.000]   And this is nice too on the instant because you're not
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:08.640]   getting into DVDs.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.680]   You can watch any individual episode
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.840]   from any of the four seasons.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.240]   So you say, you know, I would love
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.760]   to see episode five, season three, the fog over again.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.320]   Boom.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:20.720]   Boom.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.120]   There it is.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.320]   Opportunistic Pete.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.280]   Trying to work a new angle.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.360]   Don and Betty going crazy over Sally's behavior.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.080]   And a strange dream.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.480]   I'll put a little like episode.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.040]   See, you remember him.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.360]   You got to memorize.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.000]   I do.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:35.440]   I love it.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.320]   I do.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.160]   If this is-- if for $7.99 a month to watch every episode of
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.720]   Mad Men, that's a deal.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.120]   And you don't even have to pay for it.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.360]   Go to Netflix.com/twit.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.160]   And if you're in a commination, you have my deepest
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.600]   sympathies.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.000]   Netflix.com.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.840]   I like this mask.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.480]   It's OK, movie.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.440]   I'm going to rate that.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.160]   It's going to be going to be some recommendations
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.240]   on the movies I might like.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:55.720]   I love it.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.920]   Netflix.com/twit.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.360]   And if you're already a member, would you do me a
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.320]   favorite because we were trying to get some people to
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.440]   join here if you just tell your friends, your neighbors.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.120]   Go across the street.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:05.960]   Say, hey, you.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.200]   You're no commie.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.120]   You probably want to subscribe to Netflix.com/twit.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.080]   It's the American way.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.160]   It goes over great.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.000]   That, or I'm taking away your core.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.840]   No color free.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.600]   You're stuck with green tea for the rest of your life.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.320]   If you don't--
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.480]   Had you like to be taken.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.080]   And by the way, buy a brick.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:26.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.120]   I didn't even think of that.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.040]   Buy a brick.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.920]   That's what all good Americans do.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.240]   And some international viewers as well.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.160]   Thank you very much.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:36.960]   We got--
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.480]   We just got Spotify.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.480]   Yes.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:39.920]   There you go.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.600]   See, that's how you make up to them.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.240]   Hey.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.560]   We just got Spotify.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.160]   You've had it all this time.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:46.920]   You know who I blame?
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:47.760]   I don't blame Netflix.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.680]   I don't blame Spotify.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.640]   I blame the record industry, the movie industry, the TV
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.680]   industry, and the publishing industry because they don't
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.480]   have these--
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.320]   they're very parochial.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.120]   Hey, we got different--
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.280]   Oh, Fox just went worse.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.400]   Fox is now going to charge you on Hulu for the next day.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:01.760]   What?
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.560]   Even if I've Hulu plus?
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.520]   Fox is evil.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.040]   OK.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.040]   Unless you're a cable subscriber and can prove it and all
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:08.960]   this stuff.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.080]   That actually-- you know, CNN's doing that too.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.800]   If you want to watch their streaming, you have to get a
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.080]   deal with a cable.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.840]   You have to have a cable account and not all cable
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.120]   companies have signed up for it.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.120]   And that's unfortunately-- that's just the way it is with
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:19.880]   cable agreements.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.120]   You can't--
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.480]   But it doesn't align them with their customers.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:23.840]   That's the way they--
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.200]   No.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:24.720]   And they--
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.960]   Is that how HBO Go works?
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.120]   Yes.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:31.720]   And believe me, HBO and Fox and CNN would just assume go
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.160]   straight to you over the internet.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.240]   But they can't because they got deals with the cable
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.040]   companies that say no, no, no, no, no, because you'll
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.400]   undermine our subscribers, right?
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.600]   If you could watch all these without being a cable
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.240]   customer, then that would cost them.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.480]   So that's how they-- that's what it is.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.160]   I know this because of tech TV.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.440]   We had rules in our covenants with all the different
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.960]   cable companies, no more than 10 minutes of any given show
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.880]   on the internet.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.640]   They're all these rules.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.280]   You cannot stream live.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.640]   And it drove me crazy because I would say I would go
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.080]   into executive meetings at tech TV and say, we're building
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:05.360]   a brick and mortar business in an internet economy.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.760]   And there was nothing we could do about it.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.760]   That's why, by the way, this is not on cable.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.480]   Right.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.640]   Hence the new studio.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.480]   Hence the new studio.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.440]   Hence the new studio.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.160]   So, Jeff, how do you feel about Washington these days?
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:25.720]   So, you know, Saturday night--
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.240]   What happened?
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:26.840]   Tell us the story.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.520]   I was sitting home.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.840]   I had a little pinot noir.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.760]   I violated my own rule.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.520]   In my book, coming up, I have a Cabernet rule where I say
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.280]   you shouldn't allow friends to tweet, blog, or do anything
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.760]   after they've had too much to drink.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.440]   That's probably true.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:46.400]   But after a few glasses of a nice pinot, I had watched the--
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.400]   I've been all absorbed in the British story.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.440]   And then I came and I watched the stuff about what's going
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.040]   on in Washington.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:51.880]   And I just had it.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.680]   And I came online.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.640]   And I just on Twitter.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.960]   Because Twitter is meant to offload your chest, right?
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.480]   Right.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.960]   And I just said, you know, it's our money.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.080]   It's our economy, FU.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.400]   And it took off a little bit.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.880]   People decided that I said, you know, well, we ought to have
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.080]   a chant here, you know.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.240]   "FU Washington."
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:12.360]   And somebody came in named, I think, Booger or something.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.760]   I can't remember what you're talking about.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.920]   That's the great thing about--
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.040]   That's C.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.480]   See, handles are OK.
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:17.920]   Booger.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.880]   Yeah, never mind real identities.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.240]   Poor Mr. Booger.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:25.360]   And-- or Ms. Booger, I have no idea.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.800]   And said, you should make it a hashtag.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.880]   And I said, well, duh, of course.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.600]   And it took off without me.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:36.480]   And it wasn't the most genteel expression of the sentiment.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.920]   No, but it really was a Howard Bill moment.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.360]   Because you tapped into sentiment.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.400]   Of course, it's all about the battle over the debt ceiling
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.680]   and the fact that this country will be in default
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.640]   in a few days.
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.720]   And it's just the stalemate in Washington.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.200]   And it's going to affect-- you know, it's
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.760]   the British finance minister.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.240]   What did he say?
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.920]   He said, a couple of right-wing Republicans
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:04.080]   are holding the entire financial world at a hostage.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.280]   Vince Cable in the UK.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:05.780]   Yeah.
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.920]   And so the interesting thing about it
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.640]   was is that people-- and I wrote a post today about this.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.760]   It taught me a lot in the end always
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.760]   about the structure of the internet
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.760]   that when I did a few Washington,
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:22.040]   people came in and yelled at me because I didn't say FUGOP
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.400]   or a few Democrats or a few White House or a few Congress.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.640]   I think you said it right.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.160]   But what happened that amazed me was
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:32.120]   is that people imbued their own meaning in it.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.760]   And so very quickly, it left me.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:48.120]   And people said, FUG
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:48.520]   and FUGOP were making me nervous about whether my parents could
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.120]   get their Social Security check.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.960]   FUGOP was for the war for this, for that, for whatever.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.880]   And in the sense it was all entirely negative,
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.880]   in a more way.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.960]   I didn't want to be inspiring anyone to take up arms.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.520]   But also inside this, it really struck me.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.360]   And I always have to remember the faith
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.800]   that I have to have in my fellow man and woman here,
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.600]   my fellow citizens, is that in each of these
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.640]   was a message of hope, was a message of expectation
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.520]   of the government.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.440]   And in saying that they didn't meet this expectation,
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.680]   there was a hope that they could and that they would.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.720]   And so it was all wrong.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.720]   This isn't nihilistic on your part.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.680]   This is-- get it together, Washington.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.120]   Yeah, I thought it was.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.680]   And I was just mad and saying you should
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.680]   be doing better than this.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.840]   Your job is your job to manage government.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.880]   So it went on and on and on.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.800]   And of course, the other interesting thing here
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.400]   is that media is now after their second.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.440]   And so media came in.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.800]   And so I did the CBS Early Show the other day.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:46.320]   And you just had the image up where they carefully, carefully,
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.200]   bleeped and blurred everything.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.600]   But in the end, they put up this trends map
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.000]   where it says, in full glory, if you
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.640]   Washington across the whole country.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.640]   I love this.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.680]   And as I said to the correspondent,
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.920]   it's like a Howard Beal moment where everybody across the country
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.080]   is raising their windows and screaming this out.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:04.920]   I'm mad.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:05.720]   It was hot that day.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.480]   And people said on Twitter that they
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.000]   didn't want to open their windows because they
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.560]   let the heat in and the air conditioning out.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.880]   But we are a little nihilistic now.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.080]   And I kind of dare the FCC to go after them for a fee,
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.520]   an expletive here.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:25.880]   And it always teaches me, Leo and Gina, about thinking
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.360]   about the show and the cloud is that it's always a lesson
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:33.280]   in the internet and its impact on society
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.840]   and how people are using these things and other, using them
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.840]   on their own and how this new architecture enables people
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.800]   to do things.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.080]   And I want to be very careful here and make clear
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.280]   that this is not a revolution.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.560]   It's not a career square.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.200]   It's none of that.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.680]   It was a little lark on the weekend.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.560]   It's already dying down.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.480]   All I'm saying is that I learned lessons about my fellow
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.680]   citizens out of this.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.520]   And they were good lessons.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.480]   We applaud you.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   Yeah, we do.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.880]   Nothing to applaud.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.560]   Applaud the pinot.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.880]   I think that's why people really were attracted to it,
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.160]   Jeff.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.480]   It was a genuine passionate expression
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.760]   that people gather around.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.880]   So what was the final tally of the number of people who--
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.360]   I just looked it up on top sea.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.480]   It's 87,000 weeks.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.200]   87,000 weeks.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:20.920]   Which is not much at all, except that if you looked at how
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.760]   many letters to the editor would make it in, one or two
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.760]   across the country a few weeks later,
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.680]   and those are 87,000 expressions of an opinion
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.920]   that somebody got to hear now, unmediated by media.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.320]   And that's what I like about it.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.320]   The Ask Obama, the Twitter town hall Twitter
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.720]   and the White House had put out the Ask Obama hashtag
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.720]   and had promoted it during the weekdays
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.480]   for several days going up to the event.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.600]   So that had quite a bit more a bigger announcement,
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.160]   attraction, and promotion than yours did.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.600]   And it got 119,000 tweets.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.880]   So it's very close.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.760]   So it's very close.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.680]   And it's interesting.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:01.320]   We did a bunch of analysis on the data
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.720]   that we got back from the White House from actually
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.720]   President Obama's tweet that applies to that tweet.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.800]   And we wrote it up on the expert labs blog.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.720]   And it's interesting.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.200]   I think it's really easy for people
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.320]   to express anger about policy.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.760]   I think it's harder to--
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.480]   It's all over that.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:21.000]   I think it's harder to get people to participate constructively.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.040]   And I'm not-- and I don't mean to--
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.720]   I think what you did is great.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.560]   Like I said, not the words that we were showing.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.480]   But the next step is like, yes, I'm frustrated with a lot of policy
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.520]   and it made me really happy to see somebody take your tag
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.720]   and say that they're upset that they can't marry who they want
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:36.560]   because I can't either.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.760]   And I feel the same way.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.680]   But then it's like, what's the next step?
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.000]   How do we make these conversations constructive
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.440]   and informed policy rather than just kind of an expression
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.000]   of just anger?
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.520]   What warning am about to do it?
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.160]   You said, Glee, and now I'm going to say it.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.800]   OK, watch out chat room.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.240]   Habermas.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.520]   Habermas.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.920]   I did it.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.480]   I really think-- and I'm going too far.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.440]   I'm going way too far.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.720]   But that's what I do for a living.
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.720]   I think that in the internet and in these moments like this,
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:09.000]   I see us, the people starting to recapture the public sphere.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.320]   And you're right, Gina, then comes with that a responsibility
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:12.840]   to watch a dude.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.480]   This was a silly little thing to say.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.720]   It didn't accomplish anything.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.080]   It invented some steam.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.400]   That's all it did.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.080]   But there's an argument.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.120]   James Kerry, who's a scholar who, unfortunately,
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.520]   died a few years ago, who's an expert on journalism and media,
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.680]   says that it's media's job not to inform the conversation
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.600]   but to be informed by the conversation that we're having.
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.920]   And that he argues that the worst thing that happens to America
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.560]   is opinion polls because they reduce us to a number.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.560]   But you listen to the opinion polls
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.640]   and Americans are telling Congress,
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.400]   compromise you idiots.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.240]   Yes.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.320]   Somebody said earlier, one of the most picked up lines
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:50.000]   was, if you Washington for not having the compromising
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.040]   skills of a three-year-old.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.200]   Yes.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.800]   And I think at some point we are holding the feet
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.600]   to the fire of Washington.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:59.200]   Some again got mad at me saying that I was going into government
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:40:59.560]   hate here.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.360]   I'm not.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.840]   People said what they cared about then, and that's that.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.560]   But you're absolutely right, Gina.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.800]   It's the same problem here.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.280]   It's the same problem in Egypt.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.200]   How do you take these tools and now start
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.600]   to rebuild a new kind of society using these tools?
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.160]   And we haven't gotten there yet.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.560]   And I think we won't lead the way.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.800]   I think Egypt and Tunisia will.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.120]   And we better learn from them.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:21.760]   Yep.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.560]   That's the next step.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.320]   I think you're right.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.080]   I hope you're right.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.160]   I'd like for us to lead the way.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.040]   And that's the cloud.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:26.880]   I would love to, too.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:31.280]   But I think we're too cushy and people like me
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.600]   are too privileged to spout this kind of stuff out.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.800]   In other countries you did this.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.720]   You could get killed for it.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:40.120]   If you did this in China, if you were even able to try,
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:40.920]   you'd be jailed.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.400]   Yep.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.920]   FUBaging.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:44.600]   Wow.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.080]   And you could see why they walked to Twitter and Facebook.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.760]   I mean, these are dangerous platforms.
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.160]   Right.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.760]   Well, they have their own versions.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.680]   Which are probably also have their own language.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.360]   Be careful, right?
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:57.840]   Right.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.360]   Right.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.000]   And completely censored.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.960]   Everyone has to provide their identification card
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.800]   in order to use them and all that.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.160]   And that's the issue with ID again.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.840]   Because it comes full circle with the other discussion.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.680]   It does.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:07.680]   Yep.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.280]   And the Beijing airport to use the free Wi-Fi
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.560]   had to scan my passport to get a username and password.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.680]   Because there's-- yeah, I posted a picture of the slip,
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.680]   a paper of a username and password.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.880]   There's a rule that you cannot access the internet
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.920]   anonymously.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.840]   And in fact, they're asking small coffee shops and businesses
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.120]   that offer free Wi-Fi to install this $1,300 software,
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.200]   which requires users to provide their identification number.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.360]   And a lot of coffee shops are just saying, screw it.
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.600]   I can't pay for that.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.360]   And they're just turning out-- they're just
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.240]   unplugging their routers.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.600]   But yeah, I was floored by that.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.600]   I was like, what do you mean they want my passport?
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.400]   I just want to use the free Wi-Fi.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.000]   Well, that tells you something about the real name debate.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.520]   There's an example of real name--
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.040]   It does.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.320]   Doesn't it put it in perspective?
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.520]   Google, don't ask me to scan my passport
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.200]   before I can use Google+, OK?
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.200]   Right.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.200]   Well, in Germany, they have ID cards
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.680]   that are going to have RFID chips involved.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.400]   Lord knows I've talked about Germany enough in the show.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.360]   But when they go wacky in the one end on privacy,
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.880]   on the other end, they're adopting that.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.280]   And that's a little scary.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.840]   Yeah, but it makes everybody safe, Jeff.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.640]   This is what-- when you use the subway in Beijing,
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.080]   same thing.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.720]   You have to scan your identification card
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.960]   to go inside the subway.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.280]   And our tour guide explained that this made things very safe.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.360]   No one worried when they rode the subway,
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.960]   and that bombings can never happen in their subways.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.760]   It's really interesting, very interesting perspective.
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.160]   Did you know that vampires run Google?
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.000]   Watch.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.280]   Do you watch True Blood?
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:37.880]   I do.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.640]   I love it.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.200]   Do you remember this?
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.600]   I saw this last night, because I watched it on this video.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.280]   I think you have to scroll a little bit.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.760]   You have to scroll in a little bit.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.200]   114.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:51.800]   OK, so Bill, who is the king of Louisiana and a vampire,
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.960]   talks about the history of vampires,
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.800]   and why there were a lot of vampires--
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.200]   Vampire priests?
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:58.720]   In the priest.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.480]   You know nothing of our history.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:04.920]   Vampires have often found it advantageous to maintain
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:08.560]   a hidden presence in humanity's most powerful institutions.
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.960]   And in the 1600s, that was the Catholic Church.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:15.240]   And today, as you all know, it's Google and Fox News.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.280]   You screw it in.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.320]   It was a great off-end-a-game move on.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.760]   But I just love that.
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:23.200]   As you know--
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.120]   Such a great show.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.120]   That was my favorite part.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:29.080]   And as you know, it's Google and Fox News.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.480]   Of course, Googlers are never seen in daylight.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:31.960]   Right.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.480]   Well, that's a great pale.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.760]   And there are no mirrors in the Google bathroom.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.120]   They sparkle.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.560]   Oh, that's the wrong vampire.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.480]   Sorry.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.960]   Oh, now everyone's going to get upset with me
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:41.760]   for bringing up Twilight.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.200]   Twilight vampire.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.400]   They sparkle?
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:46.120]   They do.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.360]   Twilight's the glee of vampires.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.000]   Oh, you haven't enjoyed Robert Pattinson's sparkling.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:51.520]   Come on.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.320]   You've lived.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.480]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:54.980]   No.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.680]   We need more women on this show.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:58.680]   I've got a crush on Superman.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:44:59.680]   I got you, too.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.680]   I know.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.680]   I love Superman.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.680]   Oh, thank you, Eileen.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:03.680]   I love Superman.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.680]   Oh, so cute.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.680]   Eileen is putting it in a vote for Twilight.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.360]   Do I have to now somehow follow Twilight?
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:07.860]   No.
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:08.360]   No.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:08.360]   No.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:09.360]   You can stay with me.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.360]   No, no.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.360]   It's OK.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:12.360]   True blood.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.360]   Yes, big good girl.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.560]   Glory, sexy, over the top, not for children.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.400]   Perfect show for me.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.480]   Did you see this SEO whose--
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.480]   I don't know.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.480]   This is from the Atlantic.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.160]   Selling plus ones.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:27.400]   They must have some guys in a plus one sweatshop.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.640]   Paging mat cuts.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:33.640]   Plus them, plussem.com.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.680]   I'm of SEO shop.biz.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:40.520]   Is offering plus ones for your site at the rate of 50 plus ones for $10.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.480]   250 for $300.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.760]   $2,000 plus ones for $170.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.320]   So what do we do to the math for me, Wendy?
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.520]   What's the lowest cost of per plus one there?
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.520]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:56.200]   It got to be the $2,470.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.360]   It's just pennies, pennies per plus one.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.360]   We're talking $10.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.360]   It's a dime or less for plus one.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.280]   That's ridiculous.
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:05.800]   They're not worth it.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:09.040]   And suddenly, page rank for users gets implemented.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.480]   Well, and here's what they promised.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:14.440]   All plus ones come from people with a Google account that has been verified by phone.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.200]   All plus ones come from real people.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.640]   No bots are used.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.240]   All plus ones are beginning manually going to your website, clicking the plus one button.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.200]   There's no way mat cuts can track this.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.080]   It's untraceable.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:24.920]   They even say that.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.680]   Interesting.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:29.960]   Because plus ones are being given from different IP addresses.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:30.800]   And they're dripping--
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:31.800]   And when does Leo start?
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.320]   Outcome of a plus one.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.840]   Are they really using it yet?
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.800]   Are they really using it yet?
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.680]   Aren't they?
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.520]   I don't know.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.360]   Actually, you know what?
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.760]   They're only using it if it's a plus one for somebody somehow associated with it.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.200]   You know, right?
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.920]   I got the sense that they're not using it very much right now.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.280]   But it's not--
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:50.800]   Now we know why.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.520]   --it's going to become one of those signals that counts more down the road, as they gather
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:55.480]   more data.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:59.560]   Well, and you know that that's what SEO is all about is raising your ranking on Google.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:03.640]   And if there were a way to easily raise your ranking on Google, like hiring 1,000 people
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:08.840]   to click, that would work.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.840]   I think that's going to go away.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.680]   Well, I'm sure--
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:16.840]   No, I saw-- one of the things I put on is whatever it's called, think.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.000]   The Google kind of advertorial magazine they put up.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.600]   Let's just say on your t-shirt, I visited the Apple campus.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.280]   But that's all I'm allowed to say.
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:28.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.560]   I like it.
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.560]   Love it.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:32.560]   Love it.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.760]   I can't turn around all the wires.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:34.920]   It just has an Apple logo on the back.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.440]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.080]   That's great.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.600]   And you know what's great about that?
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.960]   That's the t-shirt.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.520]   You know that Steve Jobs approved it.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.480]   Oh, yeah, exactly.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.080]   So he has a sense of--
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.560]   Exactly.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:49.960]   I got my Julia, my daughter, who's in the video editing.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:55.520]   I got a YouTube that has the Play button and ER after it.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.520]   Play here.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.080]   Oh, I like it.
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:58.640]   I got the--
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.160]   Nice.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:47:59.720]   --like it.
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:00.720]   --nerdy.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:01.240]   Cute.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.000]   I love these things.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:02.720]   I love swag.
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.880]   Somebody says, not swag if you had to pay for it.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.240]   I love the stuff.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:06.880]   That's true.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.640]   I stole this from the Joliet prison.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.120]   That's how badass I am.
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.960]   So what does this think quarterly?
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.360]   Is this something Google does every three--
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.320]   So it's their first effort.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.720]   And it's basically an advertorial thing
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.440]   to send out some fancy companies do to advertisers and such.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.200]   But in there--
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:27.720]   It's very nerdy.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.240]   I mean, I could say biography.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.520]   It's very well done.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.560]   There's some neat stuff in there.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.760]   But the thing that's been rolling around in my empty brain
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:41.640]   like marbles is that I think one of the heads of advertising
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:47.800]   said that 80% of advertising will be live and personal.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:51.280]   And that changes the entire idea of media.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.800]   The idea that media is static and the advertising
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.840]   around it is static and it's a message.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:56.680]   Boom.
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:58.480]   Gone.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.240]   So it goes back to the notion of SEO
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:06.000]   that there is a static rank for a topic.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.320]   We've talked about this often on this show
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.440]   about how things get personalized.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.320]   But it gets really extreme that way.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.520]   So plus one, I'm not sure, is really a universal at all.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:18.280]   It's a signal that they can use in some clever ways.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:21.960]   But I don't think it's a one-on-one page rank-y kind of thing.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.960]   No, in fact, it's a personalization.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.880]   It's a personalization feature.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.360]   So the fact that some unknown user comes in and plus ones
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.680]   a whole bunch of stuff, and they don't really care
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.880]   about that user, I mean, the problem
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:37.960]   is if that user comes in and plus ones a lot of ski stuff
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.160]   and the poor ski advertiser is showing advertising
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.360]   to somebody who lives in Dubai, yeah,
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.080]   they're going to get ripped off for that.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.040]   But there's other signals they can throw in to.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.240]   They can recognize this person only has one ski slope
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.520]   in Dubai inside.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:56.200]   And so I'm not sure that that kind of gambit.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.600]   It's clever and somebody does it,
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.000]   but I'm not sure it's going to get anywhere.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.560]   I'm a little disappointed.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.960]   I like Google Places a lot.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:08.640]   We have a Google Place page for Twitch.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.000]   Let me see if I can--
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.920]   By the way, this is the metrics page
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.400]   that you get of how many people visited your page.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.240]   Look at this spike here recently, I think,
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.840]   because of the brick house opening.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.920]   People wanting to find out where it was.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.160]   Where driving direction requests come from.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.760]   Top search queries that get your place pages.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.480]   This is great stuff.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:33.720]   I'm a big fan of the place page.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:37.240]   But thank you, Gina Trippani, by the way, for the review.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.680]   Leo is the best.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:46.560]   He used to have reviews from Yelp.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:49.680]   Yelp and city search and TripAdvisor.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.920]   Now it's just from Google.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:53.640]   Although I can see reviews from around the web
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.840]   and a link to Yelp, but they don't embed them anymore.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.360]   Was that the request?
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.120]   I'm sad because I like Google Places.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:01.640]   I do.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:06.720]   And what's great is when you search for Twitch on Google Maps
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:11.240]   and you find it, this is the entry that was created by me.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:14.880]   So I have times, directions, all of that stuff.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.760]   Any business owner can do this.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.080]   They had 85 reviews.
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.560]   Now they're just a handful of them.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:23.040]   Which really dilutes it.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:26.160]   And the story I put on the rundown
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.600]   said that it was those three services that wanted it off.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.120]   They complained.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.960]   Like to be media companies.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:31.800]   And TripAdvisor.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.360]   But it's stupid of them.
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.240]   Because now I don't go to Yelp.
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.640]   I know I'm not nearly as often.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.440]   I ended up at Yelp more often going through a place page.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:42.040]   I like Yelp, actually.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:42.840]   But you're right.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:45.160]   I think that's how I find it more.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:45.560]   You're right.
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.000]   Me too.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.600]   I mean, this feels like-- I was really surprised, actually,
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.320]   that they did this.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.320]   Because it would be like them saying, oh, OK,
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.320]   we're going to take our snippets out of our search results.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:56.000]   Right.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:56.960]   It's a search result.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:57.960]   It's really pressured from the web.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.960]   I mean, it's a search result, isn't it?
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.440]   So I was surprised that they pulled these.
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:03.240]   So I don't know.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.400]   I assume they're pulling these reviews from the API.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:09.280]   Well, you're right.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:12.240]   Gene, I guess if you're heading toward the cynical interpretation,
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.640]   it could be that they want people to put in their own reviews
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.040]   and not benefit Yelp and TripAdvisor.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.240]   But that's not a very googly way to think, I don't think.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.160]   Right.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.560]   That's true.
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:25.200]   And I mean, I would imagine there should
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:28.200]   be some sort of system like robots.txt, where applications
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.480]   like this could say, hey, Google, don't pull my content.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.400]   I mean, I suppose that there could have been.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.920]   And they all probably said, don't pull my content.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.600]   Stupid move on Yelp's part, because I often
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.760]   wind up at Yelp because of the place pages.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.480]   But I was surprised that Google, from what I understand,
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.040]   decided to just pull those snippets,
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.440]   to pull those reviews because they were complaints.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:49.160]   And they're getting tougher that way.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.920]   In Belgium, where we had this case go back around and around
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:56.920]   around with Google News, where the papers said, how dare you.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.440]   And they won a court case for a while.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.720]   And the government's judgment was you
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:04.960]   couldn't have snippets on Google News, but also on Google.com
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.960]   or Google.be.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.400]   So Google pulled the papers off.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.800]   Google entirely including search.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.880]   The papers screamed and said, oh, you're just punishing us.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.880]   But no, it said we can't be on Google.be.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.720]   So--
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.360]   Right.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:21.200]   --and the papers came back and said, well, no, no, no.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.080]   We really want to be there.
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:25.240]   And Google finally said, OK.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.000]   So I think Google's being tougher now and saying,
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.440]   you're going to miss us when we're gone.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.000]   So now I'd really love to see Yelp's no doubt Google Analytics
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.600]   report for after this--
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.360]   after the reviews got pulled.
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.880]   I wonder if they'll take a hit.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:38.480]   It's interesting.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.440]   Interesting story from CNET's Privacy Inc,
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:46.920]   Decla McCulloch writing saying, Google Street View
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.960]   collected locations of millions of laptops, cell phones,
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:53.280]   and other Wi-Fi devices.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.440]   They were, of course, the street view.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.240]   This is probably another bug, right?
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.400]   But boy, it's embarrassing.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.960]   They should have been transparent about this
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.320]   and confessed everything back when.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.640]   They should have.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.000]   These cars, the street view cars,
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   were trying to match GPS coordinates
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.520]   with Wi-Fi access points closed or not.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.720]   The idea being that they can create a sky hook-like service
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.440]   that says, based on Wi-Fi, visible Wi-Fi access points
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.000]   here where you are.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.360]   Sky hook does that commercially.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:24.960]   And they got in trouble initially with--
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:27.600]   was it Germany?
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.800]   Because apparently, in capturing these access points,
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.800]   captured snippets were kind of random snippets of data.
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:38.320]   But now, looks like maybe they work on--
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.040]   Cell phones is not a cool phone.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:43.920]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:44.760]   It's stupid.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.280]   There's so many things about this.
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.600]   They said that they did a thorough audit of the street view
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.280]   software, the bug, after the first problem.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.600]   So they didn't catch this, the MAC address.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.640]   And now, not only were they collecting the MAC address
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.160]   information, but they made it--
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.680]   they was publicly searchable, right?
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.960]   So not only collecting the data, but it was publicly searchable
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.840]   for quite some time.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.840]   In theory, that's upsetting.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.640]   I mean, in practice, there's not much.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:09.880]   I mean, I go to four square and check in where I am.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:11.960]   There are easier places to figure out where my cell phone is
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:11.960]   been.
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:13.520]   But still--
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:13.840]   yeah.
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.080]   And I mean, isn't the FTC babysitting Google
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.800]   for the next 20 years about what data they collect
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:19.560]   and how they publish it?
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:21.480]   I mean, this just doesn't--
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.040]   this is bad news bears.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.840]   I'm disappointed that this happened.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.640]   Well, and that Google hasn't sent anything.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.400]   They have declined to comment.
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:31.760]   Unlike the other street view, Buh-ha,
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:35.000]   where they stepped forward, this way they're holding back
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:35.920]   a little bit.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:36.520]   Yes.
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:36.680]   Right.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:39.320]   And they have seen that reporters asking people,
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.800]   or they were, asking people to input their MAC address
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:46.360]   to see what information it had tracked on them when the story
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.840]   first came out when they were trying to figure out what
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.720]   was going on.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.520]   But that they pulled that you can't publicly search.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.120]   You can't search for MAC addresses anymore.
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:53.040]   That solves that problem.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:56.200]   And I think it's probably a side effect of their technology
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:57.640]   that they gathered MAC addresses.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.200]   I don't think that that--
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.720]   it's not useful to them in any way.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.680]   I mean, there's no--
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.840]   you can't think of any surreptitious reason
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.120]   they would want that information.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:06.640]   Right.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:09.320]   It's not-- mobile MAC addresses are not useful to them, right?
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.960]   They're just trying to figure out where the Wi-Fi points are.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.480]   If they got it, they got it by accident.
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:14.980]   Right.
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:15.800]   Yes.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:16.320]   So it's just--
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.800]   But still the way it got handled.
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:18.280]   Yeah, not what.
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:22.120]   Given the Buzz problem and the original Street View
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:26.360]   problem, it seemed odd that they were so reticent about it.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:29.520]   This-- the idea came out from Google that nobody cares about,
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:31.800]   but I keep coming back to is that Google, I think,
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.680]   needs independent bodies.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.600]   And imagine if you had a committee chaired
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:39.920]   by Junior Kibani, which was a bad thing.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:44.240]   And of developers who dealt with developer issues
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.000]   or who dealt with these kinds of issues,
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.240]   people would trust you.
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:49.560]   Now, you may not want that job.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:52.880]   But at some point, a jury appears on these kinds of things
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.600]   could allow an audit of this stuff.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.800]   It's the same thing Murdoch's going through right now,
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:00.120]   where the cover-up always gets you.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.200]   And if Google had come out and said it, you're
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:05.000]   writing it at the time and just said it all,
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.600]   and had someone come in and say, OK, here's everything we found.
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.280]   It was stupid.
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:09.760]   And here's the fullest stupidity.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:10.800]   We wouldn't go through this again.
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:11.300]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:11.480]   Right.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.320]   And they did that really well the first time.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:13.800]   Really?
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.160]   So it was surprising.
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:16.760]   So I don't know.
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:19.040]   Maybe they needed time to figure out exactly what happened.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.080]   Maybe they were super extra embarrassed because they had
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:22.680]   released the data was publicly searchable.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:25.320]   Maybe the FTC pressure is getting to them.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:26.320]   I don't know.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:28.040]   It's hard to say.
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.160]   You like Gmail's new look?
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.440]   I haven't been able to see it.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:32.520]   But you haven't.
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:33.360]   Well, maybe I have.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:33.800]   I can do it.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.680]   I have the new theme.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.320]   Oh, OK.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:39.400]   So that's the new theme, right?
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.160]   That's the new theme.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.840]   And you can pick the lighter, the heavy.
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:42.280]   And--
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.800]   Oh, we talked about this before.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:44.640]   I'm not sure why this is--
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.160]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:45.600]   Yeah, we did.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:46.080]   It's nice.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:47.000]   It's nice.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.680]   I think they just did a post about fees or feedback.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:50.680]   Oh, and what do the users say?
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:51.680]   Yeah, that was nice.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:52.160]   It's nice.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.000]   It's pretty.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:53.880]   A little too--
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:57.000]   not enough information, I think they said, right?
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.240]   Well, they got--
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:02.360]   some people saying too little information, too much
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.880]   information, which--
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:04.480]   Always that.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.160]   Always, right.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.640]   Never ask a police group.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.440]   Where's your clock, Leo?
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:09.480]   I want to talk about this.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:10.360]   Where's your clock?
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:12.280]   Two little information.
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.560]   You don't want to know.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:14.920]   You don't want to go at all--
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:16.800]   they were going all OCD on you, man.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:17.320]   They were.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.000]   And you want to know how late it is tonight.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.760]   Always on a clock behind you, Leo.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.760]   I'm going to get in the new studio--
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:26.000]   my little studio, the clock, will be there.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.400]   It's not going to be everywhere.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:28.960]   Maybe we should put a little clock everywhere.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.600]   I don't know.
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.320]   I don't know.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:31.800]   What it was--
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.960]   some of that was so funny is you changed--
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:35.080]   could you have imagined--
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.000]   No.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.720]   Because that caused quite a stake this afternoon.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.360]   Well, the funny thing is--
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:41.080]   Your audience was going nuts for the clock.
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.120]   I bought the clock.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:44.760]   We were calling it and I were a cosco.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:45.800]   I just threw it in the car.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.480]   You say, oh, that's kind of neat.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:48.520]   That'd be fun to have behind me.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.680]   But a little did I know this would become
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:52.920]   the most important thing on Twitch.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:56.400]   It was a big anchoring focal point of the shot in the cottage.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.400]   It was only you looked at it and you were like,
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:58:59.440]   we're supposed to be on now.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:00.960]   We're getting to the end now.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.440]   I think that's why people want it.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:03.240]   So I'll put it back.
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:04.080]   We'll figure out something.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.480]   We'll have a clock somewhere.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.520]   I don't know what else.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.640]   Sorry, I didn't mean to go off on that.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:11.120]   But I think it's the same thing with Gmail or any of your services.
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:11.600]   Is that--
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.800]   It's the clock, please.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.960]   You can't please everyone.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:14.960]   You can't please everyone.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:15.680]   I like this.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:22.080]   You can now do three-way calling on Google Talk and Gmail.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.480]   Is it three-way or do you--
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:25.680]   I think you can see the call.
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:26.680]   Oh, it's two lines.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.000]   First call on a whole all right two lines.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.680]   Oh, you can't merge them though.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:34.000]   Not yet, but that doesn't seem too far away.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:34.840]   I've got a question.
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:39.320]   I've got a really, really Fred Flintstone question for you both.
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:44.120]   No, you can't use your bare feet to power your car.
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.120]   Yeah, but that's--
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.760]   That's not a cup holder.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.680]   It's a DVD drive.
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:51.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.120]   Just kidding, Jack.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:56.640]   I am trying to tell the world that I don't have and refuse
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.280]   to have a fax machine.
[00:59:58.280 --> 00:59:59.760]   Oh, God, forget that.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.720]   What do you guys-- what do you do for this--
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:05.320]   I tell people I do not have a fax machine.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.720]   I will scan and email you the PDF.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.080]   And I just got a scan snap.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:09.960]   And that's good enough.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.480]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.560]   And they have to take you to leave.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.600]   Yeah, I mean, I basically say, hey, I work out of a home office.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.480]   I don't have a landline.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.600]   I don't have a fax machine.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.600]   Sorry.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:21.120]   And most people are OK with it at this point.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.680]   I mean, contracts and things like that, things
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:23.480]   that you have to sign.
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.000]   That's the problem.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.320]   Something still needs fax machines.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.880]   I pay for a fax service, like $15 a month for eFax.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:32.640]   And it's the same.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.440]   That's just that it goes to a fax machine.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.400]   Yeah, if they send me a fax, I have a number,
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.040]   but it comes in as an email.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.800]   And then if they want a fax, I can send it to them via the internet.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.240]   And then somewhere somebody has a fax machine.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.280]   And sends it to them.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:47.200]   It's probably a good way to make a little living.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.200]   If you don't have to ask me, there's a thing.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.480]   It's the whole network ideas.
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.160]   We all-- you know, it's the great example of networks.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.520]   One fax machine worth nothing.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.120]   Networks worth twice as much when you have two,
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.560]   and so on and so on and so on.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.720]   What's the diminishing value of the actual network?
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:00:58.720]   Right.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.760]   Where does it die?
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.280]   Where is it no longer worth the effort?
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:06.640]   Let's see.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.800]   Minnetel is leaving France Telecom.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.840]   This was kind of the precursor to the internet.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.880]   Everybody in France got a little Minnetel terminal.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.160]   Started about 30 years ago, and that
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.080]   was to save money on phone books.
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:24.080]   It was a text-only service with very simple graphics.
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.320]   It looked like Minnetel-- we had similar things
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.960]   in the earliest days of the internet back
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:33.160]   in the genie comp you served days.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.680]   They made 30 million euros in revenue
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:39.240]   last year on this thing France Telecom did.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.680]   But they're still going to kill it.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:46.000]   The Minnetel, like the fax machine, will die next year.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   So it's free similar.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   Bye-bye Minnetel.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   Au revoir.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   Au revoir.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.440]   Minnetel, we hardly knew you.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.560]   Now, nobody picked this up.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.200]   I want one.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.120]   You know what?
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.120]   Hey, hey, French users.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.200]   I think there's a lot of money to tell.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.680]   I'd like a Minnetel somewhere.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.160]   Let's have a Minnetel on the set.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:08.360]   I want one at my school in my Museum of Dead Technology.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.320]   That's a great idea.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.520]   We got a whole Minnetel.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.400]   Send us a couple.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:11.920]   Please.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.760]   But this is a guy setting up Ham Radio in Tenno on his--
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.320]   Yeah, I got--
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:15.920]   --on his roof.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:16.280]   So--
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.680]   35-foot mast of my roof going up there.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.080]   So I can--
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.000]   What's radio?
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.280]   This is so funny.
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:22.640]   This is--
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.320]   I had to Wikipedia it, OK?
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.000]   I did.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.840]   This is so I can use a Ham Radio to--
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:31.560]   I could talk to people all over the world.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.560]   I can talk to somebody in Australia.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.000]   You really had to Wikipedia this?
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.320]   I mean, I thought to myself, oh, is that like the thing
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.800]   like my dad had in the car when I was five
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.160]   to talk to other people on the road.
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:42.920]   That's a CV.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.680]   So I had that moment.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:46.400]   And then I looked at him on the internet.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.320]   And I was like, what's the range on this thing?
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.080]   Like, oh, you know.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.080]   He's like, why is Leo even interested in this?
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.560]   He talks to the biggest network in the whole world.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:53.680]   But I find it--
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.320]   I could do more with his cell phone
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:59.360]   than I do with my $500 Ham Radio.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.680]   It's endearing the retro, Leo.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.440]   That's why I do it.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.920]   Is it still a Heathkit?
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.600]   No, the Heathkit's not a rat anymore.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.640]   I actually-- you can buy the kits, though.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.920]   You can, for your amps and everything.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.760]   I should do that.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.480]   That's what a real ham would do, is solder this whole thing
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.400]   together.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.520]   If I were a real ham.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.520]   Cake.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.800]   Cake.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.360]   Dear Abby, I reluctantly signed on to Facebook
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.440]   at the urge of my siblings.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.920]   The problem is I'm now receiving many replies
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.240]   from people I knew back in college and elsewhere,
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.600]   saying how glad they are that they've found me,
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.280]   how much they've missed me, and that they would like to catch up.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:37.600]   It made me remember that I was very well-liked then.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.960]   And how, when I graduated from college with honors,
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.280]   people said I had a bright future.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.400]   But now, I am nowhere near what I used to be
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.760]   when these people knew me.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.000]   My life has not been very productive or happy
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   since I moved to California.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.120]   I married to a wonderful man.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.400]   We have no children.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.360]   And I have had only sporadic employment
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:59.120]   over the past few years because of treatment for depression
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.640]   and alcoholism.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.080]   Most of those who've written to tell me
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.920]   about their children, grandchildren, and career
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.400]   progress they have made in their lives,
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.520]   I can't tell them any of that.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.720]   Just tell me what I should say to these people on Facebook.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.520]   Unsure, out west.
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.040]   Deared unsure.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.200]   Sad.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.200]   Sad.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.040]   It's really sad.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.120]   And Facebook puts her in this.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.200]   Well, I don't know.
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.880]   These are just two Dear Abbey columns from the Kansas City
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:30.160]   Star.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.240]   Where did you get these, Eileen?
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.000]   These are great.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   These are-- these are your--
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:34.480]   I don't remember.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.680]   I think Jeff did.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.160]   Jeff, these are the idea.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:37.640]   I did.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.400]   Jeff's soft spot in his heart.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.080]   Oh, I know I brought the showdown.
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.000]   Focus on the--
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:43.960]   No, it's sad.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.360]   It really does kind of bring up that conversation.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.520]   As a person, are you a brand?
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.320]   And this sort of jealousy.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.640]   And the internet gives us access to so many people's lives.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.240]   Do you think about people going through divorces
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.160]   or people who can't have kids or people who
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.040]   can't find a job or unemployed that hear about their friends,
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.480]   getting promotions, and having their third little bundle
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.960]   of joy and getting married?
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:03.880]   It's hard.
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:04.880]   It's difficult.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.000]   So Abby, she feels this need to have a brand.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.040]   Abby says, focus on the positive.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.440]   Don't mention that you have been out of work
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.840]   because of alcoholism.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.280]   Say, I haven't had to work over the past few years.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:18.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:19.280]   Sorry.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.280]   I shouldn't laugh.
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.880]   I can't love Abby.
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:22.640]   Oh, Abby.
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.480]   Abby, focus on the positive.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.240]   It's somebody different now, right?
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.920]   It's not really Abigail Vampurant.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.160]   Oh, yeah, no, no, no.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:29.520]   Abby's gone.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.360]   Yeah.
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.240]   You could be like, oh, I'm just relaxing on my porch,
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:35.240]   drinking margaritas, another regular Tuesday.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.200]   I don't work today, just I'm enjoying one of the afternoon,
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.040]   but I'm married.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:40.880]   10 AM.
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:41.400]   Hey.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:44.120]   I'm married to a wonderful man with no rug rats.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:47.080]   We have a wild sex life, and I'm drunk.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.480]   The internet is as hard to give up
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.440]   as cigarettes and liquor, speaking of which, losing
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:57.440]   net access for even a day described as nightmare,
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.800]   according to the computer world.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.600]   It's actually a survey of 1,000 Brits
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.560]   between the ages of 18 and 65.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.800]   Some said giving up internet access even for a day
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:10.040]   was just as hard as quitting smoking or drinking.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.120]   One person surveyed said giving up the internet
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:15.800]   was like having my hand chopped off.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.560]   How were you and with Grollg?
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.680]   Oh, it was really much harder than I expected.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.360]   And it was like Diet Coke and internet
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.960]   were the two things that I was most ashamed.
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.080]   It was tough.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:25.560]   It was tough.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.120]   I couldn't get my SIM card set up with a data connection.
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:29.720]   And so I was in it.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.920]   And I was on a bus and on a tour and going to real world
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.280]   places all day long.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.120]   You really?
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.600]   And then after accessing my sites,
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.800]   where it was just hard.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:39.720]   You realize what I had it is to pull this phone out
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.320]   and start doing stuff whenever there's downtime
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.120]   or checking in or whatever.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.720]   And you want-- man, think of all the points
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:49.600]   you could have had on 4 Square here.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.040]   If you had checked in in in in in in in in in a show.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.800]   I wanted to check in at the Great Wall so bad.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:58.000]   I was the mayor of Machu Picchu for six months.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   Nice.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.040]   And somebody talked just recently.
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.360]   I'm the mayor of a resort in Beijing right now.
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:05.600]   There you go.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.040]   Yeah, but because they had Wi-Fi there.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.040]   But yeah, no, it was tough.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:09.760]   It was humbling.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.680]   And it was tough about it.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:15.120]   I went back and forth from feeling sad and humbled
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.480]   and self-righteous and full of entitlement and rage about it.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.880]   So I was like, I was like, Jeff and Leo.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.640]   I was like, going back and forth.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.480]   Which one is sad and humbled and which one is enraged?
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:32.080]   Well, I'm exaggerating.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:32.840]   But you loved it.
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.400]   You had a great time, didn't you?
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.360]   I had a great time.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.840]   And the real world has many wonderful things to offer.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.240]   I just I wanted to share.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.400]   And hey, I needed to post pictures of my dinner on Google
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.200]   Plus so people could tell me what I was eating.
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.400]   I mean, jeez.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.960]   Well, I got eight picks feet after the fact.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.120]   I bought 200--
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.200]   I was shocked that you had not tweeted.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.480]   I was shocked.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.880]   We saw so few pictures.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.720]   And I actually was mad at you.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.880]   I thought, she's holding back.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.840]   I bought the-- whatever it was, the 500 megabyte plan
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.240]   on my iPhone when I went to China.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:05.560]   And I did an audio boo recordings from the Great Wall.
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:06.440]   I was tweeting.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:07.760]   I was sending pictures.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:10.400]   I went out crazy hog wild.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.120]   And it was dumb.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.000]   Well, you know, I decided to take the Chromebook with me
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.400]   thinking that that would be a good idea.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.320]   And it was a bad idea.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:17.320]   Because you're never on, right?
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.200]   Well, because first is Wi-Fi only.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.600]   So only one of my hotels had Wi-Fi in the room.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.960]   All of them had ethernet ports in the room.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.640]   But then Wi-Fi and the lobby.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.320]   And I was using SSH Socks proxy.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:28.520]   And that didn't work as well.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.840]   A friend of mine had a VPN.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.120]   But I wouldn't have been able to install the VPN software
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.280]   on the Chromebook.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.160]   So yeah, it was just-- that was a bad decision.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.400]   I should have brought a full-on computer with a VPN ready
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.240]   and ethernet port and the whole thing.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:42.320]   But yeah, it was hard.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:44.240]   I actually wanted uploading photos to Flickr.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.560]   And then tweeting from Flickr, which did work.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.400]   Right.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:51.360]   I actually sent out a Posturist account.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.800]   Because they didn't block Posturists.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.320]   And I was able to send all this stuff out.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.320]   Like email, right?
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:56.800]   Right.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.200]   Smart.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.120]   They can't block email.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:08:59.720]   Right.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.800]   Right.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.560]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:06.920]   Gina's tip, my tool, Jeff's number.
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.920]   But first, I just want to-- a little thank you.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.120]   We are building a new studio.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.720]   And one of the things-- first of all,
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.520]   I'd like to thank all the people who have bought bricks.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:17.640]   We are closing in on 1,600 bricks sold.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:19.960]   My goal was 1,000.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.320]   My dream goal was 2,000.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:24.600]   I think we're going to hit 2,000.
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.200]   Still time bricks.twit.tv.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:29.240]   The brick wall will be back here behind the gear.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:33.720]   Then our first shipment of bricks comes in on the first of August.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:36.160]   So we'll start putting those up and have them up in time
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.440]   for the official opening of the Twit Brick House, which
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.960]   is the 21st of August.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:45.280]   I'd also do some-- can you do the explosion wipe?
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.120]   Do the explosion wipe.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.640]   I'd like to blow something up right now.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.640]   I'd like to blow something up right now.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.640]   Here we go.
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:54.640]   Ah!
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:55.640]   Nice.
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.920]   Now could we have done that with the old TriCaster?
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.360]   I say no.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.760]   I want to thank the folks at New Tech
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:05.200]   who have provided our TriCaster 850 Extreme System.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.960]   This is the system that lets us pick up video like this,
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.680]   that lets us do transitions, lower thirds.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:13.600]   It is the system that's giving us high def.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.280]   Here's another one.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.280]   Could you do that?
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:17.780]   High.
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.760]   Could you do that at home?
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.760]   I don't think so.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.840]   It's actually amazing.
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:25.320]   We're building basically a very sophisticated broadcast
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:29.600]   studio off the shelf consumer stuff.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.040]   And the TriCaster is the heart of the whole thing.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.640]   We use the TriCaster when we go on the road.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.640]   We use our TriCaster studio for broadcasts on the road.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.880]   We use the TriCaster.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:42.600]   We have the 850 here, which is incredible.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.840]   The top of the line TriCaster.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:47.440]   If you want to know more about the TriCaster, first of all,
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.280]   thanks to New Tech for providing it,
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.280]   go to newtech.com/triCaster.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:55.560]   A lot of churches, sporting events, broadcasters like me,
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.320]   use TriCaster.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:56.960]   It's amazing.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.360]   A 24 channel system with everything
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.200]   you need to make a TV show, including virtual sets.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.040]   It's like having your own TV truck.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.400]   And look at this.
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:05.920]   I love it.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.080]   Nyleen is sitting here, and she's doing it all.
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.280]   She's doing all the switching, all the lower thirds, everything.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.560]   Here's another one.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.560]   Wow.
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.560]   I like it.
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:15.080]   I lean rocking it.
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:15.680]   She's rocking it.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:16.240]   I'm learning.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.400]   I'm learning.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:21.120]   So Leo, are you missing the fact that you're not controlling
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.200]   everything right now?
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.480]   It's taking me a little getting used to, yeah.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:24.840]   In the--
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:25.520]   Of that.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.320]   But it's actually great that Eileen's doing it,
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.520]   because she's producer of the show.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.200]   She knows the show better than I do.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.040]   I just think-- and I like having other people do it.
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.280]   But I do-- yeah, there she is.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.200]   Hey, there she is.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.000]   So when you go into your office set,
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.360]   are you going to--
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.240]   I have some--
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.400]   No, I will have some switching capabilities.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.400]   Actually, I guess I'd be able to do all the same things.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.640]   The TriCaster allows me to do it remotely into the office.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.680]   So yeah, I'll have the office capability.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.400]   So it'll only be for the few shows that I do myself
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.680]   in my old office.
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.200]   But the shows we do out here, like this week in Google,
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.160]   we will show--
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.920]   So we'll do this-- we're not moving to your office.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.440]   No, this is where we're going to do this.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.800]   I think this is there.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.120]   But you get your choice, by the way.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:10.320]   You get comfy of colors on the back wall.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.440]   We should do a different color on the back wall.
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.880]   What choice, what color would you like on the back wall?
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.920]   Something Googly.
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:21.080]   Hey, is Brett still here?
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.240]   Can we change the colors on the back wall?
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:25.640]   No, do you know how to do that, Berk?
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.240]   Does anybody know how to do that?
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:29.120]   There's a button.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.080]   We're learning tons.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.760]   I spent $1.2 million.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.000]   I want green.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.880]   No, we can have any color you want.
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:38.040]   And the curtains change, too.
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:38.840]   Alex knows how to do it.
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:41.040]   Here comes Alex.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:44.040]   What's neat is with the TriCaster in this studio,
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.280]   there are more people on this side, normally on this side
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:49.440]   of the camera than there are on that side of the camera.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.760]   And that's the exact opposite of the way
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.440]   normal television production works,
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.000]   where you have a host or two or three,
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.680]   and you have 20 or 30 people who are running cameras, running
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.480]   the chyron, the technical director, the director, the tape.
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:03.920]   All of that stuff is done by one person
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:06.160]   in the master control position over there.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.040]   So Eileen's able to do everything like that,
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:09.760]   which is plain and amazing.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.120]   Except for change the color behind you.
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.720]   Well, we're figuring it out.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:13.680]   Does Alex-- no.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.520]   We just don't know that.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.480]   We haven't all been trained.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.320]   Eileen, we're so happy we don't have any echo.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.200]   We're delighted.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:19.880]   Yes.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:21.000]   Thanks to video, by the way.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.600]   Video is giving us this great, credible high-def video
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:25.400]   from our hosts.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.480]   We're still tweaking it.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.400]   And it's been a little bit of a challenge today
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.680]   because we had some technical issues on our side.
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:34.280]   But I think we're going to have much.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.680]   I mean, I love having a high-def picture of you guys
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.360]   on the round table.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.200]   I think that's really neat.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.840]   And it's a great experience on our end, too.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:41.320]   Is it better?
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.080]   Thanks, video.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:42.640]   Is it?
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.600]   It is.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.200]   So it's easier for you.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.640]   Yeah, it is because I can see Jeff at all times.
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.240]   I just didn't--
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:50.280]   I didn't even know Gina had freckles until these days.
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.840]   Oh, many, many freckles.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.720]   No, it's so cute.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.480]   I never skyped, never showed your freckles.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.440]   It's really cute.
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:59.040]   I'm hoping they're all going to merge at one point.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.480]   I'll look like I'm tan.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.640]   That's like a broken plug.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.080]   All right, Gina, it is time.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.800]   Your tip of the week.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:10.360]   My tip of the week is first quick shameless plug.
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.360]   You should buy this book.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.680]   Yeah, it came out.
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:15.240]   It came out a couple weeks ago.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.640]   New Life Hacker book, Adam Pash at Life Hacker,
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.840]   did a great job of the revisions.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.000]   It's the third edition.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:20.680]   It's really great.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:21.320]   You should buy it.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.320]   Not only because it's a great book,
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.680]   because when you buy it, then I get some money.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:24.760]   And that makes me really happy.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.280]   So thank you.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.560]   Yeah, help, Patien.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:26.960]   That's my first--
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.160]   I have the first book.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.040]   And the second book, I will buy the third book.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:31.840]   Awesome.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:32.180]   Awesome.
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:32.920]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.600]   Although, I think I have a copy coming your way.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:35.960]   Oh, well, I'll buy it anyway.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:36.720]   But--
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:37.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:37.720]   I have it.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:38.920]   I'm on my own shelf.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.080]   In fact, that's when I first--
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.960]   I met you.
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.800]   Or if I didn't meet you, I wanted to meet you.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.320]   It was when the first book came out.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.000]   When the book came out?
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:47.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:47.720]   Awesome.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:48.600]   I booked it.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:49.640]   I made a lot of favors.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.400]   All right.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:54.120]   But my official tip of the week is, this is pretty cool.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.440]   It's going to be really useful.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:59.360]   Gmail now supports zip and raw files, attachments,
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.760]   and its viewer, which means that if Jeff sends me
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:05.040]   a zip file full of juicy Word documents, and images,
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.000]   and all that kind of stuff, in Gmail,
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   I can click on it.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.520]   I click a click on a View link.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.480]   And it will show me a list of all the files inside the archive,
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:15.880]   and let me download ones selectively, which
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:18.040]   is super, super, super useful.
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.520]   You know, the Google Docs viewer, it
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.000]   uses the Google Docs viewer, supports
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.880]   a bunch of file types already, Doc, and Excel, and PowerPoint,
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.960]   and PSD.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.280]   So the zip and raw files just got out of this week.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.440]   That's really great.
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:32.800]   I'm really happy about that.
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.800]   15 different file types.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.080]   Used to be on Windows.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:39.160]   You'd have to download and unzip or all that stuff.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:42.200]   And then you didn't have a program associated with it.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:42.920]   That's great.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:43.840]   So annoying.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.080]   So much better.
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.880]   So email your zip files.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.840]   Jeff Jarvis, your tip of the week.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.480]   I pulled this one out of--
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.320]   Your number of weeks.
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.040]   --numbers think magazine number of weeks.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:57.680]   And it's not necessarily that current,
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:58.840]   but I found it interesting.
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:01.640]   There are three times as many smartphones activated
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:06.160]   every minute in this country as there are children boys.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:08.600]   That is a crazy step.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:12.400]   So Dr. Kiki has three phones and one key.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.400]   What?
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.440]   That makes sense, though.
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:18.120]   In fact, my children alone have consumed three or four
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.920]   iPhones in the last three months.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:24.960]   So and I lean at least six or seven.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.120]   Abby has a fender bender like the other day.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.400]   She runs a little minor accident.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:30.480]   He runs into a car in front of her.
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.080]   You know how that happens.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.160]   Not paid attention.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.520]   Minor thing.
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.760]   But you can't find her phone.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.520]   It's nowhere in the car.
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:41.040]   And the police officers say, oh, yeah, this happens all the time.
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.720]   It flew out the window.
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:46.840]   So apparently, she had the windows rolled down.
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:48.800]   The phone was on the center thing,
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.080]   plugged into the charger.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.120]   Flew out the window.
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.000]   Gone.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.040]   I just bought it for a month ago.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.920]   Needless to say, she now works for me.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:01.480]   All right, time for my tool of the week.
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:04.520]   I like this one a lot, although it has one side effect.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.160]   You may not like a lot.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.040]   This is the ability to add--
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:15.040]   if you're using Chrome to add to any text field in Chrome,
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.160]   the ability-- you just turn off the lights.
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.800]   I think they're working on the color.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.680]   The ability to add speech input.
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.040]   This is a user scripts.org speakable text.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.680]   The guy who wrote this, it's kind of funny,
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:29.640]   says, don't look at the JavaScript.
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:32.520]   It's super quick and dirty because I broke my arm.
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:35.040]   And so I could only type with one hand.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.760]   But you know what?
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:37.360]   It works.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:37.960]   So now watch.
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:41.240]   I'm going to go-- let's go to Google+, what do you say?
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.200]   And let's see if this works.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.600]   We're going to try it right now.
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:49.000]   So when I create somewhere to type on Google+,
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.920]   look, I get a little microphone.
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:55.680]   I am now dictating my next Google+, oh, wait a minute.
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.640]   It won't work because the mic isn't connected over.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.760]   I have to change the mic setting.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.120]   But it works.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.640]   And it's using the Google API.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:06.920]   So it's using the Google dictation, which I think is pretty
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:07.960]   good.
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:11.640]   You can now dictate anywhere there's a text field and Chrome.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.680]   You can dictate the content.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:17.080]   Now the negative is it does because it's
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:22.080]   coming from an insecure server, not a HTTPS server.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:25.320]   If you're on an HTTPS site like Google+,
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:30.000]   it breaks the HTTPS because now the page has mixed content on it.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.040]   You're still secure on Google+, and all that.
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.320]   So I wouldn't worry about it.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.800]   But you might notice that if you install this script,
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.400]   now all the HTTPS pages have this line through it.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.360]   This is how Chrome tells you, now there's
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.960]   mixed content on here.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:45.320]   In this case, the mixed content is the JavaScript coming
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.920]   from the guy's server that is putting this microphone
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.240]   in the text field.
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:51.360]   It's fun to play with anyway.
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:51.680]   So--
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.840]   And then the source code isn't so bad.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.480]   Have you looked at it?
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:55.160]   Are you looking at it?
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:56.600]   I'm looking at it now.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.960]   Short variable names.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.120]   But I'll give him a pass since he had a--
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:03.440]   Well, you're not going to type a long variable name.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.600]   That's kind of a clever idea.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.600]   It's just using the right thing.
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.640]   Yeah, really clever.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.640]   Nice geekery.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:09.160]   It's script.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.360]   Nice geekery.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:10.840]   All right.
[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:13.600]   Hey, thank you for everybody who tuned in late,
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.960]   and thank you, especially to Gina and Jeff, who
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.320]   rescheduled their lives, because we did this show.
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:21.480]   And thank you to the crew who worked their butts off
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:22.160]   to figure these--
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:22.680]   They did.
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:24.360]   --in transiting problems out, and they did.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:25.280]   Yeah, thanks for crew.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.200]   Can't hear from video.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:29.960]   He flew down from Alaska so that he could work on this
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.160]   and got it all fixed for us that we could be able to talk to.
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:32.360]   Wow.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:35.080]   Get this great video from Gina and Jeff.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.360]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.240]   That's where his profane blog posts live.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.720]   He's on Twitter at Jeff Jarvis.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:44.880]   Hey, you got a property?
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.600]   His new book comes out in just a little--
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.320]   I have to.
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.080]   --if you lay on the board.
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:54.640]   His new book comes out in just a little while on--
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.560]   what's the publisher?
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.360]   Is it Simon Schuster?
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.440]   Simon Schuster.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.040]   Public parts is the name of it.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:02.320]   I'm going in next week to record the audiobook.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:02.800]   Oh, you are?
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:03.360]   Oh, good.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.600]   You're reading the audiobook.
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:05.600]   It's so exciting.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.440]   It's fantastic.
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.080]   Oh, that's great.
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:11.520]   Well, Mr. Jarvis, can you try that again a little slower?
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.080]   When you say F you, could you--
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:16.320]   a little bit less on the siblings.
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:19.760]   Less siblings on the F you, please, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.040]   I think Boba Bowie is--
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.840]   Mickey Sittle and my hands.
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.520]   I can't just stickulate.
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.680]   Because you've done this before.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.200]   Oh.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.080]   You've done this before?
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.400]   Once, yeah.
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.800]   They won't let you just stickulate.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.760]   Oh, not talking late.
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:33.760]   Without hands, that's no good.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:33.880]   No.
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:34.360]   No good.
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.360]   I'm always like this below the camera line.
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.360]   You're Italian.
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.360]   Always.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:39.840]   It's the way it is.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.800]   Gina Trapani is at smartawared.org.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:43.520]   That's her website.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:46.960]   She's Gina Trapani on Google+ and on Twitter.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:50.240]   And her book, her lovely book, her life hacker book
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:53.720]   is out now and stores everywhere you must buy it.
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:56.360]   Now, is it all new stuff?
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.080]   It's a revision.
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.280]   It's a third edition.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.160]   So it's lots of new stuff.
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:02.280]   Updated for 2011.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.720]   And if you don't have the original, you need it.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:05.560]   You got to have it.
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:06.040]   Yes.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.400]   No matter what, I have all three.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:08.840]   Like I said, and I'm a big fan.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:09.640]   I love life actors.
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:11.160]   Quite a few actually new chapters.
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:11.880]   It got really thick.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:13.280]   It's like 450 pages.
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.200]   It's crazy.
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:14.680]   Oh, that's great.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:15.480]   Which is big for me.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:15.800]   I don't know.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.920]   Jeff, you've probably gone that big before.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:19.600]   No.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:20.360]   God, no.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:20.800]   No.
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:21.360]   No.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:21.960]   You're a bit too much.
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.760]   They want them to be thick for some reason.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:24.680]   I think it has to do with shelves.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:25.120]   They do.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.080]   They do.
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:26.560]   Give it that back.
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.040]   Yeah, yours Leo.
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.360]   I always did thick place.
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:31.400]   That's all about shelf space.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.680]   So it shows up.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:34.480]   It's great to be back.
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.600]   And congratulations on the new studio, Leo.
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:40.200]   I know that these transitions are always a little rough at first.
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.440]   But it's amazing.
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:42.200]   It's beautiful.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:45.120]   Well, I have a new way that I'm going to close all the shows.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.600]   I'm going to say, that's it.
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:49.360]   Thanks for joining us on This Week in Google.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:55.440]   The Dr. Evil Turn.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.200]   Should I've done a close-up on you?
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:58.920]   No, it's OK.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:00.520]   I think I knocked my microphone.
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:01.320]   Not cool.
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:02.200]   Not cool at all.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.240]   Thanks for joining us, everybody.
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.680]   We'll see you next week on Twig.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:21.360]   It also starts like Charlie's Angels.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:22.320]   I can.
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.400]   Hello, angels.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.320]   Yeah, you could do that.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.040]   Yeah, right.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:29.400]   We never see Leo.
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:31.000]   Should I like you?
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:31.520]   Oh, wait.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:32.320]   You got to see Gina.
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:33.320]   You got to see Gina.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.600]   Am I one of the angels?
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.680]   I got the sunlight coming in from--
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:42.640]   I was in such twig withdrawal.
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.360]   I'm so glad that we got to do the show today.
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.480]   So this is fantastic.
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:47.120]   Oh, yes, we miss you so much, Gina.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.160]   You miss you a lot.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:50.040]   It was great, great to be back.
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.920]   And I'm so glad you had Ed on in the last couple of shows.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:56.200]   Yeah, we've had great people, but it's not the same thing.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:57.880]   Maybe this could be our closing thing.
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:59.240]   Why don't you pull down the lower third,
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.760]   and I'll do a little intro.
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:02.560]   And as we go out, I just want to show you a little--
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:06.200]   this is another one from a Google Chrome experiment
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.320]   that they did.
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:09.000]   In this case with the group OKGo,
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.320]   they always do such cool videos.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.680]   And the dance group, Palabolas, I'm a big fan of them.
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:17.000]   It's all is not lost.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.040]   If you go to all is not low.st.
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:24.040]   So it's all is not lost, but the dot st.
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:24.400]   Get it?
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.040]   The dot between the all is not lost.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.040]   Just Google it.
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:30.040]   And let me play the video for you, because at the end,
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.200]   there's a surprise message.

[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:23.920]   They could be right across the highway.

[01:24:55.260 --> 01:25:00.260]   And what they say is that all it's lost, all it's not lost.
