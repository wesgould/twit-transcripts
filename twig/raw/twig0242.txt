[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.480]   gonna start way on my left with Mr. Kevin perdy who wants everyone to know he does not normally
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.160]   come his hair like that. Hello I'm going to a girl development party later and the theme is nerds.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.880]   That doesn't help. Yeah I know. Completeandroid guide dot com ladies and gentlemen or the perdman.com
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:17.040]   or the perdman dot com. That's my name. He's the perdman of Alcatraz. Yes. Nice to have you Kevin
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.400]   Gina Trapani still in her mom's basement. It's really not going well. She's being held prisoner
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:30.320]   with someone please call the authority. This is the last show in the basement. If I if I have to be
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.640]   in my home with holes in the walls that's what's gonna what's what's gonna be next week I will be
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.800]   either in my home or in my office. I'm not sure but I won't be in the mom's basement. I didn't need
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.360]   to discourage this. I would blow of the no no you want to discourage. I love this. I love it.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.680]   I know you guys love it. You'll be I promise you're gonna be in your house next week. It's not
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.200]   like the contractor is gonna put the hammer through the wall and to the next apartment or
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.160]   anything like that. It's gonna all be done soon. It'll be fine. You know we both Kevin and Gina
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.800]   are doing home remodels right now. And I also have I was getting some stuff put in. What is it about
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.680]   contractors? They get it half done and they leave and they don't come back. Half life. And you're like
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:19.600]   they left the drop cloths everywhere. Like some developers I know too. It has a little bit like
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.960]   the ouch burn that's Jeff Jarvis in his beautiful library. Looks good. What's different there's
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.640]   some next time. Next time I want to do the show from the road. I quite like that. That was fun.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:42.240]   Yeah. We watched Jeff pull up via Skype. I can't be safe news in action. Well it's I have this
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.160]   nice little I have this great little thing that you know on the dashboard and the phone's right
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.880]   there and I can just drive and talk. Yeah. I think it's fun. Awesome. We loved it. And we and we got a
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.360]   good look to it. Your beautiful estate. Your country estate. Snowpile. Yeah. Hard to believe.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.360]   Wow. Kevin Marks and his birds are back. Hey Kevin. Good to talk to you.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.600]   We got a great panel today. Well I think we should I think we should kick things off with the big
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:19.280]   announcement yesterday. Facebook was acquiring Oculus VR the makers of the Oculus Rift virtual reality
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:27.120]   helmet that blew everybody away last year and actually this year too for two billion dollars.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:36.400]   Not exactly sure what Facebook wants to do with a virtual reality helmet. Kind of mixed reactions
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.800]   too. If you go. Oh oh oh yeah uniformly pretty pissed off.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:52.080]   If you go to the Kickstarter project because as many of you may know the Oculus Rift was a
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.000]   Kickstarter project. A lot of people put money in that they were asking for I think well let's go
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.880]   see what they were asking for a few hundred thousand dollars ended up getting 2.4 million
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.480]   from what they but they paid for right. They got their the developer gets yeah. We did well
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.800]   depends what you paid for. For instance if you just supported it with ten dollars saying
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.120]   I think this is a great thing. I know I can't afford to buy one but I just want to put some money
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.200]   into this so that you continue to build a fantastic virtual reality experience for gamers.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.040]   Then you might feel a little miffed if you read the comments there are a lot of people feel very
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.240]   miffed. I was a three hundred dollar level backer so I got exactly what I paid for an early rift
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:43.200]   developer kit. But I think also you give you give you give people well for instance let's go to
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:53.120]   notch the creator of Minecraft at Mojang. He was very interested in the Oculus Rift went to visit
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:01.280]   them. Just you know thought this is really an exciting thing for us. As soon as Facebook
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.840]   bottom well I'll give you his post at notch.net. Virtual reality is going to change the world.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.760]   It's amazing you strap on some gear then you're inside whatever world you want.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.040]   I got my Oculus Rift development kit played around with it. It was convincing.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.720]   He visited the office a couple of weeks ago. They wanted Minecraft I said yeah it doesn't really
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:31.840]   fit the platform. It's on Java. But maybe we could do it. So he and the folks at Mojang started
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.880]   talking to the folks at Oculus Rift and then he says not two weeks later Facebook buys them.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.240]   Don't get me wrong VR is not bad for social. In fact I think social could be one of the biggest
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.320]   apps on VR but I don't want to work with social. I want to work with games and I did not chip in
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:55.280]   10 grand to see the first investment round to build value for a Facebook acquisition. So he's pulling out.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:05.040]   That's an example of some of the people who are a little bit upset. I don't think anybody who has
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.400]   invested however in the real world invested in Oculus VR is too unhappy. They're going to have a big
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:18.000]   payday. As someone pointed out I think if you had invested the $300 for the
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.360]   kit, the developer kit and the headset and if that had been a real investment like it eventually
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.560]   will be under Title 3 you would now have on the order of $20,000.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.240]   Yeah. Had this been an actual investment you'd have 20 grand in your pocket.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:41.520]   Which is there was a great piece in the show notes by Joel Johnson this morning on ValleyWag or
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.400]   Gizmodo. That's who gave that the number. I think it was actually more than that. I think it was
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.640]   more like $200. No he said and then somebody calculated it better. What was that? Yeah,
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.320]   factor attended there. You would have on the order of $200,000. It's interesting. What I found
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.760]   most interesting about that piece and that argument is that it's true that down the line are some
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.840]   regulations that will allow people to invest at that kind of level without having to be what
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.760]   they call an accredited investor. That's the Jobs Act which is a past and law.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:19.440]   Jobs Act Title 3 I think currently making its way through SECL. But when it arrives it would
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:29.600]   prevent it from seeming like... We got muted Kevin right when you said seeming like we'll never know
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:37.440]   what it seems like. Can you unmute there? Now he's just frozen in time. Oh yeah.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:44.560]   Well yeah I think that Joel Johnson has the right title for this ValleyWag piece.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:50.320]   Oculus Grift. He calls it Kickstarter as a charity for venture capitalists. Is this unreasonable?
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.200]   I mean don't we all know going in that... Yeah I think so. I think that's the deal. No you don't
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:01.040]   get equity. And I think in the end it's going to be piece by Joel because he says I got what I paid
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.880]   for. We may not like it but this is the way this is the deal. Sure he also points out though that
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.320]   would feel a lot different if it was a company that got to two billion through hard work sales
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.760]   iteration and such versus a company that's just being screened out at two billion dollars.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:24.000]   Yeah in fact it seems unlikely that although Mark Zuckerberg did say that they were going to
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.560]   continue with the game stuff that seem unlikely that this is now going to become a consumer product
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:35.040]   today near near time. No no no sorry I mean they've given them enough that they're in the
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.480]   league of the other two that they've bought that they haven't completely destroyed.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.360]   Yeah they've they've they've what's happened Instagram. Yeah they've put a lot of companies
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.680]   that they've shut down and folded in for engineers but they've said this isn't one of those.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.560]   Well is this an investment plan by Facebook into a whole new category for Facebook?
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:59.120]   Well one of the one of the similar countries I saw was was saying Facebook missed the boat on
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.120]   mobile gaming they wanted they want to make sure they catch the next wave of gaming and that will
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:09.680]   be this which I'm slightly suspicious of because you know like Notch I remember playing the
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:16.640]   iHellmick games in the in the late 90s late 80s which was if you remember the Terradactyl thing.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.640]   Yeah at SIGGRAPH they had the Terradactyl you put the big helmet on and you'd be flying.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.280]   This was actually in arcades in London it was in the chocolate. Really? Yeah and
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.920]   CN Tower had one. This is this is John Warden I actually know the guy he's.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.760]   But you had to put a big out as Notch points out here but big old thing on and
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:40.000]   it was a huge thing and it was really low res it was right yeah.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.920]   Well this is the other sad thing is that for people who like me bought in we only got to see the
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.360]   low res version one of Oculus Rift we never did get to see the second one that everybody said
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.440]   now or now they've really got it down and we probably never will at this point.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.520]   Joel Johnson suggested I think it's a good idea. You know you got two billion
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:05.760]   spend a little money and send all of the early backers you know the version two development kit
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.640]   or maybe just ten bucks. That would be a nice thing to do.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:16.160]   Yeah but they have VCs now who would like to recoup as much of their initial seed
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.680]   investment as possible at a high rate as possible that's the nature.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.440]   Well they already have I mean that's the point they just got they paid it right.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.520]   400. Sure but now they have to improve.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:31.520]   400 million in cash 1.6 billion in inflated Facebook stock again Facebook is using its stock
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:38.240]   really effectively to acquire stuff. The VCs are dumb. Yeah and there's still money in the
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:46.240]   table I would guess. You know I get I get Joel's point but it feels indicative of this weird
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.360]   sense of entitlement that really like turns me off. I mean it's like it's like saying if you
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.520]   purchase something from a company that at some point goes IPO it makes millions of dollars that
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.960]   you're owed something back and I feel like that that is very specific to our industry because
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:07.600]   we have these crazy blockbuster stories of young kids making billions of dollars and I think that
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.880]   on some level all of us are feeling like well I'm owed the same thing you know because I'm just
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.200]   a smart or I could have had the same idea or I could have written that code and that's just not
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.760]   the truth. I mean that's just not true and when you when you back a Kickstarter campaign you're not
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.600]   purchasing equity and that's very very clear and look I'm speaking as someone who you know crowdsourced
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.680]   you know that the early round of my own of my own company. I just this feeling of like I'm owed
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:39.440]   something and and with the Oculus deal it was particularly bad because I didn't know much about
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:45.280]   Oculus and I'm not much of a gamer but it felt like it really added more insult that it was Facebook
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.360]   because there was such a clash of absolutely had this been Google I don't think you'd see this.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:55.040]   I completely agree I completely agree but but this whole like you know how much your
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.920]   might tweets worth you know how much money that I make Twitter that I just am like how much money
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.200]   do you make you chose to use the service and you know the idea was never like I'm owning a part
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.720]   of this company. There's a way to do that you can purchase shares in a public company right but
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.400]   that's not what you were doing so I find that whole angle sort of off-putting because I do feel
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.640]   like it's indicative of a weird sense of entitlement that's that's that's got false.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:24.720]   The counterpoint to that is that is the situation that happens all too often which is
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.520]   the thank you for a wonderful journey letter that appears when the startup you've been dumping your
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.080]   data into for the for the last two years gets bought by Facebook or Google or Twitter and shuts
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.600]   itself down and all your data disappears and that's our incredible journey.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.800]   And now we must part we have come to a fork in the road.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.520]   It's the art incredible journey post yes we're shutting down you have this much time to get your
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:58.080]   data that's been amazing thank you so much. There's been enough of that happening that people feel
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.000]   that when this happens to Oculus Rift even though I think in this case it's fairly clear that Facebook
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.920]   want to keep this going and they're not going to give them two billion just for just a high John
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:11.840]   Carmack and the other chap who's name I forgot who founded the thing they they really do want to
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.000]   build something here and they think there's something there and you know yes it's you know I it is
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.160]   have been a geek dream since the since 1980s 1990s we know that we've got ages and ages of like
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:31.040]   sticking screens on your faces and hoping they work and you know the vision may actually be doable.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.120]   So the way to contextualize this is you gave your 10 bucks or 300 bucks or $10,000
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.400]   and you established this company you got them to the point where they could then go get
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.040]   additional venture funding and they could then go to the next prototype and then they could get
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.800]   acquired for two billion it would be a different I think you're right Kevin to be
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.880]   I think part of a lot of this is that people just don't trust that Facebook's going to continue on
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:58.080]   with Oculus Rift but assuming that they do then this is all how it's supposed to happen is that
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:04.560]   what you're saying this is good I mean I think this is potentially you know I don't think this is
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.520]   what this this is that feeling of they've bought this thing and it's going to die now um
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:14.880]   I think they're going to keep working on it and potentially Facebook will take it further but
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:20.080]   we know we don't know the thing is about the VR thing has been a dream for a long time
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:26.160]   I watched I watched the Matrix with my son this week because he hadn't seen it
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:31.600]   and it was interesting to sort of watch that and go oh yeah I remember this this this area as well
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.640]   you know to me it goes back to Neil Stevenson's snow crash that was the first time I and I think a
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:42.080]   lot of people maybe neuromancer by William Gibson science fiction where we so crushed a bit later
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.680]   so neuromancer there was never any technology in it there was just he was just said he sees this
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.840]   thing and there was no explanation of how it worked well he jacked in he had a little port
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:56.000]   didn't he yeah in the back of his head we don't know exactly how it worked but if he
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.280]   Gibson delivery didn't describe anything so you were a magic wasn't a technologist
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.520]   he's from technologists whereas Stevenson was like and there's a laser scanning your eyeball and you
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.600]   know we went he did massive but either way we but I think we fell in love with this idea of a
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.920]   virtual world we could enter that would be indistinguishable from the real world except that
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:18.480]   all of this amazing stuff would could happen I think part of what the other pathos behind it is
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.200]   whether when Kickstarter really works well I think you've helped create a product or a project that
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   would not have existed right were it not for your support and I think you might question or some
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   of my question whether they helped create a prototype the arcade that would have never existed if it
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:43.360]   wasn't for geeky enthusiasm or if you helped some folks get closer to Facebook I'm not I kind of see
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.400]   both sides of it I totally get the kickstarter's not a store but you know you're also not a shareholder
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:55.200]   but I think it's tough when the idea is to help individuals and small teams get started and then
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.000]   you see something like a you know a two billion dollar figure show up all of a sudden yeah but
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.720]   listen at the end of the day I've been around investors with invested in companies and the
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.360]   wise investor even if it is an investment puts the money in and then lets the smart company run
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.280]   itself and it's got to do what's best for the company from that point out and and so what were
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:18.080]   they to do say no we'll turn down this two billion dollars because we want to stay in our garage
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:23.120]   right because we want to be loyal to our peeps who gave us a few bucks in the beginning sure let's
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:29.760]   hold the garage all around put on a show you know it's it's just too too surely temple does it hurt
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.640]   kickstarter in any way I mean I look at the other one you might look at and kickstart is
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.360]   blazing this on their front page when you go to kickstarter.com is Veronica Mars a Hollywood movie
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:45.040]   that was made with money by from its fans I think the fans don't feel that down they got the movie
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:50.240]   mm-hmm yeah I mean something that was not a big mistake were it not right there and it wasn't
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:55.680]   enough money to make the movie just gave Sony pictures or whoever enough you know input that
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.920]   they said yeah maybe we should do this sure I mean kickstarter is never going to have on their front
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:06.000]   page you know sold to Facebook for two billion right I mean they've always been about works of art
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.560]   and supporting creators and I even think they're moving away from software projects a little bit
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:17.520]   although you know this really really is hardware but look you know in five years of facebook invests
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:23.040]   in Oculus or Oculus operates on its own and it comes and it becomes the vision and becomes a mainstream
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:28.240]   consumer product then then I then I could see kickstarter saying hey they got their start here
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:35.040]   but not now the other thing about this whole thing too is I still don't know what Facebook
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.600]   does with it I'm getting flashbacks to second life yeah I think it's well beyond that but I
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:45.440]   think it is the reason I bring up snowcrash or neuromancer or the matrix or whatever is because I think
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:52.720]   that many of us geeks share that dream right of a world we can enter and what it's a social world
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:57.760]   isn't it it's a social network it I think what Zuckerberg said I thought was very important
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:04.720]   yesterday which is he sees this as a platform and then and it I think Facebook's being very
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:10.560]   aggressively interested in what's the next thing they almost missed mobile which could have killed
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.040]   them and I think they're they're there that's why they're being very aggressive with Instagram and
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:21.760]   WhatsApp they want to be and I think they implied that they feel like VR could be the next thing
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.840]   maybe after wearables or maybe as part of wearables well that was the
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:30.640]   rave coster post was was good on this because he was talking about the different
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:38.800]   variations on a theme here where he basically says there's there's like four different easy
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.880]   to do a quadrant diagram which is like what you do when you're a game theorist but he says
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:48.560]   there's this difference between virtual worlds and augmented reality and life logging and that you
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:53.360]   end up in different corners of the spending which pieces you're doing and Google Glass is basically
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.840]   mostly useful for life logging with a little bit of augmentation but you know to do an actual
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.840]   augmented reality you want to do and have glasses that will let you overlay stuff on the world
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.160]   which is some of the stuff that John Walden who did the original
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:12.240]   virtuality headsets is doing now he's building very very good heads up display things that
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:19.280]   have got mostly military uses but could be useful for individuals too and so there's
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.160]   there's this key goals that do that but they're again they're just giving you little
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.920]   terminated displays as opposed to actually replacing bits of the world which is one of the things
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:35.280]   that people wanted to do with this and then the but the the idea of a virtual world that
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.440]   you're completely disappearing to it has been this thing that people have dreamt about for a long time
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:45.840]   and that that is potentially durable though I've you know I've always found that it gives me a headache
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.400]   but that's you know because for the same reasons that watching 3D at the cinema gives me a headache
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.080]   because your your eyes are trying to focus on something that's at the wrong depth.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:21:01.200]   Yeah. Rafe quotes John Carmack who of course the creator of DOOM and very famously went to
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:09.040]   Oculus VR to work to on this he tweeted today I have a deep respect for the technical scale that
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:16.000]   Facebook operates at the cyberspace we want for virtual reality will be at this scale so
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.760]   it's true Facebook's got the money Facebook's got the scale got a billion users if you're going to
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:28.240]   make a metaverse I can't imagine a better company to be doing it with well maybe Google.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.440]   Yeah his reaction was a little bit defensive he tweeted something like I'm coding today which is
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.840]   the same thing I was doing last week at this time. Yeah see yeah nothing's changed.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.920]   Yeah yeah. It's like a long hair and a katana I can do this.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:53.200]   I like this this Rafe coaster post is very interesting. Yeah Rafe Rafe is a good
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.920]   thinker on this stuff. Yeah. But it's I mean one of the interesting things last last week with
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:04.000]   GDC and the reaction to GDC was a lot of people being very sort of stressed about where gaming had
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:12.960]   gone and the the effect of the destructive effect that all this selling rubbish all the time inside
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:18.240]   mobile gaming has had on on game development and the ideas of it and this I think part of it
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.800]   part of this sort of backlash is that this reaction was they were thinking great this is this is
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.040]   finally us like dedicated console gamers even get something that's even more immersive than
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.600]   staring front of the TV and it's not really like all that rubbish on mobile and Facebook which has
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.680]   this been this sort of culture what's going on in gaming for a while. So in a sense this is
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:43.520]   selling to you know the biggest enemy of the core gamers and I think that's part of the culture
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.120]   pleasure. I agree and if you if you are a core gamer then you'd probably be relieved to know
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:52.000]   that Microsoft and Sony are both working on their own virtual reality projects although
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.240]   I don't know if they are the companies that are going to invade in that space.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.960]   And I'm you know I'd be amazed if Google isn't doing something as well though I suspect there's
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:06.400]   more augmented virtual reality. You know they've they've already got the little tiny screen
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:11.360]   thing with glass. I always thought that glass would be much better as an augmented reality device
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:17.280]   it's just really a second screen that you look up. I'd love to see it overlaid on life.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.800]   Here's here and here's a I'll put a link in the in the IOC this is this is this is pretty cool.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:32.560]   This is get that up. This is this is the company that John Walden who did virtuality like 20 what
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:39.840]   odd 25 years ago which was the original arcade VR staff. He's been still working on optics and
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.400]   he's got this this neat like he's he's just going into the core tech of it. He's got these
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:50.240]   overlay glasses that are bright enough and I was enough to actually overlay stuff on your on your
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.800]   vision. And the point is they're building chips right now. They're much they've done the whole
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.880]   software stack. But there's a little interesting history of all the different variants of this
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.720]   that they've had. And of course our friend Jerry Ellsworth and she came up here and she had a
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:09.280]   Kickstarter project called Cast AR which is again for gaming more but was kind of a while the
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:15.520]   were glasses that project a gaming space onto a screen in front of you so that you can interact
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:21.280]   with it. There's I think this is something that is very often the case with science fiction and
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:26.080]   inspires development. They want something that they read about and I think this is where you
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.560]   know Rafe talks about the metaverse. I think this is where what geeks want. So a lot of people
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.960]   are working on it in a lot of directions. It's just that it's Facebook nobody. I don't you know do
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.200]   you want Mark Suck? If it hadn't been for the Kickstarter. Let's say they hadn't done the dime
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:44.960]   for the extra never did that. Right. Would there be the same resentment? No. Of course not.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.120]   It's not Facebook. Nobody resents what's apps getting 16 billion. I mean we're all kind of
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:56.160]   flabbergasted but nobody sends it. So yeah and I think I think it wouldn't have been
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.840]   if it hadn't been Google or Apple I don't think we would have been this kind of reaction. Maybe
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:05.440]   Apple. I don't know. Go ahead Kevin. The metaverse wasn't all as well. I mean the metaverse was a
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.560]   very commercialized vision. Right. And that's you know that that there was a assumption that
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:15.600]   it would eat the web. Which was remember this is a lot of this was pre-web. When was Snow Crash?
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:21.120]   Was that 19? Was it? I didn't come out. It's a long time ago. That was like that was required
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:25.760]   reading at the first dot com I ever worked at. It was like part of the worry. See what I'm saying?
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:32.080]   That's exactly it. That's people wanted to live that 1992. Yeah. 92. So 92 feels like a long time
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:38.800]   ago. Well there's a thing before Douglas Adams hyperlandic. That could be my link of the
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:45.760]   of the week if you like. If you haven't seen this it was a documentary Douglas Adams did in 1989
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:52.560]   with Friends of Mine at the BBC. Which was talking about what it means to interact. It's actually
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.680]   the start and the beginning isn't a good idea because it takes a long time to get going. It starts
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:03.440]   with Douglas Adams being asleep. But he talks about the idea of interactivity and the examples are
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:13.360]   based on hypercard and video discs and little bits of VR and these lovely floating icons and things.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:20.320]   There's an idea of how you interact with it. And he wonderfully hit the avatar talking to him is
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:28.960]   Tom Baker camping out now. Doctor who? It all comes back to Doctor who doesn't it?
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:35.200]   So if you haven't seen this see this. But like so you watch this and he predicts he has this
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.120]   little person who pops up. He asks questions of and they just finds things and everything's
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:45.520]   linked to everything else. There he is sticking his face in. And then at the end they start going
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:52.080]   into VR and there's there's a great bit. I can. I found the VR helmet. They're showing a NASA.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:57.040]   Yeah it's just a this bit. So this is the NASA guy puts the VR helmet on. And then
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.000]   look at the size of that thing. Oh my god. This thing is huge. This is this is this is just
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.200]   chemistry. There's NASA Ames and he's not even good. He's got a model of the room he's sitting in
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:13.520]   which is there's like a gray cubicle. You would try to take cubes. Those of us do not want models
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.680]   of the rooms are in. Yeah but understand that this is the this is the base technology. They just
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.840]   got better and better and better. That's all. But this was this was 89. We had this
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:30.160]   1991 was when virtuality bought the arcade things with the terra d'accures and those those.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.960]   So this these both predates. No crash. And then snow well snow crashes are being written about that
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.640]   time. It took him a while to write it. So it's published in 92 which means he was running around
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:44.080]   1990 as well. But that was that was thought through about what you would actually do with this.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:50.560]   And then the web came through inside to act everyone and this this piece is sort of sitting
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:56.400]   on the side for a bit. So it's nice to see it going back again. But it was it was very much a sort of
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.320]   and I suppose the other fork of this is is Second Life which was the the other
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.560]   assumption of the metaverse in the virtual world. But that was all done on the screen.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.280]   Right. And that you know it's still ticking over and it's there but it there was a huge
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:14.080]   exciting around it as a as a space for commerce. But people did exactly like the NASA guy they built
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.960]   models of their shops in it which is like no I don't want a model of your shop.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.120]   It was this is like most early. I would I would nominate Second Life as the single most overhyped
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:30.080]   thing on the net. Yeah. But like all of these their early stage and things will evolve.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:34.480]   The early net was pretty early web was pretty awful too.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:41.520]   I think that this is aiming towards something very exciting.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:47.040]   And if if two billion dollar investment from Facebook moves it along I guess I'm all for it.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:52.880]   We're going to take a break when we come back change long time.

[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:30.160]   much for the work she's done and her support of this and let me add let me add Leo that at the CUNY
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:34.720]   Graduate School of Journalism where I teach we buy a site license for litter.com for all of our
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:39.120]   students and that's how they learn an immense number of the tools that they do and how they can
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:44.560]   dig into more tools on their own and it's an invaluable resource. We do kind of the same for
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:49.200]   our editors and stuff when they need to learn Final Cut or the new version we always go out and
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:56.240]   get them on Linda.com that's a great place to learn. Let us bang the drum slowly it's time
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:09.200]   for the Google change log. Gina Trippani is in her basement with the latest Google stuff.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:18.400]   Man I just love that intro. Google now Google now has arrived in the stable build of Chrome for
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:22.240]   Windows and Mac. We saw this in the beta versions a couple weeks ago we've been talking about Google
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:26.480]   now in the desktop. Well it's rolling out to everyone now. The cards will only be visible on your
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.720]   computer if you use Google now on your mobile device and if you're signed into Chrome and the
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.440]   cards that you see on your desktop Chrome are a subset of the mobile cards. So you'll see weather,
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:41.200]   sports scores, commuter traffic and event reminders. I'm seeing some stock stock prices in mine.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:46.400]   Some cards may be based on the location of your mobile device which hopefully is near the computer
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:51.920]   you're using but others will just work independent of location. How do I see those cards where do they
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:57.760]   show up? So if you've got Chrome installed I'm on a Mac here. I see a little bell at the top of
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:05.280]   my menu bar. Notifications. Oh yeah yeah you're seeing now cards there. Well I see the notifications
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:10.320]   from Google plus. Well no no up in your Macs actually in your Macs. Oh in the Mac menu bar there's
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:16.880]   another little oh look it's Greg Burnett's birthday. Happy birthday Greg. Yeah you're right Twitter
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:22.400]   stock falls. Seven percent. There's always the weather. There's always the weather. That's nice.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:28.320]   No for Linux though. No no no for Linux. Oddly I don't think I have this on my Chromebook.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:34.960]   And no love for the Chrome. If you switch to a non stable channel Jeff it's there but
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.600]   is there the beta? Okay yeah. I always run my Chromebook in the beta channel. That seems safe
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:49.520]   enough. Yeah. Not canary. What could possibly go wrong? I didn't see the now ones in mind but
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:57.520]   maybe I hasn't run the update. It's rolling it's rolling out slowly. Uh okay. Now. Google Play
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:03.120]   Music got a bunch of new features to the web app that is drag and drop uploads a mini player
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:08.480]   at offline downloads. So you don't have to use that desktop a client called the music manager in
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.680]   order to upload your music to Google Play music. You can just drag and drop your music in the browser.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:18.560]   Yeah you actually have to opt into this. It's a it's a music labs. You have to opt into the to
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:24.640]   the lab feature and then you can even configure your Google Play music in the browser to add music
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:29.680]   automatically in the top right which is kind of nice. You can also download your music now from
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.400]   the web app and the little player has a little pop out new pop out functionality that you can
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:39.040]   click the arrow on the bottom right of the corner of the UI and pop out the player. Some nice upgrades
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:46.960]   there. A new Chrome experiment called Chromecast Photo Wall. You can see it at g.co/photowall.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:51.440]   So this out works. You got a Chromecast plugged in and then you and your friends all have your
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:56.080]   Android devices. You've got this Android app and then you can create a photo wall and everybody can
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:02.800]   start adding photos to that wall. Yeah and it shows up on your TV and it generates a YouTube video
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.880]   automatically when you're done. And I think this also works just with your laptop as well if you
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:13.920]   don't have a Chromecast. We did it at co-work Buffalo the other day. It got a little an arctic so
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.240]   we had to shut it down but it's pretty awesome. Is it pretty awesome? So the Android app doesn't
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.000]   have the best reviews in the Play Store. We were talking about this last line in all about Android
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.640]   but it looks really me and it's it is just it does seem like more of an experiment than the most stable
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.800]   app in the world. But Kevin I haven't tried it so I'm glad to hear that you that you had it go
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:35.440]   on at co-work Buffalo and it worked. Yeah the setup is a little wonky you know especially when you have
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.440]   to type in a code on your Android and then make sure you've got the right Chromecast and all that
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.280]   stuff. But when it's working it's pretty neat. You're all literally just kind of pinboarding it in
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.520]   front of each other. What happened that you had to stop people put up pictures naked pictures of
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:53.680]   themselves? It's a co-working space. Okay. A lot of sensitivities and sensibilities. Yeah play.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:58.400]   So someone's got to step in and be the police. Yeah. Okay. Just checking. So there's no one who's
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:04.800]   okaying photos. They just go whatever gets dragged on there. If you. Yeah I think you can make it
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:11.200]   private but then why are you hosting your own private photo wall? Just to show people. Like if
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:17.520]   you want to show people your vacation slides and force them to watch I guess. I don't know. You must
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:25.440]   watch this. No it's really fun when it's working. It's very experimental but totally fun. It sounds
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:31.280]   like a lot like Google+ events where everybody could contribute their photos to you know at a
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.560]   particular event like if you're having a picnic or something. I don't know if this is still around.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:39.120]   I think it is but it seems similar and that's a social photo sharing. Yeah. One quarter of your
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:43.360]   event attendees don't email you and say that they never got the invite. So it's like that.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:53.280]   All right. Well on that note Google Drive adds image editing features in slides and drawings
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:58.000]   and this will just allow you to do basic editing tasks without having to leave the app. That means
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.760]   you can crop apply shape masks and more from inside a presentation or drawing drawing and you can also
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:09.520]   add borders. So little little extras there for docs for slides and drawings users and docs.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.800]   And finally I know you've been waiting for this forever. I know this is that this is what you
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:22.080]   wanted in Gmail forever. Pinterest for your inbox. It has been called. The Gmail promotions tab is
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:30.560]   getting a little visual makeover. This is a test of a new design that switches from being a list-based
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:36.480]   view to a grid with big images which of course Google is now caching on their servers right.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:41.040]   So they've got all those images. And so it shows images from the emails and it makes it easier to
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:45.440]   see exactly what the message is promoting and the grid view makes it easier to scroll through a
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:51.840]   lot of messages with infinite scrolling. And you can sign up to try this test. It's a field trial.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:56.800]   So you have to do have to opt into it. And you'll be able to toggle between the traditional list
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:01.520]   view and the grid view within the promotions tab. And this test is just for desktop only right now.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:07.280]   So you go almost never look at my promotions tab but hey if you're if you're into coupons
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:10.800]   promotions the sounds cool. Where do we sign up? How do we do that?
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.360]   In the labs? I don't see in the labs. Am I in the email?
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:25.360]   So I have to. There is a long link that Markingland had. Sorry. Well if you go to the Google mail blog
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:35.840]   you can get that link. I guess. Yeah. Okay. No. A test. Oh sorry. A more visual way to view your
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:46.880]   spam. Thank you Google. It's it's it's a G dot CEO slash mail field trial is the shortened URL.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:52.560]   Oh perfect. I'm sorry. Gmail G dot CEO slash Gmail field trial.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:59.920]   Mail field trial. Yeah. And then you have to click join field trial. And then if you're accepted.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:07.120]   Yes I want to join the field trial. If you're accepted they'll let you do it. If you're selected
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:13.120]   you'll see a message in your promotions tab when this feature is turned on. G dot CEO slash Gmail
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:20.880]   field trial. I opted in and I do not have it yet. Let me check my Gmail because I might be better
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:27.200]   than you. Do you might be trying with my not yet. I'm actually got some Gmail account. This
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.560]   is basically all spam so that should be good ones. Yeah well that's why it's perfect for that. Yeah.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:36.240]   All my all the stuff in promotions is spam. Isn't it? Isn't that what it means?
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:42.880]   It's a sign up for spam. You signed up for. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know that the Google
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:49.120]   would call it spam. Yeah. Let's see. I have multiple multiple Google accounts going on here so.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:55.760]   But that's all I got. And that my friends is what we call the Google change.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.520]   Oh.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:04.720]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Ladies and gentlemen we will take a break and come back with more
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:09.120]   Kevin Purdy is here. We're going to make Kevin say something. Maybe you could do a song from Greece.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.440]   You wonder too.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:19.760]   Or high school musical actually. I don't want to age myself. I would be more familiar with it.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:25.680]   Yeah. Kevin Marks is also here and listen for the bird song.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:32.080]   Say the secret word and win and it looks like one. Yeah. It does. Doesn't mean the cat that ate
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:39.520]   the canary. Jeff Jarvis from his beautiful library in upstate New York. I don't know where it is.

[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:20.880]   in Google and we are talking about the Goog and the cloud. There's a lot of news about Google,
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:29.200]   not just Google, but Google and Apple, Google, Apple, Intuit, Clear Channel, Comcast, eBay,
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:37.280]   Microsoft, Adobe. Apparently they've been colluding violating antitrust law by agreeing not to
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:44.320]   poach each other's employees and the really nasty part, which I've we've seen this before.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:50.240]   This this antitrust case has been going on for some years is the email from Steve Jobs
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:57.200]   to Eric Schmidt, then CEO of Google saying, oh, you got it. What is that? Oh, you're in the class.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.520]   I'm in the class. I was working for Google at the time. Oh my God. Wow. That's your
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:07.760]   so tell us Kevin Marx why this was a bad thing for you as an employee. It was not particularly
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:12.560]   amazing for me because I'm Google paid me fairly well. But but had you been looking for another
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:20.560]   job at Apple or maybe that's the thing is that if you actually read the transcripts and what they
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:24.880]   were saying, it is fairly damning. That's the piece that the smoking gun is horrible. And they're
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:28.080]   well aware of what they were doing. There's Eric Schmidt saying, let's do this verbally so we
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:35.440]   don't leave a paper trail leaving a paper trail. But they're basically saying, we're all friends
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:40.000]   say we shouldn't recruit from each other's companies. This is a, you know, which is effectively
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:47.360]   effectively forming a cartel. And it's interesting reading. Horowitz's book, which is a great book,
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:53.680]   the hard thing about hard things on being a CEO. The one piece in that that maybe go, wait a second,
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:57.760]   was a chapter where he talks about not poaching people from your friends. And reading that in
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:03.520]   the light of this sort of made me think about how far the attitude is. And from their point of view,
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.520]   it's we don't want to annoy these other companies to get into a bidding war because that will raise
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:12.560]   the price of engineers. And as an engineer, that's like, yeah, please raise my price. Raise my price.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:18.160]   Please, please fight over me. And that's effectively what happens when they do these
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:22.560]   these equal hires. So they end up getting into bidding wars for a company to get the engineers.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:29.680]   And those are the ones who benefit. And I suspect this is the unexpected consequence that they've
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:34.960]   done by deciding not to bid against each other and hiring and not to approach each other's
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.960]   engineers. They're creating a sentiment. People who leave and build startups and said instead,
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.960]   and then get hired that way. So I think they've probably shot themselves in the foot with this.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:47.520]   I'm fairly sure that this is going to, this is a lawsuit. Some lawyers will make a lot of money
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.960]   out of it. There'll be a settlement and I'll, you know, they'll be like, I mean, maybe not. I
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.960]   mean, it's the Department of Justice doing here. This is the US government. This is antitrust law.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:46:00.960]   There is a class action suit as well. But this is a classic violation of antitrust law.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:08.240]   Everybody knows this rule. And you know, Steve Jobs apparently furious that
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:18.000]   here, here's the email from Sergey Brin. So I got another irate call from Jobs today.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.240]   I don't think we should let that determine our hiring strategy, but I thought you'd let you know.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.360]   Basically said, if you hire a single one of these people, this means war.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:30.240]   In any case, let's not make any new offers or contact new people at Apple until we've had a
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:37.920]   chance to discuss. Eric Schmidt agrees. He says, I got a same call from Meg Whitman over at eBay.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:45.920]   Let's do this orally. And then, and then, this is the one that's really reprehensible is Eric Schmidt
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.160]   writing to Steve Jobs saying, Hey, don't worry, we fired that person that offered an Apple employee
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:55.520]   a job there. We're out of here within one hour. We're going to make a public example of them
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:04.080]   and job setting back a little smiley face. And then Larry Page says, gosh, I never got a smiley face
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:10.880]   from Steve. One thing, one thing that amazes me about a paper trail like this is that companies,
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:15.360]   publicly traded companies that you assume have these huge structures and delegation and so many
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:20.240]   committees and shareholders meetings. But this, the way this article reads, it's like,
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:26.960]   Steve calls Larry. Larry tells Eric, Hey, Eric, got some friction over here from Steve and Steve's
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.520]   like, yeah, I heard from Meg too. Like it's a clubhouse. Oh, it's very much, very much so.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:36.320]   Like it's not, it's not multi-billion dollar companies with hundreds of thousands of employees
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:41.040]   and all these, you know, assign rules. Like the real fours playing about the flower shipments.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:45.120]   Yeah. Here's the email from Steve Jobs. Eric, I'd be very pleased if you're
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:50.720]   recruiting department would stop doing this. Thanks, Steve. The next day, Schmidt sends an email to
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:55.360]   Google's top HR people. I believe we have a policy of no recruiting from Apple. This is a direct
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.120]   inbound request. Can you get this stopped and let me know why this is happening? I need to
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:03.920]   send a response back to Apple quickly. Let me know as soon as you can. Then they respond,
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:09.600]   the person who contacted the Apple employee will be terminated within the hour. We're going
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:14.880]   through her records to make sure she didn't contact anyone else. Please extend my apologies to Steve
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:20.160]   Jobs. This was an isolated incident and then Steve sends back the smiley face.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:26.800]   I wonder if anybody's yet surfaced that fired HR person. Boy, you know, that would be, uh,
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:36.240]   that'd be interesting. Doesn't somebody in HR say, hmm, that sounds weird. Why are we doing this? I
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:40.800]   mean, is it? No, because there's no way HR is like HR is there to be the tool of the company.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:45.520]   They know it's illegal. It is a clear violation of any trust law. There's no,
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:50.000]   there's no like, oh, we didn't know that. Oh, you can't do that? Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.640]   They knew that. So I think part of this is, and that was interesting about Horovis' book,
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:49:00.400]   was that when you're a company of like 20 people not poaching your friend's start-ups employees,
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:04.480]   makes a bit of sense. You don't actually want to do that. And the problem is people,
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:10.720]   as these companies grow, they forget that they're now behemoths. And Microsoft was
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.840]   a classic for this. They would always think they were a startup, even at the point where they were
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:20.160]   half of them, were conspiring to knock out the companies over. And the things that, and, you know,
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:26.560]   Apple and Google and Facebook are like major employees around here. They employ thousands and
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:33.200]   thousands of people. So at some point, what seems like a reasonable, like, okay, let's not get into
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:39.280]   a war over this, let's do this amicably becomes this power structure. But the companies still think
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:43.840]   of themselves as small and scrappy. And that's the piece that's tricky. And because, you know,
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:48.000]   when these companies grow like this, it does creep up on you. And the challenge is to put
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.080]   structure in place in time. I mean, the similar thing with the GitHub fiasco last week,
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:58.080]   where they've grown to be this huge company without building a management structure and
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:03.920]   still behaving like a bunch of kids hanging out. And now it's blown up in their face because they
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:10.960]   were ridiculously unprofessional. Mike Harrington's at it again. I just love this.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:17.760]   We're gonna do this, Arrington story, aren't we? Let's do it. Let's do it. So it goes back to the
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:22.720]   story we've been talking about for a couple of days now, Microsoft had an employee who was leaking
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:30.160]   code to a French blogger. He was very loyal to the company doing it on Hotmail, Microsoft's MSN
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:37.040]   messenger and SkyDrive. So Microsoft said, well, you know, let's just look at that. Let's take a
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:42.960]   look at that Hotmail thread and read his stuff. And since Microsoft has said, you know, obviously
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:47.760]   you don't need a subpoena to read your own email server. We don't do that though unless there's a
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:53.200]   clear violation of the law. But from now on, we're gonna have it live up to the standard that we
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:57.440]   would have to if we were trying to read Google's mail, the standard of subpoena. We're gonna hire
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:02.960]   a counsel who is a former judge who will review all requests before it happens, not that it happens
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:08.800]   very often. So Mike Harrington's reading about that and he says, you know, I have first-hand
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:14.080]   knowledge of this a few years ago, I'm nearly certain Google access to my Gmail account after I
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:18.640]   broke up. I love that. I love that phrase. I'm nearly almost positive. Mike, by the way,
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:23.040]   this is kind of how he this is his MO. He's kind of a little paranoid.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.440]   Nearly certain that Google access my Gmail account after I broke a major story about Google.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:33.920]   A couple of weeks after the source afterwards, the source was approached me in a very
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:38.560]   inebriated state and said that he or she had been asked by Google if they were the source,
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:42.480]   they denied it, but they would then shown the email that proved they were the source.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:50.800]   And a little wire later was unemployed. Google says, no, we don't do that.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:58.880]   No, it didn't ever happen. Google accounts, general counsel told Liz Gaines at
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:07.120]   Recode. Mike makes a serious allegation here. Google opened email messages in his Gmail account
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:12.560]   to investigate a leak while our terms of service might legally permit such access. And that's kind
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:17.840]   of the point to underscore all email services have weasel words in there that allow them to do this.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:22.160]   We've never done it. And it's hard for me to imagine circumstances where we would investigate a leak
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:28.640]   in that way. I agree. There's two things about that. One is the obvious follow up question is,
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:32.960]   how would you change your terms of service to make that not possible in future? You're the
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:38.880]   chief counsel, please do that. Because you should not have terms that let you do that.
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:44.720]   But the other piece of it is we did not investigate it in this way. What will have happened is they
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:49.680]   will have had some kind of security team to go and look at this. And that may have been an outsourced
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:56.800]   team that went and did something more fishy. They may have gone and looked at the employees'
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:59.200]   mail and investigated them and see what other ones they'd use.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:06.320]   Ockham's original tell you it's almost far more likely that they looked at the email on
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:08.880]   the employee's computer and went through their own Gmail service.
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:14.000]   Okay. But Errington said the email that he saw at the party was sent from a non-Google account
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.280]   to Errington's Gmail account. Well, but what is the computer that he sent?
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.360]   You hire a private investigator. What do you think they're going to do?
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:25.200]   They're going to go and try and hack the employee's emails.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:29.840]   And they're going to do it. They don't really have to hack it. They could just look at it.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:34.720]   Yeah. It was just something on Google service. He wasn't completely stupid, but
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:38.320]   clearly he was clumsy and drunk, according to Mike.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:42.800]   Drunk later. The fact that Trump thing is like, why does that need to be,
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.240]   couldn't you just have the employee come up with an audience?
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.480]   Because it's Mike Errington. He's making a colorful.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.000]   And he has to be a dick about it.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.400]   Well, there's my...
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.960]   Kevin and I know have some experience in this madness.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:53.360]   Oh, yes.
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:59.600]   We don't want to bring that up. But I get on with Mike and he's a good journalist.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:03.440]   He does interesting things. But he will, he will, he will, he will, he will,
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:06.960]   Grandson did a little bit about this. Like when he got all the Twitter internal emails.
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:10.560]   He's, he's, he's, he's not in a great position to Grandson about this,
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:16.240]   given that he got leaked with his internal emails and it spent a big chunk of time trolling.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:17.120]   That's a good point.
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:21.360]   We should just say, you know, your email is never and has never been private.
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:27.120]   And if you want to send private emailers encryption and use it, because that's really the fact.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:31.200]   Well, but, but, you know, what Google should say is, we shouldn't,
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:35.200]   if we don't want to do this and we're not going to do this, then we should change our terms of
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:38.880]   service. That's the, that's the pressure to put back on them. And it shouldn't be us saying,
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.640]   change your terms service to be like this. It would be okay, general counsel, you said that
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:46.240]   you don't do this. Therefore change your terms service. So you can't and explain to us why you
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.280]   can't do that.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:51.040]   As John Gruber said, it is interesting that they chose to respond at all
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:57.040]   to this particular, you know, allegation of email reading, whereas there are 6,000 others that
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.040]   exist on the web and some form, but they, they, they,
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:03.360]   sorry, these days, they didn't do this to Mike Erenkens claim.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:09.360]   Well, and also, Kaurish, it was, it was, like, it was a, it was re-reported and spread out.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.640]   So they went again under control.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:18.560]   Let me look at the, the smoking gun on the Google terms of service. Let's see if we can find
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:28.560]   that. You know, it's apparently Yahoo, Microsoft, Google,
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:38.240]   all do this. I mean, I have all have these terms in, in their terms of service. Let's see.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:46.320]   Oh, well, I can't quite find it, but, you know, it says under certain circumstances,
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:49.360]   generally it says something like under certain circumstances.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:53.280]   And that may well have been put in because they get subpoenas and,
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:53.600]   right.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:59.200]   The very common one is someone's going through a divorce and a subpoena.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.640]   And there's these, the spouses emails and that, that, that goes on all the time.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:02.880]   Right.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:09.280]   Yeah, for a subpoena, I understand. I think the issue is,
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:14.480]   no, I mean, the, the, the Microsoft thing was that they didn't require the investigator to
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.280]   get a subpoena. They reported this thing to investigators and they said, oh, we're just going,
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:21.360]   I'm looking at his journalist thing. So they, they didn't get the clear separation of powers
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.080]   thing going there.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:22.560]   Right.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:26.080]   Google has been good about that in the past. They are, they are fairly good about that.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:29.440]   Making sure, you know, come back with a court order type staff.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:34.880]   And I don't think that they would have, you know, as, as, I'd be surprised that they did that
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:35.360]   internally.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:40.000]   Microsoft's response, I thought, was fairly good, but they need, nor do they change the terms of
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.920]   service? They still allow it, but they are going to have a high standard, etc, etc.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.400]   The problem is it's like, trust us, we're going to do this internally.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:50.240]   And it's the same people who are doing this other phone each other up and firing people and,
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:53.280]   and conspiring in that way. It just makes you a little suspicious. Yes.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:02.000]   Um, the M8 from, I bet you guys talked about this a little bit on all about Android last night,
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:09.760]   the new HTC one. We did. You are an HTC one owner. I am. I am.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.920]   It's a really bad name, isn't it? So this is the two. The mate? Yeah.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:18.320]   They are offering it on the Google Play Store, which, yeah, the M8 because,
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:23.120]   oh, mate, oh, I didn't even get that. Oh, I didn't either. It was the M7 was last year's.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:26.240]   You own an M7. Yeah. Yeah. I think so.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:30.640]   You can get it from the three, uh, big, three of the big four big carriers and there's a
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:36.960]   Google Play Edition, which is great news. It's in my cart at the moment. Oh, really?
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:41.920]   Haven't pushed the button. So what's special about it? Why is it nicer than a Nexus five?
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:45.280]   Oh, God, I could go on and on.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:48.320]   Do do do do. Just give me a,
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:52.880]   but it's all beyond it. My son needs a new phone. There's a,
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:56.640]   there's like his photo post that side by side is a GIF that has the photos from an
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:01.920]   XS five and the new HTC one, like jiffing in and out and in and out and it's, it's all you need to know.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:07.760]   Camera? Well, camera, I there's a little debate on the camera. It's very, very similar to the
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:12.960]   camera you have, Gina, the old HTC one camera still four megapixels. Although the front camera
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:18.480]   is five megapixels, but they're, but they're doing this super pixel thing. They are putting two
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:26.000]   pickups on the back so that they can, uh, you can have selective focus on your images, which is odd
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:31.280]   again. You can change your focus after the fact. Yeah, the second of sensor is actually a depth
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:38.560]   sensor. So something's going on there. I'm not sure what you could also just take out the
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:42.160]   things in the foreground can be treated one way and the rest of the photo can be treated another
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:46.400]   way because it understands that. Yeah, but it's still a four megapixel camera and a lot of the
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:54.240]   issues, I think that I had with your the M seven are still there. It's good and low light,
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:59.120]   except it over exposes. Um, it just, there's still some issues with it. It's, I'm not sure
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:04.960]   that it's a great camera. Do you really like your camera and your M seven? Uh, the camera's okay.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:09.680]   Okay. I still, I still ultra pixel thing. I'm not sure I buy photos. Um, that definitely doesn't
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:15.680]   focus the way I'd like, you know, it's, it's okay. Um, my daughter likes to throw my phone a lot and
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.600]   it, I actually, I just bricked it today. Like I, it's, it's dead. Like I can't quite boot it up.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:24.240]   That's why the M eight is in my, is in my, uh, my car. I think you have a pretty good excuse.
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:29.040]   I, I, it's, it's, you look a good excuse to me. The big thing with my problem with the M seven is
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:34.240]   the battery life and, uh, the verge and everyone is saying that battery life on the M eight is way
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:39.920]   better. Uh, so that's, it's a bigger battery and it's also using, uh, the new Qualcomm quick charging
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:45.440]   capability. Um, it comes with quick charge one, which is not great, but the new quick charge two,
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:50.960]   which apparently is just a software update means it can charge like twice as fast. Yeah,
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:55.360]   that's really nice. And I even, I don't, I'm not big on cases, but I love that.view case. Yeah,
[00:59:55.360 --> 01:00:02.160]   that's kind of neat. Yeah. Yeah. So that gives you a, a dot, uh, you know, small, uh, like kind of like
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:07.760]   the, uh, the, uh, Moto X where you have a, uh, a version of the screen that doesn't use up a lot
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:13.440]   of power. So hold on. I like, right. It's like a light, right. It is. We've got to talk to you
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:18.160]   more than this. So, cause when you bought that, that one, the, the Nexus five wasn't out. The
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:23.440]   Moto X wasn't out as I remember. Um, so now that you have a panoply of choices.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:29.200]   Yes. Okay. Okay. The move sound you got the two speakers on the front. That's a big difference.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:33.920]   I love the speakers on the front. Sound is really much better on the, uh, on the HTC one,
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:41.120]   both the eight and the seven. Um, I, do you ever, twice what the Nexus five does? It's 700 bucks.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:46.400]   Instead of 350. Uh, you can't put an SD card in it, which you can't do in the next five.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:50.720]   That's what is also right. That's right. Yes. Sorry. I think the screen's better.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:55.520]   I like the screen better. It's 441 dots per inch. Very high res screen.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:03.040]   What's the same as this? I mean, they're both 1080p. Yeah. I guess it's exactly the same, isn't it?
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.200]   Yeah. They're both five inch screens. Okay. Yeah. I mean, I think I shared with you guys,
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.040]   I bought the HTC one because of the design. I was completely just suckered in. I just think
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:15.600]   it's a beautiful. Well, you'll like the M8. I played with it yesterday. It's very nice. Even
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:21.440]   nicer. Yeah. It's even, I think it's even nicer, frankly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A little softer than the,
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.320]   not as, not as sort of rectangular. Yes. A little bit rounded edges. More roundy. Feels good in the
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:36.160]   hand. Yeah. I think if you're getting the Google Play edition, I think you're spending 350 bucks
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.720]   for better, better hardware design because otherwise it's the same software, right? Yeah.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:46.960]   Yeah. Well, the Google, yeah, the Google Play edition is just the same as an X is five. Yeah.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:52.480]   Yeah. Same exact exactly. I actually got a Verizon edition because I like the
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:58.320]   HTC Sense. I want to see the new Sense. He likes Zoe's, right? I love Zoe's.
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.680]   Yeah. He's okay. Zoe. Apparently they've improved the Zoe's as well.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:10.720]   You know what's sad is this is, I think these really are great phones. They're comparable to an
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.000]   iPhone or, I mean, they're really among the, but because they don't have the marketing budget for
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.080]   Samsung, that Samsung does, they just don't, they get no traction. HTC itself is not doing so well.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.880]   Every time I see a new story about them, right financially and market share-wise struggling.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:30.560]   Yeah. Despite putting out phone after a few phones now where every site almost isn't
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:35.760]   agreement about how good they are and how well designed. Yeah. So 32 gig,
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:44.800]   a Nexus 5 is 399, 32 gig HTC one M8 is 699. So it's a strange about 300 bucks more.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:51.360]   Would you push Jeanette to a Moto X Leo? No, she likes her. She likes her. She's beyond that.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:55.520]   You love the Moto X, though, Leo. I do, but I have a feeling I may be trading it in for the
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:02.720]   M8 when it comes. Oh, really? Yeah. Well, it's, you know, see, I got again, I got the M8 with all that,
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:08.640]   you know, sense stuff on it. So we'll see. Yeah. I don't know that I buy five right now. I feel like,
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:15.600]   you know, I wait till after Google I owe. Oh, yeah. You might get one in the mail under your seat.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.960]   Yeah. That might be, you know, it might be something new soon, right? But that's always the case.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:24.720]   Well, there will be a new Moto X this summer.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:38.000]   Mm. Boy, I've used the voice stuff on my, on my, and I don't have the, as good a voice as you have,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.680]   but on my Nexus 5, I was using it today to get Chad to tell you I was late coming
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:48.560]   and just dictating emails. Works pretty amazingly. Yeah.
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:53.520]   Well, the voice on Android is great, period. We all love it.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.160]   Somebody's getting a Skype call, which is bizarre as you're all on Skype.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:08.320]   Sorry. I know. Google I owe is open for business. Well, it will be soon.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:12.640]   Registration opens April 8th. It's going to be random once again.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:20.880]   Random. Random April 8th through April 10th. I don't know why they have the extra two and a half days.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:26.000]   It says it makes it so you can play the stupid game before you sign in.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   Is that what you have to do now? You have to play the game.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.640]   It's not really me. I mean, so I went through it while we were on the beginning.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:35.760]   And you just kind of click it a bunch of times and it goes around and around and around.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.000]   It goes, what goes round?
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.880]   Mascomorant. Do I have to do this to win?
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.600]   No, it's just kind of then goes through the...
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.320]   Gather these elusive subatomic particles.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.880]   So just click on the big thing and it...
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.320]   Oh, I'm gathering it.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.960]   Because Google is gathering every bit of Adam in the universe to become part of the new
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.800]   Google Universe 2.0.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   Larry Page's Island. Now what?
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.800]   Now we'll talk about another one.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:09.760]   And...
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.000]   You've got to think who spends all this time in the Google place?
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.040]   Exactly.
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:13.760]   Right in this crap.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.000]   Well, click on the... you're making a...
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.400]   Tetris to Mahana-Heden?
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.560]   Polyhedron monolene.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.240]   Click on the right thing at the bottom right.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.360]   This is what my pants are made of.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.720]   Click on the pink thing at the bottom right.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.080]   I'll open this box and play with it.
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.120]   Silicon.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:32.640]   Build up the atoms to create a full crystalline structure of this highly abundant element.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.560]   Click the blue balls to make more.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.040]   This is beautiful.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:39.440]   I don't know.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:39.760]   Is this...
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.720]   She's imagine how good this would be in an Oculus Rift.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.680]   Now what?
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.840]   I have an neural network.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:51.200]   Add raw data to see what this network's processors can come up with.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.480]   Okay.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:57.280]   Sucking in the raw data.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:00.800]   It came up with a Rubik's Cube.
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:04.560]   Now a donut.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.760]   This is so stupid.
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:13.360]   It's weird in the post-NSA world that Google has a bunch of games where you have to gather
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.480]   everything into you.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.000]   Your sphere.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.880]   Keep it all safe.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:17.440]   Now what?
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:21.760]   Tap the Earth to see how we connect with one another.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.680]   To share ideas instantly.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.600]   With balloons.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:26.480]   Project Loon.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:30.400]   What's the point?
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.880]   A modems.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:38.080]   And now satellite technology.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:43.360]   Soon we will travel to Mars.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.560]   And this strange jigsaw puzzle planet.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:57.360]   This is like...
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:57.840]   I feel like...
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:01.520]   Oh my god.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.800]   There and now it just starts over again.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.000]   What?
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   After all that, you're back to the...
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:06.800]   You're back to the...
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.640]   Oh well, I should have just scrolled down.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.440]   That was the test.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.280]   That was the test.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.360]   Scroll down.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.240]   Oh hey.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.120]   Wow.
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.720]   Jeez.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:17.760]   Let's break stuff.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.840]   Experience IO.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.080]   Is that a Facebook shout-out?
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.520]   Getting to...
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.160]   It wasn't?
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.000]   They are round.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:26.880]   Oh, break stuff.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.920]   Move fast and break stuff.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.400]   Is that what Facebook says?
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:32.480]   Yeah, move fast.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.360]   Let's reboot.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:33.840]   Let's hack.
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.560]   Let's grab a drink.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.520]   If it's broken, break it is the Google equivalent.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.400]   Right.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.480]   If it's broken, break it more.
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.040]   Well, the point is, if you find something broken,
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:47.360]   demonstrate that it's broken so people fix it.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.560]   Oh, this is good.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.680]   So there's no rush this year.
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.680]   Just apply to attend any time
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:52.880]   during the two-day window
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.120]   and we'll randomly select who gets to come.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:57.040]   You.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:57.680]   No.
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.320]   You.
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:58.720]   Yes.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.960]   It's pretty good.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.080]   It's pretty good to save them.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.080]   To capture a lot of data about people
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.280]   who are interested in going to IO.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:08.480]   It's also $900 for general admission.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.440]   They don't mention that.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.200]   There's no price tag at this point.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.000]   So we're going to wait and here's a binary clock
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.120]   counting down.
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.480]   It's on the help page.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.760]   And there's actually a press pass
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.520]   request form on the help page as well.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.400]   Oh, there is.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.600]   I guess I should fill that out.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.560]   Yeah, you need to use Google Wallet.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.960]   You use Google+ in order to apply.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.080]   And it's academic admission is 300.
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:36.480]   I mean, this is way better than rushing to try to register.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.200]   You know what?
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:37.920]   Yes.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:38.880]   Moment in time.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.200]   Yes.
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:39.200]   But.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.760]   You are competing for the ability to have the privilege
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.200]   to pay $900 to go.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.520]   Lots more stories.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.200]   I'm going to let each of you nominate a story from our long list
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.600]   that you'd like to talk about.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.800]   We're going to get Ray Ban Google Glass, Oakley Google Glass.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.960]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.080]   Glass has doing it.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.600]   Google's doing a deal with Luxotic,
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.440]   which makes all of the major consumer glasses brands.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:14.560]   I want to talk about the cloud computing stuff a little bit.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.360]   OK.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:16.480]   Yeah, that was interesting.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:21.920]   Yeah, I actually, I went to, I got an email from Google a few weeks ago
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.880]   saying that they were doing this cloud platform live event.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.160]   It was the events going to be in San Francisco,
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:29.680]   but they were going to do satellite viewings like with streaming video at
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.320]   like Google New York and Google LA, a few other offices.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.960]   And that they were going to do a live demo on stage showing how to connect
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.360]   an Android app to a cloud service and that they'd found to do text.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.160]   And they thought that to do text would be a great candidate to do that.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:50.240]   And was it OK with me if they live coded the cloud plugin for to do text?
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.000]   And what I like to attend the event.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.280]   And I was like, absolutely.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.120]   I mean, whatever, the app is open source.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.120]   Anyway, they didn't really need to ask my permission.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.720]   So it was really neat.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.920]   I went to Google New York yesterday and just kind of watched the live stream.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.200]   There's quite a few people there.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.760]   They announced a bunch of really cool features.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:10.000]   Some of which I didn't even really get my head around because I'm just not this kind of
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.520]   engineer that does this kind of ops stuff, but huge, huge price drops in cloud computing services,
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.760]   virtual machines.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.400]   And as it always is at these events, it was the conversation that I had with a
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.600]   Googler kind of in the back and the hallway for five minutes.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:28.960]   That was way more informative than the actual presentation.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:33.520]   But the none of it is that Google, first of all, is obviously taking on AWS.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.000]   They want to take Google's internal operations.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.600]   Like all the systems that they have set up to deploy code and deploy servers,
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.200]   they want to turn that inside out and they want to offer that to companies,
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.320]   so to startups.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:51.680]   And they want everyone to sort of benefit from all the awesome automation that they do.
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:57.600]   And so this series of announcements yesterday, I think really lays the groundwork.
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.680]   I think for some even bigger kind of cloud platform stuff that we're going to hear about.io.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:05.280]   Again, this is like super backend systems kind of stuff,
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.800]   but some really, really neat stuff.
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.600]   And another interesting thing at the announcement that I found is that they're really embracing
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:16.160]   GitHub. They've stopped pushing developers toward code.google.com.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:18.080]   They said, GitHub is where the code is.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.440]   GitHub is where the community is.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:23.520]   They're doing continuous integration and checkouts and integration with GitHub,
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.360]   doing pull requests and requests.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.960]   They're hosting a lot of their own open source projects on GitHub,
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:32.080]   which I was impressed by and surprised by.
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.360]   I really liked that they were saying,
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.800]   we're going to go to where the people are versus ask them to come to us.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:39.920]   So anyway, it was a really cool event.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:44.240]   And yeah, they forked to do text and they picked it up to the Google Cloud.
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.720]   It was kind of fun. I'm still awaiting my pull request.
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.600]   I'll say I want that, yes.
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:50.640]   Yeah, that's nice.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.680]   I don't like using Dropbox.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:58.800]   So these price drops are kind of mirror the price drops on the consumer storage.
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:01.680]   They announced last week on Google Drive.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.600]   Google said at this event that up to now,
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.160]   pricing on this stuff has not followed Moore's law,
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.400]   but now it's going to start following Moore's law,
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:15.120]   which means dramatic drops have to every 18 months or something.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.280]   Yeah, they've got AWS in their sites.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:19.280]   I mean, the first question that they got was like,
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.400]   hey, are you going to offer tools,
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.360]   you know, a person in the audience,
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.320]   set up and went to the mic and said,
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.720]   are you going to provide tools to move from AWS?
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.880]   And you know, the Google on stage said,
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.280]   we will provide tools to switch from other providers.
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.040]   Like, you know, they wouldn't even say Amazon.
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.200]   And so whenever whatever whatever happens,
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:35.280]   Amazon's event is today, I might point out.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:35.920]   Yes.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:36.240]   Right.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.640]   Well, Amazon just announced some virtual workspaces,
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:39.280]   which is really cool.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.320]   I'm very intrigued.
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:40.960]   Desktop.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.920]   Yeah, you deploy a full desktop into the cloud.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:47.360]   So it's like you can have a Windows desktop running on an Amazon workspace
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.600]   and get to it through your Chromebook.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.080]   Chromebook.
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:54.480]   Well, I think not on the Chromebook.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:57.280]   I think it's not compatible with the Chromebook.
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.200]   The last thing I read so seriously.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:02.480]   Yeah, which is kind of interesting.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.720]   I'm not sure exactly what that all meant.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:08.480]   I read a long thread about it and I wasn't clear, but yeah.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.920]   Apparently there's an issue with the Chromebook.
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.640]   They said any device with an internet connection.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.000]   So that that'll be interesting.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:14.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:14.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.320]   Because there's an actual technical issue or a political issue.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:19.120]   I don't know.
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:19.520]   You know what?
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.000]   I'm going to have to.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.600]   I read this on Google+ today.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:27.120]   The idea is though that for instance, a business could have a provisioned workspace
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:31.280]   that you as a worker or a student could do it with a school,
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.280]   could log into on an internet connected device.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:35.520]   And there's your apps, including Microsoft Office, for instance,
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.400]   if you want it or whatever.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.800]   There's all your data for company.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.120]   It means the data is stored safely in the Google cloud instead of on some workers' local desktop.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.800]   Amazon cloud.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:45.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:45.920]   Yeah.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.800]   The Amazon.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.000]   Although I got to say Google's got managed workspaces.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.160]   Or managed virtual machines.
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:56.720]   I think that probably they can respond by doing something almost identical.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.800]   But they don't.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.000]   Google's supporting Windows over.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:00.800]   Right.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:00.800]   Right.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:03.280]   I don't think so.
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:06.000]   So I don't think Google is not saying one window is in our cloud at all.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.920]   Whereas Amazon is saying, sure we can run it when it's not that.
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.360]   We're not diagnostic about that.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.680]   So that they may be pushing that difference.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:17.120]   The upshot is where the middle of the war.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:17.600]   You cut his lips.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:18.080]   Wasn't it?
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.240]   And it's great for everybody.
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:20.400]   Right.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.440]   Because prices are going to go down.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.560]   The tools are going to get better.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.600]   It's great for everybody.
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:24.320]   We want a war.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:25.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:25.840]   We want a war.
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.320]   We want a war.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:26.880]   We're all good for consumers.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.080]   We're all good for one of these things, which is good.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:28.880]   That's definitely true.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.640]   Particularly small businesses.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:36.080]   So this is actually in response to your post, Gina.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.720]   It would work well with Chrome OS, but it doesn't work with it at all.
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:43.360]   You could use Chrome desktop sharing if you first connected from on some other client.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:49.360]   So you could point your Windows machine at it and then
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.400]   Chrome into your Windows machine, which is pointed at the Amazon.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:52.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:57.840]   I don't know if this guy, Charles, knows what he's talking about or not, but that's not encouraging.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.360]   If that's the case.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:14:59.840]   One bomb.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:02.800]   That would be any competitive, I would imagine.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.200]   No, no, I suspect it's just that, you know,
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.120]   Chrome is not something big for the two install yet.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.560]   It's not a big install base.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:09.120]   Right.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:13.120]   This says works with Windows, Mac, iPad, Kindle Fire, Android tablets.
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.120]   Kindle Fire.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:16.880]   So you need some sort of a client app.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.480]   It's not a browser based.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:21.120]   Ah, that's probably it.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.560]   That's what I was.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.200]   That was that.
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.320]   I assumed it was browser based.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:24.960]   Yes.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.200]   So if it's not browser based, then yeah, then that's a shame.
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.360]   Because then it went with a bunch of other things too.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.680]   It's a good deal for 35 bucks a month.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:39.840]   You get a single virtual CPU, 3.75 gigs of memory, 50 gigs of user storage, internet,
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:48.000]   explore nine, really, Firefox, Adobe Flash and Adobe Reader.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.120]   That's the standard bundle.
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:55.440]   You can get office professional for 75 bucks a month.
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.360]   Things I never use.
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.560]   It's basically Windows 7.
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.600]   You're getting Windows 7.
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.800]   We.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:07.200]   Meanwhile, Microsoft is taking the word Windows out of the zero.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:07.520]   Yeah.
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.480]   No, it's just Microsoft.
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:08.880]   It's your.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.440]   I don't know what that means.
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:17.120]   Well, it means they're trying to pitch the people who want to do Linux hosting there,
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.320]   which they've been able to do for a while.
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.040]   But this is good.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:24.880]   The fact that we've got three suppliers that let us run stuff in the cloud
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.840]   and don't require us to use their technology as much as they did is good.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.600]   Because Google App Engine was originally, you have to write everything in our own weird ways,
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:37.120]   with our own weird libraries, because then you can use Google stuff and it'll scale if you win that
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.000]   be lovely.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.880]   People said, yeah, that's kind of nice, but I don't want to write in that weird way.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.240]   I just rather write the things I know.
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:45.760]   And what's changed with the Google Cloud Engine stuff is they're saying, okay,
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:49.600]   we'll deploy SQL, we'll just write Cassandra, we'll write a bunch of other things.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:56.160]   And they did a demo last week of deploying some insane, like a million concurrent clients
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:00.160]   on a Cassandra entrance instance in Google Cloud, which is pretty impressive.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.960]   So there's this.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:03.360]   Yeah.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:03.920]   Can you play it out?
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.800]   There was a little animation on the screen.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:09.680]   I'll admit I was multi-tasking with there's this animation on the screen.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.360]   They're like, okay, yeah, we're now inserting 45,000 rows per, you know,
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.560]   millisecond into our database.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.560]   And look, it's going to do a live migration right over.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.840]   And look, the animation's not even going to stop.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:18.960]   And oh my God, look, it didn't.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.320]   Everybody clapped.
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:21.360]   And I was sort of like, whoa.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:27.840]   It's like one of these things is just so impossible to demo, you know, but okay,
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:28.960]   live migration happened.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:29.840]   Like I believe you.
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:37.600]   Well, it's also like they have to create a million, a million clients as well.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.120]   To do this.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:39.680]   Right.
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.760]   It's like, let's deploy a million clients.
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:45.680]   So we've got to server and then we want to put another million clients over here to attack our server.
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.600]   It's like, okay, I'm glad.
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.720]   I'm glad you guys are doing that.
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.600]   I don't want to do that.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.080]   That's good.
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:50.480]   That's good.
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.360]   The message is we deal with this and you don't have to, which is, you know,
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.440]   the message I want as a developer.
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.040]   Right.
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:57.520]   Doing that.
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:58.720]   Ob stuff is really annoying.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.200]   I've done it.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.480]   It's not fun at all.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:03.440]   And having people especially do it is a great thing.
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.480]   And this is what this particular product manager was saying to me was that, you know, at Google,
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.120]   they don't have ops teams.
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.680]   Like they've automated the crap out of everything.
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:13.840]   Right.
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.040]   And everything just kind of works.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:18.400]   Like they've got teams of fleets of site reliability engineers, SREs, right?
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.800]   But this ops stuff they don't do and nobody wants to do the ops stuff.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.400]   And nobody should have to do the ops stuff.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.280]   Like, and because they've optimized the crap out of it and automated it all,
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:28.720]   they want to offer those services to everyone else so that other startups don't have to have
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.320]   ops folks doing migration.
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.400]   I was just, we just switched to AWS.
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:36.400]   And I spent, I was up all night on Sunday, my rating and database with my ops person.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.920]   And you know, we had to take the site down for four hours.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.320]   I mean, it was, you know, in the middle of the night, but that's,
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:45.680]   but that's something that really shouldn't have to happen ever.
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:46.960]   So you appreciate this.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.040]   I mean, yeah.
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:49.520]   Absolutely.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.680]   I mean, I have somebody who's really good at this kind of thing.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.760]   I just sort of, you know, ran some scripts and stayed in chat and ate some, you know,
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:56.320]   some pizza.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:56.720]   Chinese food.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:56.800]   But,
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:57.280]   Okay.
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:59.120]   I forgot your,
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:18:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.000]   But it is, it is the worst kind of work.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.600]   So the more that you can automate it, the more that Google can kind of, you know, open source,
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.080]   their, their processes, it's worth the money.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:08.880]   It's worth the investment.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:12.560]   Any other stories before we move on?
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.160]   You guys want to talk about Jeff?
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.840]   Anything on your mind?
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:18.720]   Well, I've got two things.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:22.880]   Pew mapping Twitter conversations.
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.320]   It's kind of an interesting analysis.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:28.320]   Pew, Pew is a nonprofit does research on how we use the internet.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:28.880]   Great stuff.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:35.280]   And they're talking about political stuff.
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.360]   Just conversations in general.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:39.760]   And so they worked with, oh, who wasn't?
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.880]   Well, for instance, they say,
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:43.440]   No Excel.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:48.400]   The social media research foundation, which created Node XL to collect the data.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.160]   And, and, and, and so they see various kinds of conversations.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.680]   They see polarized crowds.
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:55.280]   We've heard a lot about that.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.720]   Where are people talking about that?
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.520]   She said, you idiot, you moron.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:19:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.440]   And then they map a tight crowd with highly connected,
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:04.240]   interconnected people.
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:07.760]   So it's not as if to say that, you know, there's just one kind of conversation.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.920]   Conferences to South by Southwest,
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.680]   tweets, for instance.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:14.080]   Brand clusters.
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:17.920]   And every brand there is out there.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.720]   And community clusters.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:24.480]   I'd like to buy these maps and put them on my wall.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.280]   Aren't they pretty?
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:28.080]   Then finally broadcast networks.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:30.880]   You know, when, when important stuff go out and have been spoke.
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.640]   On support networks.
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.760]   So that's interesting too.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:37.680]   The whole, you know, Comcast, Dell and so on.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.360]   Those, those kinds of conversations support.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:42.240]   So I just found that they were pretty and interesting to see
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:45.120]   the different kinds of conversations that do occur on Twitter.
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:46.880]   All right.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.480]   I'm just going to take a long download.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.240]   I can tell to get the interactive version.
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.320]   And I think we should probably mention,
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.920]   I think just for the kind of the record,
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.640]   as far as I'm concerned, I see it as an Edward Snowden victory.
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:00.320]   That on the path to victory,
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:07.040]   that the White House is looking at ending bulk collection of our metadata.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.080]   Well, that would be amazing.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.240]   Well, I, I, I will wait and see.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.360]   But at least they're making the right sounds.
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.320]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:15.360]   Good news for Pebble.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.280]   I didn't realize this is a success story.
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.520]   Pebble has sold 400,000 watches.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:22.960]   And they're on track to double their revenues in 2014.
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.080]   And when Facebook buys them,
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.040]   they're always going to get pissed.
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:25.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.920]   Another Kickstarter project I sank my money into.
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:34.240]   Yeah, they're just quietly chipping away at the, the smartwatch market.
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:37.360]   Despite all the big noise coming out of both Google and out lately.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.360]   The pebbles aren't as sexy.
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:42.160]   They don't do as much and yet people really love them.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.200]   You're wearing one, Kevin.
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:44.400]   I see Chats wearing one.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.840]   This is a, a Pebble steel.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.600]   They, they're intentionally kind of minimalist,
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:52.240]   as opposed to all the kind of things you've been hearing
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:55.200]   about what might come out of Google and Android is, you know,
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:58.240]   monitor every aspect of your health and connect everything.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.840]   And, and Pebble just wants to be like, hey,
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.920]   do all your text messages?
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:02.480]   We got those.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:07.440]   Chad, you, you still, uh, enamored of the Pebble?
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.360]   I'm, I'm still in love with the Pebble.
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:10.640]   Why?
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:15.200]   It's, it's, it does basically everything I needed.
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:21.840]   It, it allows me to do triage on my digital life as fast as it all comes in.
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:27.200]   Um, and so, so instead of pulling out my phone or, or if I'm in a rush,
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:30.160]   which happens all the time where I'm trying to get somewhere or I,
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:35.920]   I need to do something, um, that I, to focus on instead of pulling out my phone,
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:39.920]   interrupting my life, I can basically look down on my wrist and see whatever
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.480]   notification or whatever thing sort of popped in.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:47.840]   And, and it's, it's expandable and the battery lasts a really long time.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:48.880]   It's really simple.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:54.000]   I really, I actually really is this kind of blew me away.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000]   I love that it's not a touch screen.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.960]   I really like that it has physical buttons because I can check something
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:05.040]   and then go straight back into doing whatever the heck I was doing before.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:09.040]   I don't need to worry about the screen wake time finally turning off so that I
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.360]   don't actually accidentally like add some, so, you know, do something to it or
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:17.360]   if I'm in bed and, and I get a message, I can look and then, and then, you know,
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.640]   go back to sleep or whatever,
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:21.920]   I'm not worried that the touch screen is gonna create something.
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.560]   >> That's a sad, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:24.980]   >> That's sad.
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:25.960]   >> Wait, that's what you do.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.320]   I mean, everyone has this story.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.920]   >> I go to the bottom of that.
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.080]   >> I don't pick up the phone and look at buzzers.
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.960]   >> Well yeah, I mean you don't have to.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:34.780]   >> Well you don't have to.
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:38.620]   You can look and see who it's, it's mom and just mess around.
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:40.780]   >> And with, they just released a 2.0 firmware,
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:46.140]   or the 2.0 app and app store, and they're starting to get a little interactive.
[01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:47.840]   Just a little bit back and forth,
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:51.320]   so I have a watch face or an app on here called Glance,
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.120]   and shows the weather, shows the time.
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:54.320]   And then when someone texts you,
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:58.360]   you can actually respond to them with one of your preset responses.
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.960]   So- >> So it has touch?
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:02.520]   >> No, no, it's the button.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.040]   >> So- >> Yeah, you press the button.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:04.440]   >> I get it.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.040]   >> I can set the lower right button to be like-
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.480]   >> So primitive.
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:08.480]   Wow.
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.800]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.880]   >> You can't see my eyebrows on the audio feed.
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:15.320]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.760]   >> Scary high school.
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.840]   >> As Chad was saying, this is nice.
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.360]   It's nice to not have a touch screen.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:24.960]   It's nice to not get completely out of your zone and have to type out like,
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:28.080]   can't talk right now, Gina, explaining Pebble to Leo.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.440]   I can actually just hit the bottom right button.
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.320]   >> And you already have that as a preset.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.320]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:35.920]   >> Well, yeah, I'd like to tell you how the dog did on his walk.
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.240]   And I can just say, and four and all kinds of stuff.
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:41.760]   >> It's real, I have to say with 400,000 units,
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:44.560]   that's probably beating anybody else in that space.
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.000]   >> Yeah, but they're in their own life.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   >> I've forgotten, say.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000]   >> Probably beating the pins off the galaxy gear if I had to.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:49.800]   >> I would guess.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:54.000]   >> Yeah, it's probably beating the gear, which in and of itself is awesome for that.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.680]   >> Yeah, good for Pebble.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:56.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:05.000]   Good for Maker Studios, the YouTube network, which produces PewDiePie.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.480]   [LAUGH]
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:10.720]   So hold to Disney for half a billion dollars.
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:12.560]   >> For the record, that's not PewDiePie.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.640]   >> That should be PewDiePie, but it's not.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:18.160]   It's actually the founder of Maker Studios who had a big payday.
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:20.720]   [SOUND]
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:24.480]   This puzzles me a little bit because I would imagine, well, maybe they've got
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:29.840]   all these guys locked in, but I would imagine that they don't really own any of these shows.
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:34.320]   But maybe they do, that's probably why Disney bought them.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:37.240]   All right, well, let's take a break.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:42.000]   When we come back, we're gonna get our number, our tip.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.880]   Kevin and Kevin can give us some products or something they're turned on by.
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:52.520]   So we wrap it up, this week's Twig, our show today brought to you by Atlassian,
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:57.920]   the folks who created the world's most powerful and customizable issue and
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.880]   project management system, JIRA.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:05.640]   J-I-R-A, it easily captures and organizes your workflow so you can prioritize and
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:09.280]   take action on what's important while staying up to date with the activity going on around you.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:12.240]   The hardest thing about talking about JIRA is it could do so many things.
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:19.560]   It's hard to really describe, believe me, you can use this.
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:24.640]   It lets you, if you've got a team, a software development team,
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:29.600]   you can capture, organize, and prioritize all the issues, tasks, features, and bugs.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:34.280]   It gives your team a simple, intuitive interface for collaborating with one another in real time.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:38.240]   Integrate your documents, your planning documents, your backlog, all code repository.
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:45.600]   One platform using REST APIs, integration with Git so you can follow your code all the way from
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:50.320]   start to finish through delivery in one single system.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:55.360]   Expand infinitely in any direction with thousands of JIRA add-ons, including
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:58.720]   test management, time tracking, project management, hundreds of other uses.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:04.320]   If you've got a big project in the works, follow along with 25,000 other companies,
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:08.880]   70% of the Fortune 100, and NASA, and get JIRA.
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:14.400]   Avoid the problems of the Mythical Man month.
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:17.520]   Stay in the loop with notifications via email chat,
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:22.480]   @meshins or RSS, monitor streams of activity, self updating reports and dashboards.
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:25.040]   Atlassian.com/string for more information,
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:29.520]   atlassin.com/twig.
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:33.040]   Monthly plans started $10 a month for up to 10 users,
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:40.560]   but you could try it free for 30 days when you visit Atlassian.com/twig.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:43.920]   Make life easy with JIRA.
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:47.680]   Thank you Atlassian for your support of this week in Google.
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:50.000]   Now we begin with Gina's tip of the week.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.120]   Leo, you don't have your pixel there.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:53.680]   I don't.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:54.800]   You're not on yourself.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.160]   We're going to have to make Jeff do this.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.520]   It's not quite the same.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:02.800]   This is something that not a lot of people have Chromebooks,
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.800]   but I thought it was really, really interesting.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:07.200]   It's especially interesting with the pixel.
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:12.640]   But control shift refresh on the Chrome OS rotates or browser,
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:14.880]   so maybe it did it.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:17.760]   It's a square.
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.320]   It's a square.
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.600]   Oh, no, it's four, three, isn't it?
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:20.240]   Or three, two?
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.880]   You can kind of hold it like a book and go up and down.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:28.000]   I mean, it's totally weird and crazy and probably not something you could use
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.080]   unless you were, you know, I don't know, drinking your coffee in the morning
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.880]   and browsing the times or something, but still kind of cool.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:33.680]   That's good.
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:34.800]   We'll be on the Chrome box.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.280]   So the Chrome box you drive a TV screen,
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.880]   which means you can give you a portrait mode screen.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:39.360]   That would be good.
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:42.320]   We're going to back to you.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:45.360]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's upside down.
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:46.720]   Oh, it goes all the way around.
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:48.880]   Yeah, it keeps going.
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:50.240]   It's a very.
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:50.720]   It's a very.
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:53.200]   If you have to have a keyboard and a mouse to it,
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:56.320]   I mean, I've seen a lot of developers who like to have their screens in portrait mode,
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:58.400]   right? Because they get the longest scroll in their code.
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:28:59.840]   How did we not know about this?
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.200]   That's what puzzles me.
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:02.480]   They tweeted about it today.
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:03.760]   And I was like, what?
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.880]   I tried it on my Pixel.
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:05.520]   I was like, what?
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.480]   Avid reader press control shift refresh.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:10.000]   So watch how that would be good.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.680]   It's particularly good on the Pixel because it's got the touch screen.
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:13.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.160]   Because because typing like that doesn't really work so well,
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.080]   but you do, you know, scrolling works.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.840]   One other quick thing that I'm kind of excited about.
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:25.440]   Hold on. Kevin say something.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.160]   I don't know if you can hear him.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.280]   What do you say, Kevin?
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:27.760]   Oh, sorry.
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:29.040]   If you're looking at something inappropriate,
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:32.800]   you can then use the keyboard as your shield to make sure the person on the train next to you
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.840]   can see what you're looking at.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.120]   It's upside down.
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:35.600]   Right.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:37.760]   Just a tip for you commuters.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:40.720]   Okay.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:41.840]   I had that problem lately.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:45.600]   I've been watching shows on the path train coming back on my Nexus 7.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:51.600]   And, you know, just kind of cable shows, but she hit the sex scene.
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.760]   And they're not, you know, not even X rated,
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.200]   but you kind of feel a little awkward.
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:55.840]   Yeah.
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:56.640]   Next to you.
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:59.680]   But I had to do a twice on one train ride the other day.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:00.160]   Banne.
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:00.640]   The girls.
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:02.480]   Something else.
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:05.120]   So this is where you need the OK just ripped.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.400]   And just sit there on the path.
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:06.720]   That's right.
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:11.600]   They still can hear you go.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:12.000]   Whoa.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:19.280]   Jeff, did you have a number you'd like to share?
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.480]   Gina has something else I think.
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:21.120]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:22.160]   That's okay.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:22.640]   I had one.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:23.920]   Oh, this one's good.
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:24.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:25.520]   It's pretty good.
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:28.960]   So last pass, which I know Leo, at least you know him.
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.480]   Oh, you too, Kevin.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:30.880]   Just see.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:34.960]   There they're auto log in to Android apps.
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:37.760]   And on the browser on Android just got way, way better.
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:40.720]   Like it now the app, if you're subscribed to premium,
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:43.120]   which is like 12 bucks a year, it's literally like a dollar a month.
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:44.400]   Completely worth it.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:49.520]   It will auto fill your username and password into apps and into your browser on Android.
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:52.240]   In the latest update, you have to enable accessibility
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.600]   so that it can do that screen overlay.
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:56.240]   And then it can detect, you know, there's a username and password getting
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:57.440]   just dead and displayed.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.960]   But this is huge.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:00.080]   This is really huge.
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.360]   This started with 3.2.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.440]   That was the thing that was putting me off using it because it wouldn't keep that.
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:08.560]   Well, you just have to open LastPass copy the password based.
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:09.920]   Yeah, but that's like a wow.
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:12.560]   The other way I used to do it when I had a lot of, you know,
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.720]   like a new phone and I had a lot of logins to do to
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:18.480]   install on my apps is you can use the LastPass keyboard.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:19.360]   And then it will do that.
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.200]   LastPass keyboard to do it.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:24.160]   There was a shortcut you could say copy my username and password to clipboard
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:25.920]   and it would show it shade.
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:29.120]   So that was a little faster but kind of insecure because if you left it up there,
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.200]   you know, in your shade or if you left it on your clipboard,
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:32.000]   this is way better.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.400]   Like this is how LastPass works in the browser.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:34.720]   Right.
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:37.200]   And which is the best way.
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.320]   So I'm excited about that.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.440]   I just want to mention that.
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:42.160]   It can't happen on iOS because Apple won't give them access.
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.360]   And it's optional too.
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.520]   It comes up and it says fill with LastPass.
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:47.920]   LastPass can help you fill logins in other Android apps.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.040]   Would you like to enable this feature?
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:52.880]   So it's not like LastPass is going to start throwing your password on the screen every
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:53.840]   chance it gets.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:54.320]   Very nice.
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.480]   Ooh.
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:59.600]   Just checking myself.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:02.720]   And now it's time for Jeff's number of the week.
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:04.400]   Well, so I like this one.
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:10.320]   In recode, the Bay Area Council surveyed 500 San Francisco residents and they found that
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:14.800]   in this survey, people are just fine with the buses and with Google.
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:15.680]   Oh, really?
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:19.120]   72% had strong or somewhat favorable reviews of tech workers.
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:23.760]   57% had strong or somewhat favorable views of employee shuttle buses.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:28.240]   And 67% said that allowing them to pick up and drop off a limited number of bus stops
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.760]   is just fine.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:30.640]   Thank you very much.
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:37.920]   Well, we knew that it was just a small group of people who I make a point.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:41.280]   I mean, it's very expensive to buy a house in San Francisco.
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:42.400]   But it always has been.
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:43.520]   That's why I live in the middle of the month.
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:44.480]   Would you prefer Detroit?
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.520]   I mean, you know, right.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:46.960]   Good point.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:49.600]   Let's start with Kevin Purdy.
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:50.640]   You got a pick or something like this?
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:52.000]   You'll be a buffalo for that matter.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.200]   Would you rather be in Buffalo?
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:53.760]   Not right now.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:54.800]   Oh, boy.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:55.120]   Wow.
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:56.000]   I have to put up with this.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.120]   I'm not right now.
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:57.760]   Roll me.
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:58.720]   Is it snowing?
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:01.280]   No, it's not warm.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:02.000]   I will say that.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.520]   There's some.
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:05.360]   You can actually see it on my pale face.
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:09.920]   So earlier you mentioned that Google or do you mention that in the change law?
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:15.120]   Like Google now has the the visual promotions tab so that you can see
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:22.480]   little visual previews of your mail as you put it, you know, your desired spam mail.
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:27.120]   And it reminded me that there's a really cool startup that's been doing this kind of like
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.440]   visual inbox thing for a while called unroll me.
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:35.920]   It's unroll.me and you can go there and it totally does require, you know, a Gmail
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:40.240]   permissions where you get you give them access to your Gmail inbox.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.400]   That's going to be a, you know, full stop for some people.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:48.560]   But if, you know, if you are really fed up with all the email you get, you can start using unroll me.
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:54.640]   And one of the things it does is it batches all your email into kind of subscribe, you know,
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:56.000]   don't want roll it all up.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.400]   The roll up though, the emails you send to it to batch all into one big email,
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:06.000]   they arrive as these little thumbnail previews of the top of the email, just like what Google did there.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.640]   So whenever I see something like that, where a big company takes something that seems like
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:15.600]   something I've seen before, I always like to just point out that there is a, you know,
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.840]   some have trot, trot of that path before.
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:23.120]   So if you are both inundated with email like we all are and you're interested in that kind of like
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:26.880]   quick heads up thumbnail preview of your email, try unroll me.
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:27.760]   It's a really cool service.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:32.560]   All right, now I have to turn on all mail in my iMac.
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:33.360]   That scares me.
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:34.480]   All right.
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:36.720]   You like I said, let's try it again.
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:42.080]   But I do like the idea of getting out of all of these. Most of my mail now is that stuff.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:45.520]   Is that bacon, the spam that you want?
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:48.560]   Yes, spam I maybe want it or at one point signed up for
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:50.160]   spam.
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:51.920]   They could argue it's okay to send you.
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:53.040]   Yeah.
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:54.960]   Because Google does a great job stopping the spam.
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:56.880]   They just not great at the bacon.
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:59.040]   Good.
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.080]   I'm running it right now.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.680]   Thank you for.
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:06.240]   I've been using it for a while and you can see like some of them that it'll show a nice little
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:10.720]   preview of what the unsubscribe the night attack.
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:12.640]   Well, I didn't unsubscribe.
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:13.520]   I rolled it up.
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:18.800]   So now it'll come in and I've been doing it for a little while now.
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:24.720]   And it is one of the nicest things is that it'll show you all the lists you're subscribed to
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:28.480]   and you can have an unsubscribe option, which you're just like,
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.680]   that was seven years ago.
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:30.880]   A lot of this stuff is that.
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:31.440]   Subscribe to that.
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:34.640]   I still don't want a Ruby language mailing list that I really don't need
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.280]   to find the bugs in Ruby anymore.
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:39.440]   Kevin, do you have anything Kevin Marks?
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:40.640]   Do you have anything you want to thank you, Kevin?
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:41.040]   Pretty much.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:44.960]   Well, I've got a couple of updates on last week's thing.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:49.040]   So 2048 has gone on to take over the world and destroy everyone's productivity.
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:53.440]   But the fun thing is because it's open source, there are some other silly ones.
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:59.360]   So there's the number one version, which so do you know, do you get the reference here?
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:00.880]   Number Wang.
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.480]   So play this and see what happens.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:05.440]   When Kevin Marks says, do you get the reference here?
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:07.280]   Almost always no.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.560]   Odds are no.
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:12.800]   So, so nump is a British comedy show.
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:13.360]   I'm so lost.
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:17.360]   So basically, it randomizes the numbers.
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:18.880]   It's randomizing the numbers.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:22.240]   Oh, this is very frustrating, but it seems to-
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:23.120]   This is the colors.
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.120]   So you have to do it by color.
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:25.920]   Oh, it's by color.
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:26.800]   Well, I can do that.
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:29.120]   Well, except that the yellows are the same.
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:31.200]   So once you get to the high numbers, you can't play anymore.
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:34.640]   Yeah, because there are some where the numbers are the same for different numbers.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:35.920]   Yes.
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:37.120]   So number Wanging.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:43.440]   So number Wang is a parody of TV game shows done by Mitchell and Webb,
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.520]   where they just look the video up on YouTube.
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:50.640]   You probably should play into the show where they have this incomprehensible TV show.
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:54.480]   People shout numbers out and they say, that's number Wang giving points.
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:57.280]   It's just made up.
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.720]   It's just a Dada game show.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:00.800]   But very funny.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:04.400]   And so as you play this every once in a while, it shouts, that's number Wanging.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:04.720]   Yes.
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:07.200]   So the fun thing to do is-
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:08.480]   I'm still so lost.
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:10.240]   Actually-
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:10.720]   It was pretty good.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:14.880]   This is a good one to play on the bus or train when somebody, you know,
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:15.840]   they say, what are you playing?
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.520]   Oh, I'm playing number Wang.
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:19.600]   How do you play?
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.040]   Well, just can't you tell?
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:21.760]   It's obvious.
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.320]   Just watching.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:25.120]   So most of the time we said he was doing this in the break room.
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:27.120]   It's cool to troll his friends who said just-
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.160]   Definitely a troll.
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.200]   And they were like, what?
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.440]   I know what I'm doing.
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:32.960]   Some of the win numbers come out backwards.
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:33.920]   That's what's really fun.
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:34.240]   Yes.
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:35.840]   You go backwards, you get square roots.
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:37.600]   Okay.
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:39.920]   So it's just racially-
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:43.040]   To even understand this, besides the fact they have to understand British-
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:47.520]   A British game show parody, you also have to know about 2048,
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.360]   which we talked about in last week's episode.
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:53.120]   So we're going to pause the show now while you go and watch last week's episode
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:56.400]   and some YouTube number Wangs and we'll be back in an hour.
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:56.960]   And then there's-
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.560]   I'd like to give people some time to look up.
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:02.320]   And then there's the next 2048 variant,
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:04.160]   which is the 2048 meta edition.
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:06.400]   So in this game-
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.160]   You start out with 2048.
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:11.200]   That's the doctor who, and then you get the doge one,
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:13.520]   and then you keep adding things and you get-
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:14.880]   It's all the other ones.
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:18.080]   So the other variants of 2048 appearing as bits of 2048.
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:19.520]   This is actually almost completely downplayable,
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:20.400]   because three of them are the same.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:21.040]   But-
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:22.240]   This is fascinating.
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:24.000]   Look, but I'm just loving-
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:29.360]   I haven't seen an open source game take off in this way before.
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.680]   That's the piece for me that's amusing about this,
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:32.400]   is that everyone's going,
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:34.240]   "Oh, I can mix this up with that and mix it up with that."
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:34.480]   And-
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:36.080]   Is it because it's so easy to write?
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:38.320]   It's open source.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:38.960]   It's already written.
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:41.200]   So people are just walking off the-
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:41.680]   Okay.
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:43.040]   ... from the version of 2048.
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:47.200]   But also there are now 20 versions for Android and for iOS as well.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:47.840]   Right, right.
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:48.560]   You can put it into the apps.
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.720]   Yeah, there's an infinite app store collection.
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:51.680]   And then there's everyone saying,
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:53.120]   "Oh, it's just a rip off of threes."
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:53.760]   And it's like,
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:56.240]   "Well, yes, but space in valium was a rip off of breakout.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:56.880]   What's your point?"
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.560]   You know, there's a fact that they made it into something different
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.760]   and that is fun.
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.280]   It's interesting to watch.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:04.000]   So-
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.080]   It's only subtly different than the threes.
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:10.560]   But that's the point, but it's a refinement.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:11.920]   It's actually more fun to play than threes.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:12.960]   It is more fun, I think.
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:15.360]   But Lisa, who's a master at threes, won't play it.
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:16.320]   She says it's ruining-
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.720]   It's like playing badminton if you're a racquetball player.
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:19.920]   It ruins your-
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:22.640]   It probably would ruin you for threes games.
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:23.680]   You just get crossed with threes,
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:25.200]   like, "Why are these things pink and blue again?"
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:25.680]   Right.
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:26.400]   Right.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:30.400]   It seems like the only difference is the way the tiles move,
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.320]   as far as I can tell.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.280]   And I haven't spent a lot-
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:34.080]   Yes.
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:35.840]   The way the tiles move all in one go here,
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.040]   which is actually nicer than threes,
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:39.200]   but also the fact that they're powers of two rather than three
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:41.840]   means that you don't have that or would one, two, three-
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:43.040]   Yeah, it's prettier.
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:43.280]   Yeah.
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:44.560]   Yeah.
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:46.800]   You don't have to seed it with ones and twos.
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.640]   Wow.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:51.040]   So then another update on the-
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:53.440]   Something I also mentioned last week was the Tantex.
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:54.320]   People focused-
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:55.920]   Focused mobile communications-
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:56.400]   Ah, yes.
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:59.040]   Which is part of the indie web staff.
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:39:59.840]   Yes.
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.600]   And he did a post-
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.200]   So we showed you the post of
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:06.160]   trying to put link icons on your home page
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:07.600]   so that people could contact you.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.520]   And he went through and worked out what all the URLs are
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:10.480]   for different ones.
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:11.280]   So this is quite fun.
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:15.280]   So basically you can put these kinds of links on your web page
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:16.240]   that people click them.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:18.640]   It will launch that app and they can have a conversation
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:19.520]   in that particular app.
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:20.880]   So if you-
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.720]   Is there any browser will understand these?
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:24.960]   No, this is particularly focused on mobile.
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.160]   So this is Android and iOS.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:28.960]   Some of them will work with other browser documents,
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:30.640]   which ones we're doing, which ones don't.
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:31.600]   And some of them don't work until-
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:34.480]   Apparently the GTalk thing has been dropped by Google,
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:35.920]   which basically started that.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:39.120]   But if you do SMS, colon, email address,
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:42.880]   both Android and iOS will then open a chat with you
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:45.040]   using either Hangouts or-
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:48.640]   iMessage, which is interesting.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:51.600]   Would you suggest people make a page on their website
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:53.360]   with these links from-
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:54.640]   This is what we're spamming with.
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:58.160]   The idea is that you want to have a contact new page,
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:40:59.840]   but he's saying, well, we wouldn't make a contact new page
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:01.200]   that you can actually contact people on.
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:03.600]   Most people on the phone and they don't want to copy and pay
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:04.400]   something and do that.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:06.400]   How do we do this with-
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.160]   And they don't necessarily want to use email.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.840]   They want to use the chat things that they've got.
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:11.120]   So how can we make that work?
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:12.880]   T-A-N-T-E-K.com.
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:16.080]   URLs for people focused mobile communication.
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:17.200]   I like this idea.
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:23.520]   And there's a homebrew website club tonight in San Francisco
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:24.960]   at Mozilla again, because it's Wednesday.
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:29.600]   So what's the address for that if you want to know more about the homebrew?
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:32.480]   indiewebcamp.com is the best address.
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:35.440]   indiewebcamp.com
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:39.600]   and the homebrew website club, which meets every other Wednesday right after work.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.520]   And since-
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:45.280]   I have one other thing which I kept to last because it's funny,
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:49.200]   but it's also on YouTube so you can edit it out later if in case it blows up.
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:53.120]   I will put the link in the chat.
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:57.280]   All right, I'm going to click the link now and we shall find out more.
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:59.440]   This is a generic brand.
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:00.240]   Oh, I've seen this.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:01.040]   This is awesome.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.040]   Let's end the show.
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:06.880]   Before we do this, I just want to thank you Kevin Marks for being here.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.080]   It's always a great pleasure.
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:11.440]   He is a man who is changing the world even as he speaks.
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:13.280]   And we appreciate your time.
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:14.400]   Kevin Curtis- What about Jeff's number?
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:15.200]   Huh?
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:16.480]   We got a number, didn't we Jeff?
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:18.000]   Yeah, we did.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.240]   The few ones.
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:21.120]   It wasn't memorable.
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:21.280]   Oh, okay.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:25.120]   It was it was a lead into my buffalo joke, remember?
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:26.800]   That's right.
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:29.600]   He didn't mention Habermas or Chipotle, but-
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:30.800]   Wake up here.
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:32.800]   It was just that it was eight.
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:35.680]   It didn't seem like a low number.
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:36.960]   It seemed like such a low ball.
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:37.840]   I apologize.
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:40.640]   Kevin, Kevin had all the numbers we need for the next 10 years.
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:42.320]   Yeah, lots of numbers there.
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:43.040]   Number one.
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:45.120]   Lots of numbers with number Wang.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:48.240]   We want to thank Kevin Purdy for joining us.
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:50.160]   Completeandroidbook.com, right?
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:52.160]   Or actually just thepertband.com.
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.680]   Birdman, just do the pertman.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:57.200]   Like just the pertband and Twitter as Kevin Purdy.
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:42:57.840]   All the way.
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.200]   Great to have you.
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:00.400]   Good luck with the remodel.
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:02.080]   Thank you very much.
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:02.800]   You have a dorsal.
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:03.360]   You're looking nice.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:04.560]   Yeah, and your hair looks great.
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:08.320]   I hope the female programmers just eat you up, eat you alive.
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:11.760]   Yeah, somewhere in between those two.
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:14.800]   [laughter]
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:17.760]   Gina Trapani spends her last show in the basement.
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.920]   We're so sad to say goodbye to mom's basement.
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:22.720]   I wish you all the best.
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:23.120]   Great show.
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:23.680]   And your move.
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:25.200]   Thank you.
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:25.520]   Thank you.
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:26.880]   And I actually have a quick announcement.
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.480]   Think up is open to the public.
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:30.800]   Yeah, we opened up this week.
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:31.600]   Think up.com.
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:33.840]   You should come join us.
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.920]   Everybody, I'll just, you know what, real quickly.
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.760]   That's why we were doing "Oops in the middle of the night."
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:38.960]   Yeah, now we know.
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:40.320]   We're doing "Oops in the middle of the night."
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:40.960]   Exactly.
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:42.400]   Yes, we're like, "RDS."
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.240]   I'll just show you.
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:48.480]   I'll go to leolaport.thinkup.com, which is my think up page.
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:53.040]   And you can see all of the insights you get at people who followed you.
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:56.240]   Matthew Ingram can thank me for more people seeing his tweet,
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:58.640]   450, 1,398 to be.
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:43:59.360]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:00.320]   So it's the intersection.
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:05.840]   It's the, it's the, it's the, because I have, so the shared followers don't count.
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:08.080]   You actually do an intersection on it.
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:09.360]   Wow.
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:10.740]   (mumbling)
[01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:11.840]   - No, and I'm talking about the joint.
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:13.500]   (laughing)
[01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:16.100]   - We found like, "You got a big tweet ear.
[01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:18.040]   "Oh, the petitionists and daylight savings."
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:21.760]   - Yeah, that's still a beloved tweet.
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:24.620]   I don't think we're gonna ever get it, but--
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:26.700]   - Leo, I laughed at the favorite
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:28.460]   that you about the 'Spoke' app from--
[01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:30.380]   - Policy, yeah. - That's up to you Go.
[01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:32.000]   - Yeah, he was a year ago.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.660]   I think it was Dave Morean who said,
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:35.160]   "I have two iPhones."
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:37.960]   Each of them with a custom designed
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:41.120]   one of a kind bespoke app I had built from my assistant.
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:42.200]   (laughing)
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:43.760]   - Always on offense, never on either.
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.560]   (laughing)
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:46.920]   - It was funny even a year later.
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:48.560]   - It's fun, that's what's fun about this.
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:51.080]   Even if you don't, you know, use it for anything else.
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:54.200]   Just going through it is really, really fun.
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:56.680]   See who follows you, see who adds you to lists,
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:58.680]   see what your most popular tweets are,
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:01.400]   how many times you tweeted, things like that.
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:02.520]   It's really great stuff.
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:04.840]   What the best times to tweet are,
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.520]   and it's enough about me.
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:08.600]   My tweets contain the word I mean, mine,
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:10.320]   or myself twice last week.
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.080]   That's six times fewer, I'm getting better,
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:13.880]   thanks to ThinkUp.
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:16.080]   - Nice job. - Yeah, ThinkUp.com.
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:18.400]   Join, and you'll get these kinds of insights yourself.
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:19.240]   - Congrats, Gina. - Thank you.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:20.240]   - That is wonderful. - Thank you.
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:21.840]   - Congratulations. - Thank you.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:24.340]   - You can also follow Gina on Google+
[01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:28.040]   and her blog, which hasn't been posting much lately.
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:29.760]   - Have a post-millow. - For obvious reasons.
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:31.560]   It's a smarter word.org.
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.680]   Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com.
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:35.480]   Professor of Journalism at the City University
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:36.960]   of New York, the author of Public Parts,
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:39.800]   and Gutenberg the Geek, all on Audible,
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.800]   as well as on Amazon and everywhere else.
[01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:43.800]   - That's these dulce-tos.
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:44.960]   - So nice to see you all.
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:45.800]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:48.120]   We do this week in Google at 1 p.m. Pacific,
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:51.440]   when Leo's not playing around with the internet,
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:56.440]   4 p.m. Eastern Time, 21, I'm sorry, 2000 UTC on Twit.tv.
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:58.760]   Please watch live if you can every Wednesday,
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:00.600]   but if you can't, don't worry.
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.600]   On-demand audio and video available after the fact,
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:04.800]   always at Twit.tv/Twig,
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:06.520]   or wherever you get your podcasts.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:07.360]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:08.400]   We'll see you next time.
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:11.680]   Now let's end with this generic brand video.
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:13.680]   Thanks to Kevin Martz.
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:15.040]   Have a great week.
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:15.880]   Bye-bye.
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:22.000]   - We think first of vague words that are synonyms
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.640]   for progress and pair them with footage
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:26.140]   of a high speed train.
[01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:30.840]   Science is doing lots of stuff that may or may not
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:32.680]   have anything to do with us.
[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:36.080]   See how this guide, a lab coat holds up a beaker.
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.640]   That means we do research.
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:40.640]   Here's a picture of DNA.
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:45.640]   There are (beep) people in the world,
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:47.800]   especially in India.
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:50.520]   See how we're part of a global economy?
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:51.360]   (laughs)
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:52.880]   Look at those farmers in China.
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:57.520]   But we also do business in the USA.
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:59.880]   Or want you to think we do.
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:03.280]   Check out this wind energy thing in Indiana.
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:06.280]   And this blue collar guy with dirt on his face.
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:12.360]   Also, we care about the environment loosely.
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:15.560]   Here's some powerful rushing water
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.480]   and people playing trees.
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:21.680]   Our policies could be related to these panoramic views
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:23.520]   of Costa Rica.
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:25.840]   In today's high speed environment,
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:28.400]   stop motion footage of a city at night
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:30.800]   and cars turning quickly.
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:33.680]   Makes you think about doing things efficiently
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:34.880]   and time passing.
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:39.280]   Unless you think we're a faceless entity,
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:41.200]   look at all these attractive people.
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:42.440]   (laughs)
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:45.120]   There's some old talk I haven't.
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:49.240]   And close ups of hands passing canned goods to each other
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:52.080]   in a setting that evokes community service.
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:57.800]   Equality, innovation, honesty and advancement
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:00.120]   are all word teachers from a list.
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:04.200]   Our profits are all inspired.
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:08.160]   Like this guy who's looking up and pointing at a skyscraper.
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:11.760]   Guy, while smiling and explaining something to his child.
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:17.240]   Using a specific ratio of Asian people to black people,
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:19.080]   women to white men.
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:22.520]   We wanna make sure we represent your needs and interests.
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:25.680]   Or at least a version of your skin color in our heads.
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:29.320]   Did we put a baby in here?
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:30.160]   (laughs)
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:32.720]   Or about an ethnic old man who's wrinkled smile
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:35.400]   represents the happiness and wisdom of the poor.
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:37.200]   (laughs)
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:38.040]   Yep.
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:40.280]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:42.440]   (laughs)
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:45.120]   That's an at-for-a-stock footage company.
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:46.440]   That's awesome.
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:48.040]   Oh my God, that's awesome.
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:50.620]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:53.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:55.780]   (upbeat music)
