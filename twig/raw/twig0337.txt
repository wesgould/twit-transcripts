[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.940]   That's all I'm gonna say because Jeff Jarvis is now coming to us from the J school the tau school of journalism in the beautiful
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.980]   Manhattan campus of the City University of New York and look at this studio
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.260]   Wait, wait, he's it's senior. When's this ladies gentlemen? There he is
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.940]   This is so pro Jeff. I can't take it
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.620]   Wow
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.740]   And so tell us a little bit. This was something that you and your dean
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.220]   Sarah Bartlett Sarah Bartlett have been pitching for some time. I think you got some grant money to do it
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.640]   Yes, we did and we are going to become the East Coast outlet for Twit and do a show here coming up in the spring on the New York
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.500]   Tech scene on the Twit Network thanks to
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.420]   Leo and a company and we're very excited and so this is from our studio that we have here behind me is the newsroom
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.420]   It's empty today because classes start on Friday
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.860]   But and we'll fix up lighting and things and do other stuff
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.660]   We wanted to test today whether or not we could have a decent conversation a decent picture and Leo's
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.700]   Ecstatic well you surprised me. I this is I didn't know you were ready
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.700]   And we're using the Comrex live stream is
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.540]   Life-shot which is interesting because this is the public internet much like Skype
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.700]   But we're pouring more bandwidth into about six megabits
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.740]   So as a result a lot of adjustments to get the the latency down
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.380]   So it's it's less than what 200 milliseconds, right? Oh, yeah, it's 140 milliseconds for me to you 200 milliseconds from you to me
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.140]   So the round trip is less than half a second, which is more than adequate for a two-way conversation
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.740]   No more pink Jeff. Well, we'll still get you when you go to your house
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.780]   Yeah, but you look like you so it looks good. You feel like you should be like you should be on meet the presser
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.220]   I don't know Anderson. Where's Anderson Cooper when we need him. This is good
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.380]   This is really great
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.780]   So we thank you Jeff. We appreciate it
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:00.060]   You did a nice thing for us you're back from Davos, but while you're in Davos you reached out to Jonathan Abrams
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.060]   Because we've had such chatter about about AMP on the show and you and Jonathan had some talk about it on Twitter
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.980]   And and we don't want to talk to Jonathan about more than just AMP
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.020]   But this is a chance to get together with Jonathan and I'm a big fan of Nuzzle
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.220]   I visited him there and so let's we can talk to Jonathan
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.620]   Johnny so now the founder and CEO of Nuzzle Jonathan Abrams he is
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.980]   You may know the name it may ring a bell
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.900]   We did a triangulation episode with Jonathan. He is was the founder of Friendster the very first massive
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.180]   Social network and I'll never forget it was still during it was in tech TV days
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.380]   We were doing a tech live
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.780]   On the set and I remember somebody saying
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.220]   Have you seen this thing called Friendster? I think it was cat Schwartz who was my co-host on call for help?
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.380]   What friendster? What's that she said? Oh you add your friends and you talk with them and
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.620]   You know, I don't think we were aware of Facebook at the time
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.460]   I think if it was around it was because this is 2000
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.420]   But what year was that Jonathan?
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.780]   2019-99 2003 2003 that late, okay?
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260]   Well that early only
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:20.540]   Facebook did not exist then but I remember being on tech TV a few times some of the tech TV
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.380]   folks were pretty early I was where
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.020]   In fact, I remember getting on it and it we we talked about it. We brought it down and we couldn't get off
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.940]   It was really exciting and now actually that's true. I think I was on was Sarah Lane and
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.060]   She put it up on the screen and we were having problems with it loading immediately. Yeah, quit power
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.820]   Well like tech TV power which has been translated to it
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.460]   Really cool stuff and I think
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:59.420]   I mean it's clear, you know, you're kind of the John the Baptist of social media you pay for the way for
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.740]   What was to come? I don't think you got beheaded
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.300]   however
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.420]   It was for many of us our first experience and it was a it was a revelation of what social media could be
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.260]   So we owe you a lot. Thank you very much
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.860]   Well, thanks for having me on the show. It's good to see you again and and good to see Jeff again
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.420]   Why didn't you rest on your laurels? I'm sure I mean
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.340]   My space Tom is just hanging out in his mansion
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:38.620]   Sarah, I'm not kidding. Nice guy met him hung out with him and the tray rack live is great. He's but uh, you know, he's done

[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:50.020]   Go really great. Yeah, he's a physicist Stanford
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.880]   This is Tim we've been talking online for a while now, and he said he's gonna be here
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.720]   Let's be a beer. This is before Tinder before Facebook

[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:14.780]   I want to see Jonathan Abrams. I think that was the founder of entry Wow
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:19.580]   Now, okay on your friend's nerve you put single or in a relationship
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.580]   Definitely look you're out there to meet some guys
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.700]   How many friends does the founder of friends? There you are
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.380]   Almost 200 I think the only is two in real life
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.500]   All right, that's enough
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:45.100]   Thank you to whoever found that is friends who's gone though, right? There's no friends to left
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.940]   Well, the funny thing is you know as is often the case with the press
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.020]   They tell the same story to over and over again and
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.660]   Friendster was reported to have
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:02.580]   Died many many many times when it had not it was acquired in 2009
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:08.580]   Then the Asian company that owned it sort of refocused on social gaming
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:14.820]   And the weird thing is very recently they seem to have shut down the site
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:20.820]   So let's see it's like I don't know five six years after they bought it
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:28.260]   And I don't think that got a lot of coverage in the press but the irony is that there had been many
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.300]   times
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:37.700]   In many previous years when it was purported that transter, you know had died or shut down when it had not it went through June of last year
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.620]   But it was the Abe Vagoda of services
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:49.340]   For a well, I already thought it was dead. I was that by the way, I was made a go to rest in peace
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.100]   I'm saying this is the we love a big go ahead. Yeah, he was an internet meme
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:10:01.140]   Well, I started friends in 2002. Yeah, and if it shut down in in 2015
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:08.780]   It's still at 13 years. That's good a long time on on the internet. It's 150 years internet time or something
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.380]   When was that Jeff that you were you were at entertainment weekly?
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:18.300]   So it was a long time ago that people thought a big go ahead was it at people before that and and so a story went through
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:24.080]   buddy of a go to and an editor a top editor put in the late a vagoda and the fact checkers is why we had fact checkers
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.060]   Take that out and said no
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.140]   They've got a and then it went back to the editor again
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.940]   And he said the late a vagoda and it went into print that way and this is my favorite part of the story
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:40.820]   Of course is that the next week a vagoda took out a full-page ad in variety of himself sitting up in a coffin reading people
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.260]   I
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.940]   Think that's convinced convincing a vagoda of course fish from Barney Miller
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.540]   but also before that Tessio from the godfather and
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:56.220]   The meme ended up with a website a vagoda.com where you could go and in fact I went when I saw on Twitter that
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.340]   Mr. Vagoda had passed away. I
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.860]   Went there and it still said he was alive somebody tweeted. I think
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:09.180]   Kedrowski tweeted you had one job and then the site
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:14.640]   And the site went down and it's come back with with a sad
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.640]   That's terrible
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.440]   That's terrible fish sleeps with the fishes
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.480]   Anyway
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.000]   So it's anyway. Thank you for friends. They're I think you did a wonderful job
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Somebody told me that as of 2010 Facebook purchased some of your patents
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.960]   Which is awesome so so after
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:42.740]   Friendster was sold to a company in Asia that company in turn sold all the patents to Facebook for more than they paid to acquire
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:48.520]   Friendster was sort of the final chapter of the bizarre mismanagement of Friendster. So yeah now
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.960]   Facebook owns all the patents
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.540]   Apologies it was Patrick De La Hante in our own office who?
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.960]   Passed along this this tweet you had one job. Can you pull it up?
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:08.760]   Jason are you distracted? Are you busy back there? You doing something? I'm sorry you had one job a big is a bugoda dead calm rest in peace
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:14.100]   I thank you Patrick. I want to give he's he works. He works on our staff. So I want to give him credit
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.900]   For that but enough of the past
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:22.680]   Let's talk about Nuzzle. Did you have stuff in between Jonathan that you worked on?
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.240]   in between Friendster and Nuzzle yeah
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.880]   Yeah, so after friendstrider startup called socializer that was
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.820]   Oh, yeah, he edited it to evite. Yeah, and
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:36.700]   Much much better than evite, but that turns out to be a really horrible market
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:44.960]   So we merged with another player in that space and I was sort of glad to get out of that helping people
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:51.440]   Manage their party invites because that turned out to be a huge a huge headache
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:57.040]   As everybody learned as everybody learned people would call us up and say you've ruined my party
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:03.340]   Nobody's gotten my invitations that we'd look in our database and see that people had received it and they were just lying
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.720]   because
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.720]   It turns out that people
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:14.680]   Tell the host oh no, I didn't get the invitation if they don't just don't want to go right so that yeah, that was that was kind of a
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.840]   frustrating
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.200]   Market and then after that I started founders dead and then Nuzzle
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:26.400]   Founders dead of course great a great place to that's in San Francisco, right? Yep. So I'm
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.600]   Coming at you from the beautiful conference room and in
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.600]   Founders dead
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.000]   Went in here to get some quiet and I'm looking right out the window at
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Selma in San Francisco
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.220]   So founders Dan is a workspace, you know shared workspace, but it was a little controversial because it's also a private club
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:51.460]   Well, I don't think it was controversial, but it's it's also meant to be a bit of a private community
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:57.640]   Controversial only among those who couldn't get in maybe that's better said that well
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:03.440]   I mean, it's not like a country club where we're we're you know excluding people
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.040]   It's really more meant to have been a curated experience because there's a lot of co-working spaces in San Francisco
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.720]   And for the most part, you know
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:16.320]   You walk in with the the check and they'll rent you a desk and we wanted to create something that was a little bit more of a curated community
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:21.760]   Yeah, not to exclude people but really to foster more of a sense of community nice
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.200]   And also it also adds value I think a general assembly
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.720]   Kind of the same thing where you had to compete to get in and when you knew you were in that meant something about you
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.400]   Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.760]   Yeah, I mean if I understand is a pretty unique place. I mean this is you can walk in here and you're gonna see just
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.200]   Sit around or having their meetings are gonna see people like Gavin Newsom
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.080]   Gilpancina
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.080]   Jay Adelson Charles Hudson
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:51.400]   So other people in the industry I think feel like they fit in
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.400]   This is a you know a cool place for them to take a meeting a lot better than go into a Starbucks and
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:02.120]   People can come in here to to meet somebody and then they ended up often bumping into somebody else
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:08.680]   That they haven't seen in a while some other VC or entrepreneur who they're you know really pleased to catch up with so it's you know
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.680]   It's kind of a special community
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:17.720]   But ultimately is it is a shared office space and we've had companies like when Nilo and Docker and
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.240]   Data-sift social cam
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.920]   Caggle also as a company and of course this is where where Nuzzle itself is headquartered nice
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:31.400]   Jason Calicanis was here a couple weeks ago and he said really San Francisco is going to be
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:38.460]   It's the new Florence. It's the new center of the world. I'm sure you Jeff would not agree
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.880]   That's why we're gonna do a new startup scene
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:51.040]   But he but no it he put his money where his mouth is he moved from LA to be in San Francisco
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.400]   Because he and I think he's not far wrong
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.960]   I mean and there is a magic that happens because every because you can have these conversations
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:05.080]   You know because everybody is kind of trying to solve the same problems. I think
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.600]   Definitely yeah
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.560]   Sorry, you're texting is where real businesses real people are
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.240]   Austin and Seattle to
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.800]   Work through 30 inches of snow
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.600]   Well it matters here and our bare feet
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.000]   New York, we're not like you wimps out there take your little fluffy buses down your job
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.480]   I shoveled enough snow in my day. Yeah, what's enough? Are you from New York area, John?
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.120]   Canada Canada
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:45.640]   Yep, so let's talk about Nuzzle because I I have to say there have been out there were others
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.280]   Brad Cross at Google created
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.680]   Another a social news right at the same time
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.240]   News idea and I forgot. I'm sorry, Brad. I forgot the name already
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:04.760]   But it was I you joined it and a few of the others but Nuzzle I think it's very clear
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.680]   You did everything right with Nuzzle and Nuzzle has stands alone now and everybody I know in my business
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:17.760]   Uses Nuzzle. Thank you. Yeah, it's really really good and loves I think I think that what we're doing is unique
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:25.240]   So the interesting thing is people have been building personalized news aggregation tools for a long time
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.840]   There were a lot of things that pre needed silicon, you know this in Silicon Valley
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.120]   And in fact just like some other things I've worked on
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.000]   So the news
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.960]   Personalization and aggregation are one of the things that I think Silicon Valley people like to build over and over again
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.200]   But they're almost always too complicated
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.160]   charismatic that's what Brad Brad's startup was and they pivoted away
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:57.840]   There's some secret sauce you the way Nuzzle works is you sign up using your Twitter or Facebook account you will then link also your
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:03.200]   Other social media accounts is it just still Twitter and Facebook if you got others in there now, too
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.880]   So in November we launched what we call Nuzzle 2.0 and was a huge new release for us
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:14.040]   That now in addition to the experience that you and Jeff use where you log in with Twitter
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:18.160]   And you just by virtual of connecting your graph from Twitter
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.840]   Get automatically personalized relevant news using that
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.000]   As of November the 2.0 brings a new experience for people who don't use Twitter and you can now
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.440]   Go to Nuzzle on iPhone Android or web. I love that
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.080]   You can discover
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.640]   Feeds that other people have created and you can search and you can fade feeds so
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.000]   For example somebody could go and just say okay, I like
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.280]   Jeff Jarvis's feed and I want to get that via email or I want to get that via push
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.720]   Or I want to look at that on the web or I want to have that as a tab in my iPhone or Android app
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.240]   Because Jeff Jarvis he knows how to use Twitter and he's
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.880]   Followed a lot of interesting people and I'm interested in the world of
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.760]   Journalism and online news and Jeff Jarvis's feed is going to be giving me very relevant stuff
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.800]   I'm just going to use that so as of November
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:14.840]   There's a whole new experience around faving feeds discovering feeds searching that is available to people who don't necessarily
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:20.880]   Log in with the social media account. I love it Jeff. Did you notice this Google thinks your your feed is in German?
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.880]   Would you like to translate it?
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.280]   You got to stop posting these foreign language articles, okay?
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:34.080]   German first Spanish next but both of them writing about you is the other Jeff Jarvis. Oh my gosh
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.520]   I like that
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.960]   German German I'm gonna stop following this guy doesn't post in English anymore
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.960]   This is because you were at Davos
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.760]   Because what Jonathan it must resume down in German and then pick German k priority
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.520]   So this is this is actually not Jeff's feed. This is a search result. Oh
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:57.560]   So you're looking so at the top is a search result showing Jeff's feed yeah below that are
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:05.480]   Stories that have the word jotter. That's why it says stories. I guess I get it. Okay, so this could be also used as a way to
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.200]   search for topics
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.720]   Absolutely. Oh interesting right and you can get feeds of topics
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:17.400]   So I've talked to some news organizations saying that that you could use Nuzzle to say that if you want to have a feed of all of the
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.720]   You know Cleveland Browns stuff
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.880]   You can use Nuzzle because basically people have picked the people who picked the good stuff, right?
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:30.120]   Absolutely, and I think ultimately Nuzzle is moving in the direction of being more than just a
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.320]   News aggregation app that people are using for their own value which people you know use it that way and love it
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:43.280]   But we're I think evolving beyond that to also being a platform where people can create feeds and
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.680]   We think that that's a very sort of interesting
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.200]   Thing we've created a few hundred feeds to showcase the 2.0
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   functionality we launched in November, but ultimately we think in the long run the feeds will be created by media companies and experts and
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.480]   organizations and and nonprofits and and and
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.760]   you know all sorts of
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:11.360]   People or companies that have an interest in certain topic and they can use Nuzzle to create feeds on those topics or around a specific community
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.480]   You know I
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:19.640]   Planchize because I've been completely misusing us all this time. I just I just thought it was a great stream
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:24.080]   Well partly it's testament to the fact that you do that basic core functionality so well
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.880]   I've never looked beyond the three tabs news from your friends news from friends of friends
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.480]   They're gonna people who are gonna use Nuzzle in different ways
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:38.160]   Yeah, the 2.0 experience we only launched that two months ago, so that that's new so you're not that far behind
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.800]   But you know you logged in with your Twitter account and therefore
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.800]   You can use Nuzzle just the way you've been using it
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.400]   It's delivering great value to you
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:52.080]   but we also wanted to move in the direction of supporting people who aren't necessarily Twitter power users and and
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:57.000]   You know those kind of people perhaps somebody which Twitter would like to do too, right?
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.440]   Sure, and so somebody maybe doesn't use Twitter
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:06.480]   But as a fan of Leo's and is interested in Leo's world. Maybe they will fave Leo's
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.960]   Feed in the app or maybe they'll subscribe to Leo's Nuzzle newsletter
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.280]   So that is a way that we can extend the power of social
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.560]   curation
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:24.680]   To a broader audience so that everybody can can benefit from that so that but that you know that stuff is relatively
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:30.120]   Relatively new like I said the 2.0 launch was in November just a week before Thanksgiving
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:38.080]   And it was cool about this is it leverages work that I've done on other social sites. I don't really have to really do anything
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.200]   because
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.960]   the last thing anybody wants is another pit site where you have to make lists and
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.360]   And create content. It's like flip board is always saying would you like to make a magazine?
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.240]   No, I don't I don't want to make a magazine. I just want to read no stories
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.440]   Yeah, one of our fundamental philosophies for Nuzzle was that people shouldn't have to do work
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:04.480]   We didn't want to say okay come to Nuzzle and then enter a list of topics you're interested in and we didn't want people to have to train it
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:09.680]   By looking at irrelevant content before we start delivering relevant content
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.520]   We just didn't believe that people want to do those kind of things
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:19.800]   So we started off by tapping into your existing social graphs to provide instantly relevant content with no work
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:26.880]   Now what we're trying to do is figure out ways that other people can also get that power of social creation
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:32.320]   So while most people don't have to do any work and create a list if a small number of people do create a list
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.760]   Nuzzle can turn that into something that'll that then you know million other people can just consume
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:43.080]   Without them having to do any work. So for example mark and recent created an economics
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:49.640]   Twitter list that is automatically turned by Nuzzle into a newsfeed of really interesting economics news in any
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.040]   world because I follow that right for that and
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:57.800]   You know and they don't have to do any work if they can just say I want to mention economics
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.520]   They subscribe to that. They're doing no work. They're just gonna get good content
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.860]   And how do I find so I've got a I've got a media Twitter media wonks list
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.120]   So the same thing exists there that it already exists in Nuzzle, right?
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.880]   It should so as of November when we added search
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:19.840]   So now if you go to Nuzzle on via Android iPhone or web and you search for media wonks
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.840]   Hopefully that will pop up
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:27.680]   It's worked for me because I see all these lists that my feeds I've created which I never created but it pulled those from Twitter
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.240]   Right and like I said, you know in the long run we'd like
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.840]   organizations to to create great feeds
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:41.800]   so it could be a journalism school it could be ESPN it could be
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.760]   Hillary Clinton campaign it could be
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.560]   Disney it could be anybody
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:55.920]   You know people can use this to create feeds on topics or on communities it feels like you've learned a lot from your previous startups about
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:01.320]   How to build features in how to almost in a way go slow and
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:08.160]   Build thoughtfully. That's what it feels like to me. Would you agree? Is that kind of what you've been thinking about? Well?
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:15.400]   Hopefully you learn something as an entrepreneur from from project to project. I sure hope so because
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.920]   You know you tend to make new mistakes
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.560]   So if you're making the old mistakes - that's really gonna be difficult
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:29.160]   the very first company I started you may recall was called hot links and it was sort of like delicious but several years before delicious and
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.960]   I did learn something. This was back during the dot company
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:38.480]   I did learn that people do not want to do work and that regular people don't organize their stuff regular people
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.760]   Just have every photo they've ever been sent on their desktop and all their emails and one hot mail folder
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.840]   And they don't really organize things
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:50.560]   So because we had this vision that people were gonna take their bookmarks and favorites from Netscape and Internet Explorer and turn them into these wonderful
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.520]   Yahoo style directories that they would share with people and we just found that most people didn't really have their stuff organized
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.840]   And so the idea of people sharing links with each other was a fantastic idea
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.000]   But doing it as bookmarking was a little bit too nerdy
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.840]   So I think since then I tried to you know realize that I had to make things simpler and then with Friendster
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.520]   It was pretty simple and and and to this day
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:19.640]   You know saying is this person your friend? Yes? No on Facebook is not perfect because it's it's it's a little clumsy
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.160]   And it lacks a little nuance
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:27.480]   But every person who copied Friendster and tried to make it more complicated and tried to have you rate your friends and categories
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.960]   And all the things that didn't work so this simple approach was the one that worked
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.560]   So and I've extended that now into Nuzzle like I said, I think most
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.200]   previous
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:46.800]   Personalization aggregation projects that have come out of Silicon Valley have been really complicated and we've tried to create something that is that is really simple
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:52.880]   And that's just I think completely informs everything we've done with Nuzzle and it's a very very different product
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:58.120]   And it's a very different I think vision we're trying to save people time and give you just the stuff you need to know about
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.360]   We're not trying to say
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.360]   You know spend tons of time
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.920]   Customizing it and then spend five hours a day in Nuzzle
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:11.760]   We're trying to say like use this to just get the stuff you really need to know just solve your overload
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:18.360]   So simplicity has been a big part of it. But of course creating a simple product is actually not simple. It's actually really hard
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.880]   We're talking with Jonathan Abrams
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.000]   It's this week in Google not normally an interview show
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.960]   But it's hard not to talk to Jonathan that like an interview because that you want to know more especially with a product that
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.960]   I use day in day out and apparently know nothing about
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:39.960]   But in a way that's you've been you've been using it fine. I actually checked but what's great is
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:46.600]   And I think Twitter could learn from this is that the out of the box experience is fabulous
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:53.520]   And you don't you know and then I guess if you're motivated you could press the discover button and you know start to dig a little bit deeper
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.600]   If anything you made it too good out of the box
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.840]   There's no incentive to go any farther well the
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.040]   Features yet, which only launched a couple of
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:12.480]   It's not really a problem. Yeah, so I mean Leo you're using Nuzzle around four to five days a week week after week after week after week
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:19.720]   That's pretty good. I don't think we'd say that we're disappointed in that level of usage. I don't use it on my days off. That's all
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:24.960]   Every other day. I'm always that's one of my news beat checks. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Yeah, Jeff
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.280]   No problem. Let me ask you an unfair question. What would you do if you own Twitter? Oh?
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:35.000]   Wait a minute. Hold on think about it. I'm gonna give you a minute to think about it because that is a great question
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.960]   And I like it hold on hold on hold on this is time for a commercial. We're going to pay for that's a tease
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:50.040]   Jonathan Abrams here Jeff Jarvis at his brand new studio. We're still working out some of the bugs, but I think it looks awfully good
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:57.920]   It's pretty darn impressive the lighting is perfect. You obviously have professional gaffers there at oh we have professionals
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:04.040]   Crazy, yes, they run to TV and run the studio and they're great and you're done
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.280]   I'm a mic and you're really doing you're actually living quite
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.160]   At large there. It looks fabulous. Thank you to all of the people there
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:18.640]   Accuning for setting that up. Thanks to Sarah the Dean of the is it tower toe or how do you pronounce that school?
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:24.960]   town night town night town night school now's cow cow town night school of journalism, which is
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:30.720]   Don't the notice the townite center at the CUNY graduate school of journalism. Just to be I knew I'd get it wrong
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.920]   No, let's get it right townite center at the CUNY school of journalism

[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:28.840]   Slash twig you're listening to this week in Google. I'm Leo Laport with Jonathan Abrams of Nuzzle
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:35.440]   Jeff Jarvis has all started because we were talking about amp as we have many times on this show Jonathan heard the show
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:40.960]   We said Leo you got some things wrong. I we went back and forth a little bit
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:45.160]   And then Jeff said well, we got to get Jonathan on the show to talk about it
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:51.640]   Jonathan's interest is because at Nuzzle and as we mentioned when we were talking about amp is one of the first places you could see
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.240]   Googles
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.840]   Accelerated what does the M stand for?
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.480]   pages
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:07.120]   Accelerated mobile pages in the real world and in fact amp is about to launch for real in February
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.840]   But somehow Jonathan has a inside track
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:17.960]   Because it's an open right Jonathan. It's just an open standard. So you just started using it right you found content that fits and you implemented
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:23.880]   Well, you know once Facebook announced instant articles we thought
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:33.600]   Having news stories load really quickly on mobile phones instead of being awful and slow sounds great. Yep
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.260]   But it shouldn't just be fast in Facebook. It should be fast in
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:43.520]   Nuzzle linked in Twitter Gmail pocket. It should be you know, that sounds great, but that should work in everything. So
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.480]   the idea that
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:54.800]   Publishers should publish into proprietary Nuzzle CMS not really realistic since we're not a giant company yet like
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:01.840]   Apple or Facebook, but even if we were a Nuzzle supports the long tail we have users all over the world
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:09.640]   So even though we haven't translated our app outside of English. We have people who use it in all these countries. They're seeing
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:14.600]   Content from other countries. I mean we were we're not you know
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.120]   Nuzzle would not work if it only worked with like the top 10 newspapers and like that
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:23.240]   So there so no so supports a long tail of content whatever the people that you follow
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:29.840]   Are sharing that's what is being shown to you. So it really has to be an open web approach
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.600]   So we came up with an idea of something
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:39.840]   analysis to Facebook instant articles, but based on HTML and HP where there'd be a meta tag and would point to an alternate
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:46.600]   Version that you just load the HTTP and any compliant client could just discover it. Oh, so you're kind of you were ready for this
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.440]   We were you were chapping at the bit for this
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:58.640]   So yes, so we we had an idea that because of you know the way Nuzzle really is in some ways open itself
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.640]   It had to be
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:08.200]   Something very similar to amp then we heard from some people about amp and we we said well
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.360]   That's pretty much exactly what we had been imagining ourselves
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:16.120]   Nuzzle of course not nearly has the resources of Google
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:22.480]   So the fact that Google was already working with all these publishers on something that was pretty much what you know
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.320]   We had thought we needed was it was great happy coincidence
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:33.120]   So then we got involved in the Nuzzle. I mean the AMP project prior to the I guess the unveiling of it and
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.960]   We said you know, we're sort of a pretty nimble
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:43.160]   You know technical startup team we can just have our Android and iPhone app
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:49.820]   Supporting this the minute that the project has unveiled and we did that because some of the newspapers
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:54.800]   That were early partners on the publishing side. We're already publishing AMP pages
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:02.480]   We we started coding it up and it worked. So as of the day. I forget when that was it was a few months ago
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:10.880]   Since September, I can't remember exactly when it was but as it's a day. Yeah, so the AMP project was unveiled by Google
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:17.440]   And there were five or six tech partners and it was like Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:23.640]   WordPress huge multi-billion dollar companies in Nuzzle and we were the only ones, you know, the only teen little startup
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:28.480]   Included that early, but we were also the I think the only ones that actually as of that moment were
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:34.760]   Displaying AMP content live in our app. So we're we've already had it actually working
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:38.440]   Since the day the project was unveiled and we've been super
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.360]   excited to be part of it and
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:45.080]   We're still in in further talks with Google about how to
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:50.280]   Use more of Google's technologies that are related to AMP. So we
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.360]   Go ahead
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.360]   So I think the next stage is
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.120]   using a Google's cache
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:04.960]   Yes, right which they've offered and basically they become your CDN for free if you use AMP content, right?
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.560]   sort of
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.440]   Yeah, sort of I told the story on the show here when I came back from the
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.440]   Google news guys in Helsinki where where
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:21.080]   Internet articles have just been announced and I was among those who said loudly Google you should do an open source version of this
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:24.840]   And I wrote about it Jonathan contacted me immediately and said we're working on something like that
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.800]   Let's get people together and I didn't think Google was gonna do it at first and by God
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:34.040]   They turned around and they did it and they did it and I think nine months which which even though Google's tons of resources for a big
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:37.520]   Huge company that was fast and then Jonathan was that as he said that day
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.880]   It's how I can demonstrate amped people around the world is to show them nuzzle
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.440]   Yeah, so we were thrilled to be to be part of it
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:49.640]   And you know, it's only I think gonna get even better as some of the additional technologies come online
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:56.000]   So we did you work at all with Google on what amp ended up being did you did they consult?
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:05.040]   You know, I think most of the consultation so far was with publishers because the publishers were the ones that yes
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:12.560]   You know really had to make a lot of changes on their end to how they're doing things and then figure out ways to make sure that all of their needs
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:18.040]   Their needs for tracking and analytics and revenue and all those kind of things were being were being supported
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.240]   So I think that's logically been the big focus of it
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.000]   In terms of the client side
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.600]   That's lagging behind like you know, Google themselves is I think gonna start integrating this in I think it's February
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:39.520]   And I think Pinterest and Twitter linked in you know still are it's coming up. So we were we were you know pretty quick on that side
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.360]   But
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.600]   For the most part there wasn't really a lot of changes that we needed to be honest
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.600]   Google has now given us
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.280]   API and asked for our feedback about that and that's something we're looking at right now
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.520]   The publishers are worried
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.680]   Some of them were worried about paywalls and how to handle that I the day after the last show last Thursday
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:08.560]   There was a meeting of the founding publishers and Google the digital news initiative where this this really kind of launched
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:14.680]   A year ago at Davos and so this is a progress support where we are and and it's really moved moved well
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.920]   And everybody's pretty excited about where this is
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:25.120]   So I'll bring up. Well first of all, let me demonstrate it. So just so we can see the value of it
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:31.160]   So this is Nuzzle on Android, which by the way is that you did on iOS first you did it on Android
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.480]   It's it's just great
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:37.720]   I usually do it on the web because I'm sitting down at breakfast going through news stories before our day begins
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:42.480]   But it's it's if I ever have to read news on my mobile. It's a really great way to do it
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.240]   Now I won't see it on the web right I won't see app on the web. I'll only see it on my mobile. Is that right?
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:53.520]   For in certainly Nuzzle were only showing it in our Android and iPhone apps it only makes sense
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.040]   Well, it doesn't only make sense, but it makes most sense of mobile environment. Yeah
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:03.060]   But but typically on a desktop you're connected to a fast internet connection. You're not gonna see the difference
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:09.560]   In fact here you go. It's gonna Google is gonna show AMP content only on mobile. Okay. It's not necessarily within an app
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.960]   I think if you go to Google search within a browser on that's right. They're gonna show it's right
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:19.800]   So what Nuzzle does with AMP content in mobile browsers. That's an open issue
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:25.480]   So which public users are probably using our Android or iPhone app which publishers should I open?
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.680]   How many of these are amped the times is amped right? I think so. Yeah, they should be
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:35.000]   It should flash a lightning bolt. Let's see if it flashes a lightning bolt
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.880]   Didn't
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:43.880]   Try the Guardian try Washington Post Guardian or the post. Let's see if I can find one of those in my
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:49.840]   Feed here. Let's do another times article. Yeah. Do you saw that area? Okay, and so
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:56.480]   Paywall but that's an interesting thing. The amp actually worked hard to make sure paywalls were honored
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.560]   Even through a cache I guess right
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.440]   Well, we're currently not using the Google cache yet. Oh, okay
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:07.620]   Okay, so you're supporting the paywall then some insight you know amp
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:13.800]   Making the mobile content load quick and paywalls are really orthogonal issues. I see okay
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.640]   The paywall is just gonna work. I'll log into my times account in a second
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:21.600]   I just I don't know why it's not logged in here. I'm trying to find something that is amped because they log you out
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:28.040]   Regular they seem to don't they peeves me. Yeah, I seem to log well, you know, I can log in pretty quick
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:32.120]   Let me let me try it again. You know what they didn't require a login for
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.400]   the
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.440]   public
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:42.080]   Editors post so I'm thinking they want the public to see that and that was also not and I think blogs
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:46.240]   There's no login for blogs. That's what it is. Okay, and they didn't amp blogs apparently. Yeah
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.520]   So you get a lightning bolt that loads faster
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.800]   I'm not one of those people who knows is a big difference
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.880]   Because I'm usually on a fast connection
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:05.920]   And the sites I'm going to or not the junked up sites that have lots of crappy ads, but those are probably not amped anyway
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:11.520]   Well, people have definitely noticed the difference. I mean, yeah people we've had people tweet like oh my god
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.960]   It's so much faster and the funny thing is we're not yet doing the caching or
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:21.440]   Pre-fetch which would be probably enabled by using the caching
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.080]   so even with just
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:29.780]   Avoiding loading hundreds of megabytes of multiple redundant
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.800]   JavaScript libraries just that part alone
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.460]   People absolutely have noticed the speed difference and and tweeted about it
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:44.680]   It's kind of weird because the button doesn't work for login. I don't know why but maybe that's a side effective
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.240]   Trying to run this through an amp
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.760]   system
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.920]   So here's my issues. It looks like
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:58.280]   New York Times has changed their paywall a little bit. Yeah, just just very recently right so it's not been tested
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.720]   So here's kind of my issue
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.960]   The thing that concerns me is
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:07.700]   You know when I hear that image tags are different Google has specified a new way of doing image tags
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:14.200]   JavaScript is only allowed if it's Google allows it and certain snippets are allowed not and many many many more or not
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.400]   Well, everything else is not
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.760]   it is I
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:24.120]   Understand the desire to do this and the value of it for users
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.440]   but I worry that Google has invented a new kind of
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.640]   HTML without in the involvement of standards bodies
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.320]   just by talking to publishers
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.880]   that
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.800]   Is an effect and this is what I said in the tweet forking?
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:43.520]   The web so I wanted to give you a chance a to tell me what I got wrong
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.960]   Because that was your initial tweet and be is that not the case I?
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.080]   Don't think it's the case because
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:57.320]   It's not really a fork of the web and the reality is amp is the web it is a alternate
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.960]   HTML
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.400]   file
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.080]   still HTML still loaded vhdp and
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:08.320]   and essentially
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:13.160]   It's just trying to standardize things more so instead of all these different publishers
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:21.440]   I mean their own set of redundant bloated JavaScript libraries Google's saying here is a a single runtime that we're gonna try to make
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:28.720]   Solve all these needs and then address the bloat problem that's been causing so much problems for people on
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.000]   their mobile devices and
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.680]   It is an open project. I mean there's a github repo
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:39.480]   and and whether you're on the client side or the publisher side you can go and
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:45.080]   Contribute and talking about that whether someday it becomes part of a standard thing. I don't know
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.760]   I doubt Google would be opposed to that but even now
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:54.960]   You know it really is more open than any of alternatives and the alternatives are some of these closed platforms
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.320]   from some of these other big companies and
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:04.360]   You know the reality is if Nuzzle wanted to say okay publishers already publishing their content for Apple News or Facebook and
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:08.480]   articles great. Let's just show that in Nuzzle. We can't do that
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:12.480]   So that that that to me is really not open
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:16.360]   And you know whereas AMP is something that we were able to be
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.960]   part of
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:25.120]   And if publishers publish their stuff in AMP if somebody in Croatia publish something in the app and then and then you know
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:27.120]   Some startup in New York build some new
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:33.360]   app that supports AMP, you know two companies that everyone heard of it's just gonna work so that you know that
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:37.360]   That's true of any fork as soon as somebody supports it, but look what's prohibited
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.560]   Well, but they all let me try they all let me try this on you
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:44.760]   I think the difference is that a fork would mean that you that you'd be cut out and you couldn't use it
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.040]   No, no, that's not what a fork means a
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:54.940]   Fork means that you take some so it would fork HTML that you have a standard
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:59.780]   And then you've decided Google's decided that instead of image will use AMP. It's not a subset. It's a replacement
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:08.600]   It's not really HTML HTML 4.0. I mean that was kind of like a fork of HTML, but that was W3C proposed
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:14.840]   That was through a standards body the HTML has evolved. I don't I don't have a problem with it evolving
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.040]   But the reality is
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:22.840]   Microsoft and Netscape and all those companies had did fork HTML and added proprietary things that eventually
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:27.080]   Back into standards in this case Google's not even doing that in this case
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:33.600]   AMP is really simply just an HTML page. It is an it is a you know, here's a JavaScript
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:39.240]   Library that you can run in a standard browser in a standard HTML page
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.240]   Instead of a proprietary
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:47.120]   JavaScript library from the publisher or one from all these different analytics and ad companies
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:52.640]   It's a it's a it's a standard one, but it's still it's still it's still JavaScript running on an HTML page
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.960]   It's not really a new kind of HTML really
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:59.760]   Well, you can't use IMG you have to use AMP - IMG you can't use
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:05.680]   Object peram applet embed form prohibited prohibited you use whatever you want to use
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:08.700]   But it won't be an app page. It's not gonna be as fast. No won't be an
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.720]   Yes, you can do whatever you want, but it's not an end page, but being an ampey
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:19.480]   Yeah, but here's where it becomes a problem and remember this is the idea is that the ampey is a alternative version of something that
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:25.240]   Exists in regular HTML alternative version that is from Google and is promoted in
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.600]   Google search results
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:34.920]   That's not to me the same favor ampe per se they don't favor ampe per se they do favor speed and ampe is fast
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.120]   But they favor ampe per se
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:42.960]   So if somebody came out with a difference with a distinction with their own amps like faster way of doing things
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.920]   That would also get the benefit to Google's search rankings
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:54.520]   But it really isn't technically it's not a fork technically it really just is an HTML page with a but you know
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:59.400]   It's like using jQuery instead of rewriting your own jQuery like library this time
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:02.160]   It's a you know, it's something that's that's been provided
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:08.360]   But is open because there is a github repo and people can can go in there and see it all and contribute
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:14.960]   But I think it's also important to think about this in the context of the the different realistic options
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:19.440]   So you know option one is these proprietary platforms, which really are going back to like the
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:23.400]   CompuServe and AOL days these these truly close platforms
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:27.880]   You know option two is that everybody just starts using ad blockers or using the reader mode in
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:34.280]   Safari or Firefox and stripping all the the branding and business model stuff out of the pages because
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:38.880]   They're just so frustrated by all the the bloat and the problems
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:42.040]   And I don't think those are those are really great options
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:52.040]   Okay, what's your Leo what what's your worst
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:58.560]   Fear of what amped us this is a this is a land grab by Google plain and simple
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:04.200]   Because Google approved advertising is allowed Google approved JavaScript is allowed
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:09.400]   Google favors amper results for whatever reasons in its browser and
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:14.760]   The land grab what about Apple news or Facebook and standard don't disagree that those are land grab
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:20.640]   But those live in Apple environment and Facebook environment there. I'm not see I think it's a mistake to say well
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.680]   There's a worse thing out there. Yes, there's a worse thing out there. There are lots of worst things including CompuServe
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:33.240]   But that doesn't mean this is different because it's from Google and it's quote open as many Google quote open source projects like Android are
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:42.680]   Supposedly somewhat open. This is Google and it's Google driven and I understand Google was terrified about ad blockers because they're basically an ad
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:48.080]   Project, you know, that's their business and and so their response is well
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:55.340]   Instead of fixing ad tech. We're just gonna we're just gonna have our own little thing and block all the bad ad tech
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:59.240]   Although I notice outbrain into bullar it right right in there
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:06.240]   I think they are trying to fix ad tech by standardizing things. I think that's exactly what they're trying to do. Yeah, well and you know I
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:12.360]   Think the best way to fix ad tech is to block it
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:21.320]   Now I think for you Jonathan, I think this is a great boon to nuzzle because that means nuzzle is a is you know
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.920]   Nuzzi to the degree that you look at articles. I read nuzzle or amp
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:28.560]   Much better experience much better experience. Oh, here's the thing
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:35.560]   Better experience for the publishers is to better experience for the ad users is a better experience for any other apps that implemented
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:42.080]   And it's certainly I think a better experience for everybody than people simply using an adblock or reader mode to strip out everything
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.080]   That's not good for anybody really
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:47.160]   Well, it doesn't saw it. Yeah, okay
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:50.040]   Doesn't really solve that people are still use ad blockers
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.640]   I hate to tell you because most of this stuff they visit is gonna be you know
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:51:01.160]   If if you're getting a page that has ads, but it's not super slow and it's not ridiculous ads and it's not annoying with pop-ups and
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:07.360]   Interstitial I mean it's it's a reasonable amount of ads then you're probably not gonna need to use an ad blocker
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:11.720]   Well, but this is this always gonna be a subset of the web that I'm surfing, right?
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:16.800]   Or is it gonna be the future is the future of the web higher web?
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.720]   No, that's the difference with you know, you will see the entire web
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:22.040]   It's just some pages will be faster than other pages
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:27.320]   Which is true today and those horrible pages that are full of ads. I will still see and so I will still use an ad blocker
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:35.680]   Well, if Facebook it's not I guess not faith, but if if nuzzle Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn Gmail, you know
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:41.180]   Pocket all end up supporting amp then I think publishers who end up not publishing an amp
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.720]   Version of their page or be would be pretty silly
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:50.280]   So if this works, it may be that you know the bulk of what's out there does it, you know end up being
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.440]   published as amp that's Leo's point about land grab though
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.440]   Well, I'm not really sure if you know
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:03.880]   if does all and Pinterest and WordPress and LinkedIn and Twitter and and all of us all get to participate in it equally
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.120]   I'm kind of not sure who's grabbing the land
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:13.240]   I mean if it's when that when the content is being published into proprietary Apple or Facebook system
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:19.040]   It's pretty clear who's who's benefiting and who's not how about if I just want to use HTML the true HTML the
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.760]   proposed by the W3C
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:25.560]   Yeah, but am I not gonna be at a disadvantage?
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.400]   Well, I think you're already
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.240]   You have a really slow crappy experience which a lot of people do
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.240]   unfortunately then
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:39.400]   People are getting frustrated if I have a nice fast page and that's why I'm resorting to ad blockers
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:43.520]   That's if you and the ad blockers are obviously really bad for publishers, right?
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:53.920]   Okay, I mean, I mean that's we disagree on this, but I think we both I've made my point
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:53:01.600]   The good news is this is doomed, but other than that I think it's it's gonna be great
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:08.320]   Because I don't I don't see a lot. I mean the big publishers obviously have jumped right on the bandwagon
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:12.320]   Do you think everybody's gonna just say hey? I gotta make two pages now one amp one non amp?
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.520]   This is this is great. I can't wait to do that
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:20.760]   Is that what is that the future we
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:23.400]   Sorry, I was just
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:27.680]   Running low on my battery and asking so would you bring me a charger bring him a charger while you get a charger?
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:32.080]   Sorry, we'll take a break. No, sorry. We'll talk about it later. I'll take a break get a charger
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.880]   We are yes, so block this if you will
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:45.600]   I don't know why it gets me upset, but I'm getting more I'm more and more upset. I wasn't as upset initially now
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:47.680]   I'm thinking it's a terrible idea because I really I
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:54.800]   See Google do go does stuff and they say well from an engineering point of view this makes perfect sense
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.080]   This is of course what could be wrong with speeding up the net?
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.480]   But that's why there's standards bodies. I think it's a good thing now
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:06.960]   Middley a lot of these standards bodies are run basically by a bunch of big companies. Thanks, man
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:10.920]   All right, let's take a break our show today brought to you by snacks. That's what I need
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:14.480]   I'm just you know, I need a low I'm low blood sugar, but I'm not gonna eat one of them
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:20.920]   Sugar-filled candy bars. No, maybe I'll have something delicious. Oh look at this like cranberry medley
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:27.360]   See this is good for you. This is pomegranate and asai flavored dried cranberries and blueberries Wow

[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:41.960]   You can trust I love these I live on these garden tomato crunchies. These are
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:48.800]   Kind of it's kind of an interesting idea. I think they must have some some mad scientists in the nature box kitchens
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:54.200]   This is tomato flavored almonds, but they're so good. They're really good
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.960]   and talk about flavor
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:03.400]   Trying to eat healthier doesn't mean having to give up on flavor. They've got vegan alternatives. No sugar added alternatives
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:11.760]   Non-GMO options you can choose between sweet and savory salty and tart. I've got the salt and pepper spice. It's that she'll nuts here
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:19.440]   Choose from over 100 unique and tasty options. I'd like to be in their kitchens like blueberry almond quinoa bites

[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:03.360]   Ungraciously complained about the bait and switch of getting my fez in a nature box box with no
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:08.520]   Bature box. Yeah, so what should arrive from Twitter? Uh-huh nature box. We don't want you to be in a happy

[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:19.280]   Right now. I love this. Thanks to Nuzzle. I
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:24.120]   Love these some of the articles that are showing up like the New York Times
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:31.360]   Article and actually I was curious what you thought about it trying to interview Google's co-founder. It's emasculating
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:34.480]   rights connordock
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:42.620]   You you've interviewed Larry more than a few times Jeff Jarvis no, I never interviewed him you haven't really
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:46.800]   So you never got emasculated by the process. I guess well
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:52.680]   You know actually know this is this is trying to he doesn't and it's turtles complain about how they can't do their job
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:54.840]   sympathetic
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:56.440]   genre to me. Yeah
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.480]   This is it looks like this is from the insider though
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:02.960]   So we shouldn't blame it because this is that thing you pay extra for
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:08.920]   To get ins it kind of insight into how the how the sausage is made
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:15.840]   So it's not this was not like in the paper. I hope I see I see I find the distinction kind of funny
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:22.880]   I mean the fact that the New York Times still has this distinction between the blog and the insider and the regular paper
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:26.960]   It's 2016. I mean those distinctions
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:30.880]   You know are you saying they're forking the New York Times?
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:38.560]   I think they're trying stuff is what they are there, you know, it's tough to have a paywall isn't it?
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:40.560]   And so they're trying to figure out what was people to pay for
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:48.120]   Sorry, they're splitting up on the basis of of their content and their needs rather than our needs. Yeah
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:50.680]   Well, I mean, I you know, here's the world
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:55.840]   I talked to a lot of publishers who are interested in in New Zealand potentially working with us and you know
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:59.560]   It's kind of funny when somebody's title is the VP of digital at a newspaper
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:04.480]   I just kind of think that's funny in 2016 and New York Times
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:09.960]   You know, there's a lot of smart people there. They're doing a lot of cool stuff, but the
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:17.200]   Sort of the concept of still what's gonna be in paper versus not. I just think is just kind of funny to still
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:20.920]   Think about that so much in 2016
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:26.800]   He has a there is what there's I mean, I don't even the headline bothers me
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:32.400]   But I mean well how if if you were a woman trying to interview Google's co-founder
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:38.080]   Would you also be emasculated? What is that? I don't even know what that means. Is that a joke about his his wasn't it?
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:41.760]   Larry's was it Larry or Sergey who talked about the phone being a mess? Oh?
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:46.960]   That's where that's coming from that sounds more like a very yes, it that's okay
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:50.920]   So now see I'm even inside and I didn't you're right. That's obviously what that is
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:53.280]   This is the one I the paragraph
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:59:00.240]   I like whenever someone asked me what I do at the Times and I tell them I cover Google the result is often a confused stare
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.840]   That's it
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.840]   That's a beat
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:11.160]   This is a show we do a show on Google what that's it. All right. No more no
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:14.000]   No more on that
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.840]   I was gonna ask why is there not a this week in Twitter show there could be in fact
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:26.960]   Thank you for reminding me because Jeff posed an interesting question and we've given you some time and a battery to think about it
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:32.360]   What would you do what would Twitter do what would you do with Twitter right now?
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:42.040]   well, you know, we do a lot of stuff with Twitter already with Nuzzle and you know, I think you can build on Twitter initially, right?
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:46.240]   Yeah, and I think we're we're as we're going forward. We've been adding a lot more stuff
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:51.200]   And maybe we've entered we added into partnership. We were one of slacks first integration partners
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:55.600]   And we're gonna be launching more of those in 2016, but even though I
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.840]   Invented a lot of the features of Facebook
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:05.200]   Twitter is kind of where I go first and sort of where I live online these days personally
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:11.760]   You know, I love Twitter and you know, I am one of those people who you know gait isn't a lot of sort of
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:20.920]   You know conversations with our with Nuzzles users on Twitter with investors with with users with journalists and I love Twitter
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:26.520]   Jeff I think asked what would I what do what I would I do if I own Twitter?
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:30.000]   But did you really mean what would I do if I was like in charge? Is that what you were?
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.400]   Yeah, yeah, because poor Twitter is confused it lost some more and lost another, you know, handful of executives this week
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.440]   One of one of going to become chief of product at Instagram
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:45.880]   Lost Katie Stanton who was in charge of media and other things. There's been a constant round robin people are constantly wondering what it is
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:52.360]   The stock values down I use Twitter to the world doesn't there was a discussion before about Twitter being too hard
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:59.120]   So you've built a beautiful elegant simple product as you talked about a simple and and Twitter
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.080]   It is said should be the simple saying the world, but it's not
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.600]   What would you do to?
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:10.000]   With the company and so that's kind of yeah, what we want 300 million people are using Twitter, which is actually a huge amount
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.640]   So when people say oh nobody's using Twitter, that's obviously not true at all 300 million people is huge
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:22.080]   What's what's going on is there being compared to Facebook? Which has even more so the question is not
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.680]   You know, oh, you know, it's not a lot of people use Twitter a lot of people are using Twitter
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:34.200]   But now people are laying okay. How could it be instead of 300 million? How could it be a billion and I I do have ideas
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.440]   For that. I mean one of the things that we're working on at Nuzzle
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.000]   like I said is
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:47.320]   Figuring out ways that people who are not Twitter power users can benefit of our social creation approach because right now if somebody
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:50.160]   Loves Nuzzle and tells all their friends about it
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.600]   Because not everybody uses Twitter a lot of those friends
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:02:00.600]   You know for her or old product the one that you and Leo still use they might not have been able to get the benefit from it
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:06.320]   and one of the things that we've been really excited about is using Nuzzle to build newsletters because
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.760]   everybody has email and
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:16.160]   People being able to subscribe to the Leela port or Jeff Jarvis newsletter and get really interesting content with out having even you know
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.240]   Log in set up config
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.960]   Downloaded install anything just an email address. We think that's really powerful
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:28.480]   And I actually think that you know that could be really cool for Twitter as well
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.800]   I mean, there's all these celebrities on Twitter and
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.000]   Why isn't you know there?
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.440]   Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump or Katie Perry or Justin Bieber or
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:43.040]   Oprah newsletter
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:48.360]   If you don't use Twitter and you go to Oprah or Donald Trump's Twitter page
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:54.640]   I think it's a bit confusing right now exactly what's going on and and how you can gauge with that in a way
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.800]   That's a little easier than actually logging in and creating a Twitter account
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:01.960]   So if you could subscribe and say okay, give me the Donald Trump newsletter. I think that'd be pretty cool
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:07.440]   You like that how are the end reason
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:12.640]   Absolutely, I mean imagine this imagine if in effect you just described Nuzzle
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.920]   Sure, but imagine if the top million imagine if the top million
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:24.960]   Most famous people on Twitter each had a newsletter with a thousand subscribers. You'd be sending a billion emails a day. Yeah
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:33.640]   I don't think that's a crazy thing to imagine. No, I mean how many people would would sign up for the Donald Trump or the Hillary Clinton one alone
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:36.080]   so
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:39.080]   So I have a lot of ideas for Twitter of course. I love Twitter
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:46.200]   And you know right now Nuzzle has been doing all sorts of cool things with Twitter as well as with other services
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.300]   I mean if I had full access to all of Twitter's
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:53.480]   Data unrestricted. I mean we could probably do even even more
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:04:00.080]   I'd love to see that. I'd love to see Twitter have a better relationship with developers to make the firehose available
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:05.320]   How do you do you use the Twitter API? How do you interact with Twitter? We do use the Twitter API
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:09.360]   We've gotten great support from Twitter. They've even at times
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:15.480]   Done some fixes to the API to help Nuzzle, which we really appreciate that being said of course
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:21.560]   There's still even more things that I'd like that are not silly, you know the only priority that they have so
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:27.000]   So you know Twitter has been great and really supportive of Nuzzle, but I still don't have
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:34.520]   Complete unlimited access to you know all the data and technology that they have so we could probably do even more
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:39.440]   Take even Twitter's rocky relationship with third-party developers
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:43.600]   Didn't it concern you a little bit building a business on top of Twitter's feeds?
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.000]   the funny thing is I think that the
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.840]   the sort of miscommunications that happened a few years ago were more bark than bite and
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.000]   in reality
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:04.080]   The number of companies that Twitter cut off was probably not as much as the impression that was you know
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:08.400]   The confusion that stemmed from some of the blog posts that were written a few years back
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.200]   and you know the funny thing is
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:18.300]   We've had harder problems working with some other companies than we've had with Twitter in and in our case Twitter has been
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:21.040]   supportive and
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:25.480]   Has helped us in a number of different ways, so we've had a really good relationship
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.920]   with Twitter and we we
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:34.400]   Fortunately haven't had to be really concerned and obviously now Jack has come out and said hey
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.000]   You know we're sorry for some of the you know the miscommunication in the past
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.400]   We really want to re-engage with developers, and I think that's great in fact. They just announced a whole tour
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:47.880]   So hello world develop relations Twitter
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:52.160]   Good that's that's very encouraging
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:06:00.440]   Because but see I feel like Twitter could look at you and say gee that's I like what Jonathan's come up here with
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.440]   Nussel we should do that
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:06.480]   You're not worried about that. I guess it's really pretty far-fetched for them to
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:12.220]   Do what you're doing Twitter has done some things. I mean they discover and they had moments
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:16.200]   Facebook has launched a bunch of stuff, you know there's lots of people
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:21.480]   There's lots of people doing things in the world of news apps discovery curation
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.480]   I mean there's a lot of stuff going on
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:30.240]   But you worrying about that too much is usually sort of beside the point where you know
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:35.960]   We're trying to figure out you know how can we make sure that that Nussel is doing things that a lot of people could use
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:39.000]   And that's sort of that's what we're focused on right now
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:47.200]   I just for one I'm really surprised to hear that Twitter has
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.200]   advertisements that's feed I was shocked shocked
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:55.560]   One of the important guys. Apparently I I don't get them
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:07:01.080]   I do remember that day when there were advertisements in my Twitter feed and then I saw an article the other day saying
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:06.080]   Important people don't get ads and I went and I thought you know what I haven't had an ad in
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:10.800]   Quite a while. I do see promoted trends. That's an ad right?
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:14.200]   Apparently moving on up is a promoted trend
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:19.680]   Right now, but I don't I use only tweet deck for Twitter. So you don't see ads either, right?
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:24.480]   I never see that's but what would I what would these ads that I'm not seeing look like would they be?
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:29.520]   In the stream would there be like as Instagram does, you know
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.880]   We pause your stream for a moment to show you some content or I
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:40.640]   Don't know where those ads are I don't see the way I think you'd see promoted tweets right in your stream. Okay, I
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:45.600]   Think so. Yeah, none of it. We're very bad people to ask about this apparently
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:50.320]   What do you peon see do you see
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:54.560]   Guess I should really stop right there. It's there's no
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.840]   There's no
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:01.880]   percentage in this conversation. I'm a little worried. I follow a lot of people so I I kind of I
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:08.000]   Can't tell I can't really up with my raw stream. So I look at my I do a lot of searches as I look at my ad mentions
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:14.320]   I use nozzle so I'm on Twitter many times a day, but it's I'm I'm sort of using it in you know
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:18.960]   In different ways of just looking at my raw stream, but then again, I'm not obviously not a normal
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:24.760]   A normal user necessarily I posted my first I use my media walks list you do yeah
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:32.560]   Yeah, I mean I think we've all learned ways to to use Twitter to to our advantage and less and that's probably part of the
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:36.200]   From with Twitter less to Twitter is advantage. I do note that
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.560]   Tommy Chong follows me on Twitter in fact
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:48.080]   Of the famous Cheech and Chong duo he even tweeted we should all aspire to be as cool as Leo one day
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:53.560]   Whoa, okay, he is nozzle. No, I probably who wouldn't
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:09:00.120]   And then I for the first time ever used a Twitter poll the Twitter poll thing
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:05.800]   And I got Donald Trump is the Twitter poll. Yeah, I actually really liked it now that they have more than two choices
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:13.960]   I asked what kind of a Tesla I should get in the two-third majority out of six thousand votes said get the model X so I did I
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:19.720]   Let I let the Twitter verse choose my new car with some constraints
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.920]   Some constraints around it
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:30.560]   Google has sponsorship opportunity I blew it could have made some money there just
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:34.760]   You know he'll on a four a four or whoever would pay you to drive that car
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:40.120]   Yeah, well as a matter of fact Ford was a sponsor for several years and I drove a Mustang during that time
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:43.720]   You know what I did it was kind of I was completely speculative
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:50.960]   I when when they were when I was approached about advertising for Ford. I said well, I don't know let me buy a Ford car
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.520]   And I'll lay like it back to you
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.640]   So I didn't get a free Mustang or anything
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:01.160]   I actually paid you know full retail for a Mustang and they said yes, I love this sync stuff. Let's do it
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:07.320]   So and then continue to drive a Mustang for several years. I've I've moved on because so has Ford
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:10.120]   No, that's not one
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:17.040]   I realized I'm tooled to be driving a sports car is where this is a real reason. No little worried about this hangouts
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.200]   Seven is
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.640]   Coming is being slowly rolled out. I don't think I have it yet
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:30.080]   It's slowly being rolled out to Android users and here's what and I guess iOS users as well and here's what I worry about
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:35.320]   They're discouraging you from using it for text messaging
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:42.560]   You actually when you launch seven they've added this notification quick reply, which is nice
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:47.920]   But you already had that in messages on Android devices and on the first launch of
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:56.080]   The new Hangouts seven you'll see a pop-up that says switch to messenger first for SMSing
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:00.560]   There had been rumors for some time that hangouts would eliminate text messaging
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.400]   and now I'm really worried
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:06.040]   Am I gonna have to start using?
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:09.840]   Google's messages app on my Nexus I
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.840]   Did switch I took their word for it and
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.840]   There's a nice cat
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:21.520]   Which I love because I pay for Google contributors, so I get lots of cats in my feeds
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:25.400]   I'm impressed by the number of sites now using Google contributor by the way
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:29.080]   So seeing a lot of kitty cats
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:34.360]   What do you think Jeff or we worried about the loss of text message capability in Hangouts?
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:41.520]   No, because I've been using messenger you have to you switched you know when I got five they said switch
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:44.720]   Google's really pushing this
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:53.200]   So Leo I think Jonathan has an out is it time to go Jonathan we can still try unfortunately. Yeah, well good
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:58.640]   You know what I've got a run, but yeah had a great time. Thank you so much for being really happy. I was gonna get into
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.440]   a
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:05.920]   Specifically why they use a different kind of image tag in amp because we went down to Mount of you and met with
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:15.440]   Hotel is is bez David Bezbres. Yes, and he specifically talked about how the browsers have a contract for any image tag to absolutely show it
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.440]   And there are technical reasons why
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.520]   Not using the standard image tag ended up being
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:28.360]   Technically useful for trying to do the things that they're doing with amp
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:34.160]   And you know perhaps in the future, you know, these things maybe it will become an open standard and maybe slight changes
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:37.360]   The browsers will be made to address that maybe it won't be moped
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:41.920]   We need it forever, but there you know some of the things that you're concerned about there were at least for now
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:46.000]   Specifically technical reasons why they were using their own sort of version of the image tag. Okay
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.080]   Fair enough. Hey, it's great. Jonathan was great having you back. Thank you for joining us. Absolutely my pleasure
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.360]   Good work with Nuzzle and you ZZ
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:13:00.760]   EL dot com available not only on the web at for iOS and Android and really one of my
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:05.360]   Fave I'm gonna say my favorite news app. I I do I've been I've a beat check
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:11.880]   I do tech meme I do hacker news from Y Cominator and I do nuzzle and I feel like I'm seeing everything
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:18.080]   I want to see from those three. It's great. Thank you, Jonathan. Thank you, Jonathan. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks. We'll see you later
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.800]   Yeah, I'm worried about this hangouts thing. I have to say I but everybody's saying oh just use messenger
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.800]   You'll be happy
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:35.920]   Hangouts I always had a problem with hangouts trying to figure out the the what's in hangouts what's an SMS
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.080]   You I was never smooth enough for me
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:46.160]   So I actually am happy to separate out messaging back to messenger
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:54.200]   Okay, okay, I'm just gonna do it weird maybe can you can you type slash shruggy in
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:59.600]   Messenger and get the shruggy guy. Let me try
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:03.920]   No
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:10.680]   That's disappointing because you can't in hangouts already you're unhappy already you're going back
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:17.200]   One second and you're unhappy. I mean I you know everybody says but it's material design and you know you can embed
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.920]   all the things that you like in there and you know the
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:22.000]   the
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.800]   Animated I don't think you can make gifts because stickers and all that stuff. I
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:33.040]   Don't know I feel I'm worried because I hangouts is how I get all of my text messages to all of my devices
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:39.840]   I know it is weird Google put so much effort into hangouts and now they do seem to be deprecated it as they did Google+
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.520]   Yeah, not killing it, but who knows oh
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.640]   well
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:48.560]   And I guess we'll just figure it out, but if you are still using hangouts try slash
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:54.080]   Shruggy, I'm gonna send you a shruggy Jason. Let's see if I can send you a shruggy
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:15:00.440]   You know lately Jason and I have been communicating more on Facebook messenger
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:02.880]   Which is it seems to be the quickest way
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:08.880]   It's it's the quickest way to meet me is that there is that the issue no no it's just it's fast
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.440]   It's good. It's easy and I can put a little bubble you've got to deal with a message because the damn bubbles there
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:18.600]   Right it definitely gets your attention. It gets your attention. Yeah, okay, so I'm doing a slash
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.840]   Shruggy
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:28.100]   Nice I have no way to show it you can't see my screen. Oh wait. Yeah, I can't see it on my side
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:34.480]   Oh, I can't send it to you all send it to you women. Yeah, I sent it to Gary. Let's send it. Let's send one to
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:40.640]   Jason clan at this. Okay, here we go. You don't have to show just show it on my screen. Okay, so
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:48.120]   Here we go slash SH are you GG IE? That's the very complicated emoticon
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:53.720]   That is like I don't even know it's it's it's I don't even know how people do it
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:16:00.920]   The the shruggy. Yeah, can you show the struggle? Yeah, I'm zooming in I'm trying to get you don't want to sew the rest of it
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:03.800]   There you go. See like while I'll do it again
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:08.120]   You'll understand Jason while you're getting all these shrugs if I send it to somebody else
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:10.960]   Yeah
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:16.720]   That's awesome. Okay, but now let's let's character count backslash Shruggy and then how many
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:23.520]   Figure out what these characters are what is that character? I don't even know what that character is. That's a Japanese character
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:29.200]   one two three four five six seven eight nine
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.640]   Shruggies hover over it. It showed like a yeah, cuz I selected
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.400]   There's a show the date and tell okay
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.760]   Shruggy, I'm gonna do another one. Let's just shrug a shrug shrug shrug shrug
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:51.880]   Shruggy you feel like there's a lot of these hidden in there that just Google isn't telling us there's stuff that Google's not telling us about
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:55.280]   They know all the secrets
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:58.720]   So come on guys what else you can now
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:06.640]   Do donation cards on YouTube if you would like your viewers to support not you
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:09.360]   non-profits
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.600]   That's kind of cool
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:20.960]   Now you and your viewers can make a genuine difference in the world and it's popping up you're missing the whole thing Jason
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:24.800]   I'm sorry. I'll back up. Okay
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:29.320]   There it is
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:35.120]   There it is. What are you trying to find your Shruggy? Is that what you're doing? I'm stopped. I'm not gonna send you anymore Shruggies
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:42.920]   All right, enough of that. Oh, you just sent me a shruggy back. I heard it stop shrugging me
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:45.920]   moving on
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:51.040]   Mark Zuckerberg
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:57.200]   Back to work. That was a short to work back to short family leave. He really took it two months
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:01.160]   That's more than most dads doing the what it is and you saw the picture of his closet
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.440]   Yeah, it's a little weird. He's got a lot of gray shirts
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:07.360]   And all gray shirts and blue hoodies
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.360]   Wow
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:15.920]   Wow, you know, I don't know is how does he pick is there is there a Thursday shirt and a Friday shirt?
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.920]   Well, he says first day back after paternity leave. What should I wear?
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:24.360]   You know, I really like these guys like this because they're
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:29.560]   Wasn't it F's Scott Fitzgerald who said the rich are not like you and me
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:35.680]   They can get ideas that you and I might just float through our head like you know
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:40.760]   I just wish all my clothes were the same and I wouldn't have to pick them and they would float through my head
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:44.000]   And I would move on well, I didn't know when he says hey assistant
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:50.760]   Assistant go out and buy 150 gray shirts and hoodies put them in my closet give everything else to goodwill and it's done
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:53.120]   No more wire hangers
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:57.600]   No, they're not wire. They're beautiful and they're all lined up David Agas
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:05.640]   David Agas the doctor to many stars including Steve Jobs said that on Howard Stern that that jobs convinced him to just work
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:11.520]   Black because jobs said that if you wear the same thing every day people won't pay won't pay attention to what you wear
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.560]   They'll pay attention to what you say. That's exactly right
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:22.760]   When I took est I was told that yeah, I loved est I know I meant to talk to you about this because you were you were going on and on
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:28.320]   About Warner when I took when I took as in 19 said it was 1978. I had a lime green bed
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:34.640]   But I remember that the the trainers were told to dress in a very neutral way
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:39.200]   So that you wouldn't be looking like oh, what's he wearing? You wouldn't you wouldn't be looking at that?
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:43.040]   You'd be listening to the message. So this is of course. This is absolutely true
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:48.440]   Then now I'm gonna be looking at mark marks. I don't know do you have when you have a
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:56.000]   Lot of t-shirts a do you hang them up in your closet? No and be I thought they'd be folded
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.520]   Do you have somebody look carefully at these somebody has ironed them?
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:09.200]   Also notice that I'm guessing it's not Priscilla also notice the exact separation in the hangers equally
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:12.440]   Separate from each other. It's possible. He did that for the Instagram
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:19.480]   You know like how people as people will we don't see the rest of the room and are those the Facebook hoodies with the
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:22.400]   No, I don't think so they're brandless hoodies
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:27.400]   The hoodies are not ironed, but those those teachers are conspicuously
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:30.600]   Oh, I wonder where the de jeans are
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:33.400]   No, no one would wear iron jeans
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:36.720]   Well, I've known people who do
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:42.200]   Somebody said or they're new and he just okay frets in the charm says maybe they're just new
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:49.840]   Google is now gonna this is this is the only end in tears fact check candidates
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:56.520]   No, they're not they're not gonna they're not good. We'll you to fact check the let you faction of that headline. Oh, thank God
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:02.560]   Which is the way it exists now anyway, you right is Google to call googling the quote. Yeah, okay
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:10.080]   Yes, so they're doing that anyway, although there is a fact check site that I liked and who is it is the post somebody's doing this on a regular basis
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:17.120]   Yeah, there's a couple of them. It's good. It's useful plus they're always reliable snopes. Yeah, do they do fact checks on the
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:21.080]   On the debates, but they well, they might they're probably they do want Donald Trump
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:27.160]   You know it's gonna be fascinating so Trump has apparently decided not to he doesn't like megalore
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:33.900]   Megyn Kelly and he refuses to participate in the debate tomorrow because Megyn Kelly has Fox refuses to take me
[01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:37.880]   Megyn Kelly as they should has refused to take megyn Kelly off the panel
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:45.480]   Just a New Yorker headline that said that that all many Americans are perplexed by suddenly having a need to sympathize with megyn Kelly
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:56.640]   But she's so pretty but my question is he says he's gonna do an alternate event
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.640]   Is he gonna debate himself?
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:03.920]   Is he gonna put cadence of Ted Cruz up on the stage and say Ted you don't have much energy?
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:08.240]   What is Jack Shafer the media media critic just said on Twitter that
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:13.240]   Trump has said so many can contradicting things through the years he could debate himself. Ah
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.920]   That's an interesting thought. I'd like to debate
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:18.400]   myself from 1989 and
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.640]   1992
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:26.320]   Am I great? Yes, I'm great. Well, then we agree. I'm great. I'm Trump. I'm the best as nobody like me
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:30.200]   I'm Trump. I'm great. You know what we didn't get from you as a Davos report
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.880]   Kevin Spacey
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:34.880]   Had some stuff to say at Davos
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:42.840]   He he did an interview with TechCrunch. I guess Sarah Lane and the TechCrunch team was at Davos
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:49.200]   He predicted that tech firms will follow Netflix into media now Kevin knows a little bit about this because of course
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.920]   He elected to sell house of cards not to
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:55.600]   HBO or one of the other big cable
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:58.800]   Companies are networks, but to Netflix and it was their biggest hit
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:03.000]   Made them a lot of money made him a lot of money made everybody very happy
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:10.200]   Kevin is very technically literate. He is a you know, he's absolutely a gadget hound and loves technology and
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:17.320]   So I guess he says in the next few years silicon Valley is going to be much more involved in content. I
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:19.920]   Would not well, yeah, I think if you see it at
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:26.740]   What's called film festival in the snow Sundance right now Sundance. Thank you Sundance
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:31.880]   Big story about how how both Netflix and Amazon
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:39.280]   They're buying up all the films and the distributors were not they're Cinderella at these events. They go. Yes. Yes, they've got their writing checks
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:44.480]   And it occurred to me too that if you look at Apple's results, which we haven't talked about because they've been over
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:48.160]   Analyzed but but you know Apple's not really in the cloud
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:54.720]   They're not really in social and the other part that surprises me when you think about it is that why is an Apple like Amazon or like Netflix making?
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:24:00.960]   Entertainment well, that's what he says. I wouldn't be surprised if a big tech company would buy a studio Apple has the money
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:04.280]   Apple has the money to buy everything
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:11.120]   Yeah, the richest I mean amazing the success of it's so funny to watch the contrarians say oh, yeah
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:15.880]   Well, sure Apple had the most profitable quarter in American history of any company ever in the American history
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:24.320]   18 billion dollars in profit in three months, but it's the end of the line companies people are saying sell Apple stock because it's over
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:30.400]   Amazon studios has started producing its own content. Yeah, yeah, I guess that counts
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:33.480]   There's a lot of good content coming out of Amazon, but I think he's thinking you know
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:41.040]   I thought growth 1% in revenues euro percent in units iPad down 25% units Mac down 4% units
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:47.680]   What happens at some point 12% you sell a phone to every person on the planet
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.240]   And there's nowhere else to go
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:51.680]   No, I don't buy that
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:57.480]   Leo how many phones you've got this year? Oh my god, I'm not the I'm not the poster boy for that
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:01.040]   I I have five numbers inactive at all times
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:07.280]   Somebody asked my wife asked me how many phones you have and I actually had to count them. I have a blackberry
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.040]   Priv. I have a note five. I have a
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:18.000]   Nexus 6p. I have that's my Google 5. I have an iPhone. I'm missing one
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:26.040]   But but the reason I rotate the newest stuff through because I have five numbers. Yeah, sure Google 5 to two numbers
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:32.600]   Are they you know all your numbers? Yeah, you know what? That's that's why I love hangouts. That's why I love
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.880]   Google voice
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.760]   Got it and that's why I have five because that's the most numbers you can have
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:44.800]   Actually, I could have one more because Google fight doesn't count against your total. So I could have one more
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:49.840]   By the way good time if you want to buy a Nexus phone
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:53.680]   Google's clearing them out. They're blowing out to the bear walls
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:59.120]   The Nexus the Nexus 5x now two ninety nine
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:03.920]   And I understand the 6p for the first time is going to go on sale as well
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.920]   I
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:14.400]   Can't I don't advertise day promotion. Oh, hi, honey. I love you so much. I bought you a Nexus. I bought you a ugly phone
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:24.400]   Yeah, I'm not seeing that leads to romance a great night of love. Yes, honey. You bought me a phone that some people would be happy
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:27.680]   Yeah, you know what you really you want you
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:33.360]   You want whoopi buy her an iPhone be honest with you get her gold iPhone
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:41.960]   Ha no Nexus phone ever got any no Nexus certainly not a blackberry god forbid no, no the priv is pretty nice. I like the
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:47.000]   Sexy, it's not
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.120]   Davos yeah, I didn't give you a report
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:55.760]   I did write a piece on medium today in which I argued that this is the post Snowden Davos that
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:58.960]   When I thought back over the over the week there
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:04.880]   the ways in which he came up constantly was just amazing discussions of cybersecurity and encryption and
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:12.840]   And security and growth and privacy and it's it's as if he was there already as a policymaker. Yeah, that kind of yeah
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:14.160]   Yeah
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.160]   So was it worth going?
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:22.200]   Yeah, because the mockers are there and I see my media people and I went to the Google digital news initiative meeting
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:26.960]   And I saw Facebook had its big pavilion and I saw Cheryl Sandberg and other executives there
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:31.760]   So yeah, sure, you know, you get invited you go. Yeah, you have to get invited
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:34.400]   You can't just show up and say I'm here. Oh
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:37.760]   No, oh no, oh no
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:43.920]   Have I have next year a secret handshake, so you know how many how many Davos is in a row have you been to?
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:50.360]   Just 10 it's the world economic forum. I always we call it Davos because that's where it's held
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:54.120]   But it's the world economic forum and what it who runs it and why?
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:59.800]   Klaus Schwab who's a professor from German professor in Noun Switzerland
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:05.560]   And he runs it to bring together the world's leaders and to try to improve the world and they mean that they really do mean that
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:11.280]   They they convene people I sat in one session about the fractured internet in which the US
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.640]   Secretary of Commerce and the UK vice president
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:17.440]   Involved over digital stuff
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:22.940]   They're the ones who are really negotiating the safe harbor agreement and there Steve Adler the editor of Reuters
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:27.800]   Pushed them hard because there's only a week left on this and if it expires, we're all messed up
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:35.800]   And and Davos can do that they can bring together these these important people these bachars and kind of bang their heads together and make them do things
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:39.080]   And sometimes it happens so it's yeah, it's it's worth it
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:43.560]   I you know, I think you can make fun of the attendance who are there you may be front of the rich people who were there
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:46.600]   But Davos it's so the you know the world economic forum itself
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:49.220]   I honestly do believe does all in all good work
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:54.580]   I ran a session with they have a group of young people called the global shapers
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:29:00.220]   It's like the odd name, but fine and I ran a session on on future life in cities and there were people
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:02.220]   I was doing Skype. It was like twig
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:05.340]   from India and Pakistan and
[01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.980]   Russia and
[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:10.940]   Somewhere else
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:14.420]   And the young people who are doing amazing things there cities and talking that's what the forum does
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:18.080]   So I'll defend the forum. Oh, I don't think you have to see it sounds awesome
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:23.320]   But you see oh no a lot of people will attack it is there 1% and all that but we see when you see Jamie Diamond
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:28.860]   Having just gotten a huge raise over the other side of the Google party. You do kind of sneer a little bit
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:30.340]   I I bet that
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:36.820]   You know people say that about the bohemian growth to it's just a bunch of rich people running the world and
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:39.260]   Do you go to bohemian growth?
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:41.260]   I've been
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:43.300]   Once I've been once
[01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:47.200]   Pete on a tree with the George Schulz, you know that kind of thing
[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:49.300]   Wow
[01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:52.420]   Now a friend a friend of mine many years ago
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:55.020]   I know a few members
[01:29:55.020 --> 01:30:00.840]   So the bohemian club is interesting they you know they have this grove up in Northern, California and people are
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:05.660]   always protesting out front during their annual summer retreat because
[01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:09.100]   That's exactly the point they say you know this is up
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:17.100]   You know, but this is the smoke-filled room only it's among the redwoods where the rich and the powerful are planning our destiny without our input
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:25.260]   And it is you know rich people, but it's also artists because it was originally conceived by artists by bohemians
[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:29.180]   To be a get-together and they now to this day because they do
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:34.380]   Plays in which men dressed as women feature prominently so that gives you some idea of how dumb it is
[01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:42.420]   And they have to have talented artists in the group. So they you know scholarship in
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:44.800]   performers and
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:51.580]   musicians and create lots of creatives and then the paid members pay I don't some huge amount of money
[01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:54.160]   But a friend of mine will hearst
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:31:01.320]   You would think if your William Randolph Hearst the third you would just get in right you say send him a check and can I be in?
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:04.960]   He waited for like 30 years to get in
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:08.240]   Somebody had to die before he could get yeah, I was surprised
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:13.320]   I remember I remember will saying hey, I just got into the bohemian club. So what wait a minute
[01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:16.100]   You didn't you weren't in before
[01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:19.560]   We chew grandfathered in so to speak no
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:28.120]   So it's so it's hard to get in it's very expensive, but I know a guy he said you know you're this is back in the beginning you're
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:33.960]   You're an internet guru. We don't we don't know about this internet which you come and speak at the grove. So I did
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:40.960]   But I don't think Davos is anything like that effects more like Ted isn't it sounds like
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:46.320]   No, no no Ted is
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:49.800]   No, I will get in trouble
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:52.520]   Now Teddy is elitist
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:58.500]   You know we were talking about how San Francisco is becoming the center of the tech world. That's Jason's quote
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:02.160]   But in fact he's wrong Robert Scoble says it's not
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:04.880]   Silicon Valley its
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:08.600]   Champagne, Illinois and Blacksburg, Virginia
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:18.560]   And Scoble would know because as he says in the lead. Yeah, I'm known as one of Silicon Valley's top tech influencers
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:23.320]   So the winner is
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:30.320]   Champagne, Illinois and Blacksburg, Virginia. Congratulations. Well, it's where the it's where the Netscape browser came from champagne
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:37.440]   That's well the NCSA absolutely the National Center for Supercomputing applications at the University of Chicago
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:40.160]   Urbana
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:46.800]   Or maybe it's champagne is certainly a hive of tech innovation, but so is MIT
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:52.680]   So I mean there are lots of places over five million cardboard viewers were shipped
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:56.560]   I'm guessing about 20% of that with the Sunday times
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:02.720]   Yeah, I think it was a million. Yeah, I think you brought right. Yep. Yeah, a thousand plus VR apps
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:06.640]   I'm not stealing any numbers from you. This is a blog post from my baby
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:09.720]   Who's the new VR guy at Google?
[01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:16.920]   They don't make money on cardboard. I don't think but there's certainly it certainly promotes the widespread use of
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:20.800]   Immersive video as you would say not virtual reality
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:28.800]   Verizon spent 70 million dollars some of that from you Jeff Jarvis
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:33.320]   - no, I'm now Verizon and I are now divorced. Yay
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:37.880]   Who'd you go with iron out of worst would you go with I've got a T&D?
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:40.440]   Okay, that's fair. They're all bad
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.760]   Yeah, yeah
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:50.240]   Verizon spent 70 million dollars to triple the LTE capacity in San Francisco ahead of the Super Bowl now I want a Verizon phone
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:55.680]   Be glad you're not in the city Jeff. I hear it's insane. Oh
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:59.640]   Insane
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:05.680]   They built 16 built 16 new area cell sites. They installed 75 small cells
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:13.320]   They're putting in it's funny because they already were a big part of Levi stadium
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:17.160]   Santa Clara stadium for the 49ers where the game is going to be held
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:23.440]   But they put in even more antennas to reach the lower stadium seats and increase peak download speeds and
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:26.200]   They added 37 XLTE
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:31.160]   connections to existing sites
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.920]   Wow
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:39.560]   During the Super Bowl last year. I didn't know this during the Super Bowl last year Verizon customers used 4.1 terabytes of data
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:43.280]   They can handle double the capacity. That's actually not that much
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:49.160]   Well, I think we have something like that every day in our downloads
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:52.920]   Wow, yeah, we do a petabyte of months
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:55.960]   Wow, and do you pay for this?
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:58.360]   Oh
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.920]   Sorry, I haven't asked for a check yet. Oh
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:04.680]   Waiting for the bill. They're wonderful

[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:13.520]   That's why I told people cash flies is fantastic. They really do yeah
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.520]   Well, it's a trade because they get an ad and I've re-single show
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:21.520]   I mean every show and well and I told people cash flies the place because yeah
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:27.200]   Yeah, well and I think I've been told that that's it does work that that's why they're willing to give us a
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:29.880]   petabyte
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:36.800]   Incredibly and I've learned the importance of paying bills because you know our website went down Jeff
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:40.400]   Because I missed a $44 charge
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.640]   No
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:44.640]   for the domain
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:50.800]   No, that's the obvious one and the twit domain I've read I registered 10 years at a time. I'm not dumb
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:54.600]   but
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:36:01.320]   But there was this so we have a very complicated setup. We have like 18 different. It's a complicated there so
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:07.040]   Drupal back end. There's a node JS front end. It's on Heroku. There's caching
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.840]   done by a variety of other sites including
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:12.360]   Redis Labs and
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:19.040]   We don't it's redis is very affordable redis labs our bill at redis labs is something give even though with all the traffic to the website
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:22.760]   Is only like $44 a month? It's $47 a month. It's very affordable
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:28.920]   And it was we had put it on a Jeff needles when we set up the site put it on a company credit card
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:33.240]   And I you know I just I forgot about it
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:38.440]   And of course the credit card expired in September and
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:46.520]   Redis Labs kept sending email saying hey, can you update your jet of yours and it just went in the email hole and
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:52.800]   A couple a couple of days ago. No, he didn't say that Jeff needles that I got it
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:55.280]   I don't know where it went. I think I think a lot of people got it
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:59.840]   But there's a lot of traffic, you know about the website a lot of
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:06.080]   Jotto-generated emails and I guess we all missed it. So they just said well, okay guess you don't want this anymore
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:14.440]   And they turned it off and I woke up yesterday morning to a dead site
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:20.940]   Anyway, they were they responded quickly. Thank you redis labs and I said really I'm good for it. I
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:29.800]   Thank you to Google for saving Banksy's last
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:32.380]   Yeah, it's cool
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:36.120]   Miserables or is it me so habla is a Rob Mira
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:44.520]   It's a he actually is tying lemise Robla to the Calais to migrants coming into Calais beautiful
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:51.620]   But as with always as with Banksy's work, it's really graffiti and gets removed. So there goes the Google guy
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:55.160]   Some dork in a backpack with a
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:38:01.220]   I don't know how that's really different than making a video of it and we're
[01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:06.560]   Over that matter, but it's gonna be part of the cultural Institute project and Street View
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.040]   So you can go back and see it and there's a little QR code where it was

[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:09.080]   That's two study movies. Yeah, it's a choice carry novel that was a great which I read by the way after seeing the movie
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.560]   Um
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:15.320]   Wait a minute. Can this be true? It says the screen pally was by Alec Guinness
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:18.120]   Wow, I had no idea
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:20.880]   Oh
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:23.880]   That's Obi-Wan Kenobi for those of you who never heard of it
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:26.920]   For this set yeah for this set
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:32.800]   You could I wonder if it's on Netflix or somewhere if you find it and watch it in fact
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.920]   I might buy it because it's one of my favorite movies
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:38.080]   Is it an Ealing comedy no?
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:43.440]   But it's one of those great movies from 1958 all right
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:46.480]   You could tell we're drifting off here
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:49.280]   You look just under that last step here go
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:55.960]   Yeah, if you look just under the last discussion, there's even more information about the oh, yeah, I've been using the cultural Institute as my
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:59.240]   wallpaper on Chrome for some time
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:04.800]   This is a really great project in fact it was one of my picks I
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:10.040]   Think was the was the was the wallpaper. So if I do a new tab in Chrome
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:17.280]   Oh, maybe I turned it off. It's not doing it now, but it was for a while. It's my wallpaper in my Chromebook
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:23.840]   They have a a Chrome extension that will put images up from their cultural Institute
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:27.200]   They're saving art all kinds of art including street art
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:35.760]   And even have the walking tours of many of the galleries around the world. Yeah, I love it the Google Cultural Institute
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.600]   artist by artist
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:44.120]   That's the street art. Yeah, this is the street art collection, but there's lots of collections if you go you can
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:47.920]   They do seem to favor
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:52.360]   Graffiti and street art, but there's a lot of other stuff. That's amazing collection. Isn't it?
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:55.760]   Why why do I why do I know cultural?
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:59.720]   Let me my extension is turned off me turn it back on I guess
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:05.000]   I periodically go through and delete extensions I have so many of them
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.560]   Yeah, I
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:10.400]   Just put up the horses mouth trailer. Oh
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:14.700]   Okay, I'll tell you what let's uh, let's take a break
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:20.280]   We'll wrap it up with our tip in our number good good and then we will
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:23.720]   Play a little bit of the horses mouth trailer
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:31.240]   To inspire you. It's about art. It's about yeah an artist and uncompromising artist
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:38.880]   And and creativity and and I loved it because he never he never sold out he lived in a houseboat
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:41.600]   like Jimson
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:47.300]   Never sold out the Google Cultural Institute and it makes a wonderful
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:56.080]   Chrome extension is it working now? Yeah, there it is. So when I do a new tab I get art every day a different
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:02.640]   Painting or work of art from the Google Cultural Institute. Let's love that. Isn't that nice recommended as your you know
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:07.600]   You can do lots of the problem with the Chromebook. I don't know if you found this Jeff is that the wallpaper
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.960]   I wish it had I like rotating wallpapers
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:14.960]   Mm-hmm, and I wish it had to see the wallpaper because it's always a browser. Well, that's part of the problem, too
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:24.080]   Yeah, there's always something on the screen. Yeah. Yeah. All right time for a break and to talk about our mattress because both Jeff and I are getting sleepy
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:28.880]   We're getting sleepy. We're having dreams of floating areas
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:34.000]   Onto a Casper mattress. I love their slogan a life well slept
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:43.920]   Actually studies the the internet everybody now is saying sleep is more important for your long-term health for your for your ability to think
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:50.000]   For everything. I mean a good night's sleep is more than just like oh, I got a good night's sleep
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.600]   It's everything and your mattress is an integral part of your future Casper calm

[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:25.680]   Well, what you do is you order it and you can try it free for a hundred nights
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:31.440]   If you don't like it, they'll refund you every penny. They'll even come and pick it up and take it away
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:33.840]   free
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:39.680]   So I think that's enough to cut that should make you more comfortable with the idea and they'll talk about comfort. I'm

[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:20.160]   And you know Dan Dubno? Yeah
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:25.320]   You know, so he said do you want to go show with gadgets and we'll bring in a bag of gadgets
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:33.440]   Nice I can't wait when are we gonna launch the show New York startups
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:39.800]   Late spring if I can make it there. I'll make it anywhere
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:44.440]   You're a number of the week, mr. Jarvis
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:49.960]   I think what we have to do is Facebook while we were on the show revealed revealed its earnings
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:54.520]   Oh numbers came out and they were amazing sales rose 52%
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:57.880]   52%
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:01.840]   Smashing the forecasts with sales that's ad sales
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:05.200]   That's yeah, primarily right
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:10.560]   $4.84 billion and the street had guessed
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:13.520]   $5.37 billion
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:15.520]   You know after Apple announces
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:21.240]   $18.4 billion profits in a quarter making a mere billion and a half seems so paltry
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:25.480]   Yeah, I know but it's okay. It's good money
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:31.760]   It's nice work if you can get aren't amazing then the other numbers that came out and this was on on Zuckerberg's own post on Facebook
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:36.040]   Which is which is also like there 1.5 billion?
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:43.560]   Monthly Facebook users 900 million. What's app users? That'll pass a billion very fast 800 million messenger, right?
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:46.400]   So to add those two numbers together humanity
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:53.120]   Oh, no, just phenomenal insane gross
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:49:00.040]   19 million people so far connected via internet data work so it's full of small number while that goes through controversy
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:02.600]   But that's still a lot of people
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:11.040]   50 million small businesses using pages that's that's to me a huge growth opportunity is I've been trying to argue with them that
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:17.120]   Local news sites should be should be their sales agents for that and there's there's tremendous power there
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:21.120]   500 million people use events. I don't even use events
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:23.840]   What's events?
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:26.160]   Well, actually I did use it because scoble had his
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:28.640]   scoble show
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:34.240]   Last weekend and he used events to plan and pay for the whole thing. It actually worked quite well
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:37.840]   Yeah, so that's that's the numbers of the week. I
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:46.320]   Have to apologize. I missed the most important story of the week if you've been watching the new x files Mulder and Scully are using
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:50.960]   Nexus phones, of course the truth is out there
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:53.840]   Yeah
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:56.300]   Is that what phone is that is that an excess
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:03.840]   Pete on that six with the cameras off to the side, so it's a it's a five. Oh, you're right. You're right. You're right. Right. Right. So they're using the cheap one
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:06.600]   He is she's using the oh
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:10.920]   Okay, there we go. The doctor is using the new one Scully's using the six P
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:19.560]   Let's see. Yes, hard to tell but yeah, it's definitely Android. Do you think Google gave him some a little something to do that or?
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:23.560]   Or do you think they're just doing it on their own?
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:26.280]   Yeah, she's definitely holding it
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:29.320]   Six P because I see the fingerprint reader right there, right?
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:36.600]   But wait a minute isn't the camera in the middle there? I don't know. I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to we're gonna get Miriams
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:38.600]   War on this one because that looks like
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:40.800]   That might not be a six P. I
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:44.600]   See a fingerprint reader though
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:56.200]   Might be that's a five X also or the the one that's not the P the six X
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:58.200]   Oh, it's a six
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:06.520]   It's just a six. Yeah, what's got a sham ooh, so that's old that's old school women how'd I get that? No, that's cuz it was made a while ago. Yeah. Oh, was it?
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:10.640]   Yeah, I don't know how does TV work
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:15.320]   Not like this
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:25.240]   When did the Google the Google results are probably this week to that? Oh, that's right probably be interesting to say
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:31.440]   Could Google could Google become the number one company bigger than Apple? Oh interesting
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:34.040]   We shall we shall see
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:40.680]   I don't I don't know if I have a product. I seem like I have a lot of products, but I don't have anything right off the top
[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:42.520]   You have Billy Jason
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:45.560]   I have the horse's mouth two ninety nine on Amazon
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:49.000]   And I've been a people yeah
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:54.200]   Well, well worth it. I think that was an X is six. She was holding that would be my guess
[01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:58.280]   Although we're now learned I'm being told by the year people
[01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:01.640]   That that show was filmed in July
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:08.680]   Isn't it funny because it really isn't the year people to chat room, but if there were somewhere there we go
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:10.520]   Here's this horse's mouth trailer. Ladies and gentlemen
