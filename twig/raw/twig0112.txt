[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.000]   And I want to clarify, when we say this week in Google,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.680]   we mean Google, the cloud, Facebook, Twitter, Google+,
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.280]   everything that's going on, basically.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.880]   Because we've got two of the best commentators in the business
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.800]   to talk about all of this stuff.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.560]   To my left, Gina Tarpani of smarterware.org,
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.280]   founder of Life Hacker and programmer for thinkupapp.com.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.200]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.560]   Hi.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.160]   How's it going?
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.200]   Great.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.720]   Good.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.000]   Glee fan.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.800]   My favorite time of the week, Twig is--
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.000]   Twig.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.440]   Right after Glig's here.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.000]   Tuesday night.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.560]   After Glig.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.760]   Tuesday night.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.840]   Well, it's not airing right now.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   So it's Twig right now.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.280]   We're in between shows.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.600]   You're here.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.240]   You're absolutely right.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.040]   Soon.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.000]   Nothing wrong with reruns.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.640]   Also to my right, Jeff Jarvis, who
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.080]   is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York,
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.840]   the author of what would Google do in a brand new book, which
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.760]   is emerging next week, right?
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.320]   Public parts.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.880]   27th, I put the entire introduction up in text.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.200]   And watch out audio on Buzz Machine this morning.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.240]   Oh, awesome.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.760]   Buzz Machine.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.440]   Shout outs.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.760]   A few shout outs to Twigner.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.280]   Twig.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.880]   Thank you.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.440]   Buzz Machine.com, if you'd like to know more.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.640]   And I think to read the introductions, probably a good way
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.760]   to-- I always read the introduction,
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.560]   if I see if I want to read a book.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.840]   I actually don't like introductions.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.560]   I never read them.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.560]   My editor thinks I'm not the one I did one in this case.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.360]   I think it's nice because it's a table setter.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.000]   It's a summery, yeah.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.840]   I'm in the paper ring this right now.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.280]   I got it.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.960]   Facebook, my son Jake, told me, was my favorite part
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.680]   of high school.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.400]   And then you say, I don't think I had a favorite part
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.840]   of high school myself.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.640]   This is great.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.840]   This is really great.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.800]   I cannot wait to read this.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.200]   Thank you.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.680]   So Gina, I came back last night.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.240]   I had a crappy day yesterday.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.840]   And I tweeted, you know, a crappy day.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.000]   I need a glee night.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.280]   And I watched the New York episode, which I've never seen.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.080]   And the great thing was people asked me in Twitter
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.680]   and all around, did you start watching this?
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.800]   Because of Gina?
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.800]   I did.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.520]   Yes, as a matter of fact.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.520]   Mission accomplished.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.880]   She's the glee-one, the vector glee, the original glee.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.800]   I had a few listeners tell me on Google+
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.600]   that they started watching glee sort of begrudgingly
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.760]   and then got hooked because of this show.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.680]   So you know, I don't know.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.680]   They got advertised too.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.080]   Awesome.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.160]   And Chipotle.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.120]   Absolutely.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.720]   We did not do a show with you, Jeff, last week, right?
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.440]   I can't remember now.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.960]   Were we missing Jeff?
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.640]   No, we had Kevin-- we had everybody.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.160]   We had everybody.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.360]   Kevin, yeah, last week it was a year,
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.960]   week before last year.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.200]   And we did talk a little bit about 9/11.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.040]   But of course, it was September 8th that you posted 9/11
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.760]   in the mirror, your blog post about both you and Gina
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.120]   have in the past talked a little bit about your experiences
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.200]   because you were both in New York.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.720]   Right.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.840]   And had some very direct experiences from 9/11.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.360]   I was curious--
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.520]   We did not do a big 9/11 thing on Twitch
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.040]   because I figured everybody and their brother
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.760]   was going to do that.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.480]   I was going to basically ignore it.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.280]   I mean, that's wrong to say.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.320]   I'm very conscious of the day, but I was not
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.040]   going to write about it.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.840]   I was not going to do anymore.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.960]   I was just going to say, OK, I'm moving on.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.880]   And that morning, on Sunday morning,
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.400]   I was sitting on my bed and just tweeted, oh, gee,
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.440]   I would be on the train right now going to the World Trade
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.160]   Center 10 years ago.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.720]   And then I did the next one.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.240]   And then I ended up doing all day real time
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.200]   my recollections from 9/11.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.800]   And I got-- great reaction.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.480]   I got a few people who did not like it.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.040]   But--
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.480]   There is a large group on Twitter
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.080]   that don't like it when you post anything.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.480]   Yes.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.600]   They say, shut up.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.800]   And it's like, oh, you follow me because I don't post very
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.120]   often, is that it?
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.480]   Right.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.000]   So I-- in fact, for the first time,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.280]   I started blocking some people.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.160]   All you're going to do is announce you don't like me.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.920]   Then fine, I'll do you the favor of getting rid of me.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.320]   Save you some trouble, yeah.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.520]   But apart from that, it was really
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.400]   an amazing experience.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.560]   What it also threw into me--
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.560]   there's a store fire there somewhere, I think.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.400]   Oh, is there OK?
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.560]   Because I was just going to go back and go through.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.840]   I should put up that link.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.480]   But what struck me again was, what
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.080]   if we'd had Twitter that day?
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.840]   And Catherine Waymith, who's the publisher and family
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.160]   representative of the Washington Post,
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.120]   said that it'd be horrible and be awful because it'd
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.840]   be so graphic.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.320]   Well, that's reality.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.120]   Yes, it's not filtered by the journalists.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.200]   But my god will be.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.600]   Now, the other thing that happened to me
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.320]   was I was rate-limited at one point.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.720]   And Andy Carvin was nice enough to get to Katie Stanton.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.240]   And they whitelisted me.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.240]   But you think, too, what if in the middle
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.280]   of this event, people suddenly got rate-limited
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.720]   as they're trying to talk to their families
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.560]   or trying to tell the world what's happening?
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.200]   Twitter now has a responsibility as a platform.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.040]   And Dick Costolo did say in Twitter
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.720]   that that was a legacy of a rather crude effort
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.880]   to deal with abuse.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.680]   And they know that they've got to be more sophisticated
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.020]   about it.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.600]   But it was an interesting-- I didn't mean to do it.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.000]   I had no intention of doing it.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.240]   I ended up just doing it.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.160]   And as always, in these situations, I learned stuff.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.120]   What a nice idea.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.800]   I like that.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.240]   It was a great series of tweets.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.240]   And it's interesting.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.560]   That question about whether or not Twitter
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.840]   had been around in 2001.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.960]   If it had been, you wouldn't be able to retrieve your tweets
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.720]   from that day, because they would have been beyond Twitter's
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.120]   ability to go back and search.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.160]   Twitter's current state is not a good archiving tool.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.960]   And it's not a good tool for being
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.600]   able to do what you did post a long series of messages,
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.960]   because those rate limits.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.320]   So sorry, I just had to get in a little bit
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.320]   of a plug for ThinkUp or for any sort of archiving,
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.040]   any kind of platform that you own
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.160]   and that you can archive over time.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.520]   Your blog posts-- I mean, you have all your old posts, right,
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.440]   Jeff, from when you started your first blog?
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.560]   Fortunately, the old design got hacked,
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.200]   and I've got horrible links in them.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.320]   And I don't know what to do about that.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.640]   I need to hire somebody to go fix it.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.520]   But yes, I have them.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.600]   Yeah, so it's interesting.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.400]   Twitter really is for things that are kind of fleeting.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.240]   At the same time, I watched your tweets all day.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.160]   I was feeling sad about the day.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.840]   And I decided not to write about it.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.120]   And I tried to avoid most of the media porn.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.240]   But I watched your tweets going by, and I was just like, man,
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.040]   this is incredible.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.320]   So I love that we have these kinds of real-time tools
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.160]   for having these conversations in real time.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.360]   But at the same time, I worry about permanence and archiving
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.560]   and where these things go.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.680]   Where are those tweets that you posted this past 9/11
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.800]   going to be next 9/11?
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.160]   I hope that Twitter kind of steps up with that.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.800]   It's a problem, Gina, in all kinds of ways,
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.040]   and digital media at all.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.520]   When I interviewed Elizabeth Einstein,
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.560]   who's the key Gutenberg scholar,
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.680]   she came to an interesting defense of the book.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.640]   She said, floppy this around in 500 years
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.640]   like the Gutenberg Bible is.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.480]   That the paper has much more permanence
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.200]   that we don't have that kind of crypt of information.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.600]   Dave Weiner talks about how you have
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.840]   your personal digital legacy.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.200]   What if I happened to be in that day?
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.000]   What if God forbid, as I came close to, I got and killed?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.240]   What's your legacy that lives on?
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.760]   How does that live on online?
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.520]   We're so fleeting in how we think digitally.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.720]   And there are some advantages to being fleeting.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.560]   Definitely.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.400]   The whole question of going away is all right, too.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.760]   But I actually think that Google+ being fleeting
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.760]   may be a factor in fewer, for me, fewer trolls there
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.560]   because it's not worth it to schmutz.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.920]   Oops.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.240]   I think those are camera.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.080]   Dang.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.080]   So where is the storeify of this?
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.080]   If I go to storeify.com/jefjargvus, will I find you?
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.360]   Yeah, if you just Google "Jeff Jarvis storeify 9/11",
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.200]   you'll find it.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.040]   Okay.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.080]   There's quite a few of these.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.400]   Holy cow.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.920]   You've used this a lot.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.520]   So storeify is a way--
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.600]   No, no, it wasn't me.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.320]   It's somebody else did it.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.160]   Those are ones I did.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.040]   Somebody else did it for me.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.680]   Yeah, if you Google "Jeff Jarvis storeify 9/11",
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.520]   you'll find the first one.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.800]   What do you think Gina about?
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.240]   I mean, look, ThinkUp app is great,
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.120]   but not everybody can run a server.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.640]   Oh, yeah, it's not a practical solution
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.200]   for most users, for sure.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.600]   And so there's no--
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.360]   Yeah, but eventually there will be, I suppose,
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.640]   if you run a server and make it a public server
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.160]   or something like that.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.360]   Is this another way to do it?
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.200]   This seems like--
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.480]   I mean, so Mary Bjornabai did this--
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.480]   This is highly manual.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.480]   I mean, it's storeify--
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.320]   She did it by hand.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.160]   It's wonderful.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.000]   It's very manual.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.840]   Okay.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.680]   It needs a view on.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.680]   It doesn't--
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.680]   It's a way to present a conversation or a narrative.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.160]   You know what I like about it, though,
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.800]   is it's in chronological order.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.120]   I have to read Twitter upside down.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.000]   Right.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.800]   She did that.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.200]   So she's very grateful.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.000]   And now this is preserved beyond Twitter's ability
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.120]   to preserve.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.120]   I mean, I guess you could liken it to--
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.840]   If we have a conversation on the street
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.320]   and it affects one of us, one of us
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.920]   has to take the time to write it down or store it someplace
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.000]   to remember it.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.320]   But a lot of conversations aren't remembered.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.800]   I guess Twitter is kind of the same way.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.480]   And I think storeify is a great way
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.920]   to take a collection of tweets and make them--
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.920]   can curate them and make them readable.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.520]   And I think there are going to be lots of tools
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.880]   to do this kind of thing.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.840]   But--
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.840]   I don't--
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.280]   I use a tool-- this is weird-- that puts my tweets
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.520]   into my Google Calendar as a calendar entry.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.320]   Oh, yes.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.560]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.280]   I've seen that.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.920]   And I presume it stays there as long as my Google Calendar
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.480]   doesn't wipe them off.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.840]   It's another cloud question, yeah.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.360]   But--
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.400]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.400]   It's not good for this because you have hundreds
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.680]   of posts from one day.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.960]   But if you don't post to Twitter dozens of times a day,
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.640]   this is nice because it also has a timestamp.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.840]   So which Twitter has now lost.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.960]   They'll just say September 11th.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.760]   So this is-- you actually sat there all day and did this?
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.520]   I was in and out.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.400]   When I got Ray Limited, I went out for my run.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.600]   And I came back and then I filled in what would have happened
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.200]   in the interim in Google+.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.880]   But they were large-- once the South Tower came down
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.280]   and I escaped that, there were large chunks of time
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.200]   of just nothing but walking.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.800]   You know what I find really interesting?
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.760]   I agree with you on the media porn, Gina.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.240]   I thought a lot of the media coverage was self-serving.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.400]   There were some moving things.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.640]   Seeing Paul Simon sing "Sounds of Silence" at ground zero,
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.480]   I'm bawling my eyes out.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:35.160]   But in general, a lot of it just didn't seem like great coverage.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.560]   But this, which is a totally new medium and a new way of--
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.960]   I mean, who would have ever thought of this?
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.960]   This is surprisingly--
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.800]   I will have thought.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.560]   --pounds for--
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:50.040]   did-- when "Private Parts" was on cable, Howard Stern
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:54.440]   did a real-time background--
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.960]   back channel-- of the things that he remembered and did
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.600]   at the making of the movie, which was a really interesting way
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.160]   to use Twitter.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.880]   So if you were watching the movie while you were watching
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.520]   Twitter, it became a new channel.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.120]   Now, meanwhile, "The Guardian"--
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.960]   So that's like a DVD commentary.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.480]   Right.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.480]   It's text on Twitter.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.720]   And it's a critical experience.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   You've been asking questions and you'd answer.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.600]   And it's so--
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.400]   Wow.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:16.720]   That's kind of--
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.800]   "The Guardian" did something else.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.880]   "The Guardian" created a new Twitter account
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.200]   and did nothing but act as if it was that day.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.560]   And they had to stop it because people were so angry.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.320]   Because it's more the world's problem.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:27.760]   Right.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.400]   Right.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.320]   You know, it's steward-- you know, a plane crashes.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.080]   What?
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.920]   And it was never that there was past tense.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.600]   So it's really interesting that we're, again,
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.240]   the all these tools.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.040]   We're trying to figure out what they can do
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.200]   and what we can do with them.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.200]   There was some amazing uses of Twitter.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.400]   There's the diary of a girl from the 19th century,
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.240]   the day by day, the entries in the diary are posted.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.200]   There's, of course, the fake Darth Vader and all of that,
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.080]   which I find quite amusing.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.320]   Stuff my dad says, which became a book.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.360]   But it's also temporary.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.080]   Which is the nature, I guess, of everything now on that.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.160]   I mean, that's what goes on.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.440]   Gina, I love it that you've addressed this in some way.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.640]   Yes.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.280]   Well, I mean, I think--
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.360]   I just-- I've spent a lot of time writing on Twitter
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.920]   just because it's so easy.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.920]   And I've had some really good conversations on Twitter.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.520]   And I've gotten some awesome insight
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.080]   and interesting information on Twitter.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.400]   And I just don't want to lose it.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.080]   And I don't know.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.880]   Maybe I think that 9/11, especially, this whole never
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.360]   forget, always remember thing.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.840]   I mean, it really made me think about--
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.440]   I think that forgetting sometimes is good.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.720]   And having conversations that just sort of dissipate
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.520]   into the wind and to your memory are good.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.960]   But something like this, what Jeff did, I was like,
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.040]   this is an incredible first-person account happening
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.560]   kind of real times, something that I
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.280]   know that Jeff has written about this a lot in other mediums.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.280]   But I thought, wow, I'd love to have this all in one place.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.760]   And I think it's great that someone put together the store
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.520]   if I--
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.880]   I hope I never do this again now.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.920]   I mean, I've done it around the time I recorded something.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.800]   I've written about it.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.080]   I hope that's it for me.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.640]   I'm not trying to get away from 9/11, but just say, OK,
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.320]   it's by litany.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.440]   I've lived in the past enough.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.640]   Yeah, it's time.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.240]   I mean, it's time.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.280]   I think the 10-year really was for me anyway.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.160]   It's time to--
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:12.640]   I can't wait.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.760]   I'm coming to New York next month.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.160]   I cannot wait to see Tower One and those beautiful triangles.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.480]   Did you make a reservation for the memorial?
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.760]   I heard that their book through September.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.960]   I haven't made the reservation yet.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.800]   But we lost a family friend.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.160]   And I want to see his name.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.160]   So I'm going to have to make a reservation.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.400]   It's going to be mid-October.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.400]   So we'll see.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.080]   I can get in there.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:35.920]   Go look.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.880]   Hey, Twitter's Twitter's--
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.040]   let Gina do it first.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:39.880]   Then you can go.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.400]   You can go to the site.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.440]   And I'm seeing it on September 22.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.960]   That's what I got in.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.200]   And they give you every half of the time.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.200]   So you have to make a reservation to even approach
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.040]   the memorial to be inside the memorial, yes.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.040]   And I came up the path station, as I did 10 years ago, yesterday.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.400]   And it's kind of wacky because you come--
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.560]   I write in the Twitter feed about how I came up that day.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.640]   And it was silent.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.160]   And it was never silent in the concourse of World Trade Center.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.520]   And it was a different sound.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.760]   And I came up then yesterday up to the top of the escalator
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.120]   again.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.360]   And suddenly I heard water, which was really weird.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.360]   I mean, why I was there.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.120]   It was a memorial.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.160]   But that was very strange.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.200]   It was a whole new sound.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.920]   And it affected kind of the mood of everything.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.120]   Because the memorial is now--
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.520]   you can't see it.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.880]   But you hear it around.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.520]   It's very interesting.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.000]   Wow.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.840]   I don't know what to think.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.080]   I mean, of course, there's the 9/11 story, which
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.200]   is powerful and important.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.080]   But there's also this new media and social media story
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.560]   around it.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:46.280]   And Facebook and Twitter, as you say, weren't there?
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.000]   Would Google+ have been a better medium than Twitter?
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.640]   Do you think for recording this, Jeff?
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.680]   Why did you not use Google+?
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.920]   Because it's not chronological in any way.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.720]   It breaks the cron.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.360]   Because of the comments?
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.560]   Not so much that.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.560]   I think it's just that--
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.560]   You could have made it without comment.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.680]   You could have turned off comments.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.400]   No, no, no, it's not that.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.320]   It's the lack of chronology.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.080]   Because it breaks the cron and moves into the room.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:11.880]   Oh, because it rearranges it.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.360]   It wouldn't stay in order.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:13.860]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.600]   I think that's part of it.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.120]   And also, the front of the thing is,
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.920]   I don't know if we find this true, too.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.000]   If I just have that little Twitter-like observation,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   that's too little for Google+, don't you feel?
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.160]   I feel like you've got to write something or share something
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.040]   or some note on Google+.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:30.840]   Like a blog post.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.160]   I'm not going to do a one-line blog post saying, hey,
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.880]   you're kind of a Jerry Seinfeld joke.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.240]   Did you ever think why?
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.240]   I've done Twitter links posts on Google+.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.200]   And I agree with you.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.000]   You don't see very many of them.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.080]   I don't know if it's so bad.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.400]   Comments have been--
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.520]   I did a Jerry Seinfeld.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.360]   I said, why is it that they--
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.320]   I was cooking breakfast the smoke alarm went off.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.280]   I said, why is it they always put a smoke alarm in the kitchen?
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.600]   And there were actually some good comments
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.320]   follow up from that.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.360]   Like, my kids consider it their wake up.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.800]   The smoke alarm goes off.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.520]   It means breakfast is ready.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.020]   I agree.
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:08.920]   I feel a little more pressure.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.640]   I feel pressure to write a little more on Google+.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.400]   I think that's why I haven't been as active,
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.600]   because I don't feel like I could--
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.680]   so I feel like I need to have a really good link with an image
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.360]   and something clever to say about it.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.840]   So this feels like a little more pressure,
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.720]   because there's more room.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.800]   But at the same time, the feedback is amazing on Google+.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.280]   And you just get so many comments
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.840]   and such great conversations going on.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.440]   That Twitter just can't--
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.920]   It really is going to be smart.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.720]   This is where photographers have a great advantage,
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.600]   because they just post an image.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.400]   And that's enough.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.000]   That's considered enough, right?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.480]   Yep.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.920]   And here's one that just says, breathe, just breathe
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.720]   from Lotus Carroll.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.960]   And that's all you have to do.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.120]   And then she's got 15 comments, 37 pluses, three shares.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.520]   So they have a real advantage.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.240]   One picture is worth a thousand words on Google+.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.840]   Well, I know we'll get to Facebook in a second,
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.360]   but that's-- but it's interesting what
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.400]   fascinates me about the changes that Facebook's
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.520]   been doing yesterday, and two weeks ago, and Twitter,
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.400]   and Google+ is I think we're starting
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.680]   to come to kind of a consensus of how
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.480]   we look at interaction online.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.280]   The notions of following of a--
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.000]   now Facebook's going to be asynchronous, too,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.840]   which we'll explain in a minute.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.720]   The idea of control at the point in time of sharing--
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.680]   these kinds of things start to-- we're seeing a commonality.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.200]   You can argue it's just copycat and theft,
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.360]   but I don't think so.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.280]   I think it's things are emerging as standards and ways
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.480]   that we want to share in new season.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.520]   Now, even so, we use all three of those services differently
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.480]   and probably will for a long time.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.960]   But there's a commonality in terms of expectations
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.760]   that I find fascinating.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:43.760]   I totally agree.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.240]   Different cultures, but seeing kind of mental models
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.120]   around actions, whether it's a like or a favorite or a plus one,
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.480]   we all know that that's the way to say, hey, this is something
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.080]   I like or way to go to the user.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.960]   And even just sharing links, having the title and a description
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.040]   or the thumbnail, those look very similar on Facebook
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.200]   and Google+.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.400]   So-- and even Twitter is kind of getting there
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.360]   with some of the embedded media.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.120]   But it's really nice to see commonly understood interface
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.840]   mechanisms for users across new services.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.520]   Well, let's take a break and come back.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.960]   And we will talk about the new Facebook.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.560]   But before we take a break, a word from the Vinkle Voss twins.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.360]   Hey, that's a good idea.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:25.920]   What?
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.760]   Cracking like that could be huge.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.880]   Think someone will steal it.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.080]   The Winkle Voss twins?
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:30.760]   Who do that?
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.760]   Do it cautiously.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.040]   That's one way to capitalize on it.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.880]   Who do that?
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.480]   We shall return and just-- I think that's just great.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.000]   Those pistachio nuts as have been very clever.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.480]   Makes me want to eat one.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.480]   Let us take a break and talk about a brand new sponsor.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.000]   We want to welcome Vast Conference to our program.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.840]   It's always nice to have a new sponsor on our Twitch shows.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.520]   And Vast Conference is great.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.000]   It's a conference call system that's absolutely free.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.120]   If you go to vastconference.com and use the offer code Twig,
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.080]   you could set it up literally in 60 seconds.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.120]   And then once you start having conference calls
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.840]   two and a half cents per minute, you
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.200]   can use a toll free number for only another three and a half
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.760]   cents a minute.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.280]   These are great for audio conference calls.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.040]   Let me just show you.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.200]   I'm logged into my conference here.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.400]   And I'll just show you the dashboards.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.760]   Fantastic.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.280]   Now you see, I haven't made any calls on this account yet.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.760]   This is a new account I created for the show.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.840]   I didn't want you to see everything.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.720]   But this is how easy it is to do.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.800]   You can record the conference calls, which is fantastic.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.360]   You can give out a dial in number that's always the same,
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.000]   makes it very easy to-- that's your number.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.440]   You can clear connections when you and your participants
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.800]   call in the connections are very clear.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.800]   It's not VoIP based.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.480]   It's phone based.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:02.320]   And you can have huge conference calls from up to 300
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.400]   callers at the same time, which I think is very cool.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.800]   They use fiber optic lines, high-end teleconferencing
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.360]   equipment.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.200]   This is not VoIP.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.440]   This is really good quality phones.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.040]   And the management information is just fantastic.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.200]   I want you to take a look at it.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:22.040]   Vastconference.com.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.840]   They're giving our audience an exclusive deal, two free
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.800]   conference calls, up to 300 minutes, to give you a chance
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.160]   to try out the service.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.720]   Now, each two-- the minutes are per caller.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.680]   So two calls times five callers times 30 minutes would be
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.480]   300 minutes.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.360]   You get it?
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.680]   Go to vastconference.com.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.320]   Sign up for your free account.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.720]   And they'll give you a regular toll number and an 800 number
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.000]   for people to call.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.640]   And you can start calling right now.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.720]   Use the promo code TWIG when you sign up so that you get
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.920]   your 300 minutes free.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.280]   Vastconference.com.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.440]   Very nice.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.920]   So I'm afraid I'm not following all this Facebook stuff.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.280]   What's going on on Facebook?
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.000]   They've added a subscribe link.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.920]   That's wild.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.200]   Are we seeing it yet?
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:11.680]   Or is it--
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.000]   Yeah, you can go now and you can turn it on.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.480]   And this adds to the-- they did new lists stuff yesterday,
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.000]   which of course follows circles.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   The subscribers really--
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.360]   Right.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.120]   And it's automated.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.240]   The lists are automated, right?
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.480]   They are suggested.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.600]   Suggested.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.120]   I think.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.240]   And you can manage them, right?
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:33.000]   And so what this adds up to is that Facebook is giving you
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.840]   more control over what appears on your page.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.840]   It's giving you more control over whom you share with.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.000]   It's like grammatical violation there.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.160]   And it now gives people the ability to subscribe to you.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.000]   But there's new controls on both sides of that.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Look at this.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.320]   There's poll questions too.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.320]   That's kind of new.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.360]   So what's going to be post the questions?
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.440]   You can say that this goes just to the circle of friends.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.960]   You can say this goes to the public, those who subscribe to me.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.840]   So it's a far more public Facebook.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.480]   But you have more control over that publicness.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.120]   Interestingly, the subscriber--
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.880]   if Gina subscribes to me, she could say,
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.760]   I really don't want to hear any more from that bozo.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.440]   But I want to see his pictures.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.360]   She could subscribe only to my--
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.320]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.000]   That's interesting.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.600]   But what this becomes is Facebook becomes asynchronous.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.120]   Right?
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.400]   And this is a really big change to their model.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:24.920]   Exactly.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.720]   Relationships.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.280]   It's huge.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.280]   So you still have that.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.240]   And you still have the ability to publish and share with just
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.120]   those people in your synchronous world.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.960]   But from the same platform, the same profile,
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.520]   you can now share with others.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.080]   And they told me-- and I went through the call with them
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.160]   yesterday--
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.400]   and I said, what about an author?
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.880]   And their view is that if you're Leola Port or an author
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.000]   or someone who updates your own stuff as an individual,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.280]   you probably get rid of your fan page.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.800]   This now is substituted by your company.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.240]   You can't have a profile page.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.760]   So you have a fan page instead.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.640]   But if you're a person, people should be able to follow you.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.840]   And this becomes your tool for sharing in all kinds
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.880]   of newer, richer way.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.760]   So this is something you have to opt into.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.280]   You go to the subscriptions page, and you say,
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.720]   allow subscribers.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.120]   Now people who are not in your circle of friends--
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:14.600]   Exactly.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.640]   Anyone can now subscribe to me.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.840]   Allow anyone to comment on your public updates.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.480]   All right, what the hell?
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.240]   And notifications get notified about these new subscribers.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.600]   Well, I already, by the way, Facebook kind of automatically
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.840]   made me start to get digest emails, which is actually--
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.320]   I would have done that anyway.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:33.880]   I don't like it.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.720]   Notifications.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.760]   But so I don't have to worry about that.
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.520]   So now people could subscribe.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.400]   Have you done that, Jeff?
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:39.960]   Do you ever have to--
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.560]   Yeah, I did it.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.000]   I did it.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.360]   So you could subscribe to me.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.080]   Well, let me do that.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.680]   Let me go to Jeff.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.800]   Now I'm a friend of yours, so presumably--
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.760]   would I have had this subscribe message?
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.720]   You could go to Brian's Stelter, for example.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.440]   He just turned his on or massively--
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.240]   So because you're a friend, I'm already subscribed.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.720]   You're subscribed, right, exactly.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.440]   But if I don't have your friend to Brian's Stelter,
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.040]   I am not.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.560]   So now I have subscribed to Brian's updates.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.440]   Brian, now you can subscribe to him.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.240]   Brian allows anyone to subscribe.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.320]   OK, so I subscribe to him.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.640]   So now does he just appear in my news feed as if you're a friend?
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.800]   You can say-- you can also--
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:15.640]   I don't know where you do it.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.400]   You can also set a level for him.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.000]   You can say, give me everything Brian says.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.720]   You can say, give me the chosen amount as you would
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:27.840]   in the news feed now or give me only certain media types.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.560]   I don't know where you get to those controls.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.160]   I've decided that.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.560]   But that's really interesting.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.600]   Now again, the problem with Facebook
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.360]   is that often it could get way too complicated.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.760]   Right.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.240]   But as Gina said, what was that mental map you said, Gina?
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.280]   I like that.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.040]   Yes, just a mental model of the UI.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.440]   So I'm the little model of Facebook.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.240]   Now I have a fan page, which is the Leo Laporte.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.960]   But you could also go to Leo G. Laporte.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.600]   And that's my regular page and follow all my private updates.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.640]   But now I have to rethink my private updates,
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.400]   because I've been putting in stuff like what gas station I'm at.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.000]   But that's-- people won't see that.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   They won't see that.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.480]   They'll only see your public updates.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.160]   You post now.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.920]   You can post to a circle or--
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.440]   pardon me-- a list of friends.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.520]   Or you can post to the public.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.680]   See that public.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.760]   Now everything I do is public.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.440]   So I'm going to have to rethink that.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.560]   This is interesting.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.960]   Now let me ask another question.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.200]   Gina, are you doing this?
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.920]   Well, actually, it's interesting.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.080]   I have a page.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.280]   I have a Facebook page for me, which is my public stuff.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.680]   And I told everyone, that's what you spine when you find me.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.600]   But that that you're looking at right now is my private profile.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.040]   But only friends can see.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.440]   Right, so I don't get a subscriber.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.720]   I'm a real world now, but--
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.760]   No, no, no.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.120]   Well, no, because I have my user profile set.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.800]   So I was using Facebook as my private profile
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:46.680]   and my page was public.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.840]   And here's your public page.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.040]   And that's my public page, right?
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.920]   Which, by the way, I haven't liked yet.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   Well, and that, I kind of--
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.520]   I like that.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:53.920]   --like that.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.720]   --blog posts and Twitter tweets without hashtags or ad
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   times, too.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.720]   So it's interesting.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.840]   This gives me the ability.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.920]   It gives anyone the ability.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.160]   I mean, you're really kind of--
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.880]   anybody who-- any person individual who has a fan page
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.160]   can actually ditch the fan page except I
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.480]   don't want to ditch my fan page because I've
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.360]   got a few hundred people following it.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.400]   And you don't have--
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.280]   and combine it with your profile.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.880]   Well, I mean, I have a fan page as well,
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.040]   which is the Leel Report.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.120]   There's 4,000 people on that.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.640]   So you're right.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.760]   Now we got a question here, right?
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.600]   I mean, the other interesting thing about Facebook
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.280]   is that it automatically sucks in pages from Wikipedia.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.960]   So there's a Wikipedia page about me.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.200]   So there's also a Wikipedia-based page about me and Facebook.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.080]   So that means that there are two pages and one private profile.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.080]   So I don't know--
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.680]   Did you do that or did that do that automatically?
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.800]   No, that happened automatically.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.920]   I didn't do that.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.720]   That just showed up.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.560]   I'm sure the two of you probably have the same.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.800]   How would I find that?
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.440]   It's called a community page.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.440]   Let's see if I just search for Leo.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.360]   That's really-- OK.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.040]   By the way, this is all--
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.640]   this is why Facebook has a problem,
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.520]   because it's so hard to keep up with this stuff.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.840]   Now I see recommendations in here, which
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.040]   is kind of a LinkedIn style on my fan page.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.280]   Easy for people to recommend your place to their friends.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:08.760]   This is just--
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.040]   Well, I don't understand what's that.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:11.800]   OK.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.640]   Let's learn more.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:18.400]   This is places.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.640]   This is places, I guess.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.520]   But I don't know how I have a place.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.560]   Boy, this is why people don't like Facebook.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.120]   This is so confusing.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.080]   So engineering.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.840]   Now I've got to say one thing that I
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.960]   don't know if I'll get this with the new thing is notice
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.320]   all the stats I'm getting.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.640]   So are the raw number of impressions
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.200]   on the story, the amount of number of comments
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.840]   and likes per impression?
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.360]   Right.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.720]   You get that with your page.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.560]   That's really nice.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.880]   This is handy, exactly.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.200]   Because you are kind of a business in and of yourself.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.640]   So yeah, so I want to see--
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.880]   Who is the author or freelancer?
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:51.380]   Right.
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.120]   So you want to see that stuff.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.720]   By the way, the biggest feedback I've received,
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.800]   whose idea was it to put the smoke detector so close
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.440]   to the kitchen?
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.880]   More people fed back to that than anything I posted in ages.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.600]   So there you go, right?
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.520]   I'm using a tool that actually cross posts
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.400]   from Google+ to Twitter and Facebook.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:10.880]   Right.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.080]   Now is anyone giving you crap for that?
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.880]   Well, nobody knows.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.920]   But when I post something, this is a--
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.040]   you see, I have this--
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.920]   I can also share it on Facebook or on Twitter.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.640]   And I can even set the Facebook settings
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.040]   and what pages I want this to go to.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.040]   This is actually a great little extension.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.600]   Which extension is that?
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   It's this one.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.800]   Publish Sync.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.200]   Oh, Publish Sync.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.080]   I just posted a link to your Wikipedia community page
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.440]   in the doc chat.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.560]   Oh, thank you.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.200]   All right.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.800]   If you-- I don't know if you haven't seen it.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.240]   Hide the-- yeah, there we go.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.200]   Hide the screen and I'm going to now go to the doc.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.400]   Oh, it's in the doc chat.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:51.920]   It's in the chat.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.400]   Yep.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.720]   Thank you.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.680]   Facebook.com/pages/leolopore.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.280]   So this happens-- is this something Wikipedia does?
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.960]   This is Facebook's community pages.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.280]   And I didn't do anything for it to happen for me.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.920]   I think it just pulls in pages from Wikipedia.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.880]   That's weird.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.280]   I got more followers on this one than my other one.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.000]   You're kidding.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.040]   Yeah, it's interesting, right?
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.920]   And I even know it existed.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.640]   I also don't know who's posting to it.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.280]   Apparently who's this is?
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:21.840]   Yeah, who's this is?
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.360]   That's funny.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.640]   I don't see posts on it, Leo.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.080]   I post-- related posts by friends.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.160]   Oh, Dick, that was her.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.520]   That's very strange.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.920]   So if the three of us are confused by all these things
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.200]   in Facebook, my in-laws are definitely going to be--
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.560]   Automatically creating a page on Facebook is weird
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.800]   that I didn't know about.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.240]   Yeah, do you see that it says from Wikipedia?
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:51.120]   And there's a description with your kind of Wikipedia summary.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.680]   Yeah, at the bottom there's a Wikipedia summary.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.040]   But that was stuck in there.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.320]   It's funny because I don't see the posts.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.800]   So does somebody-- maybe the chat room.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.800]   Does somebody know how this happens?
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.520]   Is Mark Zuckerberg a chat room?
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.640]   Magic, thank you.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.840]   MXX in the chat room explained this all.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.120]   And those posts are post that mention me.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.200]   And that's why, because my name is mentioned in there.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.680]   And he probably used that automatic drop down thing
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.440]   to make that name show up.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.720]   Wow.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.520]   So does this-- Jay, back to what you were saying.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.680]   Suddenly, Facebook is async.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.880]   Do you explore that a little bit farther
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.480]   about how this changes the model?
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.080]   Is this a big deal?
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.160]   Well, I mean, it's a really-- it's a huge deal.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.600]   Because Facebook's whole thing was that you could only
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.000]   friend someone who would friend you back,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.680]   and then resolve these social implications of that.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.560]   And I had a hard time figuring out how to use Facebook.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.360]   And so that's why I made the public page.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.720]   And then I had my private circle of friends.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.160]   This makes Facebook a lot more like Twitter
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.720]   and a lot more like Google+.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.840]   If you turn it on.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.320]   I mean, you don't have to turn it on.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.400]   If you turn it on, right.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:11.800]   So you can say people can subscribe to me or not.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.560]   So it just-- it makes a lot more Facebook data--
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.480]   Facebook content, public facing.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.440]   So I guess my question is, if I'm not logged into Facebook,
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.400]   and I go to somebody's page who has allowed subscriptions,
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.800]   can I see public posts without logging in?
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.920]   That's a good question.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.160]   Because before-- even before all this, right,
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.840]   you could post to public.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.760]   The thing was nobody could find you.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.840]   No one was following you.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.360]   There was no structure for that, right?
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.440]   Right.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.440]   Right.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.160]   I don't know what the legacy position
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.880]   should have asked that, whether the stuff that you
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.800]   had public before is still obviously public,
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.880]   because it always was.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.400]   Wow.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.720]   What's the definition of public before
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.640]   to the public public now?
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.400]   Even Kevin Rose is confused.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.640]   Look at this post on Facebook.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:55.040]   Anyone know how to convert Facebook fan pages to subscribers?
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.480]   He's got the same point we do.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:56.480]   Right.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.280]   It's the same problem.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.760]   Well, now we have subscribers.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.720]   Let me just use that.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.320]   And then there doesn't seem to be a-- well, wait a minute.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.440]   Facebook.com/publicfigures.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.680]   Absolutely blank.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.680]   Thank you very much.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.320]   There we go.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.680]   If you are a business, you can only use a page.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.320]   If you are an individual who wants to share updates
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.920]   with a larger audience, you may want to use a profile
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.960]   with subscribers.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.920]   Public figures, like Malcolm Gladwell,
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.880]   can use a profile with subscribe, a page, or both.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.360]   Oh, yeah, like heat wood.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.600]   Why do they use him as the user?
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.800]   Why Malcolm Gladwell?
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.640]   Of all people.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.680]   That's for the pro-legents.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.320]   The guy who says all this is crap and not useful.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.480]   Why Facebook do you pick Malcolm Gladwell?
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.760]   That's pretty funny.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.160]   It was with irony.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.880]   I think there's a little irony there.
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:43.800]   So this explains what the differences are.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:48.760]   You can download a subscriptions guide or page's best practices.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.000]   Oh, this is-- you know, one point
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.360]   does this become ridiculously complicated?
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:59.080]   Now, admittedly, if you're just a user,
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.880]   you have a Facebook page.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.480]   You don't even know that any of this is happening, right?
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.000]   Right.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.480]   Or care.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.480]   Does it change-- OK, so this is the question.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.800]   Does it change for just an average--
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.920]   you know, the high school junior who is keeping track
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.200]   of her friends on Facebook?
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.080]   Does this change her life in any way?
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.160]   Her default remains as it was.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.000]   Her default, right?
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.080]   She's not-- unless she inadvertently
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.840]   says, you know, turns on subscriptions.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.560]   So it wasn't a big difference between pages and profiles
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.200]   that there was a limit to how many friends you could have
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.120]   as a profile, but pages you could have any number of--
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.800]   And it was async.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.720]   And it was async.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.760]   Someone could like your page or follow your page without you--
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.280]   Right.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.240]   So subscribers, I assume that there's
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.720]   no limit on how many people could subscribe to your public posts.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.760]   I would presume as well.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.560]   It's the same thing.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.680]   Let's look at the subscriptions guide.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.520]   Cheese, Louise.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.680]   Allow people to subscribe to your personal profile.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:57.960]   Many personal public figures.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.960]   Use profiles to connect with--
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.000]   Now you're going to allow people--
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.120]   Unlimited number of subscribers.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.080]   And you can update them from your mobile phone.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:11.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.280]   How to get subscribers.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:14.640]   All right.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.440]   Should I use a personal profile with subscribers, a page or both?
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:18.800]   OK.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.160]   I guess this is an issue we probably
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.920]   don't have to spend a lot of time on, because most people
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.840]   aren't going to worry about this.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.640]   This is for public figures, right?
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.520]   Or would they?
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.440]   Now that's a question.
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.400]   The same kind of person who has a Twitter account
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.680]   and a Google+ account.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.240]   And I'm sure Facebook's considering this.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.000]   Maybe they would use Facebook and subscribers instead.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.080]   And say, just do it all on one page.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.000]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.600]   I mean, you can make the argument that everyone's
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.920]   a public figure, please, Dave.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.920]   How do I tell people--
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.200]   And this is a big issue.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.840]   How do I tell people where they can find me on Facebook?
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.760]   You could personalize it.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.320]   Well, you get a slash, Leo LePore.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.760]   Right here, Facebook slash Leo LePore.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.560]   You got that, right?
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.520]   Right.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.480]   Well, I just get the--
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.000]   Better than your Google+ profile.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.560]   Yeah, I didn't-- yeah, that's right.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.920]   You Google+, you don't have a magic name, do you?
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:06.840]   Now, you--
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.160]   Right, so you can just share your Facebook URL, which is nice.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.160]   Right.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.440]   You can choose your URL and you can just say, hey,
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.280]   subscribe to me here.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.320]   So let's see if they've changed that.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.160]   So my username is already set to LeoG LePore for my personal.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.880]   And then they have pages.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.040]   But they don't have--
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.560]   boy, they should kind of maybe update this, to say somehow,
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.880]   something to do with subscriptions.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.680]   So I guess I could just change my username.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.480]   No, I guess I can't.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.040]   They're not giving me that option.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.400]   Leo LePore and two other friends have started getting
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.480]   subscribers.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.720]   Oh, did you get a note?
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.680]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.480]   Top my news feed right now.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.880]   Oh, that's very interesting.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.080]   You turn on notifications?
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:50.040]   For subscribers?
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.520]   I haven't even enabled subscribers yet, because I haven't--
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.080]   Oh, I see.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:54.760]   I haven't.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.960]   You know, I tend to--
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.960]   You may not want to.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.680]   --pretty quiet.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.000]   I think I only have notifications for if someone tags me
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.360]   in a photo or send me a message.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.520]   You may not want to.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.320]   But yeah, no, I have to decide whether-- if I want to ditch
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:11.000]   all my fan of my page followers for subscribers.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.840]   And my profile has always been this kind of private thing.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.200]   So it's going to be interesting to mix both public and private
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:18.640]   content.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.560]   But I'm doing it on Google+ now, so that feels a little more
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.640]   natural.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.200]   Exactly.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.720]   You can imagine being Lady Gaga and actually having a private
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.200]   area and being publicly using the same tool.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.000]   And that's what they want.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.480]   They want to be the platform for interacting.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.480]   Not publishing interaction, conversation.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.480]   Right.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.360]   Every time they do something like this,
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:49.240]   it always feels like Mark knows what's best.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:52.840]   Do what Mark says, and everything will be OK.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.560]   I mean, it feels like a really interesting--
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.000]   I mean, not only do I like that there
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.480]   are becoming these standards and these models for interaction
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.240]   that are kind of standard across you services.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.840]   But it feels like a big admission on Facebook's part,
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.640]   like, oh, hey, this is a really good mechanism.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.360]   Something that we've avoided for a really long time.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.520]   But Twitter and Google+ does something
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.320]   to stand and have proved that people
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.440]   want to follow versus have that two-way friending.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.160]   And the list thing as well is, I feel,
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.960]   like, was definitely kind of a nod in Google+'s direction.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.640]   Saying, OK, what people do?
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.720]   People making lists is useful, and we
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:31.040]   want to make that action as fun as possible.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.840]   I think those are all good things.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.240]   Somebody has made a page for my shirts.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:41.320]   So this is the problem.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.680]   Does anybody can do anything, right?
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:43.160]   You're right.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.320]   Already I have 48 fans.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.000]   Or my-- I'm sorry, my shirts do.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.280]   I like it.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.080]   All right, moving along.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.840]   By the way, we know that Facebook is incredibly sticky.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.320]   I mean, there's certainly that.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.800]   Nielsen, which is apparently trying
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.920]   to move from the rating of television to social media,
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:08.000]   put out a report that said that Facebook, in the month
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.520]   of July--
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:14.080]   I'm sorry if I can find these exact figures for you--
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:18.080]   had a total of way, way larger than anybody else.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:21.120]   53-- now this isn't your number, is it?
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.160]   No, don't go on your side.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.360]   53-- every time I do a number--
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.920]   53 billion total minutes in the month of May.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.480]   That's so far beyond the number two,
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.040]   which is Yahoo! at 17 billion minutes.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:38.640]   Google, 12, AOL 11, and MSN Windows Live in Bing 9.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.120]   That's amazing.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.560]   Right, so take Google out of that,
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.560]   because Google is not-- Google is a utility, right?
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.200]   The difference here is that those other three,
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   and mind you all the media companies below,
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.760]   think their business's content,
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.440]   whereas Facebook enables the world to make content.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.480]   Interesting.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.560]   It is content, isn't it?
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.960]   It's a content site.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.320]   I don't know if I said this on the show before,
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.960]   but if I did, I think it hit the zap in my ear.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.040]   I know we have that, I think you guys.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.800]   You're the only one she ever uses it on.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.960]   Yeah, I know.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.760]   Now you just turn me off at the monitor.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.760]   Should we go to the phone?
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.760]   No, it's like, what's zap?
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.280]   Zap, Gina.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.080]   I had lunch with a former network president,
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.160]   a news president, some months ago,
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.920]   and he said, Facebook and Google
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.120]   use our content to make their stuff.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.880]   And they don't respect our content.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.200]   I said, no, they respect content more than you do,
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.360]   because they respect the idea
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.120]   that more people can make it than you do.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.560]   You think content is only what you make.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:35.560]   Right.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:37.400]   Facebook says the stuff that everybody does,
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.760]   yeah, that's content and there's value in it.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.320]   In fact, we're going to exploit it really well
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.200]   for advertising and services and targeting and all this stuff.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.840]   And so, you know, Facebook,
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.160]   but it's not a platform for content.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.000]   It's a platform for conversation,
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.560]   and the conversation happens to be content.
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.760]   I think.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.640]   It's very interesting.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.680]   We're going to take a break, come back.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.640]   There are some Google acquisitions
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.120]   to talk about a new Google service
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.880]   that's very interesting and a lot more.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.640]   Gina Tarpani is here from smarterware.org
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:10.000]   from buzzmachine.com, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.160]   Before we go much farther,
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.800]   let's tell you to back up your stuff.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.520]   It's so important and carbonite makes it easy.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.000]   They do it right, but they have home
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.920]   and business now, by the way.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:24.040]   But for the home user, $59 a year for unlimited backup,
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.440]   all the data on your internal drive,
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.920]   secure file transmission, 128-bit SSL,
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:34.160]   secure file storage, you hold the key, and very, boom.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.840]   That's the disaster that just happened.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.320]   No, I like it.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.680]   I like it.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.640]   Because you see, we all have so much important stuff
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.800]   on our computers and our hard drives, our images,
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.200]   our financial records, our email,
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.640]   and what could happen to that stuff?
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.480]   Boom.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.740]   (laughing)
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.480]   And then it's lost forever.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.480]   Even if you're backing up right next to your computer,
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.680]   that's why carbonite is such a great idea.
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.680]   You can try it free for two weeks right now.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.760]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.160]   Just you need our name and that's it.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.160]   If you go to carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIG.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.280]   You get 15 days without any expense
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.600]   or obligation on your part.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.880]   See how it works for you.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.120]   It uses your internet connection.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.160]   So whenever you're connected,
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.880]   and by the way, that doesn't just have to be at home.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.120]   If it's a laptop as you go around to cafes and so forth,
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.600]   it'll be backing up when you're at the Starbucks.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.640]   The recovery is simple.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.320]   It's even a cloud storage
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.440]   because you can log on to your carbonate account
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.360]   from any device, including a smartphone
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:33.080]   or an Android device or a tablet
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.560]   and see your data, all your stuff's there.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.400]   It's fantastic.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.640]   You can access any file anywhere, anytime.
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.640]   Completely, privately, completely security.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.120]   And when the disaster happens, and it always does,
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.320]   you can always get it back.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.880]   They've restored 7 billion files to date.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.360]   If you use the offer code TWIG,
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.440]   when you sign up for the trial,
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.800]   you use it again when you buy
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.640]   because you'll get 14 months for the price of 12.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.680]   Carbonite.com, and don't forget carbonite business
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.160]   for your small business.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.560]   It's a great solution for people
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.840]   with multiple computers in multiple locations.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.480]   Carbonite.com.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.320]   Boom!
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.680]   You gotta back it up to get it back.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.640]   I just can't believe I have a Leo LePort's shirts Facebook.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.440]   Google buys Zagat for $125 million.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.720]   I'm very happy for Tim and Nina,
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.000]   the owners of Zagat.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.200]   Why?
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.800]   Do Google buy Zagat, your theories.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.800]   (laughing)
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.120]   First of all, I wanna say,
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.240]   I've been using Zagat since it was the thin red book.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.040]   When I go to New York, or any big city,
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.640]   I pull out the Zagat, then I bought it on my iPhone,
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.560]   and I bought it on my Android.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.080]   It's 10 bucks, but it's worth it,
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.440]   because anywhere you are, you say,
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.440]   here's where I am, what's the best?
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.760]   I used in Paris and found great restaurants.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.280]   I am a Zagat fan.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.400]   But, you know, I actually, it's quite an old company, right?
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.560]   I mean, it's been around for a long time.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.080]   It's a paper company.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.240]   They make much longer than Google.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.640]   Yeah, they make books, it's crazy.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.160]   I felt like this had a lot to do with a story
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.600]   that we covered a few episodes ago
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.120]   about how Google pulled data from their places pages,
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.920]   that they pulled from places like Yelp
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:13.120]   and other local services.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.960]   I mean, I think this is just about Google wanting to own
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.440]   a lot of that data, that review data,
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.320]   and to be able to enhance their local services.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.400]   But, you know, they tried to buy Yelp and rebuffed.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.240]   Right, that's true.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.240]   They tried to buy Groupon and rebuffed.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.840]   So, I think, and boy, 125 million is cheap for Google.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.200]   Do we know who caused the dropping of the Yelp data?
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.600]   Was that initiated by Google?
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.480]   Was that initiated by Complain Yelp?
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.600]   I don't know.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.800]   I think Zagat is a better brand name than Yelp.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.200]   You asked me that question.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.560]   Do I use Yelp or Zagat?
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.640]   I would, if I have the choice, always use Zagat.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:49.280]   What's interesting to me is, my fear about this purchase
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.000]   is that if it's viewed as a content company,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.080]   Google should not be in the business of owning content
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.800]   companies, it puts them in channel conflict
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.760]   with all of the recipients of all the links they give.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.920]   And they will get accused of favoring their, you know,
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:04.400]   this content company over competitors, and so on and so on.
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.760]   However, I think, I'm hoping that Google being Google
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.480]   would look at Zagat as a platform.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.280]   It's a means to get better reviews,
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.040]   reviews that are filtered more,
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:18.720]   which is exactly what you just said, Leo, than Yelp,
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.240]   that they have a system for doing that.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:24.720]   And if you could scale Zagat and its systems out to reviews
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.800]   of lots and lots and lots and lots of local things
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.640]   across all platforms, which Zagat has too, right?
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.680]   They have reviews of SPAWs and other stuff.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:34.160]   I'm sure you use those often too, Leo.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.760]   Then, you know, Google can have a platform for quality reviews
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.800]   of local places done by us, the people.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.000]   That, I hope, is where Google would head here.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.800]   If they just say, oh, well, they did a neat thing
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.840]   in getting cheap content, and we're gonna put the content up
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:50.440]   and screw Yelp, we're never gonna link to them.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.440]   That'd be a problem.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.320]   - Remember when they tried to buy Yelp,
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.400]   I think if they were rebuffed, but I'm not sure,
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.720]   they created Hot Pot.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.120]   Do you remember Hot Pot?
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.840]   - Oh, God, yeah, geez.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.480]   - That's still bad, look, here's my Hot Pot account.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.480]   And if I go there, it says, hey, because you like
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.640]   Central Market, you might like graffiti or demcees.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:11.240]   These are restaurants in Petaluma with ratings, reviews.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:14.640]   - Jesus, I've forgotten entirely about that.
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.240]   So I think they might end up in channel conflict.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.080]   That's interesting, I hadn't thought about that.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.240]   I think that what this does is it gives a brand,
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.240]   I think they're buying a brand name.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:27.600]   I think it gives a brand name to what they're already doing
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:32.600]   in places in Hot Pot, in other,
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:37.680]   remember they had Yelp reviews in places,
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.320]   and then they were forced to drop them, right?
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.160]   - I thought that they had voluntarily,
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.240]   I thought there was a lawsuit,
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.200]   and that they had pulled them out.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.680]   - I think you're right.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.120]   - That they had volunteered to pull them out.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.600]   Yeah, I really wonder, is this,
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.080]   I got brand, they're gonna go away,
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.360]   I agree that this was a brand buy.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.000]   - Not the content, 'cause they've got content,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   but if you could brand their content with a quality brand,
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.480]   might not rub off.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.240]   - But isn't the ways that that works,
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:09.200]   that they have guides and highfalutin' foodies and critics
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.280]   who give their ratings, I mean, this isn't a crowd store,
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.120]   I mean Yelp is--
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.080]   - Oh, they got it, it's crowd store.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.360]   - Oh, it is, it is totally crowd store.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.720]   - But in a controlled way, you've got to,
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.240]   it's a higher bar than just saying,
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.480]   - I hated the burrito, right?
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.880]   You've got to fill out a whole form,
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.480]   you have to, I don't think it approved or not.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.720]   There's, it's kind of Google-like,
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.280]   I mean, they basically had a manual algorithm
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.880]   of how people got in and how they ranked them
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.440]   and did things back in the day.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.960]   It was a very old fashioned company,
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:39.040]   it was printing, closed, expensive books.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.520]   I know from my days at Coney and Ash,
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.840]   they had to kind of get dragged on the online,
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.360]   then they got very happy and all that,
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.680]   but they still sell products behind the paywall
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.000]   and at least at first, they're not gonna make it free,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.080]   they're still gonna be paid.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.040]   - Yeah, I'm curious, I imagine at some point,
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:54.920]   Google will make it free.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.680]   So right now, if you go to zagat.com,
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.840]   you get a directory, but not the reviews,
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:03.800]   those are all locked and to unlock the ratings,
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.200]   you have to pay for it, essentially.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.920]   I have to tell you, the ratings are so good
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.600]   and so valuable that I actually, I do,
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.400]   oh wait a minute, I'm getting some ratings here,
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.000]   Vino showed up for some reason.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.960]   Oh, it's a sample I see of premium content.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.920]   I absolutely trust it.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.440]   I trust it more in foodie areas,
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.880]   for instance in San Francisco or New York or Paris,
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:27.560]   than I do in less foodie areas, I won't name names,
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:30.060]   but Indianapolis leaps to mind.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.000]   Generally-- - But wait,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:33.840]   wait, wait, it's still over there.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:37.280]   I mean, Carabas, see, it used to be that for zagat,
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:40.760]   you'd be at higher end restaurant.
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.200]   - Well, it's not sorted, it's sorted by relevance, not by--
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:46.600]   - And now it's broader already.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.920]   Carabas is very good, good, it's not fancy,
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:50.880]   but it's in a strip mall.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.400]   - But it's a chain, yeah.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.120]   - So this is interesting, now the review,
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.400]   yeah, I don't think that that's interesting, huh?
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:02.640]   You know, notice we have a Google ad.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.760]   Google offers beta right at the front, at the top,
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.960]   which is their group on, right?
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.120]   So it looks like what's going on
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:14.960]   is Google rebuffed in its acquisitions,
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.200]   created its own, and then maybe a less expensive acquisition,
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.600]   buying zagat for the brand name.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:23.080]   - Yeah, I mean, it'd be interesting,
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.800]   I mean, they should keep the brand, unlock all the reviews,
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.760]   and build those zagat reviews into Google Place pages,
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.560]   and that will make Google Place pages extremely valuable.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.960]   - But what about the Jeff's point about channel conflict?
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.320]   Because--
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.240]   - It's a good point, it's a really good point.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.840]   I mean, we had kind of a similar conversation
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.760]   around the airline data, which we all have a big story about.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.800]   - Well, let's take a look at the Google Flight Search,
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.560]   'cause, you know, that's really,
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:50.060]   now this is the ITA acquisition that Google made.
[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:54.760]   - This is a really nice flight search.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:59.760]   - I think if I were Kayak or Hib Monk, I'd be a little worried.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.920]   - Yes, well, I don't know,
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.960]   because can you book, I don't think you can book,
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.080]   it's only, it's only--
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.600]   - It's only a search.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.000]   - What is the URL, it's not--
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.320]   - It's Google.com/flights.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.680]   - Flights, no urge.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.040]   - Or you could just put a search in saying,
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.400]   "Flights from San Jose 2," and it would--
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.720]   - Right, the Bing thing.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:20.080]   So it decided--
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.840]   - It has so many nice UI elements,
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.040]   look at that, it knows where you are,
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.800]   it has the drop down of the,
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.340]   where you wanna go, kind of already extended.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.320]   - I think it's kind of a really neat UI elements
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.200]   that-- - I can change the sliders here,
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.600]   if I increase the price, can I reduce the duration,
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.880]   you know, okay, let's get the shortest flight flight I can,
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.680]   that's the shortest flight I can get,
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.700]   and there it is.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:47.920]   It's very interesting.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:52.040]   It's very engineering-focused, isn't it?
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.280]   - Yes, very much, I mean,
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.240]   those interactive data visualizations--
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.680]   - Highly geeky, highly geeky.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.560]   - Highly geeky. - Are super, super geeky.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.120]   And you can change, yeah, like look at that,
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.920]   I love that, if you change the dates,
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.600]   you can see how the fare changes,
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.200]   so go on that calendar and move those dates around,
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.280]   and you'll see what the median price,
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.120]   how the median price changes--
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.040]   - It's going down, it's going up,
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.640]   it's actually, you know, you need this
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:14.520]   because the airlines, it's so freaking complicated.
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:15.720]   - 'Cause it's so hard, right?
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.200]   - You know, they're using out programmatic algorithms
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.400]   to determine pricing, you better darn well
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.480]   have a computer on your side
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:22.840]   if you're gonna get the best price.
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.360]   - So Google is not booking tickets, right?
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.520]   - I don't think so, let's see, let's take this ticket.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.280]   And let's imagine that it never will,
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.920]   in which case it could really disrupt--
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:35.560]   - It books it, but it sends it to JetBlue.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.880]   - Well, what is interesting, it's labeled as an ad,
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.920]   look, ads, JetBlue.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.520]   - No, it says airline site.
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.680]   - When you, so when you, what that red book button--
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.160]   - Oh, it says ad.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.480]   - Yeah, so I don't know what that means,
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.160]   I don't know what JetBlue is getting.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.480]   - But wait a minute though, if I look,
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:57.480]   let's say, okay, let's change the parameters to,
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:01.320]   I mean, are these only ad-based bookings?
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:04.160]   Well, I'm getting JetBlue, JetBlue, JetBlue, maybe they are.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.040]   Oh, it's 'cause it's Oakland in New York.
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:06.880]   Let's go for message.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.920]   - I've seen tons of other airlines.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:09.800]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's say it's just
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.560]   'cause that was the airline, okay.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.120]   So let's see, let's book this continental,
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.640]   and let's say the return flight, book it, ads.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.720]   Maybe that's their way of saying,
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.120]   look, we're gonna make a little money off of this
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.640]   if you make this purchase, but as--
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.480]   - But here's the--
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.320]   - As everybody does.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.000]   - But are they, so then, then,
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.520]   what Google could do with this much data
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.720]   is it could really do things like do alerts
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:34.440]   when prices go down, tell us when prices tend to go down,
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:38.120]   it could make transparent this horribly opaque system.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:38.960]   - Absolutely.
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:39.960]   - Wouldn't that be great?
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.760]   - It would be beautiful, but if their bread
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.280]   is buttered by the airlines.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.440]   And this goes back to Channel Confident in a different way,
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:46.280]   right?
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:48.840]   The conflict they have in life now,
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.560]   by being in bed with Verizon,
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:53.000]   was that they went away against neutrality,
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.320]   and they were not user focused in that.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.640]   They were telco-focused.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.720]   - In this, where is their interest gonna be?
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.240]   Is it gonna be traveler focused,
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.960]   or which would be the old Google,
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.240]   or is it gonna be airline focused,
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.640]   'cause they're the advertiser?
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.440]   - So now, one thing I should point out
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:10.680]   is that locations outside the US are not supported.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:11.520]   - Oh.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.160]   - I can fly to Honolulu,
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.000]   so I guess it's just the US of A,
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.760]   not the continental United States.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.080]   - Pretty long Leo.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.560]   - I am, believe me.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.600]   - Believe me.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.080]   - Jeff, that's the big question.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.960]   Is Google's customer the web user,
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.560]   or is it the advertiser, right?
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.840]   And this is the continual conversation about Google.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.000]   The haters say that the customer is the advertiser,
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.920]   and the folks who trust and love them like us say,
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.000]   well, Google knows it's in their best interest
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.680]   to just get more users,
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.080]   and that will draw more advertiser.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.640]   So, it's interesting.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:50.480]   It's a really interesting conversation.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.800]   - I would hope,
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.600]   I think it would be short-sighted of them
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.480]   to make it be about the advertisers.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.120]   I don't think there's enough pressure
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.800]   on them at this point to do that.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:06.000]   So I did a search for SFO to NYC flight,
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   got the ads, but I also got this,
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.560]   which is very Bing-like.
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.640]   - Yeah, that one box has been there for a bit.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:17.480]   - Has that?
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:19.560]   - The flight link is on the left-hand menu now.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:22.400]   - Ah, so this is no different.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:25.800]   I will have to click this link here to get the new...
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:26.840]   - Right. - Got it.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.280]   Okay, interesting.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:32.720]   Well, I think this is nicely done.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:33.560]   - Yeah, it does.
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:34.680]   - And this is why people were complaining
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.000]   about the ITA acquisition.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.640]   This was the fear.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:38.520]   - This was it, yeah.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:40.160]   - Yeah, they've done it.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.720]   - They've done it, it's a beautiful tool.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:44.400]   And I actually feel a little bad for Kayak and Hitmonk,
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.320]   which are really great products in their own rights.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.520]   - I don't know, because I think that that's so geeky
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:52.080]   and engineering looking that if you are used
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:55.080]   to using Kayak and Hitmonk, Kayak's kind of horrible.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.840]   But if you're used to, frankly, that's pretty horrible.
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.680]   But if you're used to using Hitmonk as much prettier,
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.600]   I think that this is where they have to,
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.080]   their value proposition now has to be,
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.280]   well, it's easier, it's prettier, it's nicer.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.800]   - I mean, one of my big flight search criteria
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.800]   is whether or not the plane has Wi-Fi.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.360]   And I actually don't see that here.
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.560]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:19.880]   - I always try to get the cross,
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:21.280]   especially a cross-country flight,
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.200]   is just so much easier with Wi-Fi.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:25.800]   I know I sound extremely entitled.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:31.360]   Virgin America, Delta, some Delta flights have them.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:35.000]   - 'Cause I'm stuck with not that all United.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.680]   - And I think US Airways, some US Airways flights have.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.360]   - And Google doesn't have a little cute little chipmonk,
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:40.200]   either.
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.000]   I think the visualizations on here are pretty good.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.200]   And by the way, note the little Wi-Fi links.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.200]   So you can see that on hipmonk.
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.040]   - Yep, yep.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:53.920]   - So there's some value here.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.160]   I think this is what they have to do.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.960]   They have to make it prettier, cuter.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:02.080]   - You know, I've rarely heard the word cute used to Google.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:05.920]   - No, and you will never see a chipmonk with goggles on.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.160]   And this thing's like sort by agony,
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.960]   which is something hipmonk does.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:10.720]   - Yeah, that is clever.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:11.760]   - I don't know how you-- - That is clever.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.000]   - But it's clever.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.200]   And that's the kind of thing you won't see Google do either.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.360]   - The Android robot, I think,
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.880]   is the closest they've ever gotten to,
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.720]   or kind of a really cute mascot, right?
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:22.160]   - Which would you rather cut a chipmonk
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.560]   with the goggles on or a robot?
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.600]   Come on. - Right.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:27.600]   - Which is more cuttly.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.440]   - The first chipmonk.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:30.560]   - I think hipmonk has a chance.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:32.000]   I think Kayak might be threatened
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.160]   because they've let their UI become dated.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:39.520]   And that's a real threat to them.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:45.920]   Let's see, Google lets users opt out of location data collection.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:48.920]   That's obviously in response to--
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.400]   - But explain this to me 'cause I,
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.600]   'cause what was saying was you can opt out
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.520]   of your wifi being used there,
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:57.960]   but it said wifi for use in mobile and cell phones.
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:58.920]   I didn't get it.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.560]   I didn't read this for--
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.400]   - This is the blog post.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:05.440]   At the request of several European Data Protection authorities,
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:08.060]   we are building an opt out service.
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:13.520]   And making this opt out available globally,
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.920]   we release more detailed information
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:16.440]   when it's ready to launch.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:21.480]   Well, this just, I mean, they're giving you a checkbox.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:24.600]   And this is from the European Public Policy Blog.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:25.440]   So we know-- - Those guys
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:27.040]   have a lot of fun.
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:28.440]   - That's a job for a--
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.800]   You know, if you get transferred to that,
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:33.440]   you're pissed Marissa off.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.840]   - Literally the French Four of Leisure.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.880]   - Yeah, really.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:37.360]   - Oh no, what's your new assignment?
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.360]   European Public Policy Blog?
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.200]   I have to live in Brussels.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:43.440]   (laughing)
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.300]   (mimics
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:49.200]   This does not tell you very much.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:52.000]   It tells you about the collection of data.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.080]   It says, "Even though the wireless access point signals
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.680]   "we use in our location services don't identify people,
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:00.720]   "we think we can go further in protecting people's privacy
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.840]   "at the request of several European Data Protection authorities
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:04.560]   "we're building an opt out service."
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:07.280]   - If this is your home wifi and you're not identified
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.800]   with your name, then how do you have the opportunity?
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:09.640]   - Oh wait a minute.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:12.080]   - Go ahead and find your map, that number.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:15.720]   This allows an access point owner to opt out.
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.920]   So this is not for the,
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.200]   you already could opt out on the handset.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.360]   This is saying, "If I have a wifi, I do.
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.600]   "We have the Twitwifi access point.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.440]   "I can now send my Mac address,"
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.800]   or probably that's what they'd want.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:33.280]   Two Googles saying, "Do not use that access point
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.240]   "in future collections."
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.400]   It leaves me out of it.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.920]   That's an interesting opt out.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.960]   - But that is something about your mobile phone.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:41.800]   I don't get it.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:42.840]   - Well you could always opt out.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:43.840]   You still cannot, you could opt out that.
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:46.960]   - I know that, but I got all confused.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:49.920]   - No, this looks like this is for the access point owner.
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.720]   - It is for the access point, yes.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:55.560]   - Once opted out, our services will not use that access point
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.000]   to determine users' locations.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:57.840]   Wow, that's what--
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:01.600]   - So what that means is that they did the drive by
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.440]   no longer themselves,
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.240]   but what's the other company you always told me the name of?
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:07.080]   I always forget that Skyhook.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.600]   - Skyhook, thank you.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.640]   I don't need a brain, I have Google and Leo.
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:15.800]   And right, so they use that so they know that when you come in
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:19.680]   from the brick house, they know where you are.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:23.000]   So what you're doing by taking your access point in data
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.160]   out of that list is simply that they will no longer
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.640]   presumptively guess your location.
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:29.200]   That's it.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.240]   - Right, no.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.800]   - Yep.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:35.960]   - They won't use you in the determination of the location.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:40.360]   So I have opted out the Twit Wi-Fi access spots.
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:42.960]   By the way, they don't have to be open access spots.
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:45.080]   They just see, this is why it's kind of weird.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.080]   They don't need to do this.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:49.440]   I'm broadcasting a signal from my access spots
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:52.760]   to everywhere within 150 feet of this office.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:55.240]   If you're driving by and you could see that signal,
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:57.080]   you can see the signal.
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:58.080]   - It's public information.
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.680]   - Public information, so they've got a GPS address.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.720]   They see the signal, they say,
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.480]   "Well, if you could see this signal,
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.880]   "then you're within 150 feet of this location.
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.080]   "If you could see that signal too,
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.000]   "then, well, we'll do this subset and we know where you are."
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.920]   - So what I could do now, and this is very German,
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.880]   this is more blurman-y stuff,
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.280]   what I could do as a access point owner is say,
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.600]   "Well, don't use me in that."
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.200]   - Even though it has no impact on you at all.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.440]   - Has no impact on me in that.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.320]   And I'm broadcasting that signal out the window.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.040]   - And you've taken away the ability for the person
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:33.040]   going by with a handset to get better targeted stuff.
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.160]   They might want, so basically it's just a selfish,
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.240]   it allows you to be selfish.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.240]   - Yeah.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.320]   Now, it probably is in response to the fact
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.200]   that remember Google, when they were collecting
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.400]   these access point information,
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.680]   did store bits of data from those access points.
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.560]   - Oh yeah, I went to last week,
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.160]   I gave a talk at the Future of Privacy Forum,
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.720]   which is pretty much an industry group.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.760]   But when I gave a talk, there were a few members,
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.320]   the faces in the room turned so sour,
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.280]   they could have garnished a baked potato.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:06.240]   And there was this one woman there
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:09.960]   who was a former FTC commissioner, recently former.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.320]   And she went on a tear and on a tack against me
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.800]   about how Google was evil and using all this data
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:16.640]   from this wifi.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.280]   And I said, there is no conceivable business model
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.360]   and she would not buy it.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.400]   Now mind you, this, well, I don't know whether she was
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.760]   on the FTC when the FTC came to the agreement with Google
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.160]   about buzz, but this is a person, a government official
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.800]   who is in very much position to affect Google's business
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.800]   and affect how the internet works for all of us.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.560]   And ignorant as could be about this Google case,
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.360]   going with the emotional end of it is,
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.760]   oh my God, Google was using all this data.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.400]   And I said, yeah, it was a screw up.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:46.680]   And I saw Mark from Epic at a panel yesterday
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.000]   in the same kind of thing, Google the day.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.400]   It was such a royal screw up because it's being used
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.320]   against Google and against all of us
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.000]   who want some leisure of openness, constantly.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.120]   - Oh well.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:58.960]   (laughs)
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:01:59.800]   - Yeah.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:00.640]   - You know, I just glad I don't have to work
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:03.840]   for the Google European Union blog.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.360]   - How is it, Bob?
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.800]   (laughs)
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.640]   Hey, let's talk-- - We're coming
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.400]   in the morning, who hates us today?
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.760]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.000]   - Slovenia's having a rough day with us.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.880]   - You have to be a special kind of person.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.680]   They probably put all the monks.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.120]   (laughs)
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.480]   All the very enlightened people get to write for that blog.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.200]   - I'm not a comedian. - I'm gonna turn--
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.040]   - Sorry.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.440]   - I'm just turning the other cheek, go ahead.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.800]   - At this event I went to, and then a lot of nice people
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.800]   there and good people, but even the folks
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.080]   within a company who are dedicated to privacy,
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.560]   there, some of them, their job is so much
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.440]   to scare everyone in their company.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.280]   - Right.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.360]   - They're alliance in the industrial regulatory complex
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.360]   of privacy.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:49.080]   You have the so-called organization of watchdogs
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:50.240]   who scare everybody about privacy,
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.960]   and then you have the regulators who make regulations
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.160]   about it, the legislators who make legislation about it,
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.840]   and then the officials in the company who have to protect
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:00.600]   them, and then the consultants who try to regulate
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.760]   against all this, and it's all this big
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:06.160]   just tower of fear that's out there.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.120]   - It's a tower of fear.
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.600]   And Jeff Jarvis hits the slide, the top saying,
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.440]   it's okay, it's calm, calm down.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.840]   Hey, let's quickly talk about Netflix
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.480]   that we'll get our tip tool and number of the week,
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.600]   but first a reminder if you're not a Netflix subscriber
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.840]   that you can try it free for 30 days
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.800]   by going to netflix.com/twit.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.860]   If you already are, and I know most of you are,
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:30.240]   telefriends, spread the word, Netflix streaming,
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.000]   it's the best deal and entertainment,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.160]   just look at, I mean, the conversation,
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.760]   Gene Hackman, the classic Coppola movie,
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.960]   oh, and a great movie from 1974,
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.320]   I just watched this documentary about Wilco,
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.880]   I love this, they're recording Yankee Hotel Fox Trot,
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.720]   I love kind of the making of, here's John Waters,
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.040]   one man show, celebrating the origins of trash,
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:56.200]   God love that, these are all movies, TV shows,
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.760]   documentaries you can watch tonight,
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.320]   if you go to netflix.com/twit
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.440]   and great for the kids too, it plays in your iPhone,
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.720]   iPad, all the Android phones now,
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:09.400]   Froyo or later, they've added all of them,
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.520]   many tablets, what else?
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:16.400]   Well, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, many DVD players,
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.100]   most TVs, I mean, everybody does Netflix now.
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.480]   Because you like the discrete charm of the bourgeoisie,
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.720]   perhaps you'd like Bonwell's Auschien and the Loum.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.120]   - Aren't you so classy, Leo?
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.320]   That's probably my daughter.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.600]   - Oh, maybe eight and a half, or Jean-Luc Gaudard's
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.600]   a woman is a woman.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.600]   (laughing)
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.440]   Le Bon Fum.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.200]   (laughing)
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.600]   You know, they actually have,
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.040]   oh, now we're watching Le Bon Fum, I'm sorry.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.920]   But one of the great things about Netflix,
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.960]   they have a lot of international films, which I love.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:50.040]   I watched all of the Millennium Saga,
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.600]   you know, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.040]   the original Swedish--
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.040]   - Yeah, those were good.
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:54.880]   - Right.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.240]   - They're a little hardcore, I mean, they're like,
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.840]   boy, hoo, yeah, but yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.200]   But they're true to the book, which I really liked.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.680]   Yeah, we're watching Le Bon Fum.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.960]   So let's watch a little film, and we'll get back to,
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.840]   no, just go to Netflix.com/twit.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:15.520]   Sifim, inte l di omeu, dee zuithal, just so you know.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.880]   - What dog's room is doubting that you're blaming
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.600]   your daughter on this, you're throwing your daughter
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.080]   under the bus here on this.
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.280]   But you're actually the snob.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.760]   - Actually, I think this is one of those,
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:29.080]   one of those sexy French films, Vadcha Broder.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.920]   Like a wing victory.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.000]   - I feel like I've transported back to my sophomore year
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.040]   in college. - I know, this is great.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.320]   Don't you love it?
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.760]   You can watch this anytime you want.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.000]   I go home, look, de chivo.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.320]   I go home and I watch this stuff,
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.120]   and I just feel so continental.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:50.240]   Netflix.com, this is our new theme song.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.680]   (laughing)
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.160]   It's about as down as the other one.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.920]   - Have we replaced that heart?
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.800]   - No, because we thought maybe you really liked it.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.280]   (laughing)
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:04.000]   - If I really liked it, I would be the only one who did.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.360]   - I am happy to change it.
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.880]   - Yeah, didn't Gina's had suggested a better song?
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:10.720]   - Yeah, we'd gone through some iterations.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.480]   We should revisit that.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.640]   - It's been a year or more.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.200]   Just my thinking at the time was,
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:20.080]   is the Loser's song original to Glee?
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.480]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.800]   - That surely they would give us the rights to use that.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.960]   - We got to do the perfect song.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.960]   - The guy who does Glee's mixing is a fan.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:30.800]   Let's ask him.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.600]   - Oh yeah, we can ask him.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.600]   Yeah, we can ask him.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.040]   - Would that be killer?
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:34.880]   - That would be great.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.760]   - White things for us.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.600]   - Yeah.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.440]   (laughing)
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:40.760]   - That would be, that would be, it's perfectly for us.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.160]   Loser like me, that one?
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.840]   - Yeah, that's it, that's it.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.680]   - Yeah, that's us, that's our song.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.520]   (laughing)
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.120]   It was the first original, I think it was the first.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.440]   - That's not the song.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.280]   Oh, now, here it is.
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.080]   ♪ Hey, everyone you want to be ♪

[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.320]   on the drinking day.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.560]   (laughing)
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.520]   - Humberbosh, default lay, there, you're right.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:29.440]   - There, now they're set.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.320]   I like that song.
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.720]   All the dirt you've been throwing my way,
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:32.800]   it ain't so hard to take.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.840]   'Cause I know one day you'll be screaming my name
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:37.640]   and I'll just look away, just go ahead and hate on me
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.640]   and run your mouth.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.480]   - It's a great song.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.480]   - Damn, that's our song.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.680]   (laughing)
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:44.920]   - It's the loser's anthem, it's the key anthem.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.560]   - Yeah.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:47.840]   - I'll get you back when I'm your boss.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.440]   - Lee, can we have that please?
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.000]   We'll give you your edit.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.600]   - All right, Gina, your tip of the week.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:57.880]   - iOS users, iPad and iPhone users
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:01.200]   can now get to Google Music.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.560]   Android users had the Google Music app,
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.880]   but there wasn't a way to play back your music on iOS,
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:09.280]   but there's now a really kind of slick mobile web app
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.120]   for Google Music.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.080]   If you just go to music.google.com on your iOS device
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.600]   or I assume any device with a good browser,
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.000]   it's got this really nice artist,
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.720]   you can play your music back from the cloud,
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.520]   nice mobile interface, so it works great.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:23.360]   So you don't have to sync your iTunes.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.920]   - It's in Safari.
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.360]   - It's in Safari, yeah, it's a web app.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:29.040]   It's totally web app, but it's really nice interface
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.680]   and you don't have to manually sync your music
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.800]   from iTunes to your phone or any more,
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.640]   your iPhone or any more.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.320]   You can just stream straight from Google Music
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:38.360]   and the browser.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.800]   - Nito, thank you Google Music for doing that,
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.640]   'cause we know Apple didn't do it.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.480]   - Right.
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.640]   (laughing)
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:47.480]   - Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week, my friend.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:50.000]   - I'm gonna do two, one is a follow up to last week's
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.040]   discussion with Kevin Marks about Orchid,
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.120]   and it turns out that in the meantime,
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:58.160]   Google has surpassed,
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:02.800]   I'm sorry, Facebook has surpassed Google's Orchid in Brazil.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.360]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.680]   - Facebook has 30.9 million users
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.720]   versus Orchid's 29 million users in Brazil.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.920]   And what effect does that have on Orchid?
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:16.480]   Well, a lot because 90% of Orchid's page views
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.120]   are from Brazil.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.400]   So they saw that it's so big in India.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.480]   Well, now it's mainly big in Brazil.
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:24.880]   Brazil, I always, you should do a Brazilian show,
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.120]   you know, all in Portuguese.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.600]   It's the most fascinating country to me
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.800]   because things take off their online,
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.320]   never gets credit for this.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.960]   It's a very cyber nation.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:38.680]   The first and only licensee of blogger was Brazil.
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.240]   Photo logs started by,
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:41.680]   Scott Hypton was huge in Brazil.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.720]   Orchid took off before social networking.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.200]   Brazilians are nuts about this.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.480]   All right, that's my informational number from last week.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:49.600]   The other number that I kind of love
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.480]   is Robert Scobull, his new job description in my mind
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.240]   is envelope pusher.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.520]   As soon as the description comes up, what does he do?
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.360]   Right, he goes for numbers and he's subscribed.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.040]   He says, already 168 people are subscribed to me,
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.400]   but this is the part I love.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.900]   He subscribed to 30 people and Facebook,
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:08.000]   rate limit it in and said he was actually dead.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.260]   (laughing)
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.360]   - Robert will break it.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.360]   If it's breakable, Robert will break it.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.840]   - No, I love that.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.560]   - Somebody just in the chat room sent me this link.
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:18.920]   Is this a Chipotle ad?
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:19.840]   What is this?
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.840]   (birds chirping)

[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.320]   It's a radio ad, so I think I've seen this.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.520]   - Yes.
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.880]   - Oh boy.
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.240]   - Am I gonna be sorry I played this?
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:38.040]   - No, I don't think so, no, no, no.
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.640]   - Oh, it's about how Chipotle takes care of their animals.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.720]   - Oh, Zach.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.320]   - We don't seem to be killed to turn into breedups,
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:48.200]   but it'll really Nelson playing Coldplay.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.880]   Aw.

[01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.800]   They still squish him in his square pills
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.080]   before they say the chipotle.

[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.880]   At least they've had a good life
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.480]   in the little chipotle.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:10.880]   I don't know, I don't think,
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.200]   I think it's best for a food manufacturer
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:16.280]   to just kind of pretend the food doesn't come from anywhere.
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.640]   (laughing)
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.120]   'Cause I don't really want to.

[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.240]   Good for you, chipotle.
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.720]   They still haven't paid us a penny,
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.160]   but they just got a full ad.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.400]   - I suddenly feel a little better
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.320]   about the free advertising.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.240]   - At least it's free-range chipotle.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.080]   - Exactly.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.120]   - So here is my tool.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.400]   It's actually a site based on Google Maps
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.880]   that I think you guys are like called What Was There?
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.400]   What was there.com?
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.880]   Let's put in New York City and I'll show you how it works.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:53.880]   It ties pictures of historic places
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:56.680]   to their locale on Google Maps.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:59.280]   So let's say the Woolworth building under construction.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.840]   And what you can do, which is cool,
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:02.560]   is you can take the street view
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.800]   and put superimpose on the street view.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.280]   I can fade the picture out just a little bit here.
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:10.520]   Superimpose, there's the current Woolworth building.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.760]   You could superimpose the picture
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.320]   on top of its actual street view.
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.160]   - How do they do that?
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.560]   - Hey, that is me.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.400]   - Jesus.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.760]   - City Hall Park.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:24.040]   And if we fade it out, you could see it today
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:25.720]   and in the past.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.560]   Isn't that cool?
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.320]   I just love this.
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.800]   San Francisco has some good places.
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:33.400]   Now that's PT Barnum's American Place,
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.320]   which is of course gone now.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.400]   And that's what's in its place.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.360]   Just kind of fun.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.120]   It's called whatwasthere.com.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.560]   You can upload your own photos to it.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.200]   They encourage you to do this.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:45.320]   Here's one for you, Gina.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.200]   This is the Brooklyn Bridge actually shot
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:52.640]   from the tower at the World Trade Center.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.520]   - Oh, wow, nice.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:57.520]   - So there's nothing there now,
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.480]   but that's pretty cool.
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:00.800]   Here's a hat.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.640]   (laughing)
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.040]   I don't really know why that's there.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.240]   Here's Broadway in the 1900s.
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.000]   - That's cool.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.880]   - That's Broadway and there it is today.
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:12.720]   Isn't that cool?
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:13.560]   - That looks really nice, yeah.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.400]   That looks really cool.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.240]   - Really a fun thing.
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.960]   Whatwasthere.com?
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.320]   And there's actually an iPhone app that goes with it.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.800]   Gina Trappani is at smarterwhere.org.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.560]   Really great to have you, Gina.
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.400]   - Great show today.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:31.320]   - A door you, Gina Trappani on Twitter and Google Plus,
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.200]   and subscribe to her if she ever allows us to--
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.880]   - If I allow subscribers.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:36.840]   - We don't know yet.
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:37.760]   It may never happen.
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.680]   - I'll keep you on the edge of your seat.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:41.560]   I know all of you are here as you see about that.
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.400]   - Or don't.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.280]   Just follow her public page.
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.480]   - Meanwhile, Leo and I just jump in the pool after--
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.320]   - We don't care.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.720]   We live in public.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.800]   I don't care.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:50.640]   I'll circle-- - Circle me.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:51.480]   - Yeah, we'll circle Gina.
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:52.600]   That's what we'll do.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.360]   Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com, a great blog.
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:58.160]   Both of you have wonderful blogs
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.960]   that are worth reading every single day.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:02.680]   And his new book, Any Day Now.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:07.280]   Any day now, public parts will emerge.
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.400]   That's not the way to put it.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.000]   Zip up your fly.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:12.920]   Thank you, sir.
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:18.560]   And we'll see y'all later.
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.440]   Now let's go play it.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:19.800]   That's good.
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:20.320]   Let's go.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.200]   This is our theme song.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:22.240]   Goodbye, everybody.
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.880]   We do this show every Wednesday, 11 AM
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.360]   Pacific, 2 PM Eastern at live.twit.tv.
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.600]   I hope you will join us to watch it live,
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:29.960]   if not catch it.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:34.320]   We're all just nice losers on this show.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:35.320]   See you later.
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920]   Bye-bye.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:58.480]   I have it in the long time.
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.720]   You need to be Fred.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.200]   Yeah, I think if you have to do an episode where you stick
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.040]   in sound effects like Fred.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:05.360]   Yeah, we have sound effects.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.760]   I have a complete collection.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.640]   We just need to load them in the tricaster.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.480]   We've got crickets.
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.920]   You can do that when I start going off
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.080]   with some boring things.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:22.520]   And then the rim shot.
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.120]   Of course.
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.640]   So yeah, I got to preload this stuff.
