[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Jeff Jarvis's here, David Roddick, managing editor of Android Police.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   We're going to talk about Mr. Pachai's visit to Washington, D.C.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   and the group of clueless congresspeople who met with him,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   the latest on Huawei and Super Micro, kind of a surprising Super Micro story in the news.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   And then a look at the second most hated video on YouTube.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   This week in Google show where we talk about the latest news from the Google verse,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.040]   which includes the Facebookverse, the Twitterverse, and the mediaverse.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.460]   But I'm not adverse to introducing Mr. Jeff Jarvis, Professor of Journalism at the City University
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.200]   of New York - Buzz machine.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.520]   - Hey, hello. Hey, hey.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.680]   Hey, hey, hey, I got actually a question to ask you that's not about Google before I do that.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.780]   I also want to introduce Stacey's not here this week.
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.260]   David Ruddock is, though, he's managing editor at Android police.
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.800]   First time on the show.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.880]   Yeah. Welcome, David. Good to see you.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.380]   Thank you. Glad to be on.
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.300]   Anybody who's watched all about Android knows David well.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.960]   But I want to ask you, Jeff, because Apple came out with, finally,
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.560]   its cardiogram feature on the Apple Watch where people, it's a two lead cardiogram,
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.260]   much like the cardia device that a live core makes.
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.720]   One lead is on your wrist already as part of the watch.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.620]   The other lead is the stem of the watch.
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.360]   And it will say, oh, that's how they did it.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.460]   Yeah. Oh.
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.380]   So it's kind of like the a live core, which I know you like and I've loved.
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.120]   And the reason I ask is there's nobody I know besides you that's had a fib.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.940]   And the first thing Apple says when you sign up for it, when you turn it on is,
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.780]   this does not diagnose heart attacks or strokes.
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.340]   Although I think maybe they should even emphasize that a little bit more because if you
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.820]   are having a heart attack and you do this, that's the wrong thing to do.
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.340]   Right? You say, Hey, Siri, call 911 right now and get to the hospital.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:19.140]   Even if you're not sure, but you'd think that this is a useful tool for people who have a fib.
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.220]   Yeah. So is it a FDA approved the way that the live core thing is FDA approved under
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.620]   a kind of an exemption for new devices to fast track new devices.
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.780]   So the way that the live core works is the first time you take your pulse with it,
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.620]   you don't get it right away.
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.820]   It is, it is evaluated by a medical professional.
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.660]   It doesn't do that. So live core, I think has still a higher standard.
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.420]   And the, the EKG that I send in is perfectly acceptable to my cardiologist.
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.620]   Yeah. This, this actually is giving me a diagnosis right now.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.220]   Sinus rhythm.
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.700]   This ECG does not show signs of atrial fibrillation.
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.580]   Then it says, right under Apple Watch, can I check for signs of a heart attack?
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.460]   If you believe you're having a medical emergency call emergency services,
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.580]   of course, all that is a little tiny type that you have to scroll up.
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.420]   Yeah. Meanwhile, you're having a heart attack, but just don't, just don't click the accept button.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.660]   So this is very different from the live core.
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.780]   The live core will never tell you you have a sinus rhythm, right? Or will it?
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.300]   Oh, yes. That's exactly what it does. But with this, this doesn't, without that first step of
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.700]   sending it to a physician, which is what the FTC had insisted on.
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.140]   So I wonder what the, what the difference here is in, in certification.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.740]   Yeah. Whether, whether that, that EKG, does that produce an EKG for you?
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.420]   Well, you see it on your phone. You see it doing the thing.
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.140]   Do you get it recorded on your phone?
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.220]   That's a good question. Like I could say, because that's what you do with the cardio.
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.980]   You send it into your, you send the resulting EKG to your, your physician or their
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.580]   physician, if you don't have a physician. Let me see Apple Health.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.220]   If they've put it, if they put a, um,
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.020]   it will give you a regular heart notifications.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:16.340]   He say, yes, here's an, yes. Okay. So here are the ECGs that I've done.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.260]   And can you send that to a doctor? Boy, that one's very different.
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.580]   The one I just did is not look good compared to that one.
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.980]   Usually when it starts up or you're talking or they have talking.
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.700]   Yes. Export a PDF for your doctor. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.820]   And again, if you're having a heart attack or medical emergency call emergency services,
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.180]   so they try really hard to there, you know, everybody's raving about this.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.980]   There's already posts on Reddit of, oh, the Apple, uh, watch, save my life.
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.780]   A doctor told somebody who went into the hospital after being diagnosed with AFib by his watch.
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.540]   Oh, you should buy Apple stock. They just saved your life. Of course.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.780]   Let's be clear here that AFib, though I, I, I love to get something for it and whine about it.
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:08.140]   Is it's not directly fatal. The problem with AFib is when your heart is being regularly in the pools
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.620]   in the heart where blood gets undisturbed, a blood clot can form.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:19.900]   And that can in turn go out and cause havoc. But that's, that's the risk of AFib people.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.940]   Some people live with AFib the rest of their lives.
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:29.660]   So I kind of worry that this is A overhyped and B could actually lead to some harm.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:35.180]   I've, I've showed before we showed it today, our light yesterday on Mac break weekly, a, a
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.380]   medium article from a cardiologist who said he's not at all happy about this because
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:47.260]   diagnostics of healthy patients often lead to harm because of the false positive,
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.420]   the chance for false positive and but okay, the whining doctors.
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:58.380]   That's one matter. If you get, if you get falsely diagnosed for breast cancer or something and,
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:04.460]   and you go under the knife as a result, in this case, if you think you have AFib and you go in,
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.140]   you're going to get on a real AKG and they're going to say, yeah, you're in or you're not.
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:13.980]   And, and the thing about this is, there's two things about this that are good for us.
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.900]   A-fibbers as we call ourselves. No, you don't. Do you really? Yeah.
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.780]   Oh, you're a day. I believe it's called trackers. I just,
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:30.540]   so, so one is I happen to be highly symptomatic.
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:35.420]   Would mine know it's happening to you as, as a, as a British friend of mine said, when, when,
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:43.340]   when I have a dicky ticker, I know it, right? I, I'm saying, oh, and so the cardio, let's be
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.980]   confirmed. And once I thought I was in and I wasn't, and, you know, half an hour later,
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:53.980]   I realized no, I wasn't. So, so it can actually reduce the false positives.
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.300]   The second thing is, unless you really are having atrial fibrillation,
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.740]   then watch is wrong and you don't seek treatment. That would be a false.
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.260]   Right. But again, because, because I happen to be symptomatic, I, I tend to know, I was just,
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:09.260]   you know, if you're, if you're asymptomatic, if you don't know when you're an AFib, no, you should,
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.740]   you don't, excuse me. The second thing about this, that I haven't followed,
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.860]   but I'm almost surprised my cardio is just going to do this. So I, I was supposed to be on
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.140]   blood thinner. I'm supposed to be on this awful blood thinner, where you have to go in once a
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:25.740]   week and get checked and you get bruised and you feel old and I hate the crap. And because I am so
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:30.620]   symptomatic, I don't really need to do that. I, I argued with my cardiologist, he finally gave in
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.820]   because I can be an a-hole. And so I'm not just a major aspirin a day, a big aspirin a day.
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:45.100]   If I go into AFib, if they don't zap me, clear. Oh, yeah, within 24 hours, restore the sinus
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:50.940]   rhythm, then they won't do it for a month. Wow. And because then then I, because I had that
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:57.100]   happened to me once and I had to go on a trip to London and I'm just dragon. And during that time,
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:03.900]   I had to inject myself in the tummy with major blood thinner. So they're guaranteed because the
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:09.660]   fear is if they do clear, when you have a blood clot in your heart, it's going to go shoving that
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:15.820]   out into your brain and you'll stroke me die. Great. So they won't do that. So once I was in a,
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.340]   so in this time when I was in AFib, the damn different doctor, well, I fired.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:24.620]   No, I'm not going to do anything. No, no, no, no. So that was beyond 24 hours.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:30.780]   So the next thing they do is they put you out and they stick a sonogram thing down your throat
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:35.900]   to the level of heart to see if they can find any clots. Or if they find a clot, they say,
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:43.020]   ah, you're not getting cleared or cardioverted, as they say. And you're going to spend a month
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:48.460]   thinning your blood. So wait a minute. All this is sorry. I know folks just old guys just talking
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:53.100]   about their ailments. Sorry. And then my back all up and down my spine is shooting pain.
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:59.580]   So it couldn't happen with if you if these things work well, and you check once a day,
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:05.820]   then you know that within the last 24 hours, if you now go into AFib, you know that with
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.580]   in the last 24 hours, you weren't in AFib. And so they can cardio virtue.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.500]   So I think the doctor is full of crap. And I think these things can have real benefit,
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:20.140]   but I'm no doctor. Okay, good. No, I kind of withheld. I wanted to talk about it with you
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:26.460]   because you're the only person I know who's had. And also you use the cardio. So I use the cardio.
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:32.540]   Yeah. Yeah. So it does at the very least it raises awareness. Though I would say it's really
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.780]   important and Apple seems to do at least a pretty good job of saying, Hey, this is not for heart.
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.740]   It's not for anything but one particular case. Well, you see ECG you kind of think, Oh, this is good.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:46.700]   This is my whole heart. I know, you know, my now imagine. So I've talked about this with
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:52.060]   our our friend, the former head of the soon to be deceased Google plus who's now at
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:58.380]   cardio at a live core. Help me. You know, what's his name?
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:06.380]   The former head of Google plus. Oh, why can't I remember his name either?
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.940]   We've heard this live. This is Vickindotra. Vick, my good friend Vick.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:16.620]   So I was talking to Vick about the product and and now imagine and this is going to send,
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:23.820]   you know, people crazy with privacy. But imagine the correlation data you start to drive.
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.740]   Well, this is where Apple excels because Apple does do that. They have a heart study. They
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.060]   have a number of things on here and people seem to trust Apple a little bit more than they do Google.
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:37.420]   Yeah, but and a live core has a state of now too. So you can you can tie it to a live
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:42.460]   core has you record how you feel. Yeah, same thing here. Oral. Yep. What symptoms are you feeling?
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:48.380]   Yep. And, you know, where you are, what time of day it is, you know, you ate in a Mexican restaurant
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:54.620]   last night, you know, whatever. There's a lot of potential to show correlation here, which I
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.820]   think is going to be religious because they really don't know what causes an onset.
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:03.340]   And they don't know the risk factors of an onset sufficiently and with enough data and with
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:09.580]   people trusting on privacy. This is one of this is an example of big data being beneficial and
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:15.340]   why it is beneficial to other a fevers in life to share your data, right?
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.580]   David, do you have any chronic illnesses you'd like to share with us?
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:25.180]   You know, I don't think so today. Maybe up for my second appearance. I want to say something.
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.340]   You'd be really glad David. We're not talking about prostate cancer.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:35.980]   Google plus you brought it up. So there's been a second breach
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:42.620]   with the Google plus API. It sounds like and I'm not clear on this, but maybe David, you know,
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.940]   it might be related to the fix of the API for the first breach.
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.020]   You know, honestly, I've really tuned out at the Google plus.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:57.900]   Because I mean, I haven't read about the breach at all. I just know that for whatever reason,
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.980]   they decided it's serious enough to be like, I'm going to complain if we shut it down four months
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.420]   earlier. No, all right.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.100]   Crickets crickets. Yeah.
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:11.580]   In October, Google plus announced that they Google announced that there was an issue with
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:19.900]   Google plus API that allowed a malicious third party app to get data that was marked as private
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:25.340]   from the user's profile. Google said to our knowledge, no one's done this, although we don't
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:31.420]   really save records of it. It's been going on for three years. But then they said, so we're going
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:43.500]   to shut down Google plus in a year in late 2019. Then they discovered another one just this week.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:50.300]   And they posted with the discovery of this new bug, we've decided to expedite the shutdown of
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:57.180]   all Google plus APIs. This will occur in the next 90 days. So the API goes down. When does the
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:04.540]   service and then the service sunsets from August 2019? Well, this doesn't make any sense. Oh,
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:09.740]   we've decided to accelerate the sun setting, which was set for August to April of next year.
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:19.500]   So, and again, as you said, David, a great yawn was heard around the world.
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:25.740]   As much as I want to. I'm still more Google plus. I can't. I really just can't.
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:34.460]   As if the voice is a thousands of Google plus is screamed out in Anui. I think it's worth a
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:40.460]   moment of small sad. I think Google plus had such potential. I look at people like Trey Radcliffe,
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:46.540]   who made such a difference to his career posting photos. It was great for photos. I posted on it.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:52.780]   You posted on it. Mike Elgin went down with the ship. I think he hasn't been heard from since.
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.580]   So for a lot of people, Google plus was the right social network. And Elgin's pointed out many times.
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:04.780]   And I think he's right that the features of Google plus had for blocking users and moderating
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.540]   comments made it a much better place to share than Facebook and Twitter.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:13.820]   I think it was definitely a very, it could be a very insular place. If you wanted it to be,
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.060]   and you had to curate though, that was, I think, the thing. You had to be very active with Google plus
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.380]   in order to get much out of it. It wasn't something you could glance at once in a while
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.580]   and cater to that just kind of immediate, just, you know,
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.980]   IV of, you know, information that Twitter and Facebook give you. Google plus, you kind of had to
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.900]   be like, okay, I need to look at my communities. You know, who am I following? You know, how do I
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:39.740]   get all this good stuff? Google plus never felt like Google oddly for something from Google.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.100]   Google plus never felt like it was trying to throw the information in front of you to get you
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.900]   the click. Google plus felt like something you created for yourself.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:51.740]   That's why I liked it. And people like Trey and Mike didn't in lieu of a blog, right? It was their
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.740]   presence on the net in some respects.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:16:02.620]   Yeah. But you make a good point that did require a lot of interaction to keep it up.
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:10.540]   And I think also making circles was a mistake. They backed off on that. But in the beginning,
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.540]   you had to kind of pick your circles. It also everybody thought that was brilliant,
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:19.340]   because that was solving the Facebook, everything is public problem, right? So, but it was too much
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.980]   work. It was, yeah, it was, it was, it did solve the problem, but a, but a lot of effort
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.740]   on the part of the user. Mark Zuckerberg famously said, nobody wants to make lists.
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.100]   Yeah. And he was actually talking about Facebook, but he was right also.
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.500]   Right. Nobody wants to. It was too much work.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.780]   And I think part of the problem was that was so inter intermingled with your other Google
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:43.180]   presence that for instance, I still have Google plusters in my contact list.
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:49.740]   And I still hear get birthdays. Oh my lord. Yeah. And that's not what you wanted. When you put
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:55.260]   somebody in a circle, you didn't want to make them your best buddy. I don't care about somebody's
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:00.620]   birthday from Google plus. I don't care about, let's be clear here. Anybody's birthday. Yeah.
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:06.220]   But especially when you're my age, you don't care about. I'm with you. Anybody's birthday. I feel the
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:10.860]   same. Yeah. I'll be dead by then. But when Zuckerberg is my, my day, he's gonna regret that
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.740]   birthday. Yeah, he's not gonna want it on there because he goes, don't remind me. I literally de
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.140]   act. So, you know, I periodically, I've deactivated my Facebook account, but I had to reactivate it
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:25.740]   for that Facebook portal. But I made sure that two days before my birthday, I deactivated again,
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:31.660]   because I didn't want anybody wish me happy birthday. So I'm with you. I'm exactly with you.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:37.980]   Yeah. So Google plus is going to die. Even with all my ailments. You see, I'd like it. Oh, I made
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:42.860]   another one a year. No, no, no, no, people don't understand that. I passed a point. You don't really
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:50.380]   celebrate this. It's nothing to say, nothing to be happy about. So Google plus will continue as an
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:56.220]   enterprise product, which is weird. What? Oh, yeah, you didn't know that. It's part of G Suite.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:01.500]   Oh, oh, goody. I get that. I can't sign into anything, but I get Google plus.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:11.660]   I feel like that's what Google does with everything now. Well, they're trying to swing away. We're
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:16.060]   pivoting it to enterprise. Yeah, let's run to G Suite. No way to let it. Geez Louise.
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:25.980]   Okay. Well, that's that's our lead story. The death of Google plus. Let's see. What else?
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.820]   Oh, speaking of deaths, Aloe is now about to go.
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:36.060]   Which and pivot tables? Yeah, we're really no more pivot tables. Yeah,
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:43.260]   pivot tables are going. No one could figure out how to use them probably. Aloe, which was, I thought,
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.260]   really cool. In fact, the only person I ever exchanged messages with on Aloe was you, Jeff.
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:53.260]   Remember that? It came out and saved for you. Yeah, it was our little intimate moment.
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.380]   Back and forth and that was it. We were a load in the world. I said, happy birthday.
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:03.980]   And he cut me off. So now, you know, I do this every once in a while. The other night,
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:09.820]   I woke up and I pulled out my Pixel 3 and I downloaded every possible program to do text
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:14.220]   messaging because, you know, Google does allow you to make your default text message app be some
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:20.300]   other app. And then I found out I figured out after a while, because Hangout still was getting
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.460]   all the messages you off. So I have to go into Hangouts until Hangouts, knock it off.
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:32.940]   And so it's two steps. But nothing is as good as Hangouts. In terms of a, I want it to be
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.140]   cross platform. I want to be able to get it on my iPhone. Am I Android phone?
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:41.420]   I tried to look Klinkers pulse, but you can't do it on iPhone. Apple won't let them put a
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:47.260]   pulse. But that's Apple. And then I don't know why they let Hangouts be on the iPhone, but they do.
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:54.380]   And I tried a bunch of different Facebook messenger. Oh, it's so ugly. I can't. And so,
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.020]   finally, I put Hangouts back after a few hours trying everything that's out there. It needs to
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.980]   be cross platform. It needs to work on my desktop. It needs to work with Google Fi because that's,
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:10.860]   you know, that's my pixel. It's only Hangouts. Well, Hangouts survive. They said that we're going
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:16.540]   to keep Hangouts alive for one more year. And then we're going to move it to move you to Hangouts,
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:23.740]   chat and meet David. We've never had you discuss this. Please explain to me Google's messaging strategy.
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:30.540]   I don't think Google knows what its messaging strategy is. And I think that's the problem.
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:37.820]   And I think that what I've heard is that Google really, there was no, there was no, nobody knew
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:42.940]   that moving all these people to Hangouts, chat and meet was going to happen before it was announced
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.820]   by the head of product on Twitter. Like he just went on there, went on a tirade and then said,
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.780]   yeah, we've already got a plan. We're moving everybody over. And apparently it's a bunch of
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:57.740]   people on teams like News to Us. So that's terrible. Yeah, nobody at Google knew.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:02.780]   Yeah, it's pretty bad. And it's not even clear how the transition is going to work. And it sounds
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.220]   like they're going to have to take a bunch of people off product teams, you know, on Hangouts,
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:11.900]   chat who are working on features and have to put them on migration duty because the roadmap has
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.740]   changed now. And that of course, as you know, that's huge for your career if you're on migration
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:20.380]   duty. Yes, that's how soon our glory. People don't know that's how soon our Pichai became
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.940]   CEO of Google. He was on migration duty, all the glory and the money.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:30.460]   And it really is. It's just clear. All they're doing is saying to the people who are on Hangouts
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:35.900]   that die hard to her left, like we're not going to leave you out in the cold. But it's really
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.740]   just a piece, man. There's no plan going forward. They're not going to solve this.
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:45.100]   Do you use Android messages, which was now called completely generically and ambiguously
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:52.940]   messages? I do. And I use it because honestly, I live mostly in a web browser. And so the web
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.460]   interface works for me. You got a desktop interface, which is good.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:01.740]   Yeah. Hangouts works on the desktop, too. You have to have a Chrome plugin. You have to have Chrome.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:07.660]   Yeah. And I think the fact is there's a how many people, how many new people have you talked to on
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.860]   Hangouts lately? Nobody's nobody's going there. But it's my SMS app. See, so I use it on Google
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:19.980]   5 for SMS. So I talked to everybody on Hangouts. Yeah, I thought they were going to I wonder if
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.500]   they're going to sunset that they're probably going to get rid of them. I can't see that. That's
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:31.660]   my fear. And that's why I looked at Paul's and Textra, Facebook, just signal, Telegram,
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:37.740]   try them all they all can be your default SMS client. But they but I don't know. I just
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:44.940]   I'm still I'm still in denial about the death of inbox. They finally get me used to it. Yes.
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.940]   And then it's saying thing. I hate these guys. So you knew it was going to die. There were never
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:55.980]   ads in it. Are there ads in your Android messages and Gmail? I mean, I mean, just read when Jeff's
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:01.420]   like, I got a box there. So you're using and you're using it with a carrier that does RCS.
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:08.860]   David, I wish RCS, I think, will be intercompatible across all four carriers sometime in 2035.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:15.340]   So we'll look at that. Yeah, they've they've really shown how good how well they can drag their
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:21.340]   feet on that. Do you use to use five David or I was on five for a few months. It really didn't
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:27.900]   fit into my kind of data usage lifestyle, I guess I'd say. But I use messages just because SMS
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.540]   kind of the default I go to if I if I'm talking to somebody either I'm talked to in a while,
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:36.780]   or who's contact information on social network, I don't have. And so it's just it's easier that in
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:41.740]   the web interface, the web interface keeps me coming back. Yeah, I'm really now that we have a web
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:47.260]   interface for messages. It makes me much happier. So you don't use Hangouts either, Jeff? No, no,
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.660]   I use maybe I have to go to messages. I mean, Google wants me to go to messages, obviously,
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.980]   even on five, they want you to go to messages. No, to be clear, I am in a multi messaging app
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:00.060]   hellscape. I'm on WhatsApp. I'm on Facebook Messenger. I'm an Android messages. I'm still on
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:05.980]   Hangouts as well. And I also use Telegram for work communication when we're at events. So it's
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.900]   it's it's not fun. So David, do you have the problem that I have? So I'll see
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:17.500]   a an alert come up for a message that I register that Oh, yeah, so and so Leo just messaged me now.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:25.340]   Find it. And they're exactly. I have spent 10 minutes going there. Is it Facebook? Was it Facebook
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:32.300]   Messenger? Was it messages? Was it Hangout? Was it? Oh, because because somebody in one time
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.300]   once here probably Leo, Leo wants to say something to me. He's the only person on earth who would do
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:41.180]   it now. I guess I understand that really, somebody in the chat was pointing this out. That's really
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:48.220]   true. I have an unusual use case because I have more than one phone. Some of them are iOS.
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:55.500]   If you only had one phone, one Android phone and one desktop, I guess it'd be fine to use messages.
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:01.420]   But but if I use messages, then I won't get the message on my other my iOS phone.
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:08.380]   But I understand I'm I'm a definitely an edge case. So I shouldn't complain. I should just
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.980]   shut up. We can't get a viewer. We'll suffer with the rest of us.
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:21.100]   It's just you know, if if Apple made messages work on Android, I would use that.
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:27.980]   Fat chance. I know. And it's such an opportunity for them. They could even monetize it.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:33.020]   Good job. Well, for instance, you can pay stuff people with Apple messages. And I think everybody
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.620]   would use it except that because you can't pay Android people, you use Venmo instead because you
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.420]   could pay it's cross platform. There's a you need to have certain things need to be cross platform
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.340]   messaging payments. There's certain things that just have to be cross platform because not
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.940]   they could make Apple pay for Android too. There's no reason. That's exactly.
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.380]   It's just like, oh, I don't know. I don't know.
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.220]   It's a available on Apple. Oh, that's.
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.740]   Can you change the payment provider on?
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:03.660]   So what what here's my larger question? What equivalent Google to the list you just made?
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:09.820]   What equivalent Google apps are do work? Hangouts. Hangouts. Right. That's why you say
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:24.300]   it's like, I don't know what to say. I guess Google pay on the app store. Yes. I wish we could
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:30.060]   just like buy Fiat say everybody has to use Telegram or everybody has to use WhatsApp or
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:35.420]   you know what I'd really like everybody has to use signal. Yeah, signals cross platform, but
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:41.660]   signal doesn't let you have two phone numbers for the same account. It's tied to the phone number.
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.100]   So once when I set up signal on one phone, it can't have it on the other phones.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:49.820]   So that's just that's for security. I understand. But that's all right.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:53.500]   Mr. Mr. Pichai goes to Washington. We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:59.660]   We're glad to have you David Roddick, managing editor of Android police. First time on the show,
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.300]   be nice folks. No, they're always nice.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:07.820]   What are we going to need to? It's entertaining. Jeff Jarvis. They're never nice to you.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:11.980]   Buzz machine.com. Did you know he's the Leonard Tap Professor for journalistic
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.020]   innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York?
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:22.860]   Did you know that? He does. Our show today brought to you by your belt, Jeff. My belt too.
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:27.500]   We love our slide belts. Now the problem with the click, click, click, click, click, click,
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.660]   I know, isn't that sound great? The problem with belts is they were designed. I think the belts are
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:38.380]   older than forks. Belts were designed in like the eighth century, maybe even older than that.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:47.020]   Take a piece of leather of animal skin, punch hole in it, tie it up around waste. The problem is
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:52.780]   five, six holes. One of them has to work. Otherwise your pants fall down or worse.
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:28:00.220]   Your pants, but you can't talk because they're so tight. Belts just are old-fashioned. That's why
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:04.620]   slide belt is a better way. Slide belts by Brig Taylor. It's time for the holiday season. If you're
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:08.460]   trying to find a gift, your love one will love and is guaranteed to fit,
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:13.740]   look no further than slide belts by Brig Taylor. These guaranteed to fit. So here's how the slide
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:20.860]   belt comes. This is my Twit monogram belt, which I really like. You can get a monogram. This is a
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:27.420]   chrome with, I think this is vegan leather. They have top grain leather. They have full grain. You
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:35.660]   get your choice. What happens is it's all one size. You cut this end. It's got measurements on it
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:41.420]   to fit your general waste size. Then you put it in here. This is changeable. So the slide belts
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:47.180]   are interchangeable. So now it's part of the slide belt. This is my favorite part. When you put the
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:54.700]   belt on, it's got this patented ratchet mechanism, not six holes, 32 little notches.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:02.540]   By the way, it looks like you could do about six inches either way from, so you really have
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:08.540]   some room for growth, shall we say? Listen, when you put it on, it sounds so good. There's the ratchet
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:13.900]   right like that. Although when you loosen it, completely silent. So get it just right so your
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:18.380]   pants are comfortable, but aren't going to fall off. Then if you have a big meal or you just want
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:23.340]   to relax at the end of the day, you slide it up a little bit more. I love these. And they have
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:28.620]   every style unisex survival belts for adults, colorful belts for kids. Here's a, this is a
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:36.300]   blue canvas. And I really like this buckle on this, the distressed chrome. They call it brass,
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:41.580]   brass buckle with a navy canvas belt. They can be worn casually. This would be perfect for
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:49.180]   casual, casually around the house. Or for, you know, dress or any special occasion. And let me show
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:55.020]   you this. If you're going out in the woods, if you go out in the woods today, prepare for a big
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:30:02.380]   surprise. This is the slide belt survival belt. This thing, did we give you one of these, Jeff?
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:10.620]   No, I don't think you trust me with that. So it looks like a regular belt. But inside, it's got
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:19.820]   a very sharp knife. Look at that. It's also got a bottle opener. It's got a flashlight,
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:25.580]   very bright LED flashlight. And it's got a fire starter. And that's all inside your belt.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:32.860]   So if you get lost in the woods, no fear. Slide belts is here. This is the slide belt survival
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:39.740]   belt. And I have to say, I bet you you could get through TSA with that one. Because you can't
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.980]   tell. It just looks like a regular belt bottle. Don't try, please. And don't write to me if you
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:50.620]   don't Leo said he kept my belt. He said, but they, you know, you put through the x-ray. They might,
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.380]   I guess they'd know what it is. But it really looks cool. This would be great for a groomsmen's
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:31:00.140]   gift, you know, for a wedding, something like that. They also offer swappable watch bands.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:08.060]   For ultimate customization. Look, there's some great stuff. Click the gift sets tab there.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:13.260]   Those are already heavily discounted. So they don't apply the twit code doesn't apply to them.
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:18.300]   But you're going to get some great deals on a variety of belts and watches and so forth.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:22.540]   And everything else on the site, when you use the Africa Twitter, check out you get 20% off your
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:32.060]   order. Go to slide belts.com/twit. Again, use the code twit at checkout 20% off your entire order.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:36.460]   This is the place to get all that shopping done for the holidays. And see when it comes time to
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:41.980]   change the belt out, a key or anything you can, you could just loosen this and the strap comes out.
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:46.620]   It will never come out by accident, but it's easy to get out and then you could put another
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:56.540]   buckle on it. So it's very customizable. Slide belts.com/twit. Mr. Pichai goes to Washington.
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:03.180]   Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, there was some great, it's so fun to watch our Congress
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:09.580]   attempt to understand technology. Steve King, everybody's favorite Nazi representative,
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:21.180]   holds up his iPhone and says, how come when my, what was this, his niece, his daughter searches
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:25.420]   for my granddaughter? My granddaughter. My granddaughter was a surgeon. granddaughter was on some game.
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:30.460]   And then I'm guessing it was an alert. Up pops her grandfather was something awful about him.
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:37.340]   That's because he does awful things. Your grandpa is a racist. Yes. And he holds up his phone and
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:42.700]   Sundar has to say, the iPhone's made by another company. I don't, I don't know. I think about that.
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:48.780]   And then King says, well, maybe it wasn't his phone, but it might have been the Android phone.
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:56.300]   Then they say, well, why is it when we search on Google for idiot, we get pictures of the president.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:05.420]   Why is that Sundar Pichai? What was, what was Sundar's response? Sundar explained that they just are
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:10.780]   looking at the data from what people do. That was a democratic ask that, actually. Algorithms, man.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:16.380]   Algorithms. Algorithms. And then, but let me let's, before we go on, let me just point out,
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:21.100]   you know, because part of this is, the part of this hearing is because this
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:30.940]   contention that Google somehow stifles conservative thought. But it's, you know, you don't, what you
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:35.740]   don't want Google to do is to say, Oh, look, every time somebody searches for idiot, they're
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:41.420]   getting President Trump, we better fix that. That's what you don't want to have. Right. That's
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:47.340]   called the data. It's idealizing. So what, what Pichai said at some point is there's not a little man
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:53.660]   there editing these things. That's what I tell my parents hugely. It is not a little man on your
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:59.900]   computer. I was on MSNBC this morning with Stephanie rule talking about this. I love. So I made
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:06.540]   my regards. She's great. She's just great. So I made a list of the idioces. Right. You have Bob
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:10.860]   Goodlatte starting off saying you have more data. You have so much data would make an NSA blush.
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:15.900]   Oh, no, sir. Good latte shouldn't the NSA make you blush since it knows a hell of a lot more than
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:20.700]   Google does. And it victimized Google and you have Steve King, then you have Zorloff.
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:27.100]   Right. Then Steve Cohen, who's a Democrat, wanted a help tutorial line for people. Oh, please,
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:32.540]   because there's too stupid to use search. Oh, please. And then he complained, I'm on MSNBC.
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.940]   I had appearances on MSNBC. I had eight appearances on the embassy. I don't know that they don't come up.
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:44.700]   And then you had Matt gets wanting to know how many liberal employees there are. That's a little
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:51.260]   scary. Then you have Steve Chabat, C H A B O T. I don't know that he was amazed that if you search
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:55.980]   for American Healthcare Act, that was the Trump one. All these bad things come up.
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:01.100]   People are saying now. Now, let me say this though. And so many chat was pointing this out.
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:06.140]   Some years ago, when people were searching for Michelle Obama in the image search,
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:11.660]   you got pictures of gorillas. And Google fixed that, did they not? Yeah, you got well,
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:16.620]   it wasn't I wasn't Michelle. It was it was a search for gorillas. And then African Americans
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:21.100]   would come up. So now you basically can't search for gorilla. They don't know how to deal with
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:26.940]   someone. So they did a broad, but they can fix stuff like that. They can fix. Oh, that's that
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:37.020]   they do. But that's not saying that. Hello, Mr. Cohen, you think that your MSNBC appearances
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.900]   should be higher than you don't get to choose that. You don't get to choose that. And there's not a
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:48.940]   little man. And then and then finally, there was Ted Poe, who got really angry. Does this know where I
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:53.500]   am? Well, it depends on your default settings. Oh, you make millions of dollars. You know,
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:58.220]   you know, it gets all mad at them. Well, Mr. Poe, when you leave and you say, find me the nearest pizza,
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:03.260]   how can it do that if it doesn't know where you are? It's just it's just the idiocy is tremendous.
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:09.420]   So what I said on on MSNBC this morning was, is it should they be more regulated? I said,
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:16.460]   after this performance yesterday, who who do you want to be running the internet, Google or
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:24.460]   Congress? I'll take Google. Well, I'm not sure I want that either. I think there's some room in the
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:30.300]   middle. Yes. Not with this Congress. I don't think so. What about this, though, this New York Times
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:35.580]   article, your apps know where you were last night. Laurel panic, and they're keeping it secret.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.820]   Well, but wait a minute, some apps did have a nifty graphic, though. Yeah, it does have a very
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:45.740]   nice graphic. Yeah, we got very pressure with the self. Some some apps don't that, you know,
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:51.580]   don't need constantly to track where you are to work. I agree. If you're searching for pizza,
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:57.180]   you want to know pizza, often want to know pizza near you. And the weather channel has to
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:01.820]   obviously know where you are to give you weather. But that doesn't mean they have to sell that
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:09.500]   information with to third parties, right? They're just I think it's reasonable to say,
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:15.420]   okay, some apps need location information, but to constrain how they're using it or no.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:21.420]   Or at least they need to do. They need to give you transparency and do it and the
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:27.500]   transparency. That I agree. I'll tell you why location information. At first, it just sounds
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.740]   like, well, they know where I go. But there's all sorts of things you can deduce it with location
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:38.700]   information. For instance, if I as a married man spend the night at some other person's house,
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:43.260]   and they know where she was because of her location information, how is anyone going to get to that
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:50.460]   data? Well, I don't know if you're selling with parties. It's the it's the it's the could could
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:55.500]   chain here. Okay. Well, I'll give you one of the scary ones. They're also going to hedge funds,
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:00.700]   right to decide what what investments to make or what yeah, yeah, stay the cell,
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:04.940]   stayed up on human behavior. Yeah, I'll give you one. I'm gonna give up my number,
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:09.420]   because this one is relevant to what we're doing here. If you go down to the numbers,
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:16.620]   Scientific American, yeah, this will this will raise lots of questions. So a a study determined
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:21.020]   that Google searches on an individual level could predict heroin overdoses.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:26.860]   Well, why? Because you're searching for narc is your well, you're looking for various things.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:34.540]   And so it predicts hospital visits based on accurate usage with some level of accuracy, right?
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.340]   And actually, though, the person who created this report
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:43.820]   actually celebrated it because it gives just new innovative approaches to analyzing data
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:47.100]   relating to the opioid epidemic. In other words, this isn't a negative.
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:52.460]   This is a positive. It's a positive, but you're that one
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:59.100]   opioid drug user. Right. And do you fear they're going to come knocking down your door? You're
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:04.300]   going to get into all of the what bad things could happen argument here too. And this is the
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:12.380]   argument Stacy and I have all the time. I put a high value on saving lives. And what you fix in
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:17.420]   this case is not the data. It's how it could be used badly, especially by government.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:25.980]   So this is why I keep trying to say leave the doors open to these good possibilities.
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:31.340]   This is fascinating. It is the terms China, white methadone and a VINSA. I don't know what a VINSA
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:37.660]   is. Maybe it's at a alternative drug. We're strongest predictors of heroin related emergency
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:44.140]   visits in Boston, Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Minneapolis, New York, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Seattle.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:53.020]   That's fascinating. So did we gain anything from Sundar Pichai's testimony in Congress?
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:59.100]   Did we learn anything just that? And it doesn't necessarily mean much, but we're not going.
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.980]   We have no current plans to go into China with a censored search.
[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:05.660]   Oh, yes, that's right. You said that three times, at least.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:11.980]   The basis of the answers was not really, I didn't feel encouraged by that.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:18.620]   Now could mean, but tomorrow, right now, there are no plans to launch.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.420]   So plans. But any better than the 100 people.
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.060]   Yeah, there were 100 people working on something.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.340]   Why? If you're not doing it.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:35.100]   Got to get paired guys. He said, we'll be fully transparent if the company does bring
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.900]   search products to China. Well, we're going to know it.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:42.860]   In a letter to lawmakers last summer, Pichai said providing such a search engine would get
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.860]   broad benefits to China. Well, yeah.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:54.540]   So my question is really, it is to Google. And I think my question really comes down to,
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:58.620]   don't you have all these companies and services in China are so embedded at this point that
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:04.620]   cater to the needs of Chinese users and cater to all the things they want?
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:08.460]   Why would anybody in China want to use Google, especially a censored version?
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.100]   What would that really, what kind of appeal would that have?
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.740]   I just don't, I don't really see the argument in the first place.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:18.460]   It just seems like, wow, Google is really willing to shoot itself in the foot for a buck here.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.820]   And it just, it doesn't look good. Oh, they're big bucks, David.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:28.380]   I think you're right. Just to compete with the existing government supported systems,
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:34.380]   probably not into a possible, but a small market share in China could mean a lot of money.
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:40.700]   It could mean some certainly. I mean, it's, it's, you know, obviously huge market.
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:45.500]   I just, I don't know if it's worth the, the public backlash and it's clear Google is getting
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:48.780]   tremendous backlash on this. And I think it comes from both sides of the aisle,
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.460]   which is the real problem for them. They're not going to find a sympathetic ear on this issue.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:56.300]   Yeah, it's interesting to see Zollofgren, who is the Google's member of Congress, right?
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.020]   Join in the hunt.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.260]   Yeah, yeah, and just be clear, David, I agree with you. I don't, Google should not be doing this.
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:09.500]   I was glad I, I, I, I have them on the back when they left. I couldn't agree more.
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.060]   But in trying to understand the motive, which is really your question,
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:20.780]   there's a, there's a discernible dollar sign or that you can put behind this decision. But I
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:26.860]   agree the damage would be worse. I just want to point out that once again, the monopoly man was,
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:34.940]   oh, what a, the mustache got bigger and bigger.
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.620]   She shows up at every, every big tech hearing.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:39.580]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:48.620]   I thought I didn't watch it, but, but I didn't, in all the coverage, I didn't see anything
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.380]   surprising really, except for the fact that he said we're not doing the China thing.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:00.780]   I guess that was maybe the main point of going and that, and that when you go as a tech executive,
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:03.500]   you know, members of Congress make a fool of themselves.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.900]   So it's, that's a really, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:11.420]   I honestly wonder what the, I, I just think that these are totally useless to the average American,
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:17.820]   these hearings. They, they do nothing but confuse the issues at this point, but not going, just make
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:21.260]   school look bad. And I think they were responding. I think they were responding to the fact that
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:25.500]   everybody was, you know, everybody was giving them, you know, a hard time about not going to the last
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:31.100]   hearing. And so even though they know it's going to be a farce every single time, it's, it's kind of a,
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.620]   it's a no-win situation.
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:37.900]   What do you think the general public takes away from this? If anything, or do they even know about it?
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:43.580]   It was way played down in a renews site today.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:49.100]   Yeah, it's over, right? Yeah. Yeah.
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:53.660]   The nice thing about Trump is that he really dominates the news cycle day after day.
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:58.540]   Well, we can call it a nice thing. Well, I mean, it just, it is a nice thing for anybody who doesn't
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:05.100]   want to be a new cycle. Yeah. The news cycle. This, you know, okay.
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:13.740]   What else there were some, there was a whole bunch of good stuff to talk about. I, am I,
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:22.620]   they're looking for Google employees who are leaking. This is an ongoing problem everywhere,
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:29.100]   but somehow Apple seems to do a good job. They have regular staff meetings about why leaking is bad.
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:36.540]   According to a former research scientist at Google, the number one priority among
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:42.460]   senior managers is to stop leaks in the media employees. Yeah, that's a bit of an overstatement.
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.820]   Yeah, I don't think that's their number one priority. Number one, maybe number two, maybe number two,
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:49.100]   maybe number three, employees of the company's headquarters near San Jose are encouraged to
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:53.980]   monitor their colleagues and list on a webpage within Google called stop leaks. Any confidential
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:59.980]   information they see externally, of course, anyone caught revealing information, the press is fired,
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:05.500]   but that's every company. Yeah. And I mean, at a company like Google, I mean, how many of these
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:10.140]   people do you think they're super proud to be spying on their coworkers? It doesn't feel like
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:16.540]   Google's the kind of company that would foster that culture. No, no, no, like it's right.
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:25.660]   Except we didn't wouldn't know about the China thing. Yeah, we wouldn't. Of course,
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:31.820]   now Janat and Zungar is apparently talking to the intercept because he is one of four sources,
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:39.900]   the only one named talking about Google's meetings at the very beginning when they started
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:45.580]   talking about this China thing. So I mean, I could see why they don't, especially if they don't plan
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:50.380]   to do it, I could see why they might might be a little upset about that. Just a little bit. Yeah.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:57.660]   But the me too stuff, you know, was that a little bit of a whistleblowing? Yeah, right.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:03.340]   It was whistleblowing. Right. Right. Yeah. And you could argue the search thing is whistleblowing.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:07.820]   You could. You could. It's not legal. This was a blowing. It's more like moral,
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:11.740]   was a blowing. But yes. Right. Had the same thing with the drone or the
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:16.060]   the when they were trying to help out with the drones. Yes. I mean,
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:20.140]   that was a program. Yes, right. They went public with that. No, interestingly, David,
[00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:28.060]   I was not an event a few weeks ago where I forgot who wasn't talking but just said that
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:33.740]   that decision has really affected the relationship of DoD with Silicon Valley.
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:41.660]   And that and that there's a lack of trust now from the defense side because there's a belief in the
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:45.500]   defense people that, you know, this would have been more accurate. We're to save lives, blah, blah,
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:49.180]   blah. There was an argument that was there. Well, Jeff Bezos, I'm not coming up. But I think Jeff
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:55.100]   Bezos maybe got some moral gain some moral ground by saying, look, it's our job to help our military
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:47:02.220]   and help the government to help our country. It's it's unpatriotic not to make all whole new kinds of
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:05.820]   weapons that can be used in new ways and reused by bad guys. You know, you want to go to the what
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.980]   bad could happen world. Maybe you just don't want to be in the weapon business.
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:14.940]   Yeah, I think so. I think that's again, for a company with Google's image, I feel like being
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:21.500]   in the business of weaponizing anything at all is probably just not. I don't think that's something
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:26.380]   they want to step in. I mean, they're protecting freedom. Yeah, I mean, you can argue that, you know,
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:30.380]   you're saving lives, you know, you're making the drones smarter, you're you're helping target ID
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:34.380]   get better. I mean, no, I mean, I don't think Silicon Valley is a pacifist.
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:39.340]   No, no, no, no, we shouldn't have a military. We shouldn't have defense.
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:43.660]   These are these are I mean, these are intended to be defensive weapons, right?
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:50.860]   Yeah, but I just think that for again, specific to Google, I think the message plays very badly
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:55.900]   for for Google is adopted such a tone and posture on certain issues. I don't think Google could
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:48:00.220]   spin that one well. I it's complete dissonance. Is it her Amazon?
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:04.700]   Say, no, we'll do it. I don't think so. I think Amazon's definitely got that, you know,
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:08.300]   we take all comers attitude. I mean, they're so focused on commerce and, you know,
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:12.700]   business is business and it's cutthroat. I think I think Amazon can totally,
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:17.340]   can totally drive with that. It's a $10 billion contract. Yeah, it's not a small.
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:24.220]   At some point, you know, you wonder what the core business of Google and Amazon is going to be.
[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:30.140]   In both cases, it may be AI. And if that's your core product and core offering,
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:34.780]   that's where your core value comes, then passing up government contracts. You know, again,
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.100]   there's a there's a dollar sign you can put that decision.
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:52.540]   Reuters, Dateline, Tuesday, Super Micro says, we hired Nardello and Company, a global security firm
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:58.460]   to audit our motherboards. We test they tested samples of old motherboards like the one sold
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:04.220]   to Apple and Amazon that Bloomberg said were infected with spy chips and new motherboards.
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:11.100]   It examined software and design files found no unauthorized components or signals being sent out.
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:16.460]   Bloomberg got it wrong, according to Super Micro, and they had an audit to prove it.
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:21.180]   This story is super fascinating. What a shock. What's going on now?
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:25.900]   I mean, you know, I was in Bloomberg on this. This is time for Bloomberg to step forward and either say,
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:29.500]   Oh, yeah, we got it wrong or they got it. They got some splaining to do.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:34.220]   I mean, I think this is mostly fascinating is kind of an inside baseball thing just because
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:39.740]   it's like, who told Bloomberg what and why did they believe it? You know, it's in probably had to
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:45.340]   tell them many times and probably had to, you know, create some evidence that was basically just
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:52.300]   completely fake. I mean, I can only imagine the whole thing is really just it's totally crazy.
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:55.660]   We've been talking about this since the first story.
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:50:02.700]   And it's, you know, I defended Bloomberg for a long time. I talked to Mark Millian who works at
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:06.780]   Bloomberg. He knows the one of the authors he said he worked right next to him. He's very technical,
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:12.780]   very smart. He is not somebody who would be fooled. The Bloomberg's editor in chief came from the
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:18.220]   economist, highly respected. He was involved in over for over one year in the development of this
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:26.540]   story and presumably putting the authors, you know, to the test. They went with it. They said we had
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:31.180]   17 sources and they're still sticking by it. And apparently this was yesterday that this
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:35.420]   this report came from Super Micro. We haven't heard anything from Bloomberg.
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:39.820]   There's like apparently they're still sticking by it.
[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:45.740]   I mean, you just have to wonder at this point how deep does this go? I mean,
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.540]   are we talking like a state level actor kind of scary?
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:49.500]   It's scary, right?
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:54.460]   I know. It's so it's it's I mean, the intrigue is driving me crazy. I hope I hope eventually we
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:59.180]   figure it out. But I I kind of wonder if we ever will at this point, the only thing I can say,
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:04.700]   first of all, if you take this review as on face value that there and by the way, I think I do
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:09.660]   because nobody else has come up with any of these rice kernel size spy chips.
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:16.380]   And there are lots of these boards out there. So I'm having I have to think Bloomberg got it wrong.
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:20.220]   So then the question is, well, how could that happen?
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:26.860]   And I have to think that they that that this was a concerted effort on the part of the US
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:29.340]   intelligence community to
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:33.660]   mislead the care of the bird Jesus, right?
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:37.980]   And this ties in now to the arrest of the Huawei COO and to the
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:44.460]   government. This is is this part of a trade war against China?
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:49.260]   Is these days God knows it could be the problem. We just don't know, do we?
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:57.340]   One question here. So let's say you're you know, who who got a lot of these boards like Apple?
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:02.860]   The Bloomberg story would talk particularly about a company called Elemental, which makes
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:07.980]   a streaming device we use. Amazon was in the process of buying element. Oh, they have bought
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:16.380]   them since. And in Amazon's Bloomberg quoted on name sources from Amazon and Apple, but in
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:22.300]   Amazon's due diligence, they discovered they say they discovered these spy chips on these
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:27.340]   elementals. Elementals are used not only by podcasters, but by the Department of Defense,
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:35.580]   by lots of people to stream video. And the presumption was this was some sort of Chinese spy effort.
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:40.140]   They didn't necessarily blame Super Micro. The thought was it could have been introduced by a
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:46.220]   supplier or a manufacturer. So if you're elemental or if you're Apple and you do just
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:52.540]   just just because Amazon. So Amazon denied it. Apple denied it. Not only that for the first time
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:59.020]   in public, I demanded a retraction. They said we've never found such a thing that didn't happen.
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:06.300]   If they did find one, they'd be loath to announce it. But I don't think they would step forward
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:09.500]   in such a public way. Yes, it's like you're right. Not. Yes. Right.
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:15.740]   I think at this point, I don't think Bloomberg made it up.
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:21.980]   So I think that they were I think they were played. I think that's the only possible.
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:26.300]   Yeah, these guys would be that. They had to do that. Yeah.
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:32.940]   I mean, at this point, I feel like the only avenue for this to really advance is somebody's got a
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:37.740]   file defamation lawsuit. That's well, Super Micro says we're considering our legal options.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:42.300]   Can you defame a company?
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:49.980]   I guess you would call it. No, you could probably argue a loss. If there's a loss,
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:53.740]   if there's going to be a cause of action, I'm sure. Well, you don't have to have a loss to sue
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:57.900]   and say you defamed us. You may not get big damages, but you can at least sue.
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:01.580]   They're not protected by the First Amendment if they knowingly lied.
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:06.220]   Right. They are protected by the First Amendment if they
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:11.500]   didn't do it with intent, right? I'm not an expert on the First Amendment.
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:15.180]   But I feel like the point of a suit wouldn't be any kind of monetary. No,
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:19.580]   it would be to get the lumber. Yeah. Give up the goods. Yeah. Yeah. Discovery. Yeah.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:27.260]   What protections do they have, Jeff? So I was just was looking up here on the God bless of Google,
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:32.540]   which knows where I am and I'm fine with that. See, I searched and it didn't give me German law.
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:41.180]   It gave me an American law because it knows where I am and I'm not harm. It's okay. Calm down.
[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:46.780]   Anyway, it says that a company can be defamed, though only small corporations can sue for defamation.
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:49.020]   Big corporations can't.
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.100]   Companies like people have reputations that can be damaged. However,
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:57.260]   though companies can claim damages for loss of reputation, they can get nothing for injury
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:01.660]   to feelings. Yes, but I understand that. But they by the way, at least could get a change.
[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:04.620]   That's wrong. Oh, we didn't, you know, or whatever.
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:16.380]   I mean, it would have been an small corporations or those which employ fewer than 10 people.
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:19.420]   Oh, that's true. That would turn out related to any other corporation.
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:25.180]   For the purpose of kind of, why is that? I don't know. I guess, I mean, probably the cause of action
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:28.940]   that would be something like tortious interference, you know, in the Apple or one of these companies
[00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:32.380]   could just claim, Hey, you interfered with my business. So, you know, I can demonstrate a loss,
[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:37.500]   you know, and I'm sure they can. I'm sure they had calls and emails from tons and tons of companies
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:41.420]   and people that they work with deeply concerned about that. I will say, I mean, you know, I
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:45.580]   didn't know there was a law super micro stock plummeted after this story.
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:51.500]   Yeah. And by the way, to people who don't like Bloomberg, they say that was the reason,
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:56.860]   because Bloomberg reporters, we've been told, get paid based on moving the market.
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:56:04.860]   What? I know. I don't. That's what I said. What? I don't believe that. I don't believe that either.
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:09.340]   I'd have to think the S is such a moral hazard.
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:16.060]   Here it is from business insider Bloomberg News pays reporters more if there's stories
[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:21.260]   move markets. It's one of many metrics factored in reporters annual bonuses.
[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:25.660]   This is from 2013.
[00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:32.460]   We asked Bloomberg back to practice a company spokesperson, acknowledged it.
[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:37.580]   It isn't news unless it's true at Bloomberg News. The most important news is actionable.
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:41.500]   That means we strive to be first to report surprises and markets that change behavior.
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:45.340]   And we put a premium on reporting that reveals the biggest changes and relative value across all
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:54.060]   assets. You could say, well, there was a definite bonus in the picture if they could harm
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:57:04.540]   super micro. Yeah, I guess. I don't want to impugn the motives or the integrity of these two
[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:10.380]   reporters. For everything I know, they're good reporters. They're not still.
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:19.500]   It is a mysterious story. I want to know more. We want to know more.
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:23.900]   And I think if you're super micro, you might have good reason to be pretty darn angry.
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:32.780]   But you know what? Bloomberg call us. We'll put you on. I'd like to hear your story. I'd like to
[00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:39.020]   hear your side of it. So you brought up the Huawei story. Yeah, let's do it. We'll tie this into
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:47.580]   the Huawei story. So by the way, as Carson said, is the is a man on the way to in new it, on the
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:52.380]   road to a new it. She's been bailed out, right? Yes. None of it counts. None of it.
[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:58.620]   It's the new Bob Hope and Crosby movie, the road to none of it.
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:05.260]   Imagine that she will then be exfiltrated from Canada. And so that she doesn't have to stand
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:10.220]   trial in the United States. She's supposed to stay in her home. Are they surrounding it?
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:15.580]   I doubt it. I don't think I mean, Canada can't be too pleased to be in the middle of this because
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:19.980]   they can ease them. That's now arrested in China. Yep. Immediately Canadian
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:23.740]   diplomat arrested in China. And if you're an American business person, I wouldn't be going to
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:30.860]   China anytime soon. And so then Trump saying he made her V now the problem is that any
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:35.820]   country out there says, Oh, we got a negotiation going on. Let's arrest ourselves a few executives.
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:44.700]   So Meng Wanzhou is the CFO of Huawei. She's been accused by a US Department of Justice and was
[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:52.140]   arrested in Canada at the behest of the DOJ for creating a shell corporation to bypass Iranian
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:57.740]   sanctions. So let's stop there for one second. How many companies are doing that these days?
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:04.940]   That's a question. How many are doing it? It's illegal under not under Chinese law.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:17.100]   We make it our sanctions. So is that for us to step in and arrest someone from another country
[00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:27.980]   in another country, because they're violating our law. They sold HP gear to Iran. Through this
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.780]   shell company, which they claimed was not part of Huawei. But in fact,
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:35.980]   all the employees had Huawei badges and we're getting checks right away. So I just wonder how
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:40.700]   common it is and why did I'm presuming it's fairly common. I mean, not common common. I'm
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:45.020]   presuming they're not the only company in the world to do it. And why would they pick on Huawei?
[00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:50.220]   Right. And of course, there's been a drumbeat. There's been a drumbeat for years.
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:58.460]   Don't use Huawei gear in your 5G networks. Don't buy Huawei phones. Don't buy Huawei technology
[00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:03.660]   because their founder was in the Chinese military and it's presumed that there is a connection
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:06.780]   between the Chinese. And by the way, I don't trust Huawei myself either. Yeah.
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:13.820]   But in this house of cards, God knows. Well, right. And really, this is the problem. If, if,
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:21.820]   I don't know what to say anymore. I know. I just don't know. I just don't know.
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:24.460]   But that's the point. Well, this isn't that the goal of all of this
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:29.500]   is just to confuse the hell out of everybody. So nobody knows what's going on.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:34.780]   I mean, this is what ZTE gotten so much trouble for. It is the same, same basic crime
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:38.140]   that they're accusing Huawei of here. Right.
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:42.780]   Granted, I think Huawei, it just seems so much less. It seems a little more fishy
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:47.980]   because of the timing and political situation and be because Huawei's business presence,
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:53.260]   the United States is microscopic. They sell some laptops here. That's, yeah.
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:57.820]   And so I think that's why it is a little more political. They are the number two smart phone
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:02.140]   manufacturer in the world, though, after Samsung. And they're the number one manufacturer of 5G
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:07.020]   gear. And I think that that's why all of this is going on right now because as all of the nations
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:11.180]   of the world and all the telecommunications companies in the world ramp up to 5G,
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:16.140]   they're buying a lot of Huawei gear. Canvas says we're ripping out our Huawei gear at a cost of
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:21.900]   over a billion dollars. Geez. Wow. And of the fear, of course, is that the Huawei gear is used
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:28.300]   either to spy for industrial espionage or for cyber warfare that they'll have a kill switch,
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:33.100]   they could flip and take all the networks off the air as an act of war.
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:38.460]   And not just business espionage, but like the now the Marriott hack is being
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:42.860]   Oh, let's talk about that. I don't know if I trust that. Who's saying that?
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:46.460]   I know. It sounds like more.
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:54.140]   How some mirrors? How's the car? It's a house of mirrors. I don't know what to believe.
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:02:00.060]   I mean, I mean, it's completely credible that it's a Chinese operation. It's a nation state
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:08.540]   that hacked the Marriott. Apparently, according to the accusation that they were doing this to,
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:13.740]   and this is in the New York Times article, that they were doing this, they were also hacking
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:20.860]   insurance companies and others. And this was part of a concerted effort of the Ministry of State
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:31.340]   State Security, the China's communist controlled civilian spy agency. But it's related to the trade
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:42.300]   war going on. I'd like to know who is saying that it was the Chinese. Is this the White House?
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:53.820]   Was this the CIA? This is where it just gets crazy.
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:03:01.180]   Now, by the way, can I do a separate rant here? Yeah, a minute.
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:08.060]   And it may have done this before the show stopped me. I say that my students all the time,
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:11.340]   but did this before stop me? No, Germans and repeating themselves.
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:19.980]   Can we not presume that let's just talk about our dear country, that every single American has had
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:26.860]   their name, address, age, probably social security number and a credit card number or two,
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:32.700]   breached. Yeah, you could find out go to haveibenpone.com. You'll be everybody.
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:36.300]   Everybody has. Right. So what that means is, and yet we're still trying to fix the
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:41.900]   dyke after all the water is out. And what we should be doing is trying to change
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:47.660]   the transactional infrastructure such that all that information is useless. You can't do
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:59.020]   anything bad with it. I don't want to say this. So some bozo has more than once used by name to
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:04.700]   get cable service in an entirely another city. Really? Yeah, they have a cable company.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:11.420]   Three of them didn't check credit. So I've got to go to the police tomorrow to file another
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:20.540]   report. It was fraud. And because the problem is that the companies didn't do their job.
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:29.740]   So it's easy. We've always made it too easy to defraud companies because their rate of loss
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:33.180]   is small or what the hell they're writing up some stuff. They'll collect some stuff. Okay, fine.
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:41.260]   But that means that the data should not be enticing. If we fixed the structure,
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:46.220]   data breaches for these issues wouldn't be an issue. And it could be for other issues.
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:53.100]   But on a broad scale, it just wouldn't be. That's what we've got to fix. And there's zero talk about
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:59.500]   that. What do we have an FDC for? How do we protect the consumers? And we've got to make data
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:05.420]   breaches mean less. Companies have to do a better job that's really clearly true. And the only way
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:11.260]   they're going to do that is if it costs them more, not to. But we're nowhere near doing that.
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:17.500]   Nowhere. Yeah. I mean, we have an entire society that's got insurance built upon the notion that
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:22.780]   these things are going to happen. Right. And so when losses are incurred, everybody gets their
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:26.540]   stuff back. Yep. So does the insurance company fight for this? Do they go to the
[01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:31.580]   Congress and say change the laws? Kind of cause somebody something. No, you know what? The
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:35.420]   imprisoned cost is you because you're the one has to waste time going to the police. Oh, and
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:39.820]   what it really makes me feel bad is wasting the police's time. Yeah, I don't know where they're
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:47.820]   not doing much. But Lily, Lily Hay Newman today and wired and she's good. She's your security
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:58.700]   reporter. If China hacked Marriott if 2014 marked a full on assault, she says, if that was China
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:01.980]   involved in the 2014 hack of the Marriott, because that's what happened, by the way,
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:06.060]   that would make it just one of several devastating, roughly concurrent cyber attacks against the
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:11.020]   United States. The same year, Chinese actors pilfered extremely sensitive and expansive data
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:16.140]   on tens of millions of US citizens. Remember this from the office of personnel management?
[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:25.500]   China. In February 2014, anthem was hacked China names, birthdays, addresses, social
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:32.220]   security numbers, even income data. Throughout 2015, analysts noted the intelligence value to
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:37.020]   China of gathering in depth information on so many people from multiple sources. The diverse
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:42.380]   it this is why, by the way, this is this this is the motive. The diversity of data could allow
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:48.540]   Chinese espionage agents to check and cross reference information and track individuals over time.
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:55.740]   If I were if this is a crane hassled senior director of threat research at a gary, it's a
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:07:00.780]   fishing defense firm used to work as a digital behavior analyst for the FBI. If I were a foreign
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:06.140]   intelligence service, by the way, good use of the subjective tense screen and wanted to get a
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:11.020]   complete picture about a specific group of people. These are exactly the targets I would
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:15.820]   select. OPM contained comprehensive data on government employees, anthem contained detailed
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:20.380]   personal information, Marriott contained travel records from a foreign intelligence perspective.
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:26.540]   It would be very useful. That kind of makes sense. I see what they're saying. They get the
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:31.660]   huge bucket, but they've already got a list they're looking for. They're looking for US agents.
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:38.380]   Building a map. Yeah. Exactly. Okay. So in fact, that's the best outcome possible
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:44.380]   for you and me, unless you're a Chinese agent, David, I don't know, or a CIA agent, but it's
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:48.380]   spent for a normal person. They don't care, right? They don't. Well, unless they're finding a
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:52.860]   revenue stream and reselling it. Well, Russians would do that. Right. Yeah.
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:08:02.060]   The US and China had agreed to a landmark digital truce in 2015. We didn't report on that. I wish
[01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:07.500]   we had that banned digital assaults on private companies to steal trade secrets. The Daytona
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:12.700]   seems successful for a while, right? Say Newman, but over the last 18 months, China has yet gradually
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:17.740]   eroded the agreement, pushing its boundaries and ramping up hacking efforts in areas outside
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:25.420]   the deals scope. So these are old hacks going back four years, three or four years. They agreed
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:31.020]   that to stop doing that, but they're finding other avenues. Even then less hacking doesn't mean
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:37.900]   no hacking. All the data that we had certainly indicated that we had certainly indicated a
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:43.420]   decrease in activity, but decrease does not mean it went to zero. J. Michael Daniel,
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:46.860]   White House cybersecurity coordinator during the Obama administration.
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:55.660]   Wow. So maybe it is a true story. Maybe, maybe we're just having a delayed reaction to
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:09:00.780]   bad action, bad acting on the China's part all along. I don't know.
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:05.580]   And I think we're just getting this influx of this news this week because of the news that
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:10.860]   the administration wants to announce all these these crackdowns on China. Right. And so, you know,
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:17.020]   they're building the case. I just feel manipulated. I really do. Don't we all. And we don't know
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:22.860]   who's manipulating who's pulling the strings. Oh, all right. I'm going to take a break. We'll come
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:31.340]   back. I want to play the video. It's official now. YouTube rewind 2018. Now the number two
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:37.660]   most hated video on YouTube. Let's make it number one. Let's make it number one. You can all help
[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:43.340]   right after this. I showed it. I showed it. I brought to you by cash fly and literally,
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:47.980]   quite literally when you go to a twit.tv or website and you watch a show, when you download
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:54.220]   the podcast, you're getting it from cash fly. It's our content delivery network, our CDN.
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:10:01.180]   Make this the last month your CDN gives bill gives you a headache with cash fly. You know,
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:07.100]   every second your site's down means money being lost on your watch. And it's even worse if you
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:12.220]   can't predict CDN costs because of unpredictable usage bills. We'd be like that. We've been on
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:19.100]   cash fly for more than 10 years. And our downloads are very spiky and very unpredictable. If we had
[01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:23.660]   if I had a log in to cash fly every minute to see, oh, is it going to go over the limit this month?
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:30.620]   I wouldn't have time to do anything else. Fortunately, I don't have to because cash fly works with you
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:37.580]   to create a custom plantar to your needs based on yearly usage trends. And boy, do we save on
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:43.020]   average customers who switched to cash fly save more than 20% and have I ever had a CDN
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:49.420]   CDN outage in 10 years? No, no three. Have we? No, never had a three. We screwed things up,
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:53.580]   but that's not cash fly. No three AM calls from cash fly.
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:58.860]   R's tech. I'm not the only one. R's technical is director of technology says,
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:03.180]   sometimes we have spike events generating 15 to 16 million page views with cash fly.
[01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:08.540]   You know, it's the issue. The CDN just absorbs it. Our customers commend us on that.
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:14.060]   I like it that no one's ever complained to me that they can't get our podcast from cash fly.
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:19.500]   It's always there. It's always fast. If you get if you get if the podcast loads fast for you,
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:26.220]   thank cash fly. And if you have content you deliver to customers, whether you're a podcast
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:31.180]   network or you have video or maybe you're doing software as a service, a game developer,

[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:10.380]   Thank you, cash. Yes. We were, you know, it's Matt Levine. He's a great guy, founder of cash
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:15.500]   fly. He came to us way back when and said, you know, we should help. We could help because do
[01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:18.940]   you remember that John in the beginning? We were using BitTorrent and stuff to get people to get
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:23.740]   the show to people. Oh, God. Who is crazy? We'd say, okay, who wants to seed the episode this week?
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:32.140]   All right. Let me just see what the so this is YouTube does this every year. They call it the
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:36.700]   rewind and it is kind of like the highlights of the year right on YouTube.
[01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:45.500]   A hundredly stylized. Yeah, it promotes their stars in a that's really over produced way. It
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:50.620]   always has done that. Yes, 116 million views and less than a week. But this is the number that's
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:59.820]   interesting. 9.4 million thumbs down, making it, I think only second to, to what is it, baby?
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:06.940]   Justin Bieber hit. I don't know that, but see that just it's spike. It's not that they don't like it.
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:13.740]   Right? I don't know. Let's watch. Here, here's somebody standing looking over the, what looks
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:24.380]   like the Grand Canyon. Who is it? Will Smith. It's rewind time. If I control rewind, I would want
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:30.700]   what can you work night? What can you do? That's right. Oh, Marcus Brownlee name checked by the
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:36.060]   famous Will Smith. And there's Marquez. Is this what you want us? You know who I would have asked
[01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:41.100]   for? I don't know who he is. Quit horsing around. Or him. Play me some of that jumping music. Okay.
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:47.580]   You said jumping music? Jumping music. These are all YouTube stars, right? We don't know any. I get it.
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:53.420]   We're too old. Allegedly. At the end, they're quite interesting. Oh, it's a Fortnite bus. I get it.
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:58.540]   They're all jumping out of the Fortnite bus. I get it. I don't even know. Thank you.
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:09.660]   Will Smith bungee into the Grand Canyon live on YouTube? Is this Marcus? Here I like that.
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:14.380]   I guess they're showing off the international.
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.300]   Yes.
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:28.380]   So guys, apparently we survival rewind this year. Y'all, we can do whatever we want.
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:33.580]   Who does this appeal to? Henry, you're 25? Well, what do you know? 24.
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:41.820]   That's my son. He, yeah, dad knows. Okay. I recognize Casey and I step. Do you know who these people are?
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:46.860]   Well, I know they're mostly YouTubers.
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:52.300]   Ninja. Okay. So he's a Fortnite player. He was a guy driving the bus. He actually should have
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:59.260]   recognized the hair. That was Ninja. Casey, I recognize. Tell me who else these are. Come on, Henry.
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:09.340]   This is your, this is for you. This is for you. Or are you two old? Is it for eight? Is it for 12
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:17.900]   year olds? Who's this for? Oh, I know that is. That's the guy with the beer. That's the guy
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:23.740]   explains everything. He's a guy who ruins everything, right? Or no? That's not him.
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:26.860]   She's some makeup YouTuber, right?
[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:34.620]   He's a science guy. They're in, it looks like they're in China or Japan. I don't know.
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:43.740]   Eating food, funny hairstyle, dogs, cakes, dogs eating cakes, turkeys, people in tuxedos,
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:47.340]   champagne. Marshmallow needs to be in these videos. That was, yeah, well, Smith at the
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:53.180]   beginning. He recognized well Smith. There's Marshmallow, who played with Ninja in the Fortnite
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:16:00.220]   celebrity match. I remember that. Some cowboys ice skating for reasons no one fully understands.
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.900]   Okay, I'm going to give this a thumbs down.
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:08.780]   Bongo cat production. I mean, this, this even for YouTube. How much do they spend on this?
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:12.300]   They spend a lot of money to go around and get people. But you know,
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:20.620]   my feelings challenge, right? This is not for us. I realize this is for YouTube creators.
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:24.460]   Because this is that you'll go, oh, I can't wait. I've got to be in the next remix. Like,
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:30.460]   this is a reward for working on Google's farm, right? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:39.340]   Okay, now he's, what's that called? Crumping? What's John Oliver, Never Trevor Noah?
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:44.540]   Ninja, Ninja, right? Pink hair, blue hair, whatever. Okay.
[01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:50.140]   Partunes. What's the, what's the beast there? What's that tarantula all about?
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:54.060]   That is Lucas the Spider. Lucas the Spider. Thank you.
[01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:59.180]   You know that because you have a young kid. That's because of your kid, right?
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:03.180]   He's coming to themselves this year. He's coming to help the cause that matter to the most.
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:07.260]   There's a kitty cat. Everyone who proved it's okay to talk about mental health this year.
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:10.700]   I'm showing that view is that it's okay to go through the time. And now the serious moment.
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:14.700]   It takes a lot of bravery to be that vulnerable. And I'm so proud of this community.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:21.020]   I think this year's rewind should celebrate the fierce, fabulous, and empowering art of drag.
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:23.900]   I want to see all of you be your own kind and beautiful.
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:26.220]   All of a look, you know, the education, the people who give you best education.
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:27.420]   Those people who raise money in the field of education.
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:31.740]   We also give a moment to Asian representation in entertainment this year.
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:35.100]   Major strides were made. And the people who put aside their differences.
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:36.780]   Yeah, and created something really special.
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:40.460]   Here's to all women in 2018 finding their voices.
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:42.460]   So much back on the
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:44.460]   whole thing.
[01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:45.740]   Can we give a moment to working on this?
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:49.100]   This really is the biggest international focus they've ever had on this.
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:50.620]   Yes.
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:51.580]   About time.
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:52.620]   Yeah.
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:54.620]   Yeah.

[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:07.420]   And I'm here, cool.
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:07.980]   Families are received.
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:11.340]   I want to give a moment to everyone who supported me when I got sick.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:14.860]   All of the homeless messages I got made me feel like I wasn't alone.
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:16.380]   Somebody who got sick, but she's better.
[01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:17.820]   We're forgetting something.
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:20.780]   Was she famous because she got sick or famous before?
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:23.340]   She's famous because she makes awesome crap.
[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:25.340]   She makes awesome crappy robots.
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:26.300]   Oh, yeah.

[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:32.060]   Okay.
[01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:32.540]   Jeff.
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:33.420]   It's really cheap.
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:36.380]   Like I struggle to understand the immense dislike ratio on it.
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:38.940]   It's not something I would enjoy,
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:40.780]   but I think it's...
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:41.340]   I don't know.
[01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:41.980]   I just wonder...
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:43.340]   I think it's like nominating
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:45.260]   Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf to be
[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:47.580]   sexy his man alive and people.
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:51.420]   It's now become a hoot to hate it.
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:52.940]   That's all.
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:53.260]   Yeah.
[01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:54.220]   I think maybe.
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:54.700]   It's a maybe.
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:55.180]   Maybe.
[01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:57.820]   No PewDiePie in this.
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:58.220]   Yeah.
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:02.140]   That's what... I think that's probably a big chunk of those numbers.
[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:04.780]   Those people are people voting it down for PewDiePie.
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:05.980]   Yeah.
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:06.780]   Yeah.
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:07.340]   The Internet's...
[01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:07.740]   The Internet's...
[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:08.140]   The Internet's...
[01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:08.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:15.100]   YouTube is such a massive throng of people,
[01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:17.260]   and so many people with something to say on it
[01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:18.700]   have something awful to say.
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:19.980]   It's really the problem.
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:20.860]   Meanwhile,
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:22.220]   there are the vast majority of people
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:23.580]   who are perfectly fine to consume it,
[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:24.460]   and not say anything.
[01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:27.980]   And they're in, I think, still lies the problem.
[01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:30.780]   Pressing that dislike button is a lot more appealing
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:31.980]   than pressing the like button.
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.500]   Henry, do you still...
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.980]   Most of your media is YouTube, right?
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:37.820]   Almost everything, right?
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:39.580]   You go home, you watch YouTube.
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:41.660]   You want to learn how to do something, you watch YouTube.
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:43.340]   Yeah, that's more so.
[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:43.660]   Yeah.
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:45.500]   You learned how to cook really well,
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.340]   watching YouTube videos.
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:47.820]   Thank you.
[01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:48.140]   Ooh.
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:49.340]   Have you ever made a foil ball?
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:50.540]   What?
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:51.100]   Never mind.
[01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:53.980]   All right.
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:55.420]   All right, Jeff, I'm going to give you that.
[01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:56.300]   I'm going to...
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:57.740]   I am going to vote thumbs up.
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:21:59.100]   Bakes people happy.
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:21:59.580]   I think...
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:00.860]   Are you going to keep playing it or, yeah?
[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:01.260]   Should I?
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:01.980]   Do you want some more?
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:03.020]   Because yeah, because you're almost at the end
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.740]   where they have the credits, in essence.
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:06.540]   Oh, all the names.
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:07.580]   You're being a link.
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:08.380]   Oh, okay.
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:09.580]   So we can see...
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:12.940]   I do like it that it is the international scope of it.
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:13.420]   Love that.
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:14.140]   Love that.
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:16.300]   'Cause that's more honest about what's going on.
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:20.300]   I don't know why there's not more Bob Ross, but...
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:20.860]   Ah!
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:22.860]   Here's Will Smith again.
[01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.940]   So he bungeed off...
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:25.580]   Oh, that's hot.
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:27.020]   That's hot.
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:28.300]   Oh, no. It's just going to trigger me.
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:29.900]   He's on it.
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:30.380]   Is he...
[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:30.860]   I don't know.
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:32.780]   Oh, look.
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:33.820]   So maybe Will Smith's my cousin.
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:35.020]   Because Brownlee is fun.
[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:38.620]   So if you cast realize a Kashi Dotty TV by the sky,
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.140]   enjoy Phoenix, the cake clap,
[01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:41.340]   Casey Neistat,
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:43.020]   Marill Twins, Bear Hug.
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:44.860]   Wow, all these people.
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:45.420]   That's good.
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:46.700]   So you know who everybody is.
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:50.140]   Have you ever watched this guy stuff?
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:51.500]   Or is it called primitive technology?
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.740]   Yeah, this is kind of an amazing YouTube video.
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:54.380]   This guy's...
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:54.860]   Cheers.
[01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:55.340]   Yeah.
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:55.820]   It's...
[01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:56.300]   It's...
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:57.340]   It's unbelievable.
[01:22:57.340 --> 01:22:58.860]   It's good.
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:00.300]   And when the world falls apart
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:01.900]   and we're reduced to living in caves...
[01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:03.820]   We'll know how to make a house.
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:05.100]   We won't be able to watch the video.
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:06.300]   We'll hope we did once.
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:06.940]   Yeah.
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:07.660]   Now this...
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:09.980]   What I do like about this is...
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:12.780]   This is the kind of media...
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:15.660]   This is creative that you would have never seen this on...
[01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:19.020]   Mainstream media, probably.
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:19.980]   I mean, now you will.
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:23.980]   But YouTube gave scope to somebody with a crazy idea
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.260]   that turned out to be really good.
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:28.780]   We just made a YouTube play button.
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:30.140]   That's pretty cool.
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.180]   But I want that.
[01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:36.700]   All right, it's actually a rewind button, isn't it?
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:40.220]   That's kind of a nice shout out to that.
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.660]   What's the name of that channel?
[01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:46.060]   I want to say it's primitive technology, ancient...
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:46.540]   I want to...
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:47.660]   I think it's something like that.
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:48.060]   Yeah.
[01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:49.500]   His videos are totally wild.
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.020]   Here's a review.
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:52.460]   Here's PewDiePie's response.
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:54.460]   PewDiePie's response.
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:54.940]   Oh, girl.
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:57.100]   Our yearly edition 2018.
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:57.820]   Last year...
[01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:00.540]   When is this guy's 15 minutes going to be over?
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:01.420]   Oh, God.
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:03.660]   You know, as long as...
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:04.700]   As long as, you know,
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:06.700]   white male gamers are insufferable,
[01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:07.820]   he'll still be a thing.
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:09.980]   And I think that's going to be a long time,
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:10.860]   unfortunately.
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:13.820]   He really has the worst audience.
[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:15.500]   I think there's another way to put it,
[01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:17.900]   which is as long as white men are still insufferable,
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:18.780]   a lot of being insufferable.
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:19.820]   That's it.
[01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:20.700]   That's going to be forever.
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:23.260]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:25.660]   You're going to have an army after you,
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:26.380]   says my son.
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:31.500]   18 million views on PewDiePie's response
[01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:33.740]   to YouTube rewind.
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:37.100]   Roughly twice the number of thumbs down.
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:43.660]   I wonder how many thumbs down PewDiePie got, actually.
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:45.100]   Let me go look at that.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:47.340]   Gear review.
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:48.940]   Welcome to everybody.
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:53.500]   He got 53 thumbs down, but 1.6 million thumbs up.
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:25:00.780]   If you're watching him, you're drinking the Kool-Aid already.
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:01.740]   It's not really.
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:01.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:03.660]   People aren't going to come on mass to be
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:05.100]   mad at PewDiePie.
[01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:09.420]   So YouTube's official blog.
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:11.660]   Kind of a rew...
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:14.380]   A prose version of the rewind.
[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:17.420]   In 2018, you danced your heart out to Drake.
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:19.580]   Yodled and Walmart played a lot of Fortnite.
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:23.100]   It's funny that YouTube's getting a lot of credit for Fortnite
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:25.340]   when it really had nothing to do with Fortnite, right?
[01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:28.940]   Which is also kind of funny, given the massive spat
[01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:30.300]   between Google and Epic.
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:31.100]   Right.
[01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:32.620]   They're really not on good terms.
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:33.500]   Actually, that's a good point.
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:37.500]   Epic intentionally didn't put Fortnite on the play store.
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:37.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:39.100]   So they have it on Twitter.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.140]   So why would they?
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:41.340]   And YouTube's like, well,
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:43.820]   that's what you guys are talking about.
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:45.660]   This year, it was a smart company.
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:46.460]   It's...
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:47.500]   Is it?
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:48.620]   But is it really?
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:49.340]   Is it?
[01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:51.580]   This year was marked by surprising celebrity moments.
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:54.460]   In February, Kylie Jenner surprised the world
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:58.140]   with two-hour daughter and 11-minute film detailing her pregnancy
[01:25:58.140 --> 01:25:59.580]   and the birth of Baby Storm.
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:01.820]   Oh, man.
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:03.980]   That's what's wrong with YouTube right there.
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:05.740]   You can't say that's a good thing.
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.020]   53 million views.
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:10.220]   Number one top-training video of 2018.
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:11.980]   Will Smith vlogged all over the world?
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:15.020]   He jumped out of a helicopter over the Grand Canyon on a dare.
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:18.460]   Rihanna started her own Tutorial Tuesday's makeup series.
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:19.260]   And of course...
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:21.980]   So what this is all about is the big name celebrities,
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:24.940]   the A-listers saying, man, we better check out this YouTube thing.
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:29.500]   Or Rihanna said, well, I gotta do makeup tutorials.
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.500]   Oh, they've tapped out the money on Instagram.
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:32.620]   It's time for a new medium.
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:36.460]   Emerging and well-known YouTube stars showed up in a big way
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:38.620]   in the year's top-training videos list.
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:43.740]   Liza and David shared the news of their breakup through tears and...
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:44.620]   Okay, I've had enough.
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:45.980]   I can't read anymore.
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:47.660]   Let's do the Google change log.
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:49.420]   Oh my god.
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:52.060]   The Google change log.
[01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:55.420]   It's like Karsten has his finger right over that button.
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:57.100]   He's learned the entire show.
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:59.820]   I tried to surprise him, but I couldn't do it.
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:02.700]   You can't. Karsten is Wonder producer.
[01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:03.980]   Wonder producer.
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:05.500]   We should make a...
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:08.860]   Twitter-y-wind video with Karsten in it.
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:12.780]   He rips off his bow tie and underneath there it says WP.
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:13.260]   He could...
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:13.820]   He's gone.
[01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:15.580]   He could bungee off the roof.
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:16.540]   Please don't.
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:19.180]   Alpha zero.
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:21.020]   This is actually an amazing story.
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:27.580]   Alpha zero is the self-learning AI that taught itself from scratch
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:31.660]   without being given anything but the rules how to become a master at chess,
[01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:34.700]   Shogi, which is Japanese chess and Go,
[01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:38.380]   beating the world champion program in each case.
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:42.860]   It literally became the best AI
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:45.020]   by teaching itself.
[01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:47.260]   Oh no.
[01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:49.660]   We have no more games left.
[01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:51.180]   The machines have taken them over.
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:54.220]   That's kind of an amazing story.
[01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:55.740]   There's a book coming out
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:28:00.700]   by chess grandmaster Matthew Sadler and Wimmers international master,
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:06.460]   Natasha Regan, who analyzed AlphaGo's chess games for a book about
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:08.860]   AlphaGo called Gamechanger.
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:11.100]   What they say is interesting.
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:15.340]   They say AlphaGo's style is unlike any traditional chess engine.
[01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:20.460]   It's like discovering the secret notebooks of some great player from the past.
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:24.460]   That's what happens when instead of training,
[01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:27.900]   like as they did with Deep Blue, training on games,
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:31.260]   they let the AI play.
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:34.700]   They teach it the rules only and let it play a billion games
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:36.140]   and learn the rules itself.
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:37.340]   That's fascinating, I think.
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:43.820]   Google News, collaborating on the future of audio news
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:46.620]   for the Google Assistant.
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:49.980]   This one gives me chills and it's by Liz Gaines,
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:52.380]   who we all know.
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:54.460]   She's been on Twitch many times.
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:57.260]   What I didn't know is she's now the product manager for News at Google.
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:00.460]   That's why we haven't had her on Twitter in a while.
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:06.860]   Now I understand, for the past century, radio has been on what she was at.
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:09.420]   What was that podcast startup?
[01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:11.660]   ADB, I think it was.
[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:13.420]   Yeah, and then did Google buy them?
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:14.700]   Is that why she's now a Google?
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:15.740]   No, they just went out of business.
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:16.860]   They just went out of business, okay.
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:21.500]   50 DB, I don't know, something like that.
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.340]   Some number of DB.com.
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:27.100]   That was by the way, that's probably why they went out of business.
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:29.100]   Was it 65?
[01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:29.900]   Is it 48?
[01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:30.380]   What is it?
[01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:34.620]   For the past century, radio has been a one-size-fits-all medium.
[01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:36.860]   Thank you very much, not true.
[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:40.540]   Turn on the radio, you're dropped into a show in a moment of time,
[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:43.420]   regardless of what you already know, where you are, what you're interested in.
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:46.220]   I'm insulted Liz.
[01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:48.300]   Imagine if you could have your own radio.
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.140]   Oh, you mean podcasts?
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:53.580]   For the past year, we've worked with publishers from around the world,
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:55.900]   including the Associated Press Hollywood Reporter,
[01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:58.380]   Universal Online in the South China Morning Post,
[01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:02.940]   to link through the future of audio news, to think through the future of audio news.
[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:06.940]   A prototype that brings the artificial intelligence of Google News
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:09.180]   to the voice contact, to the assistant contact.
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:10.700]   This sounds like a bad idea.
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:16.060]   Anyway, I was trying to read about it, and I really didn't quite get it.
[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:19.100]   It sounds like basically your daily briefing, which is already a Google feature,
[01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:21.820]   but completely audio news focused.
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:23.500]   Well, let's see what happens here.
[01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:24.860]   I'm going to play Google.
[01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:25.500]   Play the news.
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:28.620]   Let's get started with your morning news update.
[01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:29.980]   First up is KQED.
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:30.940]   That's the...
[01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:31.980]   This is the California...
[01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:33.500]   Public radio in the San Francisco.
[01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:33.820]   I'm John.
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:33.820]   I'm John.
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:34.460]   I'm so pulved of...
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:35.900]   We're going to head to space now.
[01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:37.340]   I love when we do this.
[01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:38.700]   The Mars inside has to...
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.300]   I don't know how this is different from radio.
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:41.660]   This is actually radio.
[01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:44.940]   It's already beamed back in photos since it's a rival yesterday.
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:48.140]   When NASA's insight mentioned Mars to the launch from the Central Coast,
[01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:50.380]   Vandenberg Air Force Base six months ago...
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:51.260]   We're going to head to space.
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:52.300]   I love them.
[01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:52.460]   I love them too.
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:52.460]   I love them too.
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:52.460]   I love them too.
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:56.700]   They said this sequences were short and assimilated,
[01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:58.140]   but not short enough, apparently.
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.420]   I just made history.
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:01.740]   Never in a change, shall we?
[01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:02.700]   From the AP.
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:08.140]   Kevin Durant poured in a season high 49 points as we're team back down 18 to beat the magic.
[01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:08.620]   This is interesting.
[01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:09.580]   Is that a real voice?
[01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:10.380]   Next story.
[01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:11.660]   Here's KCBS.
[01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:15.660]   Whether it's a hotel, motel or vacation rental,
[01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:21.420]   all those little hair care products and lotions in plastic bottles will be banned in Santa Cruz.
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:21.900]   Thank you.
[01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:23.900]   'Tis the holiday season.
[01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:24.700]   Keep calm and...
[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.140]   I'm moving on.
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:26.540]   I don't...
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:29.100]   And Google fit on.
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:32.060]   Google Fit has been redesigned.
[01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:37.340]   Around new activity goals from the American Heart Association and World Health Organization.
[01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:39.980]   Physical activity recommendations.
[01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:43.500]   So, I don't know if you've not looked at Google Fit lately.
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:44.620]   You know what you've been doing.
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:45.420]   Yes.
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:46.540]   And where you're doing it.
[01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:48.780]   It's got a widget.
[01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:50.620]   That's what this breaks down to.
[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:51.260]   Hey.
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:55.100]   Oh, is it me or did they take away the Google News widget?
[01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:58.060]   Google's been taking away widgets for years,
[01:31:58.060 --> 01:31:59.420]   which when I saw this thing...
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:00.940]   Why are they putting a widget in an app?
[01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:02.700]   I thought widgets were basically dead.
[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:06.380]   Prominently featured on my pixel because I use it.
[01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:08.540]   The Google News widget, it disappeared one day.
[01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:09.580]   There's a couple of days ago.
[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:10.220]   It's gone.
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:11.100]   There's no more widget.
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:11.740]   There isn't a...
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:12.460]   There isn't a new...
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:15.740]   Because they changed Google News entirely.
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:16.780]   Is there a new one?
[01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.260]   This is the new Google News widget that was news for you.
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:22.380]   And it had my stories, the top five stories.
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:22.780]   All that.
[01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:23.660]   I use this widget.
[01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:24.300]   Oh, no.
[01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:24.860]   I see it.
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:25.580]   I'm still there.
[01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:25.980]   You still see it.
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:27.020]   It's gone on my phone.
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:28.140]   See?
[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:29.180]   Moral panic.
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:30.620]   That says David's briefing.
[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:32.220]   Yeah, you got that still as a widget?
[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:33.500]   Yeah.
[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:36.060]   I mean, I don't think I have an update to the News app or anything.
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:37.660]   Uh, go get your updates, baby.
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:39.020]   It'll be disappearing.
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:39.820]   It's gone on mine.
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:43.180]   Unless they changed the name to something else.
[01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:45.340]   I can't find it.
[01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:46.940]   I was very disappointed.
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:47.580]   Anyway.
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:49.100]   So now we have a widget for fit.
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:51.660]   Take a deep breath, relax it on one.
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:52.220]   Oh, it's telling us...
[01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:52.780]   He knows.
[01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:53.340]   He knows that.
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:54.140]   It's telling me what you do.
[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:54.940]   It's telling me all.
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:56.060]   Take a deep breath.
[01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:56.780]   Reason, I'll be real.
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:04.380]   The 4U tab comes to iOS in over 130 countries on Android.
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:06.300]   Huh?
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:08.860]   It's the in Google Maps.
[01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:10.380]   There's now a 4U tab,
[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:11.740]   just like there is in Google News.
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:16.860]   Google Maps is probably the most overstuffed product Google distributes.
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:18.060]   I just want a map.
[01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:19.900]   And the map is this big.
[01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:21.580]   And the rest of the crap is the...
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:22.300]   Is this big?
[01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:23.420]   Yeah.
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:25.020]   I just want a map.
[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:25.900]   You're at the airport.
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.660]   Would you like to try this hot new type of place?
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:29.340]   No!
[01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:30.620]   No!
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:32.140]   Explore.
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:33.580]   I don't want to explore Petalim.
[01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.420]   I just want to know where the hell I am.
[01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:38.300]   Though I do use it when I'm in a city,
[01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:39.100]   I go...
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:42.780]   I turn the map on and then I go to the explorer around me to find a restaurant.
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:43.340]   I find it very...
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:44.300]   Do you use it sometimes?
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:44.620]   Yeah.
[01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:45.580]   It can't be good.
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:47.260]   Sometimes it can be real bad.
[01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:48.700]   I think it really depends on what you're looking.
[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:49.100]   You're right.
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:51.020]   Well, you know, and soon,
[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:52.700]   up in the list is Taco Bell,
[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:53.900]   which I've actually liked being there,
[01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:54.860]   but it's kind of ridiculous.
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:56.380]   Yeah, it is.
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:57.660]   It is ridiculous.
[01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:59.820]   But that's why I use Waze whenever possible.
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:00.700]   That's when I walk.
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:01.580]   Waze is all about this.
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:04.220]   By the way, I forgot to report this news on the show.
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:06.300]   So my...
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:09.260]   Remember, I was doing my car hunt for like five years.
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:09.740]   Yes.
[01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:11.980]   One of my requirements was to have Android Auto.
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:12.300]   I got it.
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:13.500]   I finally gave up.
[01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:13.900]   Yeah.
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.980]   And I got a Mazda CX5, which I like very much.
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:19.100]   And they announced a retrofit.
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:22.620]   And it cost me an FM fortune.
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:23.180]   Because we've...
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:23.500]   Yeah.
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:24.460]   400 bucks.
[01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:24.860]   Wow.
[01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:25.980]   But I got it.
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:27.340]   Nice.
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:28.140]   And so...
[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:28.540]   I have a me on it.
[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:29.980]   I'm thinking about getting it too.
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:31.020]   But it gets 400 bucks.
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:31.020]   I did.
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:31.420]   400 bucks.
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:32.700]   400 bucks.
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:35.180]   It's 200 for the hardware,
[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:37.420]   because they got to replace the things.
[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:38.780]   And it's 200 labor.
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:41.180]   But I did it.
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:43.660]   And so I get Android Auto last, right?
[01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:44.940]   So then I discover...
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:48.940]   This story will end with genres being stupid.
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:52.060]   So I'm using it and I'm listening to a book.
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:53.820]   And I've got my Waze.
[01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:54.300]   I'm happy.
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:55.340]   I'm cruising along.
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:57.260]   Well, now I don't want to listen to Waze.
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:00.460]   I want to listen to MSNBC on Sirius.
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:03.740]   So I can't figure out how to get Sirius
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:04.860]   unless I get off my phone,
[01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:06.140]   where I'm just running a fortune.
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:06.780]   Yeah.
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:07.740]   And I can't get the radio.
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:09.100]   How can you listen to the radio?
[01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:12.860]   So finally, I did figure out that once I'm listening,
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:14.380]   was the map is up.
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:15.500]   If I hit my favorites,
[01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:16.940]   I can go to MSNBC.
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:17.260]   It's fine.
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:19.420]   And then I hit the back and go...
[01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:20.380]   But it's a little...
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:21.900]   It's Cluji.
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:23.020]   The screen...
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:24.700]   I can't tell if I want to hit a button.
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:25.340]   I can't do where it is.
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:28.220]   I cannot get the turn by turn directions to save my soul.
[01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:29.580]   Only the map.
[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:30.380]   And so I can't tell,
[01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:31.420]   "Well, how's it rooting me?"
[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:32.940]   I don't know.
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:34.060]   So I made perfect.
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:37.100]   But I figure I'll get updates.
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:39.500]   Because the updates are coming along to that.
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:40.300]   Okay, Android Auto.
[01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:42.380]   And it's pretty cool.
[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:44.300]   I think being a god of androids,
[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:46.220]   or I think you might be kind of half to do it.
[01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:48.700]   So you can help me when I get the phone.
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:50.460]   I've used it.
[01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:54.220]   Android Auto is unfortunately a product that I think has gotten worse over time.
[01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:54.700]   Oh my god.
[01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:55.740]   Yeah, I think you're maybe right.
[01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:56.940]   Well, it's...
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:57.180]   That's...
[01:35:57.180 --> 01:36:01.100]   The performance is really terrible from what I've heard lately.
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:04.540]   David, didn't it used to be that it would basically
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:06.700]   brick your phone so you know,
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:07.500]   "You can't do anything.
[01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:08.140]   You're driving."
[01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:10.380]   Yeah, I did do that.
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:11.980]   But it does do that anymore.
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:12.940]   So now I can,
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:14.540]   at a stoplight,
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:17.580]   hit the thing and see if I got a message.
[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:20.140]   Or do something else.
[01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:22.940]   So at least it's not as nanny-ish as it used to be.
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:24.620]   As long as I can play Pokemon Go,
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:25.740]   I'm heading down the freeway.
[01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:26.300]   I don't care.
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:31.740]   Except Pokemon Go always says,
[01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:33.020]   "You're going too fast.
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.100]   Are you a passenger?"
[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:36.860]   Yeah, I'm not driving.
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:40.940]   So as soon as we talk about Google Hangouts,
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:41.580]   low and behold,
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:45.180]   Google Hangouts Chat gets smart reply.
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:46.460]   Oh, this is Hangouts Chat.
[01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:48.380]   Not Hangouts.
[01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:49.180]   Hangouts Chat.
[01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:50.460]   And oh, guess who is for?
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:53.420]   You, Jeff, G Suite users.
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:55.180]   It's rolling out G Suite users
[01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:56.620]   within the next few days.
[01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:57.660]   So this is Chat.
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:00.060]   Android Police Guy,
[01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:01.660]   you've got to explain to me.
[01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:03.180]   Please.
[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:06.300]   So there's Hangouts Chat
[01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:07.340]   and there's Hangouts Meet.
[01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:08.620]   Yeah.
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:10.300]   Chat leader first G Suite.
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:12.940]   Right?
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:13.340]   Yeah.
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:15.260]   So Chat is for,
[01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:16.300]   Chat is supposed to be this
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:18.620]   intra-organizational communication platform.
[01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:19.820]   It's like Slack.
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:20.220]   Okay.
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:21.180]   It's Slack.
[01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:24.940]   It's Slack, but with more of the kind of Hangouts legacy attached,
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:25.580]   it's ugly.
[01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:26.540]   It's ugly Slack.
[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:27.500]   Yes.
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:28.380]   It is ugly Slack.
[01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:29.740]   I think that's a good way to put it.
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:32.380]   And with a more of a focus on one-to-one communication,
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:34.060]   I think, than Slack has.
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:37.340]   But, and then Hangouts Meet is just basically,
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:38.540]   as far as I understand it,
[01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:41.020]   they're taking a lot of the old Hangouts on Air platform,
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:44.540]   the meeting, the cloud meeting platform,
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:45.660]   and they're doing something with that.
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:46.540]   I've not used Hangouts.
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:47.900]   They're doing something with it.
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:49.180]   They're doing something with it.
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:50.460]   They're doing something with it.
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:50.940]   It doesn't matter.
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:52.060]   They're going to kill it anyway.
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:54.380]   That's the thing about Google products, though.
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:55.820]   Somebody's actually pointing it at me as,
[01:37:55.820 --> 01:37:57.500]   "Hey, if you look at Aloe,
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.820]   a lot of what made Aloe kind of neat
[01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:02.940]   has been hooked in the Android messages now."
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:06.300]   So when something Google dies,
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:10.460]   usually it kind of lives on with features in other products.
[01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:15.260]   And so I think that you kind of have to follow the kind of fall path.
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:18.460]   And I think Hangouts Meet is kind of from where
[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:21.980]   the original Hangouts, like voice, or the video product started,
[01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:23.340]   and Hangouts chat is kind of,
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:26.380]   Aloe meets regular Hangouts,
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:28.060]   meets, I don't know, Slack or something.
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:30.700]   So a lot of the stuff does live on.
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:32.540]   It's just like, I've never,
[01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:34.380]   I've never used either of these platforms,
[01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:35.980]   because they're enterprise only.
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:38.780]   And it's hard to keep track.
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:41.340]   So if you use Google Translate,
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:42.860]   you probably didn't even know this,
[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:44.700]   because gender bias is so built in.
[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:47.420]   But if you translated a sentence that said,
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:50.940]   "From Turkish, Obeir d'Ochdar,"
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:53.180]   it would come out, "He is a doctor."
[01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:54.620]   There was a bias.
[01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:59.180]   If you used words like strong in doctor,
[01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:00.940]   you'd get a masculine skew,
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:03.820]   or feminine, or nurse, or beautiful,
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:05.100]   you'd get a feminine skew.
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:07.420]   They're going to fix that, which is good.
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:09.180]   So now if you translate, "Obeir doctor,"
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:10.780]   you'll get two translations.
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:12.860]   "She is a doctor," or "He is a doctor."
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:13.340]   Thank you.
[01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:15.580]   That's, it shows,
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:16.780]   the reason I bring this up though,
[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:20.540]   is it shows how easily these human biases
[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:23.500]   get translated into machine learning.
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.260]   We think, well, it's machine learning,
[01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:26.620]   it's not biased, it's a machine,
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:27.980]   but it is because it's biased,
[01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:29.260]   because it's trained by biased.
[01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:31.340]   And in bias, the problem with bias
[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:33.660]   is often it's unseen, unheard, and unknown.
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:35.820]   So it's actually a difficult thing to root out.
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:39.340]   We're going to get Amy Webb on a triangulation student.
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:42.220]   She's got a brand new book all about this.
[01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:45.740]   She's our futurist.
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:48.460]   And she's been on,
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:49.340]   I think she's been on the show.
[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:51.500]   She's certainly been on Twitch a number of times.
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:54.460]   And her new book is The Big Nine,
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:57.180]   How Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:59.260]   Will Change Humanity.
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:02.540]   That comes out March 5th,
[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:04.060]   but I got, I am proud to say,
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:06.300]   a pre-release version.
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:10.300]   Let's see, what else is in the change log?
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:11.340]   All right, we're still in it.
[01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:11.660]   Oh.
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:12.940]   Oh my God, it's endless.
[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:16.940]   Or Carson has his hand over the next button.
[01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:18.140]   Yeah, he's been just leaving it.
[01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:19.260]   He's been hovering all day.
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:20.140]   It's going to sleep.
[01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:22.700]   Top trending, I love this actually.
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:25.260]   The year in search every year Google does this.
[01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:27.420]   This is better than the rewind, if you ask me.
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:28.700]   It takes a few seconds.
[01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:29.900]   I'll switch this one on.
[01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:33.420]   I will just say, when we talk.
[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:34.060]   Alex.
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:36.140]   Alex.
[01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:38.620]   Alex.
[01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:40.300]   So it looks like a cochlear implant,
[01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:43.100]   a baby that's never heard before hearing his mother's voice.
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:48.460]   This is a miracle rescue that all 13 members of the soccer team are out of the cave.
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:50.220]   He turns into a superhero,
[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:52.220]   set on beating his many homeless people.
[01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:53.020]   So cute.
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:54.700]   This election we've seen his story.
[01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:56.060]   I always like this video.
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:56.940]   Yeah.
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:40:57.420]   Yeah.
[01:40:57.420 --> 01:40:58.380]   See once again,
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:40:59.820]   and kind is not.
[01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:01.820]   Rule.
[01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:03.580]   When Google does the feel good stuff,
[01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:05.340]   I always like it.
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:06.780]   Their ads are always good this way.
[01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:14.300]   How to be a good singer.
[01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:16.540]   Oh, that lady was great.
[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:19.100]   How to be a good dancer.
[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:21.100]   Who's the answer to the outfield?
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:25.980]   Fortnite really gets a lot of credit for teaching people to dance.
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:27.100]   How to be a good kisser,
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:28.380]   how to be a good listener.
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:29.420]   I'm saying the word,
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:29.980]   Yami.
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:33.580]   What makes a good role model, Stephen Hawking,
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:36.380]   while there is like, there is George Bush.
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:39.100]   He has half the dream.
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:41.100]   They just want to notice someone care.
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:42.060]   We got love for the song.
[01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:42.300]   Right.
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:42.780]   We got to sing.
[01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:45.260]   Wow.
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:47.100]   What makes a good friend?
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:49.820]   Drum circles.
[01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:50.860]   What makes a good teacher?
[01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:52.220]   Learn how to...
[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:53.420]   What's that called?
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:53.900]   Dabbing?
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:54.780]   What is that dance?
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:56.780]   Flossing.
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:57.420]   Flossing.
[01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:57.900]   Okay.
[01:41:57.900 --> 01:41:59.900]   I'm obviously a year or two behind.
[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:03.740]   The Olympics.
[01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:06.860]   Oh, there he goes.
[01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:09.980]   That was the most bit bungeeing out of an airplane.
[01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:10.620]   Life is good.
[01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:13.500]   The world is filled with people who have been happy.
[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:14.700]   They were a day now.
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:17.340]   We love their kids and what life would their lives,
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:19.500]   the little dignity and hope.
[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:20.380]   Just like everybody else.
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:23.980]   Good things are worth searching for.
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:26.780]   It's just an ad for Guvole, really, but...
[01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:27.580]   Yeah, but it's good.
[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:28.860]   It's kind of fun to see the year.
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:32.940]   Number one search in the United States World Cup.
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:35.500]   World Cup.
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:37.020]   Number one person search,
[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:40.300]   Demi Lovato, Meghan Markle, Brett Kavanaugh, Logan Paul,
[01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:41.580]   Chloe Kardashian.
[01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:42.220]   Oh, dear.
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:42.700]   Oh, dear.
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:43.260]   Bish.
[01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:45.180]   Can't we pretend you're already a finder?
[01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:45.580]   Yes.
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:46.860]   Why are you searching for her?
[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:49.420]   Oh, I like this.
[01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:50.860]   Number one beauty question.
[01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:52.620]   How to apply magnetic lashes.
[01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:55.020]   I did in fact search for that.
[01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:58.780]   Diets.
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:42:59.980]   Keto, Dubro,
[01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:03.020]   Nume, carnivore, and Mediterranean in order.
[01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:07.500]   Jiffs, Fortnite, default dance, Dilly Dilly, orange.
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.420]   Sorry, did I say Jiff?
[01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:10.860]   Yes, you did.
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:15.420]   Jiffs, Fortnite, default dance, Dilly Dilly, orange, justice, and black.
[01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:18.940]   Anther, how to vote, how to register vote, yes.
[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:21.340]   How to play mega millions, no.
[01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:22.460]   How to buy Ripple.
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:24.300]   What?
[01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:24.540]   What?
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:26.860]   Oh, that's a Bitcoin.
[01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:28.220]   That's a crypto course.
[01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:28.780]   All right, okay.
[01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:29.900]   That was a cheap one.
[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:33.100]   See, Jeff and I grew up in an era where Ripple was a...
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:34.780]   Of fruit flavored wine.
[01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:36.940]   In fact, the first thing I ever got drunk on was,
[01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:39.180]   was I think great poll.
[01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:39.900]   Oh, that's sad.
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:40.460]   Oh, I know.
[01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:41.820]   Watermelon Ripple, that's what it was.
[01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:42.780]   Oh, that made me see.
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:44.700]   How to turn off...
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:47.660]   My son left the studio, it's okay.
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:49.980]   Loss.
[01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:52.300]   The people we lost.
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:54.700]   Mac Miller, Kate Spade, Anthony Bourdain,
[01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:56.140]   Stan Lee, Aretha Franklin.
[01:43:56.140 --> 01:44:01.820]   Movies, professional sports teams, politicians, TV shows,
[01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:03.420]   video games.
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:04.060]   This is fun.
[01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:06.940]   That's in the US, but you can, of course,
[01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:08.860]   change the locality.
[01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:09.340]   What do we have here?
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:10.540]   We're going to go to the bottom, would you?
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:11.740]   Well, I'll go global first.
[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:13.580]   And then I'll go to the bottom.
[01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:15.900]   This is the very bottom.
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:17.660]   So we'll go...
[01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:18.940]   Learn how the lists are populated.
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:19.980]   I was curious what it was.
[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:21.420]   Oh, you want me to click that link.
[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:23.100]   Learn how the lists are populated.
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:24.780]   Lists are based on search terms.
[01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:25.580]   Oh, so it's obvious.
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:25.900]   Okay.
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:27.260]   I had the highest spike this year.
[01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:27.820]   Never mind.
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:28.220]   Never mind.
[01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:29.180]   It's okay, I got it.
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:30.780]   I got it, Google, I got it.
[01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:32.220]   Oh, I see it's based on spike.
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:34.380]   It's not so it's not total popular
[01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:35.900]   because that would get really boring.
[01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:37.500]   It's going to be very similar.
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:37.980]   Exactly.
[01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:38.700]   It's ballistic.
[01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:40.300]   It's like the billboard charts.
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:44.300]   So try Germany.
[01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:48.060]   Oh, let's see what they were searching for in Germany.
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:49.900]   Yeah, it's got to be things that are scared of.
[01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:51.260]   You're going to have to translate things.
[01:44:51.260 --> 01:44:52.060]   You're scared of it.
[01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:52.540]   Probably to go.
[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:53.100]   It says, "Jeth."
[01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:56.140]   Alimine, "Such begreif."
[01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:57.660]   I don't know.
[01:44:57.660 --> 01:44:58.700]   "Tubouve m."
[01:44:58.700 --> 01:44:59.180]   I don't know.
[01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:00.380]   "Mond"
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:01.020]   Battle on Berlin.
[01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:01.900]   Have you seen that show?
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:02.700]   Yes.
[01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:03.260]   Awesome.
[01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:03.820]   Oh, it's great.
[01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:05.740]   Awesome.
[01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:07.420]   It's the number one series in Germany.
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:10.140]   Is there a second season coming?
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:11.660]   Yes.
[01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:13.100]   So the story of that is interesting.
[01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:14.940]   It's based on a series of books,
[01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:18.220]   very famous best sellers in Germany.
[01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:21.020]   And one per year starting in,
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:22.940]   what is this, 1922 or 23,
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:25.340]   and going all the way up to 39.
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:27.820]   So it's following the rise of Hitler.
[01:45:27.820 --> 01:45:30.860]   But there are mysteries where the Nazi rises
[01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:31.900]   in the background, right?
[01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:35.580]   So they're planning to make all of them, I believe.
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:36.140]   Wow.
[01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:38.300]   Now, do those two main characters stay?
[01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:38.540]   Yeah.
[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:40.060]   I love her.
[01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:40.780]   She's just great.
[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:40.940]   Yeah.
[01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:45.020]   I think that's really, really, really good.
[01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:46.460]   If you haven't seen it, but it is in German.
[01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:48.060]   It's in German subtitle,
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:50.220]   but it's the most expensive show I've made in Germany.
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:52.860]   The production value is in incredibly expensive
[01:45:52.860 --> 01:45:53.820]   show I've made anywhere.
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:56.380]   There's also an English dub on Netflix.
[01:45:56.380 --> 01:45:57.580]   And it is a crime.
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:45:58.620]   Do not watch it.
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:45:59.100]   Don't watch it.
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:00.300]   Don't watch it.
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:01.500]   You're exactly right.
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:04.620]   You can turn on English dubs on.
[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:07.580]   I was watching a German version of Stranger Things, kind of.
[01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:09.660]   And I thought it was the worst,
[01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:11.100]   because I heard I was listening to the dub.
[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:11.820]   Yeah, I know what you mean.
[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:13.660]   And then if you watch it in German,
[01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:15.020]   like the acting is suddenly good.
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:16.300]   Yeah.
[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:17.260]   You can't understand it.
[01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:17.580]   Oh, man.
[01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:19.020]   You have to say have subtitles.
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:21.260]   Is there a little video to share with our audience here?
[01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:22.700]   Of Babylon Berlin.
[01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:23.500]   Babylon Berlin?
[01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:25.820]   Probably on YouTube.
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:28.300]   Is it on Netflix?
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:29.420]   Is that where it is?
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:30.380]   It is on Netflix.
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:30.860]   OK.
[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:31.180]   OK.
[01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:32.780]   Let's give him credit.
[01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:35.820]   Here's the trailer from Netflix.
[01:46:35.820 --> 01:46:41.100]   It was really great, because historically,
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:42.540]   and the reason it was so expensive is they
[01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:44.620]   really recreated Berlin in the 20s.
[01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:46.620]   My friend is doing business on the side.
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:47.420]   It's a little adult.
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:49.740]   It is a mystery.
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:51.020]   The trailer is in English.
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:51.740]   Oh, fair.
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:53.660]   I'll do with it.
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:55.020]   Oh, it's the dub's trailer.
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:55.980]   Oh, no.
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:58.060]   Oh, that's in German.
[01:46:58.060 --> 01:46:58.860]   What happened?
[01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:00.140]   Oh, that was the Russian.
[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:00.940]   Oh, that was the Russian.
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:02.140]   So that's why I had subtitles.
[01:47:02.140 --> 01:47:06.780]   He is a World War I veteran who's still suffering PTSD,
[01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:09.260]   and it's-- but he's also at least detective.
[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:13.100]   And the Russians are involved.
[01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:13.740]   And when I--
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:14.620]   Start 28?
[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:15.980]   I don't know why I thought it started really.
[01:47:15.980 --> 01:47:16.460]   Oh, more eyes.
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:18.460]   That might make sense.
[01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:18.940]   Yeah, Hitler.
[01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:19.180]   Now.
[01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:22.300]   Oh, won't you dare me hit.
[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:24.300]   And I missed.
[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:25.180]   Help!
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:26.140]   Help me!
[01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:27.820]   Excuse me, Detective Sergeant.
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:29.340]   This man made the torture.
[01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:30.220]   Why the dub?
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:31.420]   It's so bad.
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:32.860]   Stop it.
[01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:33.660]   No.
[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:35.900]   Excuse me, Detective Sergeant.
[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:37.820]   Oh, Lord.
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:42.780]   Okay, and that's the Google change.
[01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:46.140]   Let's take a break.
[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:47.260]   You're picks of the week,
[01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:48.940]   and actually I should give you a chance
[01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:50.940]   if you want to do any stories I missed,
[01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:52.460]   because there's quite a few stories.
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:54.700]   I have left out here,
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:56.380]   including the Australian,
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:57.980]   any encryption law,
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:59.420]   the better, more positive,
[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:01.420]   but less flesh colored tumbler.
[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:07.420]   Stalling smartphone sales.
[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:09.260]   I got you under that now or after the commercial.
[01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:10.860]   I'll let you both pick David.
[01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:11.740]   You pick one, and Jeff,
[01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:13.660]   you pick a story that I missed,
[01:48:13.660 --> 01:48:14.540]   because there's quite a few.
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:18.540]   But first a word from our sponsor, Brex.
[01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:22.780]   The first corporate credit card for startups.
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:24.380]   And I'll tell you why it's for startups.
[01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:26.540]   First of all, it's fast.
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:28.220]   And if you're a startup,
[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:29.660]   you know everything you got to get done.
[01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:30.300]   You got to move on.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:30.860]   You got to move on.
[01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:31.580]   Five minutes,
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:33.180]   an online application,
[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:33.820]   and you're done.
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:35.500]   On underwriting is based on
[01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:38.460]   one thing, cash in your bank account,
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:39.260]   your cash flow.
[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:41.020]   They can offer your company,
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:41.500]   because of that,
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:43.900]   you can offer your company 10 to 20 time higher limits
[01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:45.340]   than other corporate credit cards,
[01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:47.660]   with no personal liability.
[01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:51.900]   And I completely understand the value of this.
[01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:53.900]   You also get great high value rewards
[01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:55.740]   that are tailored to startups,
[01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:56.860]   to modern business,
[01:48:56.860 --> 01:48:57.740]   high multipliers,
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:48:59.260]   and the stuff you spend the most on.
[01:48:59.260 --> 01:49:02.940]   7x on rideshare.
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:05.020]   Three times on restaurants and travel,
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:06.060]   two times on software.
[01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:09.500]   There's no limit on how many points you can earn,
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:10.780]   and this is the best part.
[01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:11.740]   I love this.
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:13.900]   Points can be redeemed for statement credit
[01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:14.860]   on transactions.
[01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:17.660]   Exclusive offers with some of the best technology brands
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:19.420]   and services that you might be using
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:20.460]   as a new business,
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:22.780]   AWS, Google Salesforce, WeWork.
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:25.660]   So because Brexit is underwriting your company,
[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:28.300]   that means no minimum operating history,
[01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:30.700]   there's no painful paper application,
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:32.540]   no personal liability.
[01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:34.380]   They merely use the cash raised by your business
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:35.580]   to extend credit.
[01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:36.940]   So you don't need a credit score,
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:38.220]   you don't need a social security number,
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:39.900]   you don't need a security deposit.
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:41.740]   It's a Visa card, it's a real credit card,
[01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:43.580]   but it's better in a lot of ways.
[01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:44.700]   It's very high tech.
[01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:47.180]   First time I used a card,
[01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:48.220]   I used it as a restaurant.
[01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:51.340]   Immediately get a text that said,
[01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:53.340]   "Ah, we got your transaction.
[01:49:53.340 --> 01:49:54.700]   Take a picture of the receipt."
[01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:55.900]   I thought, "Oh, that's interesting."
[01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:59.660]   I mean, literally within a second of using it.
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:00.780]   So I took a picture of the receipt,
[01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:02.860]   they said, "Oh good, that matches.
[01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:03.900]   We've categorized it,
[01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:05.820]   we put it in QuickBooks.
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:06.380]   It's already done."
[01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:07.660]   What?
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:09.980]   Don't even save the receipt,
[01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:11.020]   crumple it up, throw it away.
[01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:14.140]   You just reply to the text message
[01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:15.180]   with a picture of receipt
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:16.140]   and it's automatically matched
[01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:17.020]   to the transaction.
[01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:18.300]   Complete statement descriptions
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:20.460]   clearly tell you what you've spent on.
[01:50:20.460 --> 01:50:21.980]   Of course, it works not only with QuickBooks,
[01:50:21.980 --> 01:50:24.940]   but all the major software programs for accounting.
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:26.620]   I love this.
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:28.460]   Join the thousands of startups and tech companies
[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:29.420]   who use BREX
[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:30.940]   to manage their growing business needs
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:33.100]   and earn valuable rewards while they're doing so.
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:35.500]   Get the card free and,
[01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:37.500]   because you're watching the show,
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:44.780]   your card fees will be waived in perpetuity forever.
[01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:47.180]   B-R-E-X.com/twit.
[01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:51.900]   B-R-E-X.com/twit.
[01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:53.740]   You want to use that URL,
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:57.020]   because that'll eliminate the card fees in perpetuity.
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:51:00.380]   I like saying that in perpetuity.
[01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:02.140]   B-R-E-X.com/twit.
[01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:05.340]   We thank BREX for supporting this week in Google.
[01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:08.140]   David, there were some stories I missed.
[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:09.340]   Was there anything important?
[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:13.500]   Oh, David's muted.
[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.020]   An important story, I don't know.
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:21.500]   I thought that this is in particularly
[01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:24.860]   Google related, but it was a bit of a funny one this week.
[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:26.140]   Samsung was supreme.
[01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:29.500]   I don't know if you guys had heard about this.
[01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:30.220]   Tell me about it.
[01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:34.540]   So they launched their phone with the cutout notch,
[01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:36.220]   which was in the document here.
[01:51:36.220 --> 01:51:37.260]   And they launched--
[01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:38.300]   They have a client dot.
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:39.340]   It's not a whole notch.
[01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:39.820]   It's just a--
[01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:42.300]   Yeah, it's a cutout, a punch hole.
[01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:42.860]   Punch hole.
[01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:43.500]   A punch hole notch.
[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:43.820]   Yeah.
[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:46.460]   So they launched the phone,
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:48.620]   and they announced they're doing a partnership with Supreme,
[01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:50.540]   which is so hot right now.
[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:55.100]   And Supreme is a fashion brand that you pop up stores
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:57.100]   and people go buy Supreme merch.
[01:51:57.100 --> 01:52:00.300]   And it's very popular with the young people.
[01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:00.700]   Except--
[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:02.220]   It would look a little foolish on me.
[01:52:02.220 --> 01:52:06.780]   So except it turned out that the real Supreme
[01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:10.060]   doesn't have any kind of distribution or IP rights in China.
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:12.220]   So they partnered with an Italian company
[01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:14.860]   that used a copyright or trademark loophole in Europe.
[01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:15.740]   Supreme-ah!
[01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:17.740]   It's supreme-ah!
[01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:21.660]   Yeah, so Samsung, they're huge.
[01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:25.020]   You would think, how would they think this is a good idea
[01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:28.060]   to partner with an obviously fraudulent version of Supreme?
[01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:30.220]   Now, the Italian versus Supreme argues that,
[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:31.420]   hey, they're legally protected
[01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:32.860]   and there's nothing Supreme can do about it.
[01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:35.980]   But that's not really, as we say, a good defense.
[01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:36.700]   I don't--
[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:37.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:39.660]   That's just like, you can't sue us.
[01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:42.860]   OK, that's definitely grounds to do whatever you want, I guess.
[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:44.940]   But so they're now reconsidering.
[01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:46.700]   They haven't walked away.
[01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:48.300]   They haven't walked away.
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:49.900]   But they're thinking about it.
[01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:51.820]   They are. They are considering it.
[01:52:51.820 --> 01:52:54.460]   So this was translated from Mandarin.
[01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:56.380]   It said recently, Samsung Electronics announced
[01:52:56.380 --> 01:52:57.660]   that the launch of the Galaxy A&S
[01:52:57.660 --> 01:53:00.300]   that will cooperate with Supreme Italia in the Chinese market.
[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:02.860]   We are currently reevaluating this cooperation
[01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:05.260]   and we deeply regret the inconvenience caused.
[01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:06.860]   See, this--
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:09.100]   OK, so I'm really glad you brought this up
[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:11.180]   because I saw this story.
[01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:11.980]   I didn't get it.
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:13.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:15.420]   I'm not fashion-forward like you are, David.
[01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:18.460]   And so I had no idea whose Supreme was in the first place.
[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:20.060]   So now I understand.
[01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:20.460]   Thank you.
[01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:23.100]   Yeah, I think that sweater proves your point, Leo.
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:24.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:29.340]   It's a holiday festival.
[01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:30.300]   I know.
[01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:31.100]   Sorry, but it's not better.
[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:32.700]   It actually is.
[01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:34.060]   It's Supreme Color.
[01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:35.020]   Is Supreme Red?
[01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:35.580]   It is.
[01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:37.020]   Yeah, it matches the Supreme Red.
[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:38.220]   Yes, it does.
[01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:42.220]   So there's a Supreme t-shirt that costs $1,150.
[01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:44.540]   What?
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:45.340]   Why?
[01:53:45.340 --> 01:53:46.940]   Why?
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:48.860]   There's a Supreme crowbar.
[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:53.260]   I don't know if this-- it says it's official.
[01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:55.980]   I don't know if it-- it's streetwearofficial.com.
[01:53:55.980 --> 01:53:57.660]   Well, I guess that's not official supreme.
[01:53:57.660 --> 01:53:59.100]   But this is part of the confusion.
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:53:59.500]   Here it is.
[01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:01.100]   Supreme New York City.
[01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:04.540]   You can tell it's hip because they're using courier
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:07.020]   as the typeface on their website.
[01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:07.980]   They must be hip.
[01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:12.860]   Well, look at this fine reflective camo.
[01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:14.780]   See, that's what I could wear.
[01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:19.420]   This beautiful-- it's not bad $178 for polar tech hooded
[01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:20.140]   raglan jacket.
[01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:22.140]   I guess they must become collectors items or something.
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:24.060]   It sold out.
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:24.620]   Yeah.
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:25.500]   It was sold out.
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:26.700]   Everything sold out.
[01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:29.100]   The resale market for this stuff is extremely hot.
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:31.580]   And I think that's most of the hype.
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:33.020]   Yeah, it's all sold out.
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:35.420]   You can't-- oh, I'm sorry.
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:36.860]   You can't-- no.
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:37.660]   Oh, I mean--
[01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:38.620]   Let's just sold out to you.
[01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:39.420]   I can get this one.
[01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:40.380]   Look at this one.
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:41.340]   I can get this one.
[01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:42.380]   Let's get a large--
[01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:43.820]   Oh, please don't, yes.
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:44.860]   That's great.
[01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:45.820]   Oh, my gents.
[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:48.540]   It's not sold out.
[01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:50.060]   It's not sold out.
[01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:50.780]   It's all cotton.
[01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:51.180]   No, no.
[01:54:51.180 --> 01:54:51.980]   Real stock.
[01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:52.460]   Stop.
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:52.700]   Stop.
[01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:53.980]   I'm adding it to my cart.
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:54.780]   Oh, no.
[01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:55.660]   In the cart.
[01:54:55.660 --> 01:54:56.460]   Oh, no.
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:57.820]   What if I can wear that next week?
[01:54:57.820 --> 01:54:59.020]   Somebody get a piece like--
[01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:00.300]   I'm wearing it next week now.
[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:01.180]   Who knows?
[01:55:01.180 --> 01:55:02.140]   No.
[01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:02.620]   No.
[01:55:02.620 --> 01:55:03.420]   I'm not--
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:04.940]   Whoa, oh, oh.
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:06.140]   Too bad this is sold out.
[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:07.260]   I really wanted this one.
[01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:09.180]   That's the shirt I wanted.
[01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:10.860]   Oh, my lord.
[01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:12.940]   It looks like an orange sherbet cone
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:14.140]   with a lime--
[01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:16.540]   a little lime side.
[01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:19.580]   What about just plain white?
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:21.020]   This is a vampire waffle.
[01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:22.940]   See, I can see--
[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:23.820]   But these are all sold out.
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:24.700]   See, the only one that--
[01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:26.540]   The one I bought was not sold out.
[01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:29.100]   This isn't sold out.
[01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:29.580]   And there's a reason.
[01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:30.700]   This is poop brown.
[01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:33.740]   That's not sold out.
[01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:34.780]   All right, Jeff, what was your--
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:35.740]   Oh, it's your--
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:36.380]   Okay, mine.
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:37.100]   I didn't know this.
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:37.660]   This is--
[01:55:37.660 --> 01:55:38.620]   I'm sure you all knew this.
[01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:39.340]   I didn't know this.
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:42.140]   Stripe, which is a company that does transactions.
[01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:42.460]   Yes.
[01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:43.180]   For companies?
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:43.660]   Yes.
[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:45.180]   They are publishing books.
[01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:45.500]   What?
[01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:49.500]   As I was in Strand Bookstore today--
[01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:50.540]   and I see this interesting book,
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:51.580]   The Revolt of the Public,
[01:55:51.580 --> 01:55:55.980]   which was originally released in 2014 by Martin Gurry.
[01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:56.780]   And it's re-released,
[01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:58.300]   and I had never read the original,
[01:55:58.300 --> 01:55:59.740]   and it's a really nice production.
[01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:02.780]   It's beautifully done printing and all that.
[01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:04.380]   And who's Stripe Press?
[01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:11.420]   And so they've released one, two, three, four books so far.
[01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:13.020]   But it's really interesting to me
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:18.860]   that you have a company that's using this for branding,
[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:22.220]   and it's another way to support books.
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:26.140]   They're specializing in books about economic
[01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:27.500]   and technological advancement,
[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:29.420]   which is kind of what Stripe's all about.
[01:56:29.420 --> 01:56:32.620]   But it's not really native content in the sense they're not
[01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:33.740]   going to have a talking about Stripe,
[01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:34.700]   but it's interesting.
[01:56:34.700 --> 01:56:35.260]   I think this--
[01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:35.740]   And it--
[01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:36.220]   The public--
[01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:36.780]   It's associated with them.
[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:37.740]   It looks nicely done.
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:38.300]   Mitchell Walberg's--
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:39.900]   They're not even really well published.
[01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:40.220]   Yeah.
[01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:42.460]   Really nicely done, nicely designed--
[01:56:42.460 --> 01:56:44.620]   I love the cover art on all of these.
[01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:45.260]   Fantastic.
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:46.220]   They're just great.
[01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:49.420]   And not expensive, 20 bucks and 17 bucks.
[01:56:49.420 --> 01:56:53.100]   So I was thinking that they can't express it.
[01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:54.300]   Yeah.
[01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:55.820]   But if God bless them though--
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:57.660]   Stripe partners with millions of the world's most
[01:56:57.660 --> 01:56:59.180]   innovative business organizations.
[01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:00.540]   It will shape the world tomorrow.
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:02.540]   These businesses are a result of many different inputs,
[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:05.260]   perhaps the most important ingredient in these ideas.
[01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:08.940]   Stripe Press highlights ideas we think can be broadly useful.
[01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:11.500]   A Stripe if you'd like a 10th anniversary
[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:13.100]   edition of what would Google do.
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:14.060]   Let's talk.
[01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:14.380]   Yeah.
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:15.580]   Yeah.
[01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:17.900]   Very interesting.
[01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:18.220]   Very cool.
[01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:18.540]   Okay.
[01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:19.260]   Very cool.
[01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:19.740]   Yeah.
[01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:22.300]   So I've ordered the revolt of the public.
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:22.860]   Of course.
[01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:24.620]   I'm sure it mentions Gutenberg.
[01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:25.180]   Well, I have to.
[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:26.780]   It's revolting.
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:29.820]   So after our Amazon, we see this morning,
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:32.700]   put the tape up and somebody who hadn't watched it.
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:33.500]   And somebody made a joke.
[01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:36.140]   I said, well, you know, the phone knows where you are
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:37.900]   so you can find the nearest pizza hut.
[01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:41.980]   And somebody came in and a beloved twig fan came in and said,
[01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:44.380]   pizza hut Jeff, you should have said Chipotle.
[01:57:44.380 --> 01:57:45.740]   They knew.
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:47.820]   And then somebody else came in and said, well, did you mention
[01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:48.380]   Gutenberg?
[01:57:48.380 --> 01:57:49.500]   And in fact, I did.
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:50.700]   Oh my God.
[01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:51.820]   You mentioned Gutenberg.
[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:53.820]   Got Gutenberg on to MSNBC.
[01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:54.220]   Nice.
[01:57:54.220 --> 01:57:56.060]   One of the segment was very short.
[01:57:56.060 --> 01:57:59.340]   Well, next time ask for more time.
[01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:02.220]   Jeff, you have a number for us?
[01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:03.020]   Yes, I do.
[01:58:03.020 --> 01:58:04.220]   I already gave up one of them.
[01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:04.460]   Yes.
[01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:06.220]   We used one of the numbers.
[01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:06.380]   Yeah.
[01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:06.940]   So it's fine.
[01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:09.100]   I volunteered that.
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:10.860]   Oh, I guess we got to do this one.
[01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:16.140]   So Verizon's oath has done a breakdown of the brand of the brand.
[01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:23.820]   It's written down $4.6 billion, leaving a brand value of $200 million.
[01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:25.740]   Which you might use.
[01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:27.980]   They bought Huffington Post alone.
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:30.700]   AOL did for more than $300 million.
[01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:37.260]   They bought Yahoo and AOL for something akin to $4 billion.
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:39.260]   $4.5 billion, $4.5 billion.
[01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:39.980]   Yeah, I think.
[01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:40.380]   Right?
[01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:42.540]   AOL was $4.4 billion.
[01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:44.620]   So a total of $8.9 billion.
[01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:48.780]   So even then they were down to half of that
[01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:51.500]   and the brand value down to $4.8 billion.
[01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:53.820]   And they wrote off $4.6 billion of that.
[01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:58.300]   So basically, is that saying it was a flop?
[01:58:58.300 --> 01:58:59.900]   There's, well, hello.
[01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:02.700]   Hello.
[01:59:02.700 --> 01:59:03.020]   Wow.
[01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:04.540]   What were they thinking?
[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:06.860]   Yes.
[01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:10.220]   It was the last effort to do a volume-based content business
[01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:11.100]   as if that's going to win.
[01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:12.140]   And sorry.
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:16.060]   Now, it's a little confusing in terms of maybe you can explain this to me.
[01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:18.060]   Because what's the difference we've written down?
[01:59:18.060 --> 01:59:22.940]   The goodwill and the actual business, which are different.
[01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:24.860]   So they wrote down the goodwill.
[01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:26.540]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:29.820]   I imagine there's a tax benefit.
[01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:30.780]   Tax benefit would be my true.
[01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:30.940]   Yeah.
[01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:37.340]   They are also giving early buyouts to 10,000 employees.
[01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:38.220]   10,000?
[01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:40.460]   Yeah, they only have 40,000.
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:41.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:44.860]   That's a significant downsizing.
[01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:47.980]   Couldn't happen to a nicer company.
[01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:50.460]   Jeez.
[01:59:50.460 --> 01:59:53.180]   Although then they used to be 9X.
[01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:54.860]   They used to be your local phone company.
[01:59:54.860 --> 01:59:57.580]   Well, and then the phone company, of course,
[01:59:57.580 --> 01:59:59.260]   now AT&T, owns Time Warner.
[01:59:59.260 --> 01:59:59.580]   Right.
[01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:01.980]   So they're growing in the content business,
[02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:03.820]   but folks, let me tell you,
[02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:05.260]   contents are crappy business.
[02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:06.780]   So content.
[02:00:06.780 --> 02:00:08.620]   It's a Gutenberg era thing.
[02:00:08.620 --> 02:00:12.300]   Is this worse than the Time Warner AOL deal?
[02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:14.620]   No, this is only this is the second worst.
[02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:17.180]   No, I'm still suffering for that one.
[02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:17.740]   Oh, that's right.
[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:19.100]   You were a Mr. Time Warner.
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:22.700]   Oh, I finally just the last of my original stock is now something else.
[02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:25.980]   It must be fun to track your stock.
[02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:27.740]   You now want a bit of stripe publishing.
[02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:28.620]   Congratulations.
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:32.620]   What does it turn into today?
[02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:37.180]   David, do you have a pick or anything you want to share with the audience?
[02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:41.900]   You know, I was looking for something and I really,
[02:00:41.900 --> 02:00:43.900]   I wasn't able to come up with anything.
[02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:44.380]   Got nothing.
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:45.580]   Anything great.
[02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:48.380]   It's been a bit of a slow, slow news week for us.
[02:00:48.380 --> 02:00:50.300]   Come on, what's your favorite phone these days?
[02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:51.260]   What's your favorite Android?
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:52.060]   Oh, man.
[02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:54.940]   I mean, honestly, it's a tough pick.
[02:00:54.940 --> 02:00:57.740]   You like the one plus the T better than the Pixel?
[02:00:57.740 --> 02:00:59.740]   So that's a hard one.
[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:02.460]   I don't think I like it better, but I think it's a lot better bang for your buck.
[02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:08.540]   And if you do want a number, I mean, one plus is sales of the 60 are up 250% over the six.
[02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:11.740]   So they're saying big returns on that T mobile deal.
[02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:15.900]   And they just came out with a new version of the phone that's got 10 gigabytes of RAM that nobody needs.
[02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:17.900]   But it's a partnership with McLaren.
[02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:23.660]   And I think they're in a business where saturation is really starting to take its toll on a lot of the big players.
[02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:28.220]   One plus is up and coming in a way that is pretty interesting to watch,
[02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:33.100]   especially here in the US market, which is really prove kind of intractable
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:36.060]   in terms of unlocked phones picking up.
[02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:40.620]   So their deal with T mobile is definitely changing things up.
[02:01:40.620 --> 02:01:47.100]   I talked to the VP of device PR, Huawei America.
[02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:50.540]   And she said the reason that we didn't introduce the P20 in America,
[02:01:50.540 --> 02:01:54.620]   and now it's replacement with the mate, is because we didn't have a carrier deal.
[02:01:54.620 --> 02:01:57.260]   And she said, without a carrier deal, it's hopeless.
[02:01:57.260 --> 02:01:58.940]   You don't want to spend millions marking a phone.
[02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:02.140]   If you don't have a carrier deal, you're just not going to sell many devices.
[02:02:02.140 --> 02:02:05.100]   So they never were the one country where Huawei doesn't sell that phone.
[02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:09.340]   Well, and then they got kind of banned anyway.
[02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:10.620]   Why didn't Mac know?
[02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:11.660]   It didn't matter.
[02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:15.340]   And there's the reason they don't have a carrier deal is because the government stopped.
[02:02:15.340 --> 02:02:16.300]   That's exactly right.
[02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:20.700]   Because they announced Verizon and AT&T deals at CES a year ago.
[02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:25.580]   And they were going to they were going to and they had to cancel them and they were
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:28.940]   peeved. And that's when they said, well, we can't sell this phone in the US.
[02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:30.700]   So this is proving it true.
[02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:32.060]   One plus is experience shows.
[02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:33.180]   Yeah, it helps a lot.
[02:02:33.180 --> 02:02:33.740]   It helps a lot.
[02:02:33.740 --> 02:02:36.700]   250% to have a carrier deal.
[02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:41.900]   Well, I think we've had a very nice show.
[02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:48.620]   I guess the one thing I would share with you is that a duck, duck go is now just duck.
[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:52.140]   Duck, duck.
[02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:55.820]   And you know what? This shows Google has good will.
[02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:59.980]   Google when they bought On2, which is the video codec company,
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:03.820]   acquired in 2010 the duck.com domain name.
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:11.500]   Duck Duck, CEO Gabriel Weinberg said, yes, Google has given us the duck.com name.
[02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:12.540]   Oh, nice.
[02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:15.820]   You see, and you think these big companies are nasty.
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:18.700]   They're good neighbor.
[02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:24.060]   Gabriel said, we're pleased Google has chosen to transfer ownership of duck.com to duck.go.
[02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:26.700]   Having duck.com will make it easier for people to use duck.
[02:03:26.700 --> 02:03:31.980]   Duck go. So if you go to duck.com, spell that carefully.
[02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:33.420]   Don't let autocorrect.
[02:03:33.420 --> 02:03:36.460]   You will get duck.
[02:03:36.460 --> 02:03:40.140]   Duck go. Yeah, you would think Google would say under over our dead body,
[02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:43.020]   but I think really they're being that's appropriate.
[02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:47.500]   Yeah, I feel like Google just felt that domain wasn't all was quacked up to be.
[02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:51.100]   Oh, sorry, sorry.
[02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:57.500]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, as if fate in your whole life has brought you to that moment, David.
[02:03:57.500 --> 02:03:57.980]   Thank you.
[02:03:57.980 --> 02:03:58.700]   You've been story.
[02:03:58.700 --> 02:03:59.980]   It was a reason.
[02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:00.860]   It was David.
[02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:02.940]   This really it's I might have been waiting.
[02:04:02.940 --> 02:04:05.740]   David Ruddick blame him.
[02:04:05.740 --> 02:04:07.980]   He's a managing editor of Android police.
[02:04:07.980 --> 02:04:08.700]   Great to have you.
[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:09.820]   Thank you for being here this week.
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:11.260]   Thank you for having me.
[02:04:11.260 --> 02:04:11.820]   It was great.
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:13.580]   What is RDR V3?
[02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:14.300]   That's your Twitter.
[02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:15.900]   It's actually that's my initials.
[02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:20.380]   Yeah, Robert David Ruddick the third.
[02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:22.300]   Something like that.
[02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:22.940]   Oh, that's cool.
[02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:24.380]   That's nice.
[02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:30.060]   Randall Randall Richard Richard Rudolph get more 1950s.
[02:04:30.060 --> 02:04:32.940]   Roger not quite 1930s.
[02:04:32.940 --> 02:04:34.140]   Roger David Ruddick.
[02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:35.980]   I like RDR.
[02:04:35.980 --> 02:04:37.500]   That's good.
[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:37.980]   I get it.
[02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:41.660]   Yeah, it's it's Roy and considering I was born in the 1980s.
[02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:42.940]   I don't think anybody.
[02:04:42.940 --> 02:04:44.060]   Yeah, I don't think anybody would have.
[02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:44.940]   The third.
[02:04:44.940 --> 02:04:46.300]   And you're the third I take it, right?
[02:04:46.300 --> 02:04:47.260]   Your dad and grandpa.
[02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:48.060]   That's great.
[02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:48.540]   I am.
[02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:49.580]   That's nice.
[02:04:49.580 --> 02:04:51.340]   But you have a country music career ahead of you.
[02:04:51.340 --> 02:04:52.140]   So it's product.
[02:04:52.140 --> 02:04:55.260]   It's a perfect country music name.
[02:04:55.260 --> 02:04:55.900]   Yeah, it is.
[02:04:55.900 --> 02:04:56.780]   It's great.
[02:04:56.780 --> 02:04:57.260]   Really?
[02:04:57.260 --> 02:04:58.380]   Jeff Jarvis.
[02:04:58.380 --> 02:04:59.980]   I'm literally living everything.
[02:04:59.980 --> 02:05:02.140]   Well, Jeff Jarvis is almost a made up name.
[02:05:02.140 --> 02:05:04.780]   That alliteration alum makes it worth its weight in gold.
[02:05:04.780 --> 02:05:05.980]   JJ is.
[02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:07.420]   Yeah, that's why I literate.
[02:05:07.420 --> 02:05:09.820]   I have this propensity for alliteration.
[02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:11.260]   My book titles are alliterative.
[02:05:11.260 --> 02:05:12.300]   Oh, I'm alliterative.
[02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:12.620]   What was it?
[02:05:12.620 --> 02:05:13.980]   My kids are alliterative.
[02:05:13.980 --> 02:05:15.740]   Your kids are alliterative.
[02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:18.060]   Oh, well, at least they're not a legitimate.

[02:06:19.100 --> 02:06:21.260]   Easy enough to find that.
[02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:24.540]   Just search for this week in Google.
[02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:26.380]   Or you can even ask your voice assistant.
[02:06:26.380 --> 02:06:29.020]   Play this week in Google podcast.
[02:06:29.020 --> 02:06:31.100]   In most cases, it won't play the right thing.
[02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:33.980]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[02:06:33.980 --> 02:06:35.260]   Have a great week.
[02:06:35.260 --> 02:06:37.100]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:47.020]   Bye-bye.
