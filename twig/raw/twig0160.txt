[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900]   It's time for Twink this week in Google.
[00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:09.120]   We'll talk about Twitter's API changes, a new Android camera and laws that make it illegal
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.280]   to link in Germany.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.280]   It's all coming up next on Twink.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.200]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.480]   From people you trust.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.880]   This is Twink.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.160]   And with for this week in Google is provided by cash fly.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.400]   This is Twig.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.400]   This week in Google.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.360]   Episode 160 recorded August 22nd 2012.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.040]   The number one Twitter quitter.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.160]   This week in Google is brought to you by Ford.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.000]   Ford invites tech geeks to join the conversation, submit ideas and grab your tech geek badge
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.400]   at social.ford.com.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.280]   It's time for Twink this week in Google.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.440]   Do not let the name deceive you.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.960]   This show may or may not have anything to do with Google.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.760]   It really is all about what our hosts want to talk about, whatever they want to talk
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.760]   about.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.680]   From Chipotle to Glee to Habermas.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.880]   Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Gina Trapani of smarterware.org.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.880]   Hello.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.880]   Hello Gina.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.880]   How's it going?
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.880]   Good.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.120]   I'm excited about the show today.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   As always, I'm always excited.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.120]   I look forward to the show all week long.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.120]   That's down with a week.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.520]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.520]   Don't tell the other show host.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.520]   That's because they don't tell you.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.520]   You just said that.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.520]   But you say that to all the hosts.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.520]   I do.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.520]   I say it to all the hosts.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.160]   That's Jeff Jarvis there.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.680]   He is a I do everything to be on this show.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.640]   We're on vacation at the beautiful sky top lodge of the polka nose and I interrupt the
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.120]   vacation to be on the show because this show is a vacation.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.520]   Please apologize to Mrs. Jarvis and the Jarvis clan.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.520]   I am sorry.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.280]   Glad to get rid of me for an hour.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.360]   He's in the polka nose, baby.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.160]   Jeff is a no jokes.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.560]   Jeff is a professor of journalism.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.520]   I guess school doesn't start for a while.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.520]   Next week.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.520]   Next week.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.920]   At the City University of New York, he's also the author of Public Parts and what would
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.760]   Google do in other great books.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.440]   Oh, also Gutenberg the Geek, a 99 cent special from Amazon.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.440]   He blogs at Buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.400]   Gutenberg the Geek now available in India.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.520]   They just expanded Kindle Singles to India.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.280]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.280]   Is that automatic?
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.800]   All Kindle Singles now are available in India or did you have to?
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   If you have rights to, yes.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   I think it goes there.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   If it's yours, right.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.160]   That's the advantage of publishing it yourself.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.160]   It's so amazing.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.080]   The interlocking publishing rights and what a mess it is internationally.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.240]   You see it all the time on Audible where there's a book on, in fact, one of the books we've
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.640]   been recommending on Audible was Stephen King's Salem's Law, which they have for years all
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.640]   of a sudden.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.640]   It's not there.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.040]   It's just because the rights expired and nobody renewed it at some point.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.040]   I'm presuming.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.120]   It's just weird.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.680]   Rights are a bad idea.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.240]   All right, let's talk.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.400]   Let's talk Twitter.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.680]   Is it been, was it this?
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.880]   It feels like I've been talking about this API change for a long time.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.960]   It happened right after the last show.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.840]   And we had the discussion about App.net right after that is when all this stuff was.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.840]   Isn't that funny?
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.440]   Dalton's timing is pretty darn good with App.net.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.440]   It was Thursday last week.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.920]   Marco, I first became aware with Marco Arment's post.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.320]   He's the creator of Instapaper interpreting some of Twitter's API changes.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.920]   And this what I would say is arguably the gloomiest interpretation.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   Yes.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.720]   There are those, including the guy at TapBots, which is one of the top iOS Twitter clients
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.440]   who said, "Ah, no, it's fine.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.440]   I don't worry about it."
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.400]   But here's, this all comes from a post on the Twitter blog by Michael Sippy titled,
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.640]   "Changes are coming" in version 1.1 of the Twitter API.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.880]   It gets weird after that.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.280]   For instance, you can't detach photos in a Twitter stream and put them on another window.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.600]   No other third party or social actions could be attached to a tweet.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.960]   In effect, tweets have to be published exactly as Twitter specifies no matter where you're
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.200]   publishing them.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:33.120]   Tweets that are grouped together into a timeline may not be rendered with non-Twitter content
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.680]   comments, updates from other networks, or presumably circles, arrows, or...
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.280]   Whoa, but they said Spotify was fine.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.920]   But that's exactly what you can do in store if I as annotate.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.440]   How could they do it?
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.480]   It's not your content, Twitter.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.840]   Oh, that's really what the battle is, isn't it?
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.800]   Whose tweets are these anyway?
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.720]   Geez.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:04.040]   Flipboard's Mike McEw left Twitter's board, apparently recently, and Marco assumes because
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.080]   of these APIs, because it would, if I imagine it's going to affect Flipboard.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.760]   One of the, this is quoting from the post, "One of the key things we've learned over
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.360]   the past few years, this is from Twitter, Michael Sippy, is that when developers begin
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.400]   to demand an increasingly high volume of API calls, we can guide them towards area of
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.000]   value for users and their businesses."
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.520]   To that end, and similar to some other companies, we will require you to work with us directly.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.880]   If you believe your application will need more than one million individual user tokens.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.880]   And if one million sounds like a small number, you'll need our permission if your application
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.120]   will require more than 100,000 individual user tokens if you're using our user streams
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.600]   product, 100,000.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.120]   However, you could be grandfathered in.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.840]   That's why the tapbox guy is not upset.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.840]   He says, "Well, you get double what you've got now."
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.880]   And this is specific to traditional Twitter clients, not other kinds of Twitter products.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.880]   Like Flipboard.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.520]   Oh, it's just clients?
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.440]   Yeah, traditional Twitter clients.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:14.560]   The 100,000 user token permission kind of ceiling applies to clients that make large
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.160]   amounts of calls to certain endpoints that map to traditional clients.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.560]   Does that make sense?
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.040]   So only Twitter clients, like traditional Twitter clients, are going to get hit by this 100,000
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.040]   user token ceiling.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.240]   Well, that's significant because that means without Twitter's permission, you can't have
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.240]   more than 100,000 users.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:39.440]   Right, if you make a traditional Twitter client, but so something like Starify isn't a traditional
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.440]   Twitter client.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.440]   Wow.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.440]   It's a curation site.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.440]   But the Starify.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.440]   Go ahead.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.520]   Well, let me understand, though, but the earlier things that Leo listed about how you can't
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.840]   interspers other content, you must display the tweet is the full tweet.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.320]   You may not put any other social action upon it.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.320]   Is that not just for Twitter clients?
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.680]   That's for any user of the API.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.480]   That's for the Huffington Post or Starify.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.480]   Display requirements do apply to all apps.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.680]   But yeah, the user cap is targeted toward traditional Twitter clients.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.000]   I mean, Twitter's been telling us for 18 months that they are discouraging developers from
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.560]   making new traditional clients.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.000]   They're saying this area is saturated and we want you to build on Twitter, but we want
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.200]   you to make products that are not traditional Twitter clients because we've got those already.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.520]   That's basically what they've been saying for the past 18 months.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.400]   And these guidelines changes are just kind of like, and this is how we're going to provide
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.900]   that guidance.
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.880]   Paul had that of tap bots response.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.880]   Don't panic.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.720]   There's been a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt generated by Twitter's latest announcement.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.960]   I wanted everyone to know the world is an ending tweet bot for the Mac is still coming
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.960]   out.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.960]   They're in beta now.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.240]   Tweetbot for iOS isn't going anywhere.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.520]   He says the changes to the API won't affect tweetbot.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.520]   All current API calls are made using authentic.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.520]   That's the authentication requirement.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.320]   That's appropriate, by the way, right?
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.760]   Yeah, I mean, this is the thing.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.920]   As a developer, I build Twitter product.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.920]   I'm building it.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.640]   It uses the Twitter API as part of its primary function along with lots of other APIs, Facebook
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.720]   and Bitly and Google+ etc.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.440]   And I read these changes.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.600]   They're about five major bullet points.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.600]   Three of them are great.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   Awesome.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.520]   Per endpoint rate limiting awesome, verifying pre-installed clients.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.520]   Awesome.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   OAuth across the board.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.520]   Awesome.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.600]   There's one that's like, meh, because it really depends on how they enforce it.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.040]   That's the display requirements.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.200]   And then there's one that's pretty yucky for traditional client developers, which is
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.600]   that user token ceiling.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:53.080]   But I have to tell you, as a developer, I was really frustrated with what I thought
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:58.920]   was wildly sensationalized and oversimplified headline, which is that Twitter hates developers,
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.000]   Twitter's turning its back on the people who made it what it is, and they've turned evil.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.800]   I thought that was a really-- I just thought that was a mischaracterization of what's
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   going on.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.560]   I definitely think that there are troubling parts to this announcement, but the majority
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.360]   of it is actually really great for developers.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.720]   And I felt like there was just a lot of misunderstanding there.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:22.280]   And I thought, you know, Marco has a section in his post about how there's a lot of subjectivity
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:28.800]   and uncertainty here, because Twitter very-- specifically, very purposefully made a lot
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.240]   of these guidelines broad and open to interpretation.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.120]   So we really have to see how they're going to interpret it.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.920]   Do we really think that Twitter is going to ban any app that has an email, this tweet
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.920]   link on it?
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.040]   You know, like just through, say, Android share menu?
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.680]   I don't think they will.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.720]   If they do, that's awful.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.320]   And I think we have a right to go crazy.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.080]   But I think for the most part, these aren't.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.240]   No, I read these and I thought, like, not that bad.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.360]   You know, and I'm building a company on a tour API.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.440]   So you could say that it's in my best interest to be on their good side.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.440]   And I guess--
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.440]   No, but you would never do that.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.000]   If you were pissed off, you would say so.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   I absolutely would.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   That's absolutely true.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I absolutely would.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   No, Gina is not Mili Mouthed.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.760]   She's many things, but Mili Mouthed, no.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.440]   But I mean, you know, we've had this conversation before, and Jeff and I disagree.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.720]   Like, you know, I haven't been outraged about anything that Twitter's done.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.040]   I'm concerned, and there are bits of these guidelines that trouble me because they could
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.080]   be enforced in really bad and onerous ways.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.840]   But Twitter hasn't done that yet.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:35.120]   You agree with your colleague who suggests that you should interpret these changes like
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.000]   you would, say, an App Store, Apple's App Store.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   It's just--
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.240]   Well, this was the irony of Marco's post.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.000]   Like, Marco's a guy who has built an entire business on the iOS platform.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.200]   You know, he's subject to Apple's whims.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.720]   How is this any different?
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.760]   I really, how is this different?
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.760]   I mean, I think what's interesting about Twitter is that because they built such an
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:01.120]   incredibly easy API and developers took to it so well and how they're so good to developers,
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.640]   their bootstrap and the patent agreement and the MySQL open source, that they were really
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.480]   good to developers, and now they're turning bad.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.960]   So I feel like, you know, they're turning bad, quote unquote.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.480]   So I think there's a sense of betrayal, you know, like, they used to be good to us and
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.480]   now they're not.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.760]   You know, Apple was always sort of jerks, right?
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.640]   But you don't get as outraged about them or, you know, Google+ which hasn't even provided
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.720]   an API yet or Facebook, you know.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.680]   Some of their terms of use in their API are insane.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.640]   So it's just interesting to me to watch the reaction and I think, you know, Twitter really
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.480]   has to prove-- I mean, Twitter's communications about this were not needed to do that.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.480]   That's the key.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.480]   That's the key.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.480]   I was going to ask you that, Chana.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.320]   So would you agree that the communications just leave a lot to be desired?
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.800]   Yeah, they really did.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.520]   I mean, you know, I know Sippy and, you know, he's a really good writer and it surprised
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.480]   me that it came across so kind of-- kind of the tone was slightly doomsday from their
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   point of view.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.320]   Like, "Oh, we're about to lower the hammer.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.640]   You're not going to like this."
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.640]   I mean, it kind of came across that way.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.000]   So, you know, I love that, Anil, you know, my co-founder wrote, you know, rewrote the
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.440]   announcement and kind of with a positive spin.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.240]   I was like, "Oh, we could-- you know, we could rewrite this announcement this way."
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.840]   And I thought that was an interesting sort of intellectual exercise.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.160]   But yeah, I agree that communications was not-- could have been a lot better.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.200]   And I think that there were just parts of that announcement that were very dealt developer
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   specific.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.480]   I think there are a lot of people saying Twitter's turning their backs on developers who don't
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.240]   really understand what per endpoint rate limiting really is and why it really is superior to
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.200]   what they offer now.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.200]   So yeah.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.040]   When they say per endpoint, they don't mean per app.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.600]   They mean per user.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.600]   They mean per API endpoint.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.600]   So the Twitter API provides a set of endpoints.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.640]   So an endpoint would be like a kind of question you'd ask your an API.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.240]   So an endpoint might be the home timeline.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.600]   Or the endpoint might be your direct messages or your profile.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.920]   These are all different like questions that you can ask the API.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:00.400]   So right now you get 350 calls per hour across all endpoints per user.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.160]   This change you get 60 calls per endpoint per hour.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.120]   So if you use more than six endpoints, right, because 6960 is 360 and 360 is greater than
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.120]   350.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.400]   I know I'm doing this quickly.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:16.480]   So basically what Twitter is doing is they're saying you get more API calls per hour across
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.880]   a lot of endpoints with this change, which puts the squeeze on traditional client apps,
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:28.920]   traditional Twitter clients, which are constantly querying the home timeline endpoint, right?
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.920]   Primarily.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.480]   They're using one endpoint over and over.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:38.960]   They're using one endpoint a lot over and over exactly versus products that use lots of
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.520]   different endpoints that do something interesting with favorites or do something interesting
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.720]   with, you know, pictures.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.120]   Which think up does?
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.120]   Think up does do that.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.200]   So I mean, I mean, good for you, bad for tweetbot.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.200]   Well, right, right.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.560]   I mean, just on top of my head, think of users over nine endpoints, right?
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.520]   So that's already that ups our API call allocation in three, 15 hour to five, four
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.520]   day and hour.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.520]   So that's like, that's great news.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.120]   That's great news for us.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.000]   And sweetpot doesn't seem too concerned about it.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.680]   Honestly, even if you're a traditional Twitter client and you're being conservative, you're
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.000]   being smart and conservative about your API call, 60 per hour, per endpoint is totally
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   reasonable.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.280]   Because so tweetbot could make one call and then feed all of its clients with that one
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.280]   call.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.280]   So they're saying every second or every minute you make.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.760]   It's per user per endpoint, right?
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.760]   So like a few user.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.360]   Yeah, it's per user per endpoint.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.360]   So you authenticated, you have tokens and your timeline is different than is that, you
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.280]   know, if you hit the timeline endpoint, that the response is going to be the payload
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.840]   is going to be different than if I hit it, right?
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.080]   Because my timeline looks different than yours.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.480]   So it's per user per endpoint, right?
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.480]   60 per hour.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.960]   So in a Neil's blog, he said, our biggest Twitter API upgrade ever more API calls for
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:55.800]   almost every kind of app, better security by extending OAuth to all APIs, a clear roadmap
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:01.080]   for Twitter app developers to know what's encouraged a few new restrictions for people
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.560]   making traditional Twitter clients.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.920]   And when official 1.1 is released, you'll have six months to migrate.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.920]   Some have posited as like Dan Fromer and read right web.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.280]   This is this is Twitter saying we want to survive.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.160]   They have to do this.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.680]   Does that seem reasonable, Gina?
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.440]   It's not a not a land, not a money grab.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.720]   They need to they need to monetize.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.720]   I don't know.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.560]   But that's not that seems to be right.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.920]   I mean, it seems to be why they're doing this is where this is one area where I think their
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.520]   communications could have been different.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.120]   I mean, you want to assume that they have they want to restrict the display of tweets
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.000]   because they want to be able to insert advertising or insert links back to Twitter wherever they
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.320]   can, right?
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:48.720]   Because they need the eyeballs and they have to keep they want to keep Twitter users using
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.320]   their tools for the primary use of Twitter, which is your timeline, your replies, direct
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.320]   messages.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.720]   So yeah, this seems like this is about their business model.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.640]   I don't think that I agree that this isn't a money grab.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.720]   I think this is Twitter figuring out that it needs it needs a business model and figuring
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.960]   out how it's going to do that.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.240]   And they're taking the long if the long view and saying we're going to start this now.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.760]   If they did anything wrong, it's that they didn't think of this ahead of time.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.760]   Right.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.760]   Right.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.760]   Look, they've been giving us this guy.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:22.200]   18 months they've been saying, hey, like we got we got the client area covered, you know,
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   make other things.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   Stop doing that.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   Right.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.200]   Fairness.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.680]   Google said the founders of Google said we don't like advertising.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.680]   We don't want advertising.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.680]   Right.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.120]   You know, and I said that when I started this network boy, that was a mistake.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.120]   Right.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.120]   So, so I'll give them all that.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.400]   I think what probably disturbs people is two things.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.920]   One is, yeah, the cultural attitude of it.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:46.480]   People do feel as if they really contributed to Twitter's success by creating conventions
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.040]   by distributing Twitter, by helping make it popular.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.280]   And so the attitude was not, let me be fully open here and explain what we need to do
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.480]   and why we need to do it.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.840]   And yes, we're grateful what you did.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.560]   But this is the reality of what we have to deal with.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.560]   People would deal with that, I think.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.560]   They should probably accept that way.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.560]   It's a little bit pictorial.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.760]   The second part of this, I think, and this is from my ignorant, non-developing view.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:12.280]   I'm grappling with this in a lot of contexts, is what's the responsibility of a platform
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.960]   and what's the real thus the reliability and trust you can have in a platform to build
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.120]   your future on it.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.800]   I'm reminded of, and I think I've told this story before, but when I took day life, originally
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.800]   to Fred Wilson, he said to the founder, you pen a chart and none, can I build a profit
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.920]   affordable company on your platform?
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.080]   And let me tell you before you answer that the right answer is yes.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.080]   Really?
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:39.760]   And when I complained about some features that were not existing in Twitter, Fred responded
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.400]   publicly, well, that's what the clients are supposed to make, the outside developers
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.480]   are supposed to make.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.720]   So there's a compact there.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:52.560]   There's a relationship there, a covenant that can change and perhaps has to change.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.560]   I'm not denying that at all.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.480]   So I just think it does come down to communication to say, okay, folks, we've tried a lot of
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.480]   things.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.280]   Here's where we are and here's the reality of that.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.720]   And we want to bring you along, but you got to play by these rules to come along.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.440]   And then I think it'll be a little bit different.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:11.480]   And Neil has a real good point then is, but it's not just about gloss over what exists.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:16.920]   It's also about being transparent about the rationale, what's going on A and B about trying
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.240]   to maintain ongoing trust.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.840]   Because what Mark Hosepost says at the end, I believe it was his post said, I ain't building
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.840]   on Twitter.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.640]   Well, that's the issue at the end.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.320]   Is if there's no trust there, then are they really willing to go alone?
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.360]   And the irony of this is then Twitter does become a media company.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.120]   It becomes a very old fashioned media company.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.640]   Well just as I'm telling media companies to make themselves embeddable and spread their
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.360]   stuff out on the web, Twitter's saying, no, no, no, you all have to come to our website.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.960]   We want our page views.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.440]   That's so 2005.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.440]   Right.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:53.200]   I mean, if developers interpret this announcement as a giant FU, which many have, obviously
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.360]   Marco did and said that he might not, you know, he might just rip all the Twitter related
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.920]   features out of InstaPaper because he can't bear to develop against Twitter's ever changing
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.280]   rules anymore, which again, I thought his reaction was extreme.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:11.200]   You know, if he interpreted that way, the risk is that you're not going to have a Twitter
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.440]   developer come along and say, you know what I want to do?
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:18.360]   I want to build a business making a really awesome Twitter client that does all the things
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.120]   that none of the official clients do.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.120]   Right.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.680]   I mean, that's how Tweety happened.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.280]   All of which got acquired by Twitter.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.280]   Right.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.760]   So that's how that innovation happened in the beginning.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.840]   That innovation is not going to happen now because a developer in it, no developer in
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.400]   a right mind is going to build, I'm going to try to build a product, a company and a
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:40.680]   product with a cap of a hundred thousand user tokens, at which point you have to kind
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.080]   of apply for permission from Twitter to continue.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.080]   Exactly.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.880]   How are the ones and stock tweets and Twitter took over the convention?
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.680]   I would include Bitly on this.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.880]   The funny thing is, the various people who still work with Twitter in some way or another,
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.440]   I sense are being so cautious.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.840]   But you know, I'm cautious in becoming hyper critical of Twitter here because I've made
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.560]   mistakes before when it comes to Twitter.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.160]   I didn't understand some of the good work they were doing internationally when they came
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.440]   out with rules and I thought, well, that's a bad rule.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.160]   But in fact, you know, the idea that they would censor something in one country, but
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.280]   leave it in other countries and make it transparent, I didn't get by that that what they were
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.000]   doing was exposing censorship.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.320]   You know, it was a good thing.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.440]   So but I'm also a little gunshot with Twitter now after the Olympics and what they did with
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.080]   Guy Adams account.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:35.360]   That was a cultural problem of not understanding their responsibility as a platform.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.360]   And when I argue that media companies now to become platforms, that's why I'm grappling
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.360]   with this.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.080]   What does it mean to be a platform?
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.600]   Sun Jake says, you know, you build your business on somebody else's platform, you get what
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.720]   you deserve when they pull out the rug.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.280]   I, you know, I kind of agree.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.280]   It's funny.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.240]   I was saying on Twitter that we have to wait to see how Twitter actually enforces a lot
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.200]   of this stuff before we can truly criticize and Mache from Pinboard and Jason cocky, the
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.200]   stellar.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.440]   They both said to me like, what do you mean?
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.560]   You're not supposed to protest a law until someone gets, you know, arrested for it.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.840]   And I was like, but Twitter isn't a democracy.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.000]   We're not voting about whether or not this is okay.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.080]   I mean, but with Twitter is nothing.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.640]   The first rule I wrote a post about about about kind of trying to explore these notions
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:21.280]   of a platform and simply put without users, a platform is nothing.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.320]   Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.400]   So it's may not be a democracy, but it is a collaboration.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:31.160]   And if it was not collaborative two ways, then then it doesn't work as a platform because
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.200]   there's not two way trust.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   Right.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.200]   Absolutely.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.200]   Absolutely.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.200]   That's true.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:41.280]   You know, that my point was like, if I I'm going to be outraged if Twitter indeed bans
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:47.160]   an app for having an email, this tweet link in it, you know, that no social actions bit,
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.560]   which could be interpreted very broadly.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.880]   Like, I'll just I'll feel more outraged and I'll feel like they're truly evil if they
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.920]   you know, really don't want us to email tweets, you know, for example, or or share a link
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.280]   to insta paper from a tweet, which is what Marco brought up in his post.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.440]   And so, but you know, but people were saying that I that we should protest, you know, these
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.200]   changes now before we actually start to see enforcement.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.960]   I mean, I'm going to learn a lot about enforcement because I'm building a Twitter product.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.560]   So I'll let you know if we get if we get pulled over for something, but but I think you're
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.960]   going to build it.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:20.680]   But Jean, isn't it weird that you're saying you're you're you're saying that you you are
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.880]   not going to build it to the letter of the law because we're assuming they don't mean
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.880]   the law.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.880]   No, I know.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.160]   I mean, I'm going to comply.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.880]   I'm going to comply with the display requirements.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.400]   I'm going to comply with the with the changes.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.720]   What Twitter's asking me to do, whatever terms I've accepted when I said I want to use this
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.840]   API, I'm going to comply with.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.320]   But like, for example, the Android example, I think is a good one.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.800]   Androde, you have a sort of a built in share menu, right?
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.360]   You can tap something and say, share this to email, share this to messaging.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.880]   That's a social action.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.560]   If you if you interpret that very broadly, you know, is Twitter really going to am I
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.800]   going to take that?
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:59.440]   For example, menu might disable that menu on tweets because if you interpret this guideline
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.840]   very, very strictly, you know, Twitter might ban the app.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.840]   No, of course not.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   I'm going to leave it in there.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:09.640]   If Twitter calls me out on it, then I'm going to pound my fist and say that they've gone
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.640]   evil.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.160]   You know, I'm going to go back to your point about democracy.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.480]   I it's not a democracy.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.080]   You're absolutely right.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:22.760]   But Twitter has to acknowledge publicly that it depends upon you developers.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.160]   And I think that they did at the beginning.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:30.040]   I was at a conference where Biz Stone was asked along with Chad Hurley and Reid Hoffman
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.720]   from my Wall Street guy.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.080]   Well, you know, what big company do you want to deal with?
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.640]   It looked like they were confused German shepherds with their their head's cocks.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.640]   Why we would do that?
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.120]   No, our users and our developers distribute us.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.440]   We rely on our ecosystem.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.040]   It's a member of an ecosystem.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   And let me just do this real fast.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.080]   But what I wrote the post, I tried to come up with some rules for platforms, right?
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.360]   The first I think is that users come first.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.880]   If you don't believe in that, then you're creating a walled garden.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.120]   You're creating a service.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.120]   Hey, user or loser.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.120]   We don't care.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.120]   It's like a telephone company.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.480]   Second, a platform is defined by its users.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.480]   It's truly a platform.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.720]   You don't necessarily know how everyone will use it.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.920]   Only through its use do you learn what it is.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.720]   The platforms collaborate.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.880]   If you don't collaborate, it's a dead thing.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.880]   A platform changes.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.200]   And the platforms need principles that a platform I think should be transparent.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.560]   It should enable portability.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.720]   These are principles.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.640]   And that it has to be reliable.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.960]   If you can't rely on it, if you cannot trust it to be what you think it is going to be,
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:32.880]   if you can't rely on to at least be transparent about its changes, then is it really a platform?
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.760]   Now is Twitter a platform that?
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.160]   Or is it becoming AOL?
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.760]   People always say, oh, Facebook is the next walled garden the next AOL.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.400]   Is Twitter trying to become the next AOL?
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:51.280]   Can you be a platform for people but not a platform for developers?
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.640]   I don't know because I think people are developers.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.320]   Even if you don't write code, right?
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.440]   The people who put in hashtag or @sign in Twitter.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.440]   That's true.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.120]   This is enfranchised.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.520]   People would use it.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:12.600]   So in other words, people are, I would say, I would submit that these API changes affect
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.760]   developers.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.920]   And so Twitter might be saying, we don't want to be a platform for developers.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.400]   We want to be a platform for people.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.400]   For users.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.400]   For people.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   For Justin Bieber fans.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.040]   And it's less about power users and developers and more about regular people.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.040]   It's not unreasonable.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.040]   Is it?
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.040]   Right.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.440]   In fact, a lot of these changes empower regular users.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:40.520]   So getting your app certified, apps that come pre-installed devices must be certified.
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:46.880]   The display requirements are going to, those things are going to reduce confusion and make
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:52.680]   a consistent experience, which is what Sippy's last blog post headline was creating a consistent
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.880]   user experience for regular people.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.960]   I mean, I think this is just the tech community reckoning with the fact that Twitter isn't
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.400]   an, isn't for the elites anymore.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.800]   We got to have.net pay a hundred bucks and join app.net.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.040]   If you want to learn more, it's been called.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.040]   Right.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.040]   I think that's the part of it.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.040]   I have $50.com.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.040]   It was the top of the world.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.040]   It was the mockery.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.040]   It was so funny.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.040]   I mean, seriously, if the tech community wants, there's plenty of places the tech community
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:25.480]   can go. Twitter is pretty much saying we want to be for real people.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.800]   We want a business model.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:33.800]   And I don't think real people know or care about API's, 50 bucks, stewardship platforms
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.800]   or anything else.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.280]   If you think regular people are seeking out non Twitter clients, I mean, regular people
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.280]   are typing Twitter into the app store search box, right?
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.280]   They're not typing in.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.360]   No, they don't even have to because it comes with the iPhone.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.360]   All right.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.400]   So they don't then that's what Twitter wants, by the way, right?
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.400]   Yes.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.400]   Twitter does.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.040]   But yeah, but Twitter build itself on the back of those.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.360]   That was a mistake.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.240]   And that was my question is should Twitter.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.240]   Is it a mistake though?
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.960]   Thought of this earlier?
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.040]   Could Twitter be what Twitter is without those developers?
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.600]   I would argue absolutely not.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.600]   No, I agree.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.120]   Twitter without the @sign would be useless.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.120]   Twitter without the hashtag would not allow people to organize revolutions.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.040]   And all of that came from third parties, not from Twitter.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.040]   Absolutely.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.040]   Twitter is not smart.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.360]   Twitter is smart, but it's not smart enough to build Twitter.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:23.040]   But putting myself in Twitter's shoes, I would say, well, that's true.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.240]   But now we need to survive.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:30.040]   We need to monetize and we need to be a less confusing, more consistent platform for the
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.840]   real people who are using us.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.360]   That was then this is now.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.880]   Don't develop on it.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.880]   Right.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.880]   And don't develop on it.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.880]   We'll take it from here.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:49.160]   Is it immoral or dishonorable to have built a company on developers back at five years later
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.240]   to say, hey, that's nice.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.240]   Thanks.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.640]   We've got enough clients.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.800]   They're not saying to tap bots, don't make tweet bot anymore.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.760]   They're just saying no more new ones.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.760]   Although they might do--
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.720]   They're saying you can make it, but at 100,000 user tokens, you're going to have to talk
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.720]   to us if you want to go beyond that.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.960]   I think-- I know.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:17.680]   I'm not defending Twitter by any means, but I think I understand what they're saying.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.000]   Now, what my question is, is it wrong?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Is it bad?
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   It's hubris--
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   It's hubristic.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   It's hubristic.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.680]   It's thinking that they can go it alone now.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:31.240]   And it's like weasily in that it rejects a community that made them what they are.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   Weasily.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.720]   They're saying we got this, right?
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.960]   So the reason why Twitter was built on the backs of developers, really, it was users
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:42.840]   making up new conventions like @replies and retweets, and independent developers being
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.600]   faster than Twitter proper to make clients to support those things, because Twitter proper
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:53.120]   was so small and unproven and was just dealing with stopping the fail-whale every day, right?
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.240]   But now Twitter's got the infrastructure and the team and the clients, and they're basically
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:02.760]   saying we got this, any new traditional client features we can handle.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.320]   We're building cards.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.280]   We're innovating internally.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.560]   So we got this.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.760]   You guys do the other stuff.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.120]   So it is a little bit of hubris.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.160]   Here's the analog.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:21.600]   OS X is built on an open source kernel, mock kernel, and BSD.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.240]   So they built up-- now they never made it.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.680]   Apple never made a promise to that community, and they made a little bit of a promise.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.040]   We'll give back Darwin, blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.200]   But they're built on IMDB, CDDB.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:38.840]   There are many, many-- CDDB is actually the most accurate analog, which was a database
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:46.080]   of CD information that was created by users, which went basically private.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.840]   And they said, OK, we got it from here.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.520]   It happens a lot, actually.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.160]   So isn't it moral?
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.760]   Is it unethical for a community to grow and change?
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.640]   Especially if you accept the premise that they couldn't survive.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.240]   I think that's the crux of it.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.840]   Do they have to do this?
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.600]   Is it greed or was it necessity?
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.640]   We don't know, because they really haven't told us.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.120]   And Dan from her says it was necessity.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:18.360]   What's the downside of-- so I guess the downside is we must put ads and tweets, and if those
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.360]   ads don't appear.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.360]   Right.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:26.040]   Yeah, I mean, I wrote another post this last week trying to rethink copyright.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.760]   Not that this is hardly the first one doing that.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.320]   There's millions of people trying to rethink it.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:34.800]   But it occurs to me that there's a notion of what I call credit, the right to credit,
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.600]   the right to move things on.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.800]   And that creates new models.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.880]   And so I saw a company I met at a mission last week called Reposts.us.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.160]   Did I mention them?
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.160]   That enables an article to become embeddable.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.320]   So I wanted to build this, because no one would build it, but luckily it along came a
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.320]   company that did it.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:55.200]   And it's really very cool that an article could travel and be embedded like a YouTube
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.280]   video with brand advertising, your own advertising, the creators advertising, the creators analytics,
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.640]   and the creators' links associated with it.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.320]   So rather than trying to get everybody to come to your site, which is the old media
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.160]   model, now you can go to where the readers are.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:13.840]   And what that has embedded in it is the business model that says, yeah, you need advertising
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.680]   and analytics to travel with your content.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.680]   If it's going to travel anyway, let's take advantage of that and leap on top of it.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:25.600]   So I argue that, yes, the creator has some rights to create those rules by which this
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.600]   can happen.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:32.280]   They're right to say we think these buttons have to travel with the stuff that we've created.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.280]   Okay.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:39.640]   The only thing that he has, but there is not one shred of content on Twitter was made by
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.640]   Twitter.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:44.320]   It was made by its users.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.480]   And so we asked you, is it a democracy or not?
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.480]   No, it's not.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.680]   But it should act a little bit more like one with an acknowledgement that if we left tomorrow,
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.440]   this is why Google says don't be evil, not because they're virtuous, but because being
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.560]   evil is really bad business now.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.560]   Is this evil?
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:04.440]   No, I think it wheezly is as high as I'll go.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.440]   Okay.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:10.080]   Evil, evil would be saying to Justin Bieber, hey, we can't afford you because we have to
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.000]   do it five extra servers just for your content.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.520]   So could you rate limit your tweets or evil might be saying you can only have 1.5 million
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.520]   followers.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.840]   Or we'll charge you from, well, I don't know if that's evil actually.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.840]   That might make more sense.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.840]   Maybe that's what's next.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:27.840]   I don't know.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.840]   Well, I guess that's what happened.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.840]   I would argue.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:35.240]   Crapy is saying you can only retrieve 3,200 of your, your, your own tweets from the service.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.000]   But has that slowed down growth of Twitter?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.800]   And that's been this case all along since almost the beginning.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.400]   Has that slowed down the growth of Twitter at all?
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:46.200]   No, if a platform doesn't adhere to certain principles, it does not necessarily slow
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.200]   down growth, right?
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.440]   If you make a great product, which Twitter has, you get huge adoption, which they have,
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.440]   you know.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.440]   You have Twitter.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.200]   Twitter's looking at the number of people they have on Twitter and they're saying we're
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.000]   doing everything right.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.760]   Now we just need to figure out a way to make money.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.040]   On the question of how tweets are displayed, you know, it's interesting, Jeff, like you're
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.400]   saying, this is our content.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.760]   So Twitter shouldn't dictate the way that tweets are displayed.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:16.120]   But if apps, I mean, who should decide how tweets are displayed at makers?
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.120]   Right.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.120]   I mean, because...
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.120]   Exactly the right question, Gina.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.120]   I don't know.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.680]   All I'm saying is that yes, Twitter does have a right to say this, but it's not an
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.480]   exclusive right.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.760]   It's not a right that goes beyond the interests of its users.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.680]   And so if there are apps that come down the pipe that I as a user would like to exist,
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:38.760]   we users would like to exist, but they now can't because Twitter exclusively said, no,
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.840]   you can't do that for reasons that they have.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:47.240]   That's weasily behavior to its users seed rule number one, a platform is its users.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.800]   And the end of the day, a platform without users is not a platform.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   Right.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:52.800]   Right.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.800]   It's a platform for users now.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   Thank you app developers.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.000]   It's not a platform for you.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.120]   The user for the, but what does Twitter become?
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.040]   Twitter became what Twitter became because developers.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.040]   Yeah, but it's done.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.040]   And it's done.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.040]   And it's done.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.240]   And that's the real question, Leo.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.240]   Is it done?
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.160]   Is Twitter, is Twitter baked now?
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.160]   It's baked.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.440]   Yes, it's baked.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.440]   You see it's hash.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.240]   It's Twitter hashtags on every television show.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.880]   It's done.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.360]   It's done.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.360]   Thank you.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.360]   We'll take it from here.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   I admit, you know, it's, I'm believing you danced with the one that brung you, but I can
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.840]   understand why they might say, you know, we've got investors, the ones that brung them are
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:34.720]   the people that put $150 million into Twitter's infrastructure.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.720]   That's what made Yahoo.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.440]   Yahoo thought it was baked.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.440]   Google never been.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.440]   Ah, interesting.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:45.120]   I'll tell you the couple of apps that I'm really concerned about given these guidelines.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.120]   Time hop.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.120]   You guys have used time hop?
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.120]   I think we've talked about it.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.120]   Ase time hop.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.120]   I love it.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.680]   Yeah, so they email you a year ago tweets.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.880]   They're not going to be able to do it.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.320]   Yeah, I mean, well, they just, they, even if they comply with the display requirements,
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.160]   they just add a new feature where you can comment on and ask somebody like, so if I get
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.040]   your year ago tweet, I can ask for an explanation.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.400]   I can be like, hey, Twitter, like, what did this mean?
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.160]   But that's, that's a comment on another service.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.240]   You know, a third party service.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.240]   So I'm worried about that one.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:17.320]   And I'm worried about stellar, stellar that I owe, which Jason cocky makes, which is kind
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:21.280]   of like a list of all your favorite, all your friends favorite tweets.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.280]   It's awesome.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.280]   There's always great content there and it's favorites across several networks, Flickr,
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.040]   YouTube, et cetera.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:31.000]   But Jason, Jason's a designer and he put a lot of thought and work into making tweets,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.260]   you know, to making the reading experience really nice and being really minimal about
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.440]   what meta information it showed, you know, he shows in every tweet.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.640]   And for him to comply with the display requirements, it's going to add all the little, the Twitter
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:46.640]   glitter, you know, the retweet button, the reply button, the favorite button, the avatar
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.640]   and all that.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.840]   So, so I'm concerned.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.920]   I want to be clear with everyone that I am concerned about these changes and I think it's
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:56.560]   going to, you know, affect some apps that are even not traditional Twitter clients badly.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.560]   And I'm really hoping that Twitter is going to take that Facebook approach of like break
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:03.560]   things and then kind of, you know, break things fast and then, and then fix them later.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:08.680]   I'm hoping that Twitter is going to iterate on these changes and maybe clarify some of
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:13.760]   the guidelines or requirements and maybe be a little, a little more lenient than the worst
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.760]   interpretation.
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:15.760]   And that's just a hope.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.520]   And we're going to see this, this, these changes roll out in the next few weeks, the
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.520]   coming weeks.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.840]   You know, I, I, I, I made a mistake before, we were emphasized this again, I made a mistake
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.400]   before thinking that Twitter took a wrong turn when it took right turns.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.040]   And I'm not saying that these are absolutely wrong terms.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.360]   I may not understand.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:35.280]   So, so the problem here may be a problem of communication and transparency, or it may
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.200]   be a problem of culture and substance.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.840]   I don't know yet, but I, but I want to know.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.600]   Yeah, I do too.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:46.800]   I'm just sad because, besides using think up to archive my tweets, I've been using a
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:52.960]   WordPress plugin for years that automatically archives my tweets and I put up, there's a
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.160]   blog post every week.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.800]   I don't think anybody ever reads it because there's never any comments on it.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:01.840]   But on my blog, there's a post every Sunday night of my Twitter updates for the week.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:06.440]   And it's, it's as much for me to be able to look back at that week, you know, 10 years
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.000]   from now because Twitter's not going to let me do that.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   So these are all archived.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.560]   I mean, I don't think Twitter's going to notice this plugin, but if they do, this is clearly
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.560]   a violation of their, right?
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.040]   Because it's, yeah, that definitely those don't don't comply.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.040]   There's no reply.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.040]   There's no tweet.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.800]   I mean, this is a pure case of this being your content.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.400]   It's my content being archived from Twitter.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.400]   Absolutely.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.400]   Absolutely.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:32.120]   You should be able to display your tweets on your blog, however you want.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.120]   Any way you want.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.720]   Yeah, I wrote it.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:41.320]   So I guess if there were a lot of people like me who really thought that was important,
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.480]   that could hurt Twitter.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.760]   But I suspect that that's not, that that's not the case.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:51.120]   It's just that goes into reading Twitter's TOS because are you granting Twitter in not
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.520]   as close of license of that content?
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.960]   In which case you were just exercising your own use of your content.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.320]   Well, and this is what I've always said is that for years, that's why I keep quitting
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.320]   Twitter.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:05.920]   I am number one Twitter, as I have been for years.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.240]   In fact, we were going over on app.net.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:14.520]   All of the places that I have left Twitter for starting with Jai Koo, remember that?
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:19.760]   And counts and plurk and buzz.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.880]   And I can go on and on.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:26.680]   And I keep, because I want somewhere that will treat my and status net or identical, I want
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.080]   somewhere that will tweet my content as my content.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:34.040]   So one of the simple pandas says, don't forget spallink.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.040]   Is that actually?
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.440]   I don't think there's a splink.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:37.560]   There could be.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.080]   I don't know.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.080]   I like Jai Koo.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:45.400]   You know, I really, really Google bought them, put them out of their misery.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.280]   I guess you can open source the code though.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.280]   The code's open source.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.480]   You could make your own Jai Koo server.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.760]   Because it had threaded.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.280]   It was everything Twitter wasn't.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.280]   But it didn't make it.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.880]   And that's really the bottom line.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:02.080]   Now, was it the developers that were, I guess it was, it was developer ecosystem that made
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.000]   Twitter Twitter.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.280]   Why didn't Pounce succeed?
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:09.600]   Pounce was great.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.120]   Why didn't Jai Koo succeed?
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.400]   Was it because they came after Twitter?
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.600]   Maybe the network effect, right?
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.880]   Google massive, when you hit critical mass, then the rules change.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:26.360]   Twitter, something changed on Twitter when Ashton Kutcher and Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber,
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.080]   when the celebrities discovered it, that was the, that was when they turned the corner,
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.080]   right?
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.080]   Britney Spears.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.680]   Yeah, I mean, that was, that was the big part of it, I think.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.200]   And that to me was the first reason to get the hell out of there.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:42.000]   As soon as Ashton Kutcher was there, it's like, I don't want to be here.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.120]   Unfortunately, that's where everybody is.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.680]   I don't know, it's fascinating.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:50.160]   And I like app.net.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.000]   I don't think app.net's going to make a difference now.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.120]   Yeah, but I really like where Jeff is getting, where Jeff is, what Jeff is poking at right
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.440]   now, which is like, what makes a platform a platform?
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.680]   What should the principles of a platform be?
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:09.000]   You know, what, what things out there really are platforms or what are just kind of, I
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.720]   don't know, media companies.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.720]   I know you don't know.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.720]   But that's what I like about this is that you're-
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.920]   That's what this show was kind of about, really.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.920]   Right.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:19.920]   So, what is really possible because platform is, is that platforms networks, the way I draw
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.120]   the world now on the whiteboard is that you have vertically integrated industries that
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.520]   are now replaced by three levels.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:30.120]   Platforms, entrepreneurial efforts that can start now because those platforms exist and
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.520]   then networks that are necessary oftentimes to bring those entrepreneurial efforts to
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.600]   critical mass for things like purchasing your audience.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.360]   And the network really is just a special case of platform.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.360]   Right.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.440]   It really, that's true.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:46.000]   And value today falls to the platforms because that's, that's who has it together.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.720]   So Google and Twitter and so on.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.960]   I think it, I think it starts to shift over time.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.640]   So I've been arguing that newspapers should think of themselves as platforms for their
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.640]   communities.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:59.760]   Universities should think of themselves as platforms for students, futures and education.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.760]   Governments should be platforms too.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.080]   Well, Riley, if he shows up, we'll probably talk about that.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.080]   That's what he-
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.920]   What government 2.0 is all about?
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.920]   So in that case, it means-
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.240]   And people like Yochai Beckler who do brilliant work about networks and what networks and
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.240]   what networks are.
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:16.080]   But I think the network kind of exists in an ecosystem on its own.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.200]   They form like atoms and molecules.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:23.720]   A platform is an explicit act to create something that people use and thus depend upon to build
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.720]   something.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.840]   Respond, benefits come from that.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:30.200]   Huge benefits flow that if you become a platform that makes critical mass, you get huge benefit
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.080]   once you figure out your business model.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.120]   But responsibilities also flow.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:37.320]   So that's what I'm trying to get at Gina is I'm trying to understand what we should
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:42.760]   expect those responsibilities to be and can we ever depend upon them or, you know, Steve
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.680]   of nothing and I will argue about whether Google has to be evil because it's a company.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.640]   I don't think all companies have to be evil.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.120]   I think today, you know, it's bad business to be evil.
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.560]   But maybe platform, maybe we can't depend on platforms.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:58.680]   Maybe it's fools, Marin to ever depend on platforms because they must be what they must
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.760]   be which is companies and they will change.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:04.120]   Unless they're open source, which is why I like open source.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.120]   Which is-
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.120]   Which is-
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.640]   Another question that came about Twitter.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:11.920]   Could you really- I forget who wrote about this so I apologize for not citing, but someone
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:17.280]   not me wrote that, okay, smartasses, you think you want a Twitter to be federated, but what
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:22.320]   if the tweets ended up coming, you know, 10 minutes or 10 days later?
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.120]   You have a high-
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.120]   Worthless.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.120]   You have a low tolerance for-
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.120]   Worthless, yeah.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.760]   And so you witness the fail-well.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.880]   So you want a company to run this.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.760]   Once that company runs it, folks, then the rules change again.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.200]   I think some of this comes down to your definition of platform.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:43.560]   And this is what I was trying to get at was the traditional definition of platform is
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.440]   an operating system is a platform.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.400]   Microsoft created- In fact, you could really say that Microsoft created the platform that
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:54.600]   powered the personal computer industry for many, many years because it provided a reliable,
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:43:00.120]   stable API and service platform for developers to use.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:05.160]   It was those apps on top of Microsoft Windows that made it all work.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:08.560]   So to my mind, that's one kind of platform.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.960]   But I think we're seeing the emergence of a second kind of platform.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.440]   And that's kind of the point I was making, which is Twitter was originally like Windows,
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.760]   that kind of a platform, a developer platform.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.600]   But they quickly realized that really what they are is a platform for users, a content
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.600]   platform.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.720]   And that's- I don't think the rules are the same for a newspaper as platform as they are
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.200]   for an operating system as platform.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.200]   I think the rules are different.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.800]   Well, yeah, but I go back to that notion of-
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.200]   Gene had brought it up, you know, the RT.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.600]   The fact that it was users were not developers, but they acted like developers.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:42.120]   They created a function through a- They added the API.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.440]   They added a convention.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.640]   And Gene, what do you think a platform is?
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:56.200]   Well, I mean, a platform enables users, enables people to get things done, right?
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   So I- You know, it's interesting.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.360]   I mean, I think the question that you and Siva talked about is whether or not if a company
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.360]   is in charge of a platform, do the rules change?
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.600]   I mean, is Twitter's goal to be a platform?
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.440]   Is Twitter's goal to stick around and provide a great service?
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:13.040]   You know, I mean, I think about the iOS app store, right?
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.040]   Is it platform?
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.320]   That's a platform for developers to sell their apps.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.000]   And it's all- And it's Apple's rules.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.760]   It's not an open deal.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.040]   And this is the point Marco makes.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.320]   For a platform to be successful for developers, it has to be consistent.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.880]   Yes, and that's what Twitter's not been.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:34.280]   You need- Microsoft succeeds a platform, particularly Microsoft, because it never changed the API.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.480]   It never changed the rules.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.080]   It was really consistent.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.480]   And you- It controlled the rules.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.480]   It controlled the rules.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.480]   But you didn't have to- But you didn't have to get approval.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.480]   And you took all the products.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.440]   And I don't know if approvals are disadvantaged or not.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:53.360]   As long as the environment is known and stable as it is with the app platform on iOS, I don't
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.240]   think it's a matter- Control is really the issue.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.960]   So that we want to be- It has to be consistent.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:58.960]   That's what Marco was saying.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:44:59.960]   Right.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.520]   He said, right, the consistency free to mount.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:06.160]   He felt like if these changes are being launched now, what happens next year or the year after?
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.520]   Do we really think that the app store has been totally consistent?
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.960]   I mean, there haven't been enough sort of app store snafoos this whole time.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.800]   And also it's just Apple's nature to be very controlling.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.400]   They're the whole widget company, right?
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.400]   Right.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.760]   I mean, Apple's never gonna build something on top of an open platform.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.640]   They want to control the whole experience top to bottom.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:27.160]   And it's very successful doing that.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:31.440]   And when they launched the iOS platform, they're also a multi-billion dollar company.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.880]   Twitter was a tiny little startup and would have done anything to get anybody to use it,
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.200]   including developers in the beginning.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.520]   And that's why they made an API that was totally insecure.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:42.440]   I mean, remember when you could pass your username and password along with the URL?
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.440]   Yes.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.440]   Access the API.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.240]   I mean, they did it just so easy for anybody.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.640]   And that's why some developers loved it.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:51.400]   I mean, I think tons of web developers really cut their teeth on API development on the
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.400]   Twitter API because it was so easy.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.200]   So they went from very, very liberal to more restrictive.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.960]   And people don't respond well to that, right?
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:03.200]   But if you're Apple and you start very restrictive and you set the tone, this is what it is,
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.000]   then you feel more secure.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.600]   You know, Marco obviously feels that Apple's been very consistent this whole time.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.600]   I don't know.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.600]   I mean, things change.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.080]   I feel that things have changed in the app store as well.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.920]   I mean, there's uncertainty about everything.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.800]   Whenever you're building something on someone else's business that relies on someone else's
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:20.800]   business, there's risk.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.360]   I mean, there's risk when you cross the street, you know?
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.920]   But that's, again, this is why consistency is so important.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.680]   You have to make, you know, it's so, I don't think it's a problem.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:34.400]   Jeff, you seem to think it was a problem if a platform's owned by a company.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.840]   No, I agree with Siva that it has to be because it has to be a dictate.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:44.680]   A platform is ultimately a dictatorship because otherwise it's inconsistent.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.880]   And so it has to be absolutely consistent.
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.120]   But it's a collaborative, but it's a mix, isn't it?
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:54.360]   You have to be, you have to perform a platform means stable.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.040]   I can build on this.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.400]   If it's a moving, shifting sand, it's not stable.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.400]   It's not a platform.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.080]   A platform doesn't move.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.240]   That means it's a dictatorship.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:07.320]   Now you can do all sorts of loopy things on top of it, but that platform.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:11.880]   Well, that's the, yeah, I mean, that's why I think Microsoft is probably better at making
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.280]   platforms than Linux was.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.480]   And Apple too.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.400]   But even Linux is somewhat of a dictatorship and my line is smart enough to say it's not
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.000]   Linux unless I say it's Linux.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.680]   Oh, I mean, open source.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:29.400]   Yeah, the key part of successful open source projects is a benevolent dictator, but a dictator
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.400]   indeed.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.360]   And you know, Apple introduced the Mac App Store.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.160]   I mean, I have to buy my apps through the Mac App Store a certain way.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.680]   And now they're building into OS 10 ways to say, oh, this app hasn't been verified.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:42.040]   I haven't installed the latest update yet, but you know, it does.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:46.840]   It's differentiating between official Apple apps and an Apple app, you know, apps that
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.240]   you just download off the web.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.960]   I mean, they've gotten more restrictive over time as well.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:56.320]   I mean, I think there's just a lot of uncertainty around Twitter in general because people still
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.240]   understand how they're going to make money and what they really are.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.080]   And they don't make their sort of indicating that they're not really sure what they are
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.920]   and their communications, as we said, has been carried.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:05.920]   Which is OK.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.280]   I mean, again, Google shifted.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.560]   I don't have any objection to that at all.
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:13.320]   People have joked about, and I've joked about the front Wilson's face about, you know,
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:16.520]   oh, Twitter now has a business model 10 times.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.080]   I think everybody would understand that.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.640]   Everyone would say, listen, this is the reality.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.480]   This is the path we're taking.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.320]   You may not like it.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.600]   You may think advertising is corrupt, or whatever, but it's the way we're going to go.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.720]   And I'm cool with that.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:32.000]   I just think there's a cultural issue there of communication.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.040]   And it's all the worst when you hit that point of critical mass when you don't you
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.160]   think you don't need your developers anymore.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.600]   That's what's weasily about it.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.520]   And if you say, no, we still do or we still do in some extent, but in some cases we don't
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.480]   because we can't afford to.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:44.720]   And here's why.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.880]   Here's the reality we have.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.280]   I'd respected a lot more.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:51.280]   Hey, that's fair.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.400]   I think a great conversation we're going to move on, but that was fun.
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:00.880]   I think this is kind of really key, not just it's not about Twitter at all.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.080]   No, this is what this show was really about.
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:08.760]   When Gina said the rule day one is it's not a Gina, as I understood, said to you, I'll
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:09.760]   be on it.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.560]   If it's not really a show about it's not it's never been a show about Google.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:17.040]   It's a show about the cloud and what it really is about is platforms and networks and all
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.040]   that.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.760]   The cloud is just one one substantiation of.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:24.920]   And I think that the conversation about what the conversation about what a platform is,
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:31.640]   what the rights and responsibilities are of a platform maker is fundamental to everything
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.640]   we love in technology.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:37.800]   I don't care if it's an operating system or a semiconductor or any of that stuff.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:42.360]   Yeah, I was arguing for this week in the cloud, but clearly Leo made the superior
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.360]   editorial decision.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.920]   Well, I knew that nobody would listen to a show about the cloud.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.160]   Not the cloud.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.360]   Now they might.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.360]   You know what?
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.360]   Now they might.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:56.960]   But when we launched this show, 160 episodes ago, it was a much better branding to talk
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:57.960]   to say.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.880]   And we talk more mostly about Google.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:00.880]   We do.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.880]   We do.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:02.880]   Well, Google's a big part of the cloud.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:04.880]   I'm glad I didn't title my book.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:05.880]   What would the internet do?
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:06.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.880]   Exactly.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:14.120]   Specificity is good in titles, even if you and by the way, foolish consistency is a hobgoblin
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:15.880]   of small minds.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:19.160]   So there we're going to take a break and come back.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.400]   You can parse that all you want.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:24.320]   We're going to take a break, come back in just a second with more of Jeff and Gina.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.880]   And yes, Google news.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:26.880]   Don't worry.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.280]   We're not going to talk about Apple Samsung on this show at all.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.080]   I promise you.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.880]   I promise you.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.880]   Fished though.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:35.880]   We're at about Ford.
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.480]   I will talk about Ford on this show.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:41.160]   This is something interesting for its doing.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.240]   It's kind of along these lines.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.400]   They created a social site, social.ford.com.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:52.840]   And this is a company that really is thinking about what it means to be a car company, what
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:58.800]   it means to be a business in the 21st century, and is really responding to that clue train
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:04.800]   manifesto where the dialogue marketing is a conversation.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.600]   This is a conversation between you and the customer.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.120]   And this site is a perfect example.
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.160]   I mean, they're making it fun.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.080]   You can get a grab a, I don't even know what these bad.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:16.520]   I guess people use these badges on Facebook and other places.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.440]   You can grab a badge.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.000]   But that's part of it is identity, isn't it?
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.040]   You want to identify as a friend of mine says, "I'm a Ford family.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.440]   We're a Ford family."
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:27.440]   And I think that's what happens.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.440]   People do that with their cars.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:30.440]   "Oh yeah, we're Ford."
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.800]   My dad was Ford.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.520]   So if you're a Ford family, you can get a badge.
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.880]   I think this is, you know, Ford, I drive one, or you can have a badge for your particular
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.720]   car, which is great.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.800]   I have the Mustang badge.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.640]   And then they made one for us, which is funny.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:46.640]   There's a geek badge.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:50.000]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.440]   Because they're very aware of technology as well.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.040]   Actually, there's quite a few of these.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.320]   I'm going through a lot of badges here.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.560]   Here's the geek badge.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:58.560]   Nope.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.000]   Here it is.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Tech geek.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.840]   We don't have hobbies.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.400]   We have purpose.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.000]   You're not just ahead of the curve.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.680]   You're the one leading it.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.840]   You can take that badge right there and put it in.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.480]   Stick it where the story's shine.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.320]   You also can put your ideas on here or read other people's ideas, which I think is really
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.320]   a cool idea.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:26.200]   There are, for instance, in technologies/convenience, there are 1,540 ideas.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:29.920]   There are 2,483 green ideas.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.240]   This is a good way to see what's important to people.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.080]   2,926 infotainment idea.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:37.280]   You can see what really matters to people.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.280]   There's also articles.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.880]   In fact, I wrote one, just a little one.
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:46.480]   Because I had an interesting conversation with one of Ford's engineers about autonomous
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.480]   vehicles.
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.080]   What kind of technologies are you using?
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.280]   I actually want to talk to them again.
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:57.840]   I'm going to go get them on the horn again and talk to them about security.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:02.600]   We were talking today about the car computer and its security.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:07.440]   Here's some interesting stuff in here that I posted recently on here.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.440]   This is it.
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:11.680]   FordSocial@social.ford.com.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.280]   Ideas, images, videos, articles.
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.920]   Yes, you can grab yourself a little badge.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:22.680]   It's Ford's social site, social.ford.com.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:23.680]   I had a minute.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.680]   I'm a Ford.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.680]   We're a Ford family.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.240]   The LEO badge is the new bumper sticker.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.240]   There we go.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:34.680]   I'd love to see badges made into bumper stickers.
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:35.680]   That's interesting.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.480]   It's appropriate for Ford.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.080]   Yeah, really.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.640]   What you put it on your website, you put it on your Facebook, that kind of thing.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.000]   It's like a bumper sticker for Facebook.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   A bumper sticker.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   That's interesting.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   Very interesting.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   Let's see.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.760]   Let's talk about Google.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:59.200]   Google updates Android Voice Search to support 13 new languages that gives it 100 million
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.240]   new users.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:03.480]   That's non-trivial to add languages.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.280]   It's incredible.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.280]   To add 13 language.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:12.360]   They have now 42 languages and regional accents in 46 countries.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:15.920]   Localization is a huge pain when you're dealing with text.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.520]   I can't imagine voice recognition, localization.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:21.080]   You can use voice search in Basque.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:26.880]   Bulgarian, Catalan, Portuguese, European or South American.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.400]   That's two different ones.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:35.600]   Finnish, Galatian, Hungarian, Icelandic, Norwegian, Romanian, Serbian, Slavok and Swedish.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.600]   Wow.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.600]   That's ridiculous.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:41.160]   Have you used the Google translate voice to voice?
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.320]   No, I know they just added that.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   Is it cool?
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.320]   I mean, it's really remarkable.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:49.480]   When Eric Schmidt demod at once, he said that it's the new Google translate app.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.040]   It'll bring world peace.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:55.680]   So you can be in a concrete and say to someone.
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:56.840]   But now it's voice to voice.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:00.120]   So you can hold up with somebody and say, speak and it will come back and translate to
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.960]   you in back into voice.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.760]   Then you can speak to it and translate back to them in voice.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.760]   Wow.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:06.760]   That's very useful.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:07.760]   Very useful.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.120]   Why don't I have it?
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.120]   I should get it.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.000]   It's a separate app, Jeff.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.920]   It's the Google translate app, yes.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:15.920]   Okay.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.120]   Let me see how it got it here.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:20.880]   A-N-S-L-A-T-E on it.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.880]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:22.880]   It's a separate app.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:23.880]   Translate.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:24.880]   I saw when they updated it.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:26.080]   I want to download it so I can play with it.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:27.480]   So choose languages, right?
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.280]   I can do English to German.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.080]   Yeah, because you know German, you could tell us how good this is.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.080]   I'll see.
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.440]   By my German's bad, so we'll see.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.040]   So now I'm going to enter text below.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.280]   No, I think I can enter.
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.280]   Oh, yeah, I can.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:40.280]   I can't.
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:41.280]   I can't.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.280]   Dictate text.
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.280]   I thought so.
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.280]   Why was it not doing that?
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.280]   Where's my microphone?
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.280]   Ah, eh.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:53.720]   Okay, so I'll do English to French because I kind of can sort of understand French.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.200]   Do you see a microphone on there?
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.200]   Let me see.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.200]   You're using...
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.200]   You don't have the new one, dude.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.160]   Okay, ready?
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:04.880]   Where is the pen of my aunt?
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.280]   Oh, it got it wrong.
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.280]   It got it now.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.280]   How do I play it?
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:11.280]   Oh, here.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:14.120]   We don't do that.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.360]   It's not even close.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.960]   It got it said...
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.440]   Let me do another one here.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.440]   Give me a sentence to say.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.440]   Oh, well...
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:26.280]   My name is Leo and I am a television and...
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:29.280]   I didn't finish.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:33.880]   The fastest way to get yourself thrown is to be seen as Ilem.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:34.880]   Huh?
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.480]   Let's do a different one.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.440]   What should I say?
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.600]   Where is the train station?
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:44.040]   Where did I go?
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.040]   That's right.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.200]   Did that be great?
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:52.600]   Where is the train station?
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:53.600]   Hold on here.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.600]   Let me see.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:57:01.880]   Inchine ein baleinna.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:06.120]   Does it speak Pocono?
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:11.000]   Is there a bathroom near here because I really need one?
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:19.160]   That's good.
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.160]   That's good.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.520]   I think any Frenchman would understand that.
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.640]   Did it emphasize the "really"?
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.840]   Yeah, it says "jiff".
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:26.760]   "Re mombas wanda".
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:30.320]   "Re momb" means I truly need one.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:35.320]   And by the way, it translated mine with "cause" as C-U-Z.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.720]   That's the English.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:39.720]   That's funny.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:46.240]   "Vaux istau bonhof".
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.640]   Hold it up to the mic.
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:52.640]   Yeah, it got train station.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:55.680]   This is good.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.440]   This will be very handy when you travel.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.680]   This is the "babelfish" that everybody, you know.
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.520]   So it's not just that you can do search.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:04.920]   You can now tie languages together at the same time.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:05.920]   It's just...
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.960]   So the languages it translates.
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:15.640]   Spanish, Afrikaans, Albanian, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijan, Basque, Belarus, Bengali, Bulgaria.
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:17.720]   I mean, it's just a long list.
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.280]   I want this in my glasses.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.280]   Oh, Latin.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.280]   It does Latin.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.280]   Where does it go?
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:27.000]   Here, here's Latin for "is there a bathroom near here because I really need one".
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.760]   It is.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:34.840]   That's actually pretty accurate.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.240]   As I remember from my high school Latin.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.960]   I don't know how they had to pronounce it.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.520]   Yeah, I was going to say hi.
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:41.520]   It's a dead language.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.960]   I was like, "There was a word for bathroom.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.920]   I guess it was just sort of the hole in the ground."
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.160]   That is kind of amazing.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.160]   "A latrina".
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.800]   "A latrina" is the word for bathroom.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:55.480]   If you're truly stranded in a country where you don't speak the language and you're trusting
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:59:02.560]   Google to translate your English correctly or your native language correctly, I mean,
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.560]   that's really putting a lot of trust into Google's hands.
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.840]   I would to hear speed in the me.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:07.840]   I don't speak Vietnamese.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.640]   I have no idea how accurate this is.
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:15.480]   I would just hope they'd point me to a bathroom.
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.480]   "L'a la tarmacant amber yenday vyto chu ken moat".
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:18.480]   I don't know.
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:19.660]   And you just come put in jail.
[00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:22.240]   Yeah, just saying, you know, insane asylum.
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.800]   It looks good.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:24.720]   Wow.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:28.280]   So, that's the other thing is that you can change the language.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.400]   You can say that once and change the language.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.320]   "Hail me a tuk tuk".
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:34.320]   Is that it?
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.320]   "Hail me a tuk tuk".
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:40.960]   "Hail me a tuk tuk".
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:45.400]   I don't know.
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:48.360]   It translated tuk tuk into Van Bahn.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:49.360]   Hmm.
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:54.640]   I wonder if you say taxi if it'll translate into tuk tuk.
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.880]   Ahhh.
[00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:01.640]   We'll never know because I'm stopping right now.
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.880]   That we leave as an exercise for the listener.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.320]   I think that's pretty cool.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.320]   Isn't it?
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.320]   Right, cool.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.560]   And I want that my Google glasses for sure.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.800]   I have to say everybody, this is, I am not kidding.
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.720]   This is a huge challenge for Apple.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.200]   The new iPhone comes out September 12th.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:23.800]   And I see more and more people who would nominally be automatic iPhone purchasers,
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.840]   seeing stuff like that and going, "Hmm".
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.400]   And Google now, I think Jelly Bean is so compelling.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.240]   It's really coming together.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.280]   Just Gmail and calendar.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:39.240]   The number of people I know who rely on those who now prefer the experience of those things
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.240]   in Android.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.760]   It starts to come together.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:42.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:48.200]   And more importantly, the awareness is starting to rise among normal people.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:52.320]   I always kind of make this a habit of looking as do I walk around town iPhones.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:56.960]   And it has been predominant, like 90% iPhones, especially in Northern California.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.160]   Until recently, I'm seeing more and more Android phones.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:00.960]   And I'd say it's 50/50 now.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:05.120]   Jake taught this summer at a great thing called ID Tech Camp.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.200]   They do them in campuses around Stanford and NYU.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.720]   He was a Princeton.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.680]   And he said, "All the fellow counselors who are all Geeks teaching how to program,
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.840]   Jake taught how to program iOS apps."
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:18.480]   But the counselors were all using, instructors were all using Android phones.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.480]   That's a bellwether.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.480]   Because those are the Geeks.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.480]   Those are the influencers.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:29.200]   I said we weren't going to talk about Apple Samsung, but really the truth is Apple Samsung,
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.800]   the jury is now deliberating.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:35.560]   Really, Samsung is a proxy, obviously, for Google.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:43.920]   And Google has responded via its proxy Motorola patented fringe at lawsuit against Apple
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:49.560]   with the US International Trade Commission asking the ITC to block Apple from importing
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:54.960]   the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and various Apple computers.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.360]   Oh, dear.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.360]   It's getting ugly.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:08.320]   In fact, an ITC judge has already issued previously a preliminary ruling in a previous
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:14.080]   Motorola versus Apple case and said that Apple did indeed infringe on one of Motorola's patents.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:21.320]   So sometime next week, what kind of hell would break loose if the ITC said, "Yeah, Apple,
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.480]   you can no longer sell any device in the US."
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:30.920]   What kind of...you know, the backlash to Google and Motorola on this one is not worth winning
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920]   this case.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:37.360]   I mean, they better hope they don't get a judgment in their favor, right?
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.480]   Yeah, I thought that Google wasn't going to use patents offensively.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.480]   Well, I guess not.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.520]   And it's interesting that Motorola's official statement worded it that we have little choice
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.400]   but to defend ourselves.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:54.400]   We would like to settle these patent matters, but Apple's unwilling is to work out a license
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.040]   and this is what Apple said to Samsung, by the way.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.720]   We would like to work out.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:01.960]   This is what we...this mutually assured destruction.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.040]   This is what it's all about.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.040]   You bypass.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:07.840]   Well, at the same time this week, someone at Google, I didn't put on the run run, I forgot,
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.040]   argued in favor of getting rid of software patents.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.040]   Good.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.040]   Oh, everybody's...
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.800]   Everybody is an agreement.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.000]   It's just too expensive.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.360]   It's too much money and time is wasted.
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:23.240]   It's a death-blowing innovation.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:29.320]   That as long as those laws exist, well, have at it.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:36.640]   YouTube is going to let users decide whether they want to see ads on mobile.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:40.200]   I am shocked, shocked.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.200]   On Wednesday...
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.520]   I think that's what that says to the advertiser is, this is a real view.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.520]   Right.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.520]   They can charge like war force.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:47.520]   Ah!
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.520]   They ended it.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:55.480]   I think it was working on mobile and that the usage going to mobile is tremendous, but
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.880]   it's known as a horrible place for advertising.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.480]   Where do brand advertisers like to go?
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.480]   TV.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.040]   Bad rep on mobile.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.040]   Put the two together.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.040]   I think it's a clever move.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.040]   Whether it works or not, we'll see.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.040]   But I think it's very clever.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.720]   And you're right because they're calling it true view.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.080]   So that's...this really was viewed.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.080]   Right.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.360]   That's the idea.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.120]   Do people really want to watch ads?
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.600]   Which is going to be...
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.520]   This is from the New York Times, Bittsblog, Keir, Kain Miller writing.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.880]   Do people really want to watch ads?
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.360]   Yes, the executives say.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.880]   Say they're lounging on their sofa, watching funny YouTube videos on their phone.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.640]   By the way, this is via the mobile site.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:33.960]   This is not an app.
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:37.640]   They might want to watch a trailer for a new movie from Paramount Pictures.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:43.160]   Or if they're watching videos to get new style ideas and Lori Al offers a beauty video, they
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.160]   might be interested.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:49.640]   You know, Leo, what occurs to me in the second is that what Google did with AdSense was
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:53.280]   force the advertiser to create an ad that performed.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.800]   And then they were forced to do cost per click.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.800]   Right.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:00.040]   And so it's almost the same here as that Google say to the advertiser, "You better have a good
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.240]   ad or nobody's going to want to watch it."
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.240]   You know, Dig did this, didn't they?
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.840]   Dig said you could opt out of ads on Dig.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.080]   I thought that was quite innovative.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.360]   And I think it's the same exact motivation, which is, "Hey, if people don't opt out, they're
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.360]   really paying attention.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.360]   It's a better ad."
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.400]   I thought that Dig was that you could dig or bury an ad.
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.400]   Yeah, you could.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.400]   Well, the same thing.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.400]   You could say, "I don't ever want to see it."
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.400]   Right.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.400]   Right, right, right.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.680]   But it'd be interesting to see if YouTube took this a step forward and said the ads that
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:31.240]   get skipped the most, you know, don't get played at all, but this doesn't really make
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.240]   sense.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.240]   Right?
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:34.240]   Because if you haven't seen the ad, then you can't judge it.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.880]   You know, it's not an editorial judgment.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:41.360]   According to YouTube, on desktop computers between 15 and 45 percent of YouTube viewers,
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:43.680]   that's a big number, 15 to 45.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.240]   That's a big range rather.
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.760]   Generally choose to watch specific ads.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:54.360]   65 percent of video ads shown before videos pre-roll now offer the choice to skip, right?
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.240]   You see that skip.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.560]   I always skip.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.720]   I always skip too.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.440]   You shouldn't say that, mister.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.040]   Don't skip.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.560]   I don't always.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.040]   I do almost always.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:09.040]   But there are moments when I get hooked and say, "I actually care about that."
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.040]   You're right.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.680]   I just want to challenge this to the advertiser to make the ad compelling.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.360]   If the ad's good and it's interesting and it's something I want to know more about, or
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.560]   I just want to see, I'm going to watch it.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.560]   I'll watch the ad.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:22.480]   Oh, by the way, Apple pulled those genius ads.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.360]   They showed them the Olympics with it.
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:28.200]   They took them off YouTube and they took them off their site.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.160]   They said, "Well, we never intended for anybody to see it after the Olympics."
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:32.640]   I think they were crap.
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.640]   They were embarrassed.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:38.760]   Phil Farh, he group product manager for monetization at YouTube.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:39.760]   I want that title.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:40.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:43.840]   I'm a product manager for monetization.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:48.440]   Much better user experience, says Phil, where the user actually feels in control of their
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.880]   advertising in the same way as they feel in control of their content.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.960]   I would completely agree, actually.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:57.680]   And content creators are capable of earning more money in a more user-friendly environment.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:02.040]   Finally, they're realizing, look, you can't force people to watch ads.
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.040]   You have to--
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:07.520]   Here's the other value to YouTube is that it becomes a more pleasant YouTube experience.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.520]   Yes.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.560]   And well, how often do you start watching stuff and say, "Okay, I've seen that five times.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.880]   I'll tell of it."
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:17.040]   By the way, they're basically implying that they're not sure this is going to work.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.760]   They're just going to try this out, yeah.
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:20.760]   So they don't know.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:25.600]   Hey, if I could put a skip-add button in our shows, I would.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.320]   Absolutely I would.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.800]   It would change the way we charge.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.160]   We'd have to track you.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.040]   You wouldn't mind if we track you, would you?
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.840]   Not a bit, Leo.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:40.680]   All the people who wait tracking cookies, the problem is that for these things to work,
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.520]   you've got to have metrics.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:47.760]   A, and B, one of the reasons-- one of the benefits to the user for tracking cookies is frequency
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.760]   control.
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.680]   You'll get the same ad over and over and over and over again.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.080]   Frequency control says, "I don't want to waste money showing to you again."
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.680]   And it tops out.
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:00.600]   It's really too bad that they don't call those ad preference cookies or something like that,
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:01.600]   because that's really what they are.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.360]   They're ad preference cookies.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:14.760]   Google Play gift cards are here just in time for Christmas or Labor Day.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:17.640]   And you can get them at Target, Radio Shack, and GameStop.
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.600]   So now this is parity with the iTunes.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:25.440]   Of course, iTunes gift cards are a huge, huge revenue for Apple, I would guess.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:27.600]   And it's a big grandma opportunity.
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.600]   That's the opportunity.
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.280]   Right, but one of my kids wants now, they want iTunes gift cards.
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.280]   Absolutely.
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.280]   That's what we've always given the kids.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:35.360]   Stock and stuffers.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.360]   Everybody loves it.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:39.600]   Now, I don't know if-- now, this will be a real test.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:44.360]   Because let me ask Chad, would you rather get a Google Play card or an iTunes card?
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.160]   That's a good question.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.160]   10, you're 16.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:50.520]   Now, here's the thing, is the Google Play card doesn't work with everything on the Google
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.400]   Play store.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.640]   So you can't buy, say, a Google device with a Play card.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:56.640]   No, no, no.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:57.640]   It's for content.
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:58.640]   Right.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.640]   And you can't buy--
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.640]   You couldn't buy a Macintosh with an iTunes card.
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:02.640]   Right.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.640]   No.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.640]   No, you can't.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.640]   Not for an iTunes card.
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:06.640]   No.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.640]   You can get Apple.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.440]   But you don't see a Macintosh in the iTunes store.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.440]   Right.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.440]   Ah.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.440]   But I can't use--
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.440]   It's a coin.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.320]   I have an Apple gift card.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.520]   I can't use in the iTunes store.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.760]   I can't use it in the store.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:22.200]   You can buy movies, music, books, or apps, but not, obviously, in Nexus 7.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.880]   Or subscriptions, which I think you can do in the iTunes store.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.520]   Ah, you can't get subscriptions.
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.520]   Right.
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:29.520]   Don't figure that.
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:31.520]   That's just, you know.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.560]   Me, my phone is an Android phone.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.560]   So you'd want to?
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.560]   I'd want it.
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:36.560]   So grandma now has to know.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.560]   Oh, that's bad.
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:38.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:39.560]   That's the thing.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:40.560]   I must know about your Nexus 7.
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:41.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.560]   Hey, sonny boy.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:45.200]   Are you Android or Apple?
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.280]   My parents got blessed with me.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.760]   A Barnes and Noble cards.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:49.760]   Oh, dear.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.760]   Amazon would be better.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:51.760]   Oh, dear.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:57.160]   Do you have a-- Hey, Jeffrey, do you have a nook or a Kindle?
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.160]   Oh.
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:03.760]   Well, the other reason I find this compelling is that kids who have cash instead of credit
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:12.000]   cards can now go into Target by a Play Store coupon and now have credit.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.360]   Oh, that may be the whole point of this.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.360]   Exactly.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.360]   That's a really point.
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:20.320]   Chad Johnson, ladies and gentlemen, his hair may be red, but he's got stuff in his head.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.320]   But his matter is still gray.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.480]   Matter is still gray.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.720]   Very good point.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.640]   So you wouldn't have to have a credit card.
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.640]   Right.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.600]   Oh, that's huge.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.440]   I think you're exactly right.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:37.560]   This is a way of getting apps and stuff in there.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.360]   Google and Boingo.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:45.920]   Remember last Christmas you get on a virgin America flight and they get free boingo thanks
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.920]   to Google.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.360]   Golden Age of free Wi-Fi.
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.360]   Oh, yes.
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.360]   It was a golden age.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:51.520]   It was a golden time.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.200]   Well, now you can do it at the mall.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.680]   Google and Boingo have a-- I didn't know this.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.880]   There's a free Wi-Fi project in New York City.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.880]   Oh, that was amazing.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:04.200]   The first time I experienced that, I was like, this is Nirvana.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:07.160]   It was like the 14th Street Station free Wi-Fi from Google.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.160]   It was amazing.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:09.160]   It was good Wi-Fi.
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.160]   It was fast and everything.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.160]   Yeah, it was great.
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.160]   I mean, when you train--
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.160]   More right under Google.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.160]   You're out.
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.800]   So, but--
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.640]   Marissa Myers, former Wi-Fi access point.
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.880]   They are going to do this in malls.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:26.640]   It will be ad supported eight malls across the country in San Francisco, Los Angeles.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.640]   Tampa and Seattle.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:32.680]   They wouldn't say the specific malls.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:37.520]   So they did that in six subway stations and 200 hotspots.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:42.680]   But that will end September 7th.
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:43.680]   Oh, no.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.880]   So malls makes a lot of sense, right?
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:50.600]   Because Google offers is going to show you ads for stores that are near you in the mall.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.600]   Makes sense.
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.280]   Well, but here's what's really going to happen.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:56.600]   What really happens, of course, is that retail is becoming a showroom.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.320]   For the internet.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.520]   And so it really happens is another easier, faster way to say, "Ooh, what is this cost
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.840]   for online?"
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.120]   And it's another needle into the kidney of retail in America.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.880]   So I'm surprised the malls are going to go for it.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.520]   I know it was really weird.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.160]   And needle in the kidney.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.160]   Oh.
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.160]   I was going to say a kick in the kidney.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.160]   That was a little too much.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.160]   I was going to do a wood stake in.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.160]   That was too much.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.160]   I was looking a little smaller.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.160]   This is how my brain operates.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.160]   Ow.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:26.160]   I've had too much surgery, I guess.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.080]   Oh, look behind the curtain.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:35.760]   So I think that you can go too far with deals, the deallification of America.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:40.240]   I mean, I guess I like, I understand the idea of deals.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:45.160]   But when I start seeing deals in my bank statement, that's going a little far.
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.520]   I saw you tweet about this.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:50.160]   Bank of America started embedding.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.160]   It looks like ads.
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:56.720]   And not only that, I mean, if people are upset about Google looking at Gmail, these deals
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.560]   are tied to what I charged.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:01.240]   Let me see if I can find the image.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.400]   Yeah, I do not want an ad supported bank.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.760]   So Bank of America responded to me.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.760]   Of course, you tweet something Bank of America.
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.520]   Yeah, every company watches.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.360]   You tweet something and they said, "Well, you know you could turn them off."
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:17.240]   Yeah, you could turn them off, but on a per load basis.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.920]   So next time you come back, they're back.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:21.640]   This is what Square is going to be.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:22.640]   Mark my words.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.640]   So look at this.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:24.640]   So look at this.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.360]   Square has not because Square has the...
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:30.640]   And we want to argue about platforms and value and Jackbeat and both.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.880]   That's why it's worth asking.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:34.440]   Because Square is going to get more.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:37.080]   It recognizes the value of that.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.080]   Uh oh.
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:41.080]   Sorry, he's in the Poconos.
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:46.320]   He'll be back momentarily.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.840]   I wish folks, those of you listening at home, could just see Jeff's expression right now.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:51.840]   He's gone.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.840]   Oh, how is he?
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.080]   Let me show you while you're calling Jeff back.
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.240]   I'll show you.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:58.280]   So this is from my checker.
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.920]   And this is in the bank statement online.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.920]   This is not like...
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.440]   Okay, so this is in line with your transaction.
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.640]   In line with my transaction.
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.200]   I bought sushi and Boston, actually Jennifer did.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.360]   I bought sushi and Boston, maybe Henry.
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:14.440]   Earn 10% cash back when you die at Burger King.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:19.440]   So they decided because I was eating sushi, maybe I'd like to dine at Burger King.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.680]   Which is a horrible tart.
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:22.680]   Horrible.
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.240]   I went to a grocery store and it said rent new movies on DVD and Blu-ray, earn 15% cash
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:30.560]   back at Red Box, which of course is in grocery stores.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:36.160]   Went to buy clothes at the Grove Boutique, earned 15% cash back at Aeropostal, which is
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.360]   a clothing online clothing store.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:44.480]   So they're not, not only the embedding these in my check statement, the Bank of America
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.040]   is looking at what I'm buying and then recommending deals.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.320]   They call this by the way, a loyalty program.
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:56.880]   I said it's a disloyalty programming and I'm getting a new bank by unbelievable.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:57.880]   Wow.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.320]   Like they need more money?
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.320]   Didn't...
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.320]   How much did the government give them?
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.320]   Wasn't that enough?
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:04.320]   You need more?
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:11.600]   For crying out loud, I already gave you money.
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.600]   Anyway.
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:16.800]   I actually went out and got a new bank because of that.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.560]   I just thought it just didn't seem appropriate.
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.320]   Now mint, so somebody's saying doesn't mint do this?
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.960]   Yes, but I'm signing up for mint and that's the deal.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.520]   I get, Mint's free, first of all, the bank is, I'm paying a lot of money for my banking
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:27.520]   services.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.320]   Mint's free and that's part of the deal.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.320]   I understand.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.320]   I made that deal.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.200]   I didn't make that deal with Bank of America.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.160]   Did you complain?
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.640]   On Twitter and then I changed banks.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.640]   No one noticed.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.640]   Nobody in Bank of America.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:40.640]   No, no.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.680]   I got lots of tweets from Bank of America begging me to come back.
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:46.320]   But here's an interesting thing because then I tweeted, well, I tweeted this and I said,
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.320]   this is Twitter.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.720]   Boy, this is really interesting.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:49.720]   Case study in Twitter.
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.680]   I tweeted as I've been doing lately, well, what's a better bank?
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.800]   And I got a lot of response of what's a better bank.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:01.160]   And many banks that were mentioned, TD America, Ally Bank, a couple of the banks were mentioned,
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:04.720]   then tweeted me saying, Leo, we'd love to have you as a customer.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:06.920]   And I don't think it's really interesting.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:10.400]   And people are, these companies, and it's not because it's Leo, I don't think.
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:13.360]   I think these companies are constantly monitoring for their name.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.360]   They have tools to do that for sure.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:20.280]   They have tools and people and tools who are people.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.720]   At least at Bank of America.
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:26.160]   No, I got a lot of tweets from Bank of America.
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.720]   They were not happy about me.
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:28.960]   They said, you know, you could turn that off.
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.920]   You know what's opt out, but it is an opt out.
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:35.240]   You could turn it off, but only, but then you come back the next time it's there again.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:40.880]   And I don't want them looking at what I bought and giving me loyalty deals based on it.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.280]   That doesn't seem right somehow.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.280]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.280]   What are the drugs stored?
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.280]   Do you have a grocery store?
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.880]   Do you have a frequent buyer card?
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:48.880]   No.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:53.920]   No, because, but again, that is, okay, so that's, that is similar, isn't it?
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.120]   So I went to the grocery store.
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.200]   If I use it, and I don't use it for that reason.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:01.080]   And by the way, I feel screwed because everything costs like a lot more because I'm not using
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.080]   the loyalty card.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.080]   That's the thing.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.080]   You want to pay the real price.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:08.480]   The only way to pay the real price is to use the loyalty card.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.480]   Yeah.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:16.400]   So, you know, Philip K. Dick wrote a short story about a world where advertising is everywhere.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.560]   It didn't seem possible.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:21.840]   But, Leah, why don't you use the loyalty card?
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:23.840]   Did you just privacy reasons or?
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.040]   Yeah, pissed me off.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.480]   I don't know how to do that.
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:32.080]   Every time they end, boy, they, there's one, I go to the CVS drug store over here and they
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.600]   say, where's your loyalty cards?
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.600]   I don't have one.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:37.160]   And there's one clerk who will still scan in a loyalty.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.160]   She has like a one tape.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:48.680]   And you have to pay the cost of the like longer transaction of them asking, do you have one?
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.320]   Do you want one and having to say no every time?
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.880]   So, but no, but that's it.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:54.880]   No.
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:57.680]   And Taffron, you're pointing out exactly what's true.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.320]   They're paying you for your data.
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:00.320]   That's exactly right.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.480]   I just choose not to give them data.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:04.720]   So I get screwed because I have to pay more for my groceries.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.600]   I believe the truth is they are not paying you for your data.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.520]   They're charging you the actual value of the grocery.
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.560]   But only if you use a loyalty card.
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.760]   If not, they're going to charge you more.
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.120]   Ha ha.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:19.960]   So it's a little, it's a little different, but that's just my belief.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:26.680]   Anyway, I don't do it because it offends me, offends my I should say they say, Alex in
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:31.680]   their chair, I'm says, Oh, just use Jenny's number eight, six, seven, five, three, oh,
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:32.680]   nine.
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:34.960]   That works everywhere.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.680]   Use your user, Vincent says it too.
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.440]   Apparently this is some people are doing.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:43.280]   They say, just use your area code plus eight, six, seven, five, three, oh, nine.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.600]   And then Jenny will be the one eating hummus.
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:48.600]   I'm surprised that you're that you're not.
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:50.720]   Yeah, you both use them.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:53.600]   You're I mean, I know you're a sister like me.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.600]   Yeah, you're a mr. public.
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:58.240]   You're mr. like, what can we, you know, get out of aggregated data?
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.440]   Truth is I just too much trouble to fill out the form and do the whole thing.
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.360]   I just want to pay for my groceries and and leave.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:05.720]   But you know, here's the good news.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:08.320]   Thursday is senior day over at the Petaluma market.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.120]   I get 5% off just for looking old.
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.280]   You do not count as a senior.
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:15.280]   Come on.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.280]   Sick.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:17.640]   What starting this year?
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.840]   I'm a senior.
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.840]   55 and up.
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.760]   I think you're scamming them.
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:27.920]   You know what's depressing is like for the last three years they've been saying you're
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:28.920]   a senior, right?
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.920]   That's what's depressing.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:35.320]   You know, there's a horrible day awaiting you when you realize that you're old enough
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:36.320]   for aARP.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:40.200]   I don't look forward to that.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:45.440]   You join it right away because, you know, they're protecting Medicare.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.640]   Thank goodness.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:50.920]   I'll be happy if I make it that long.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.920]   You will.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.600]   You know, you young people always say stuff like that.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:55.600]   Right?
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:56.600]   Isn't that true, Jeff?
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:57.600]   The young people go, oh, I'm going to die young.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:02.600]   Get to our age.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.600]   You're going to go, God, I hope I don't die.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.600]   Please give me a life one more month.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.600]   Oh, I want to live to 100.
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:11.360]   I will be grateful for the experience and the wisdom that I have at that time.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.360]   You will.
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:13.360]   Oh my.
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.360]   Make a pay.
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:17.960]   I'm going to see that on Google+ over a picture of an old cap.
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:20.200]   Wait till you're going to the bathroom every half hour.
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.960]   Then see how wise you feel.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:29.400]   Not the time to think.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.400]   No, read.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:35.000]   That's by the way, the Nexus 7 perfect size for bathroom.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   It is.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   It is.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   Just right.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.320]   God, I'm sorry we brought this up.
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:42.240]   A superior Galaxy Nexus specs.
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.680]   This is from the Verge.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:50.960]   Evan Rogers writing rumored specs for the new Galaxy Nexus Sam mobile is the blog.
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:51.960]   Huh?
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.560]   Minor upgrade, I would say.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:54.560]   Not a huge one.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:21:00.520]   It's going to be 4.65 inches.
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:02.720]   Super AMOLED.
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.240]   The Galaxy S3 is 4.8.
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:08.960]   It will be a one.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:10.560]   So that's the same size, isn't it?
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:11.560]   Same size as the old one.
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.960]   A little bit faster A9 and 1.5.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.560]   A pair of opposed to 1.2 gigahertz dual core.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.560]   Better.
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:18.560]   You know what?
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.560]   This they should have done in the first place.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:23.120]   These call me about the Nexus is they actually had a 5 megapixel camera when everybody else
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.120]   had an 8.
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.960]   It will go finally to the 8.
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:28.400]   Better front facing camera 1.9 megapixels.
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:32.320]   Really it's all about getting parity with the Galaxy S3.
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.720]   And to get something out before the holidays, right?
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:35.880]   Yep.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:43.720]   I am going to predict that I will be sporting a Galaxy Note 2 before the end of September.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:45.360]   Oh, that's so.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.160]   Well, they're no, no, we do know.
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.320]   They're announcing it in one week.
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:53.080]   I don't know when they'll ship, but I figure it'll be right about when Apple announces
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.080]   their--
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.080]   Nexus 7.
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.960]   Well, that's the beauty of it.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.600]   It's a phone and a fablet.
[01:21:58.600 --> 01:21:59.600]   Right.
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:00.960]   So do you stop carrying the Nexus 7 at that point?
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.400]   I never carry the Nexus 7.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.400]   It's Wi-Fi.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:06.080]   It's no good anywhere, but where you live, right?
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:07.080]   You carry it around?
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:10.480]   Yeah, because I use it at the office.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.280]   I use it at Starbucks.
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:13.640]   I have been my phone.
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:17.320]   No, I feel my phone is-- you know, I have the S3, which is that 4.8, which is fine.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:19.320]   And I cannot wait to go back to the Note.
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.320]   I miss my Note.
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:26.240]   So when the new Note's 5.5, that'll be-- if it fits in my pocket, which I think it will,
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:29.000]   I will not-- I don't carry the iPad around either.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000]   It's too big.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   Even the--
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.880]   Well, I used to carry my laptop around with my phone, with my iPad.
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:35.880]   No.
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.560]   I then reduced to just the iPad.
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.480]   Now I've reduced to just the phone and the Nexus 7.
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:42.000]   I do love the Nexus 7, but I just feel the phone is sufficient.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   What about you, Gina?
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   Do you carry a tablet with you?
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.240]   I mean, I mostly work at home when I travel.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:50.280]   I do carry it in my bag, but I don't like carry it in a pocket.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.280]   Yeah, yeah, travel's too--
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.280]   You know, I mean, you know.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.280]   Yeah.
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.840]   But if you're going to-- you say, I know I'm going to a coffee shop.
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.480]   Should I bring something with me?
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:01.800]   If I go to a coffee shop, I will take it with me just to do email, whatever.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:05.240]   But yeah, and if I-- I think if I commuted to an office, I would take it just to read
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:06.240]   on the train or the bus or whatever.
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.240]   I guess to train.
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.240]   Yeah, sure.
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:12.240]   I listened to audiobooks, so that's-- you know, I could do that on my phone.
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.240]   Is there-- is the guy--
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:18.260]   Is the-- is that the-- is that the-- is that the one you're talking about?
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:19.260]   Tabton one.
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.260]   That's the-- that's the tablet.
[01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:21.260]   Yeah, gotcha, gotcha.
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:25.520]   And then-- then-- yeah, and then-- but they're going to do a note.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.000]   They're all called the note now.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:32.620]   That's why some of the confusion, they've renamed the tablets to be notes.
[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:34.460]   So I'm talking about the note, the phone.
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:36.400]   It'll be the note-- the name, the note.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.400]   It'll be the note.
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.400]   The note.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:39.400]   I'm talking about the note.
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:40.400]   The note.
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:41.400]   I'm talking about the note.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:46.400]   The phone.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.080]   The next note, note two, phone.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:52.440]   Here's James Franco showing you how good he is at fabbling.
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:54.680]   Oh, we got some weird audio.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.200]   Oh, hold on, I could fix that.
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:57.200]   Watch this.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.200]   Whoop.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.200]   Whoop.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.200]   I unplug it.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:06.040]   I'm fucking-- I can't-- I make a sound because I am that old.
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.040]   And then--
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.080]   This crystal is-- is chill cheesy.
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.080]   It's real cheesy.
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:13.120]   To compare it to these Siri ads, which are equally cheesy, right?
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:14.120]   This is--
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.120]   Oh, true.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:16.120]   Same idea.
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.120]   No, gosh darn it.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.120]   Whoop.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.120]   Whoo.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:24.040]   I didn't get to it loud enough.
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:26.200]   I wonder what that is all about.
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.120]   Is it still bad?
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:29.120]   So popular.
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.120]   There we go.
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.120]   See, it works, but you got to do two whoopoos.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.120]   I directed that.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:34.320]   Let's go back to James Franco.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.560]   So why?
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.560]   I'm James Franco.
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:37.560]   Oh, hi.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:40.720]   In the past few years, I've acted in a bunch of movies.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:41.720]   Yes.
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:42.720]   I've written some.
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:43.720]   Yes.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:44.720]   I've produced some and have directed some.
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:46.960]   Yeah, I got a PhD in English.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:51.040]   I've also appeared on the soap opera.
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.720]   I directed a theatrical dance company.
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.000]   So I'm thinking that this is how they pitch them.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.640]   James, you can do an ad, but for the first 30 seconds
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.280]   of being ad for James.
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:01.280]   And then we'll--
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.280]   Yeah, just talk about how great you are.
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:03.280]   Just how great you are.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.440]   And he said, yeah, I'll do that.
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.520]   Are you going to pay me?
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.560]   So anyway, eventually gets to the tablet.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.200]   He's making eggs for some reason.
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.840]   I wrote a book of short stories.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.040]   Oh, he's still boasting.
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:18.040]   And I'm even directing this commercial.
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.320]   Ah, Bruce, give me a little wider.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:23.400]   And cue the tiger.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:29.880]   It's not a good ad.
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.040]   I don't even want to watch anymore.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.040]   I'm done.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:33.040]   It's slow.
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.040]   It's really slow.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.480]   That's already 30 seconds.
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.560]   Do you haven't even told me what you're advertising?
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:38.760]   Yeah, it's already annoying.
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:39.560]   It's true.
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.080]   Sorry, James.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:40.560]   I'm not really annoying.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:41.480]   Sorry, James.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:42.840]   You're cute.
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:46.240]   I like getting geeks and freaks, but no.
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:50.480]   So here's a guy who's a guy who--
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.360]   Google contractor, part timer, whose job
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.360]   was looking at the worst of the internet.
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.680]   Did you see this?
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:57.280]   Yes.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.000]   This is a BuzzFeed piece.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.760]   It's a confessional by an anonymous--
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:02.920]   It's a nominous.
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:06.800]   A former contractor for Google who didn't get hired.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.440]   So maybe he's bitter.
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:12.920]   Yeah, his job was basically to look at child pornography,
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:15.480]   beheadings, murders, fetishes, to judge
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.280]   whether or not content was.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:22.760]   15,000 images a day from Google Images, Picasa, or Kut.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.720]   Google search on and on and on.
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:29.080]   He just-- that was his whole day.
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:32.960]   Was looking at that.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:36.320]   He really don't think about these folks, right, when you talk
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:36.800]   about internet.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.000]   Somebody's got to do it.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.040]   Yeah, someone's got to do it.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.040]   And it's funny.
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:43.000]   He said that he didn't realize at the time how much it was
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.720]   kind of affecting his outlook on life and the world,
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:50.080]   but that they had some auditors come in and just kind of
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.800]   test him, give him some test images, kind of like a Rorschach
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.520]   test to see what his reaction was.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:57.640]   And he said that after a year of looking at all that crap,
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:59.560]   he would see a picture of a father and a son
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.240]   and be like, that's messed up.
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:04.760]   You know, it's just like a child.
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:05.920]   Oh, you ought to--
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.600]   I can tell what's going through their minds.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:09.800]   I know what he's thinking.
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.080]   That's why he didn't get hired.
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:13.160]   You can't do this job for more than nine months.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.760]   You go crazy.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.840]   But then there's Matt Cutts, I always say.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:17.680]   Yes, but then--
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:18.400]   That's true.
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.000]   That's true.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.960]   That doesn't have to look at that crap anymore, does he?
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:21.480]   Yeah, look at that stuff.
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:24.360]   But he has to think like all the evil scum buckets
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:25.160]   of the world.
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.600]   And what are they going to do next?
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:31.600]   And he is the nicest, most friendly, wonderful guy we know.
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:34.800]   Maybe he runs Michael McPuppy farm now, I don't know.
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.600]   No, no, no.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:40.120]   So it gets his frustration out or is the world's greatest
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:40.600]   therapist.
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:44.440]   But no, Matt worries about all the worst slimmers of the world
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:46.680]   and it is the nicest guy we know.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:51.840]   So thank you for sharing this post from Google.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:55.880]   I didn't know they had so many pluses for so many people.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:57.760]   Right.
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.520]   I mean, if Google-- if Google divisions don't use Google Plus,
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:04.640]   then here come the arguments of the ghost town.
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:08.360]   So there's 81 different Google Plus circles
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:13.240]   from Google Maps, Google Argentina, to Google Chrome
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:16.520]   developers, to something called Big Tent.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.840]   Big Tent, by the way.
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:18.720]   That's the thing.
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:20.160]   I went to one of those events.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:22.040]   I did two of those events by video.
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.280]   They're doing another one in New York on creativity.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:27.360]   They kind of do these think events, which are very good.
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.600]   Anyway, this is good.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:28.960]   Thank you.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:32.240]   I'm going to add that to a circle.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.560]   I think I'll call it Google.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.400]   A Google circle.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.000]   Google with 3Os, that way.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.200]   It's distinctive from my other Google circles.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.840]   And then it just adds them, right?
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:45.640]   Boom.
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:46.920]   Wow.
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:47.640]   How exciting for me.
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:49.800]   You've been overloaded with Google goodness now.
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:51.040]   Yeah, I should be able to--
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.600]   I wish they still don't have this in Google.
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.320]   You can look at an individual circle, but I love it.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:58.160]   You could look at any combination of circles.
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:28:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:01.440]   I think you can also demote a circle
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:02.640]   and say give it to me less often.
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.400]   You can do that.
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:06.840]   I guess that's the closest thing, right?
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:10.800]   On Live, we talked about this yesterday.
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:13.400]   It's actually on Sunday on Twitch.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.240]   It's an online gaming system.
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:16.000]   It was kind of clever.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.280]   All the work was done on the servers.
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:21.400]   So you could have a lightweight low end client on your end,
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:23.840]   and you'd still be able to play high end games.
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:26.400]   Weird thing happened.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.960]   They fired everybody.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:32.600]   But then they sold to one person who was really into it.
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:35.160]   He said, I'm going to rehire most of you, this is eventually.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:39.960]   But right now I'm going to hire about a quarter of you back.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.280]   Very strange.
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:47.320]   Tesla Museum is funded.
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:48.320]   This is an indie go-go.
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:49.160]   That's a great story.
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.040]   Yay.
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.480]   So this is an indie go-go project.
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.840]   Indie go-go is like Kickstarter.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.440]   Maybe a little bit more open.
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:30:01.640]   They needed $850,000 to create a goddamn Tesla Museum.
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:03.280]   That's what it says.
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:05.480]   The property is for sale right now on Long Island.
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:07.480]   And there's one chance to kind of get it.
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:09.640]   And I think the government said that--
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:12.120]   Royal government said that they match.
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:14.800]   So they needed 1.6, 1.65, whatever.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:17.840]   And so they had $850 to make the match
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.200]   and get the property.
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.280]   And it's the last-- not the last minute,
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:22.920]   but it's still more time to go, which
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:24.400]   speaks for a better museum.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:29.120]   But an anonymous $33,000 gift for the month.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.080]   $850.
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:31.400]   I bet you this is Paul Allen.
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:34.600]   Tesla's final laboratory located in the sleepy town
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:38.160]   of Shoreham, New York is known as Wardencliff.
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:41.200]   He attempted to build a tower there
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:46.160]   that would provide free wireless energy to the entire Earth.
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:51.080]   But he lost his funding before the project was completed.
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:53.800]   So are they going to resurrect the tower?
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:56.200]   I don't think the tower with the buildings there was.
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:01.520]   It was sold to a photo company, photo chemicals.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:06.720]   There was all kinds of expenses of clean up as a brown site.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.480]   I think it was bought by Agfa then.
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:09.760]   And they were going to sell it.
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.400]   And they wanted a certain amount of money,
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.160]   because they cleaned it up.
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:14.600]   But the building is still there.
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:17.720]   So just a word of warning, they've raised enough money
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:20.640]   to buy the building, but not to build a museum or anything
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:21.400]   else.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:21.920]   I think so.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:23.200]   So now they have the property.
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:27.680]   So I guess we'll have to have another fundraiser, maybe
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:28.920]   a bake sale or something.
[01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:31.400]   Or maybe a company of days to go on a Leo?
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.520]   Oh, maybe they could go over and over and over.
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.200]   38 days left.
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.520]   38 days left.
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:42.080]   What he should do is set that let's have a goddamn billion
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.600]   dollar meter, a million dollar.
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:46.960]   So for $25, you can eat by 10 of Tesla.
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:50.680]   $33, you get a Tesla is greater than Edison bumper sticker,
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:51.760]   which I love that.
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:53.800]   Definitely wins you geek cred.
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:54.640]   I love that.
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:55.800]   Well, this is the oatmeal, right?
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:00.800]   The oatmeal kind of put out that great homage to Tesla,
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:04.160]   that one comic about how Tesla was so much better than Edison.
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:05.080]   Right.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:05.800]   Right.
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:08.960]   I mean, Edison killed an elephant, right?
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:13.480]   So it's funny how you can--
[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:16.480]   for reasons that may be justified or maybe not
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:18.600]   become a geek icon.
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:22.280]   And then now, well, we've got to spill the museum.
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:22.720]   I don't know.
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:23.640]   Is it was Tesla really?
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:25.120]   I'm going to pledge.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:27.240]   I want the bumper sticker.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:28.080]   $33.
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.480]   I want that bumper sticker.
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:29.920]   So I'll put--
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:30.960]   Everything is threes.
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:33.400]   Yeah, because Tesla like three.
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:37.920]   You could get a custom oatmeal portrait of you for $3,333.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:40.040]   So the guy's doing this is the oatmeal guy.
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.000]   Yeah, it's the oatmeal guy.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:42.360]   Wow.
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:43.560]   It's his-- it's his campus.
[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:45.880]   Mr. Oatmeal.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:47.760]   Dark Lord of the Or-- oh, that's why it's
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.080]   Let's Build a God Damn Tesla.
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:52.880]   That's why I thought I was gratuitous profanity, but no.
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:53.400]   Oh.
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.520]   He's not merely taking the Lord's name in vain.
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:58.120]   He's doing it all the time.
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:59.600]   So I'm going to give you this one,
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:00.680]   and then we're going to move on.
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:01.320]   This is for you.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.840]   Just for you, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, Germany.
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:06.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:08.760]   Germany, your favorite country.
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:11.040]   Yeah, I'm going to use my Google Translate out of Translate.
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.880]   What the F they're doing?
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:15.600]   It's kind of hard to believe.
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:19.040]   They basically want a law that says,
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:22.960]   if a search engine reproduces a newspaper's headline
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:26.200]   and/or first paragraphs, you have to pay the newspaper.
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.680]   So you can link to them, but you can't link to the headline
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:30.280]   or any content from the article.
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:30.880]   Right.
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:31.880]   Right.
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:32.380]   Right.
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:36.160]   And this is called a "Lizetungs Schutzrecht."
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:38.440]   Put that through your Google Translate and smoke it.
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.760]   And it's various publishers coming together
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:42.120]   and publishers have a bad business model.
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.480]   They've always been complaining that Google's
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:44.880]   making all the money, and we aren't.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:47.600]   There's another hiding behind the skirt of government
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.640]   trying to create this law.
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:52.920]   And it's kind of the last minute of going through the Bundestag.
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:55.800]   And now people are raising alarms as well as they should.
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:00.600]   So Kai Overbeck, the policy guy for Google in Germany,
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:03.800]   just wrote a strong response to it,
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:06.400]   which I think is in due time should happen.
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:07.360]   And other companies are.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:08.520]   Because it's just ridiculous.
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:12.920]   It's just-- there's also--
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:16.440]   they were also talking about a kind of an ancillary copyright
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:20.560]   that would force companies to pay publishers license fees
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:22.520]   for using their work in a commercial setting.
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:26.120]   So employers, for instance, if I have people reading the internet
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:30.240]   here at the office, I would have to pay the publisher
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:34.800]   for letting my employees read the news online.
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:35.800]   It's like music.
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:39.040]   Yeah, it's the absurdity.
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.200]   OK.
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:42.240]   Got a bad business model?
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:43.840]   Go to the government.
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:44.280]   Yep.
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:46.040]   They're specializing.
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:48.880]   Fix up bad business models.
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:49.680]   Wow.
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:52.000]   Is that going to pass-- is there a chance in hell?
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.400]   I think now it's not going to.
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:53.800]   I think it's not.
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:54.760]   Because they went through a second--
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:55.840]   there was enough fewer.
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:56.960]   They went through a second--
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.080]   I guess I shouldn't use that word.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:59.840]   They went through a second version.
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:02.880]   And not their side likes that.
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:05.080]   So we're at that kind of impasse now.
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:08.160]   And it's basically publishers don't
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:10.480]   be in their chests about how they're being put upon
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:13.640]   by this bad internet.
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:17.640]   Marissa Meyer has stuck it to Google now, not once,
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:18.760]   but twice.
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:21.200]   According to Business Insider, she
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:26.320]   has hired a chief of staff who used to help position Google.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.480]   In fact, has been there since 2007,
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:32.560]   most recently product manager and managed Google+ marketing.
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:35.880]   His name is Andrew Schulte.
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:38.040]   It's not the first Google employee she's hired, actually.
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.880]   She's hired a number of Google employees.
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:44.240]   And she's decided not to give all the Yahoo employees
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:44.920]   Android phones.
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:46.840]   They're all getting iPhones.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.040]   I think they have a choice.
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:48.800]   That's what I said.
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:49.320]   Wow.
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:51.240]   I didn't see that in the story.
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:53.080]   Most of them are stuck with BlackBerry today,
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.240]   which is so appropriate to Yahoo's bad as a wife.
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:57.960]   If she's giving them a choice, that's
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:00.640]   a different story than the one I read, which just said,
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:01.480]   they're getting iPhones.
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:03.000]   So they have a choice.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.240]   I think they'll have a choice.
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:05.200]   That's what Google does.
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:06.640]   Google says you have a choice.
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:07.000]   Yeah.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.240]   Yeah, that's fine.
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:09.200]   It's smarter, too.
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.680]   You want people to be on these platforms.
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:12.720]   That's one of the arguments about why Yahoo
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:13.840]   is behind in mobile.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:14.360]   Right.
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.520]   They're using BlackBerrys.
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:16.520]   Which is BlackBerrys?
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:17.040]   For crying.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:17.320]   For crying.
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:18.000]   Not loud.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000]   Of course they're behind.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.400]   But they're BlackBerry client.
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.160]   Awesome.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.640]   Awesome.
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:25.160]   All right, we've got to wrap this thing up.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:29.240]   Has Mr. Timo Riley arrived yet?
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:30.160]   He's going to be on Skype.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:32.240]   Well, then we better wrap it up anyway.
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:35.480]   Let's finish these things up with Gina's tip of the week.
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:37.320]   Gina?
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:39.600]   Google just launched a new mobile search
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.360]   experiment called Handwrite.
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:42.080]   So this is pretty cool.
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.200]   It's popped up on my phone.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:45.440]   I think if they announced it earlier this week,
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.400]   you go to google.com on your mobile device on iOS
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.280]   or your tablet or Android.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.200]   It doesn't work in Chrome.
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:53.320]   It works in the stock Android browser.
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:54.600]   And you enable it in your settings.
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:57.560]   You go to g.co/handwrite.
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:01.800]   You tap the button, which just looks like a handwritten G.
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:03.960]   When you enable handwrite, you can actually just
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:07.680]   draw the letters that you want to search for on the screen.
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:08.200]   I know this is--
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:09.080]   It's so much faster.
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:10.560]   This is a little gimmicky.
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:11.640]   This is a little gimmicky.
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:13.600]   I hate making.
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.320]   But if you're in a situation where you're on a bus or a train
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.680]   and it's kind of moving and it's hard to pick up the keyboard
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:20.320]   or in this video that we're watching
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.640]   if you're on the treadmill or whatever,
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.320]   and you just don't want to pick at your keyboard,
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.680]   you don't want to use voice search.
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.680]   This is pretty cool.
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:27.720]   What was her hand?
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:30.040]   That's still what she's on the treadmill.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.600]   Well, I think that was the point.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.480]   All she had to do to search for cupcakes was type C-U-P-C
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.120]   in really big letters.
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:39.400]   Right, because the instant search auto completes the rest.
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:41.120]   So this is pretty-- I have to say,
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:41.720]   this is pretty neat.
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:42.600]   It's a little gimmicky.
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:43.560]   It's kind of like voice search.
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:44.880]   I don't use it very much.
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:46.880]   But trying it out was a lot of fun.
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.760]   And there might be some situations that I might use it.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.240]   And actually, one of the things they
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.880]   show is somebody doing it in Japanese.
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:56.560]   And I think for ideograms, for non-Arabic or Roman texts,
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:59.200]   that would be non-Roman texts.
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:00.280]   That would be cool.
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.960]   Oh, someone that tried just corrected me.
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:02.760]   It does work in Chrome.
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:03.440]   Sorry.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:04.640]   I didn't think it worked in Chrome.
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:05.960]   OK.
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:07.360]   So hand write.
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:08.760]   Search right on the Google Home page.
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:11.680]   Now, by the way, chat room, we depend upon you.
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:14.080]   And we're never going to do to you
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.040]   what has been done to developers elsewhere.
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:17.360]   Yes, we love you.
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:18.120]   We need you.
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:19.280]   We build on your wisdom.
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:20.720]   You see, and we understand that.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.480]   This ain't a platform.
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:25.160]   It's a democracy.
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:26.600]   It's an affinity.
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.880]   It's an affinity.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:32.080]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:33.040]   All right.
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:36.840]   I could talk about the rumors of $4 million a month production
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:38.920]   for mini 7 and 1/2 inch iPads.
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.120]   But I won't.
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:45.200]   Instead, a mashable did a handy collection of Google Maps
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:48.680]   stats, meaningless huge numbers that are just so huge.
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:50.160]   You can't get your head around them.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:54.040]   Google Maps now has 20 petabytes of data.
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:54.880]   This was interesting to me.
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:56.760]   They say that satellite and aerial images
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:58.880]   are updated usually every two weeks, which
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:01.120]   is really impressive to me.
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:04.320]   Street View is documented more than 15 miles of roads.
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:06.960]   And the cameras from Street View have 15 lenses
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:12.680]   and produce 65 megapixel images, even better than Curiosity.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:13.200]   Wow.
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:18.640]   My product of the week or tool of the week
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:20.640]   is actually something that's not out yet, but was announced
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:21.160]   by Nikon.
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:22.680]   You've heard, of course, about the fact
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:24.160]   that people are using smartphones instead
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:26.240]   of point and shoot cameras, Nikon decided
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:30.280]   to respond by putting Android in a point and shoot camera.
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:31.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:34.040]   It's only gingerbread, but I like it.
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:36.600]   It's a $350 camera.
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:41.400]   And if you look at it, it's even got on the back a full screen.
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:45.840]   Let me scroll through the images with the Android buttons
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:46.640]   on it.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:47.160]   Look at that.
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.120]   It's just like your phone.
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:51.200]   Only you can't make calls on it.
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.920]   I think that's kind of an interesting product.
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:56.800]   I'll certainly get one for review as soon as they come out.
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:57.120]   I just--
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:59.520]   I didn't want to see a force-close dialogue.
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:00.520]   I can't--
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:01.520]   I know.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.320]   Now, they-- does support Wi-Fi.
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:05.720]   Has GPS built in?
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:08.800]   You can online sharing from Facebook and Twitter
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:09.280]   and other things.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:10.600]   So there's certain-- I mean, there's
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:13.040]   certain compelling things about this.
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.760]   I think it's kind of intriguing.
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:16.480]   If Maxwell, Smart, were working today,
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:18.840]   there'd be Android powered shoes.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:19.800]   Android Everywhere.
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:22.320]   That's the Nikon Coolpix S800C.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.840]   It'll be out next month.
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:26.200]   And I will get one for review, of course.
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:28.640]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.360]   That's where he blogs.
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:30.840]   And you must read his blogs to understand
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:31.760]   what we're talking about.
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:36.400]   He has a whole blog on platforms, a whole post on platforms.
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:39.400]   That was kind of the foundation for what we were talking about today.
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.960]   Let me again thank Skytop Lodge for the use of the facility.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:42.680]   Look at that.
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:43.360]   The beautiful--
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:43.840]   Look at those.
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:45.600]   This is just a meeting room, but it's a gorgeous place.
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:47.320]   My daughter-- we're on the zip line today.
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:48.000]   Oh, what's fun?
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:48.520]   I'm boxing.
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:49.080]   Oh, what's fun?
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.280]   Oh, zip lines fun.
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:51.280]   That is really neat.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.120]   I would never do it.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:55.560]   I am chicken-esque to the hilt.
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:56.800]   I wouldn't make it up.
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.080]   Oh, no, zip lines are fun.
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:58.560]   They're safe.
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:40:59.400]   The ladder.
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:00.560]   But the guy who likes to write it is you
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.120]   have to belay on the ladder.
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:02.600]   Oh.
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.840]   I want that at home.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:06.280]   Then you couldn't fall.
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:07.200]   Yeah, it's about a whole ladder.
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:09.560]   It won't fall as far as I can.
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:11.600]   His book is Public Parts Available Now.
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:16.960]   And don't forget his Kindle single Gutenberg the Geek.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:18.720]   He's starting to look more like Gutenberg.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:20.720]   If you had that funny hat--
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:21.720]   I know.
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:22.720]   I know.
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:25.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.480]   Gina Trappani is at smartawear.org,
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:29.440]   founding editor of Life Hacker.
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:31.360]   She's also, of course, the author
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:34.760]   think up and works at Expert Labs on that.
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:35.720]   So no more Expert Labs.
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:36.560]   Just think up.
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:37.440]   Oh, really?
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:38.680]   Yeah, no more Expert Labs.
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:40.520]   Actually, we just bought thinkup.com.
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:41.400]   Oh, good.
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.200]   Nice place over for now.
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:45.480]   So wasthinkupapp.com, announced thinkup.com.
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.800]   Right, right.
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:48.240]   Fantastic.
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:48.840]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:49.440]   Thank you, Jeff.

[01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:03.320]   I could have called it that.
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:04.720]   Maybe.
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:06.080]   Maybe.
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:08.560]   Anyway, you know what you're going to get now.
