[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.440]   all that jazz with Gina Trappani founding editor at Life Hacker currently a principal at ThinkUp
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.320]   the fabulous Twitter and Facebook analytics company at ThinkUp.com and a blogger at Life.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.400]   I mean what is it smarter where dot org and she's probably forgot the address as well.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.280]   So sad. I know you got it right here.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.680]   You're busy. Whatever happened to blogs. Yeah. She's got a baby. She's got a new
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.680]   program. There he is. Jeff Jarvis. He's in Seattle today to meet with some big wigs at the Gates
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.800]   Foundation. Oh, that's beautiful. Oh, yeah, that's pretty. And what are you doing? Jeff's a
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   professor journalism at City University New York. He also blocks a buzz machine. What are you
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   doing at the Gates Foundation? They have a meeting of all their media fundees. So I'm going to stand
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.840]   up and say I'm not a fundee yet. Ah, so my favorite moment, Gina moment this week, I'm just
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.680]   going to throw this in is that somebody speculated that there are new regulations about
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.800]   and Russia. I guess it was about about not using nasty words and how I could look at Russia.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.720]   Gina looked up her data on ThinkUp and said that I didn't use the F word as much as she thought.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:07.280]   Yeah, we have a new insight and think up that tells you how often you drop the F bomb on
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.320]   on Twitter or Facebook. And you know, it doesn't show up for everybody. It only shows up for folks
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.520]   who do that at all. And of course, Jeff, Jeff had that insight and it wasn't so bad. It was only like
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.720]   eight times in the month. Well, now I'm now embarrassing. Now I got a I got a
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:28.080]   oomph out my F and act here. I'm going to have to I'm going to have to use F one so I can just see
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.280]   yeah, because I I've never used that. I don't think I've ever used the F word in any of my tweets.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.160]   I you know, I have an either honestly because I just personal policy, but that's not the case
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.720]   for everybody. And we just thought, Hey, why not celebrate it?
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.440]   Some of you uses a lot. Do you have a red a red insight, you know, right?
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.760]   We're not judgmental. We merely count. Oh, and we'll let you know how many more this month
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.360]   as compared to last month. Once we have the data to show you that.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:05.120]   I love think Jeff insight. That's my look at that. It's Matt cuts from the Google. He's one of the
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.640]   early employees at Google currently fights spam and Google search results. He does those wonderful
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.400]   webmaster videos to Matt's nice to see you from the Googleplex. Good to have be back. Thanks very
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.560]   much for having me. I got a question for Matt. Actually, we get I mean, and I mentioned this
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.320]   before, but I but I never had the guy here. I've been getting a lot of email. You guys must be on
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.040]   a campaign to get rid of bad backlinks because I've been getting email all of a sudden from
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.480]   people who spammed our forums many moons ago saying, you know, I don't know who did that.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:44.880]   Could you delete those all those spammy links or spammy accounts? And then a few of them are
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.880]   really mean and say I would hate I would hate to have to report you to Google for not doing so.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:58.000]   Yeah, that's a nice forum you got there. So am I should I worry?
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.680]   No, no, you don't need to worry. This is basically a one time correction where for a long time,
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.920]   spammers were like, get links all the links as many links as you can get links everything.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.040]   And now that's not the case. And in case in fact, it makes sense to not have some of those
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.880]   low quality links. So this is basically a lot of people trying to go back and clean up the mess
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.000]   they've made. The nice news is going forward. People will be or at least anyone who pays attention
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   will be smart enough not to just say, yes, get as many links as possible. That's what I want to do.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.800]   Yeah, but no, you don't need to worry about it. You're in fine shape. It gives me great pleasure
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:39.520]   to often to respond to them saying with a little bit of cotton Freud. Oh, you spam my forum and now
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.520]   you wish you hadn't. But somebody pointed out to me, I think this is possibly the case that some
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.320]   of these might be legitimate firms that hired less than legitimate SEO firms and they did it
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.720]   on their behalf. Yeah, that does happen. Yeah. Or at least that's what people always say.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.880]   Right. We're actually going to shut down those forms because they're not much used.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.760]   And I just think it's probably better. The forms are kind of old hat.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.000]   Yeah. Well, there is discourse. That's actually a new one from Jeff Hatwood and company. And it
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.040]   actually does a very good job of being crawlable and it includes some user trust so that you don't
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.720]   you can't just drop a link the day that you're interested. So you might want to check out.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.720]   I am now suddenly interested discourse.org. Is there it's a it's an open source, right? You
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.200]   download it yourself, right? Is there like a very popular discourse installation?
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.520]   That's a good question. All I know is, you know, since we're interested in spam
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.840]   spammed forums, we did a little bit of an audit to make sure that, you know, that it was crawlable
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.440]   and had pretty good SEO. And it was actually looking really good. It's one of the very few times I was
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.240]   like, there's not a lot more to suggest. So if you just want to drop in forum that is sort of like
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.880]   the next generation of forum, I'd sort of start looking there rather than with some of the older
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.360]   ones that I am going to talk to our team because I like the idea of a forum. And you know, there are
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:04.080]   forums like the developers forum, you know, XDA developers forum for Android that are very
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.200]   active and very widely used AVS forum. There are some kind of they become kind of platforms.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.680]   I think a forum is a nice way for our audience to to get it or active. So maybe I should take a
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:22.000]   look at this. I should know this. There is there is a subreddit for twin on Reddit. Yes. Right.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.320]   Many subreddits. I think each of our shows has a subreddit. And you know, we just launched a Reddit
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:33.120]   show called Reddit up. Right. Because I love Reddit. New stuff coming out. I can talk about
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.480]   later. Yeah. I talked to them. So they will do a hosted version. They haven't done it yet,
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.880]   but they're working on a hosted version. But we haven't we have a few surfers laying around.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.040]   Yeah. And the sandbox looks great. Just the, you know, front page. Yeah. Just, you know, try it out.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.040]   Yeah. Very good discourse. Well, one thing they do, which I really like, they don't have to,
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.040]   you don't have to go page next page next page next to read a discussion. You can just look at it,
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.640]   which is great. Yeah. We use something briefly. It was very popular called vanilla. Remember
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:06.240]   vanilla forums? They were really clean and simple. Oh, yeah. Loved those. But we ended up using some,
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:14.080]   you know, PHP, BB's tile thing that really is just, it makes me nervous. There's even
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.520]   there are servers. Yeah. There are entire server packages you can lease out of Russia for 500
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.880]   bucks a month where they will register accounts, solve the CAPTCHA, you know, just, you know,
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.320]   professional software packages to spam every type of forum. Oh, horrible. It's pretty crazy.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.840]   You're into Russia, Matt.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.280]   My wife would like to go and I'm kind of like, I'm not sure I want to go to Russia.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:46.000]   Really? You think, no, you'd be safe there, wouldn't you? I'm sure, but he's lowering the GDP of Russia.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.360]   Here's a, here's a picture of Vladimir Putin considering the arrival of Matt Cuts in the Soviet
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:00.640]   former Soviet. I am not amused. Well, and there's these new blogger laws that Putin
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:06.000]   signed where the others have from. Yeah. After register. Yeah. That's pretty wild.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.800]   And he'll use THICCUP to find out who's using the F word and banish them.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.720]   Putin on Monday, actually a few weeks ago, said that the internet was a special CIA project.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:25.920]   You know, so this is a lot of government. China very famously does this. You have to register if
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.360]   you want to publish on the internet. That's really sad. It's really sad. It's the
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.280]   ruination. The time story goes through kind of the state of things of how all the countries that
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:46.240]   are trying to mess up Turkey, China. Of course, during the Arab Spring of a couple of years ago,
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:54.320]   Egypt, Syria, Venezuela during protests against the government in February was blocking online
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:00.640]   images from users. Pakistan has banned 20 to 40,000 websites, including YouTube, saying they're
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:07.840]   offensive to Muslims. Facebook blocked for a while. Yeah, that to me, that is a measure of how
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:14.960]   powerful and good the internet is as a force for democracy, for, you know, freedom.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.560]   When the tyrants don't like something, that's a good sign. Yeah, that's a good sign.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:27.360]   You might hope think up gets banned there as well. That's my goal. It helps
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.960]   us what a terrible thing to do. It wasn't that it used to be if you're an author,
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.240]   what you really wanted is the Catholic Church to ban your book. That would sell copies, baby.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:45.360]   Let's see. Should we talk about a classroom a little bit? Yeah, that looks neat. Launched
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:51.920]   yesterday, they announced it at an event some time ago. It's the apps for education tool to help
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.520]   teachers create and collect assignments. My fellow faculty members immediately were
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:03.600]   sending an email around saying, we want this. Is it a blackboard replacement, a moodle replacement?
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:11.280]   What exactly? I don't know. Does it do? You can create and collect assignments,
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.200]   classroom weaves together, Google Docs. See, they already, you've already got Docs, right?
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.280]   You've got a lot of them. Blackboard is universally despised.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:25.120]   Everybody uses it. Not only expensive, but everybody uses it, hates it. We use moodle at the local
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.960]   high school that I'm a part of. That's an open source project, but that is ugly, a little hard
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.800]   to use. We also use Google Docs. I think anything that works with Google Docs would be very powerful.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.040]   This is an evil conspiracy to get young people onto Google. It is the CIA.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.440]   And it sounds like if you have a lot of assignments, it will create folders in Google Drive for like,
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:55.120]   here's the class period and here's individual students. What are we doing with paper in 2014?
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.040]   Just even bringing that all in one place is a large amount of progress.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.840]   It's funny. Lisa's son, Michael's 11. He's in fifth grade. He has to do his first
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.920]   research project. The first thing is, he's doing it on cactuses.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.680]   Get the encyclopedia entrance entry for cactus. And it's like,
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:24.320]   fortunately, back when my kids were that young, I bought a world book in cyclopedia in 1995.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:32.160]   And I still have it because it's beautiful. It's a new movie. I've been, I just moved it to my office
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.000]   this week so that Michael could get the cactus, the sea volume.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.080]   And then when for a while, we subscribed to the yearbook because, you know, of course, it's immediately
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:48.560]   out of date. So now you have to subscribe to a yearly update of what happened in 1996, '97, '98,
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.920]   '99. And it just stops it. 1999 is the last one I got. And there's,
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:58.640]   so I'm considering an artifact from the previous century. The Y2K problem of knowledge. It's just
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:04.240]   nothing. Nothing happened after 1999. The end of history. End of history. It's beautiful.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.960]   I got the deluxe edition. It's leather bound. It's gold plages. It's got a little ribbon.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:14.880]   I don't know what I was thinking. I was nuts. It was very expensive.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.360]   But it's, but you know what? I'm glad I have it now because it is. It's kind of a little bit of,
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:26.480]   you know what it was? It's because when I was a kid in 1965, I read the encyclopedia. I loved it.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.800]   I would just take a volume at random. I liked the S volume because it was the biggest.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.200]   And I would just read it. And I thought, I'm taught myself the sign language, the alphabet and
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.080]   sign language using like encyclopedia, botanical, like the blue. Yeah. And I was like, nine. I'm
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.520]   just imagining that my daughter is going to be like, mama, like, what was an encyclopedia?
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:51.040]   I'm waiting for that. Yeah. So I had it here at the office and I had everybody, I said,
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.640]   can you help me guys? And Russell said, what did you print out, Wikipedia?
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:00.640]   [laughter]
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.880]   Times has changed. So this classroom is...
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.360]   You know, the Germans did print out Wikipedia.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.560]   What? What? What for?
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:12.960]   One of the publishers there did an edited, amended version of Wikipedia called the Wikipedia
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:20.960]   lexicon on this very thick book. Wow. Here's the encyclopedia Britannica entry for cactus.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.440]   Look at that. Just could they charge you to get to it?
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.760]   They do. They do. This is just a locked sample.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.000]   To continue learning, pay here.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.480]   Well, and look, it's got an ad next to it for Vonage,
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.520]   Tripit, activate your free trial. Members get more.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:47.440]   Merrill Lynch. This is not the encyclopedia. And on Google.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.240]   Right at the top there. Yeah, like, don't be using this. Be using Google.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.840]   An ad for Google ads.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:15:01.520]   Wow. Yeah, it's... I kind of... I love books, but I think books are a specialty product now,
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.480]   aren't they? Yes. Nothing wrong with it.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.760]   It was a wonderful column by Will Self in the Guardian about the...
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.840]   this week, about the end of the literary novel. And it's just magnifically overwritten.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:18.560]   Oh, I hope that literary novel is not dead. Oh, he argues it is.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.400]   Because he argues that basically you have to get buried in a narrative.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.120]   And readers will not give up the link and the link will break the narrative.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.080]   Oh, that's so sad.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.440]   And he didn't say it really mournfully. He just said this is a reality.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.840]   This is going to come as a great shock to Jonathan Franzen.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:42.480]   Oh, well, yeah. Let me take... So, I had his book with corrections, I guess, the one before last.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.040]   Yeah, that was a great book.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.640]   Well, I was... I'm talking about getting him... You're talking about a lot of work.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.040]   I was trying to get through it. Yeah.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.640]   I was reading it. And then it was in my briefcase on line 11.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:59.200]   Wow. And the book got completely infused with all the dust.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.240]   Absolutely. Every page was... Oh, that was the corrections.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.120]   And that...
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.560]   Right. So, I threw it out and then I bought it again.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.880]   And I couldn't read it anymore. It just seemed self-indulgent to me.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.040]   Fiction has since.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.240]   Wow. So, it's not the link. It's 9/11 that killed the book for you.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:23.040]   For me, for me, and I also think that he's a little bit self-indulgent, too.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.680]   I loved his book, The 27th City. I'm still in the blurb on the cover from People Magazine.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.880]   Well, interesting, because when I do a search for Jonathan Franzen,
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.560]   I get the Google Books page for the corrections. Look at that.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.040]   You know, I was talking to a friend of mine about iPad magazines or tablet magazines,
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:48.240]   and the difference between reading web pages. I use Instapaper to save stuff to read later.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.920]   And if I'm on the subway and I'm offline and I start looking at my Instapaper queue,
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.760]   I have this hyperlink anxiety because there are often links that I want to follow.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.240]   No, it's not.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.760]   And I can't because I'm offline.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.000]   And so, what I like about books and magazines, they are contained, right?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.720]   And it's up to the author to provide all the context in the words in front of me
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.600]   versus just, you know, kind of linking off and letting me decide.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.000]   I mean, of course, I read like that all day.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.640]   But what's nice about the book and the magazine and sort of the contained story is that
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.240]   I don't have hyperlink anxiety and I can't go off into a million directions.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.080]   I'm just giving myself over to the author to take me from point A to point B and give me
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.120]   all the information that I need in that straight line.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.560]   And I think that there's value in both ways of reading.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.560]   I don't think sci-fi's going away.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.800]   I feel like at least among the most technically literate folks,
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.280]   people who watch our shows and so forth, we all love sci-fi.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.000]   We love getting buried in a sci-fi novel.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.440]   So I don't, you know, I don't know.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.280]   So fiction's not going away.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.680]   Well, you said the novel's going away.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.440]   The literary novel is going away.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.440]   The sci-fi is not literary.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.120]   What was it I was with the other day?
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.080]   Whoever bought Harlequin, always News Corp bought Harlequin,
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.320]   I was like executive from News Corp. And the number of romance novels,
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:10.240]   if you want to call that fiction of any sort, is just incredible hundreds, hundreds of me here.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:10.880]   Wow.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.600]   So people like to read fiction.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.240]   Just not literary fiction.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.200]   Smart.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.640]   Highfalutin fiction.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.120]   So I would say that that isn't link anxiety because why don't you have link anxiety
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.560]   if you read Harlequin? I mean, link anxiety is link anxiety.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:32.480]   It's just that people don't have time for highfalutin literature.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.400]   Well, part of the argument is are people willing to do something hard?
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.520]   Oh, no, definitely not.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.840]   Definitely not. Too much work.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:47.360]   Well, it's funny because I mean, I say stuff to read offline when it's, you know, TLDR
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.040]   because I'm during my work day, right?
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.680]   Like I can't, it's not a piece of content I can ingest quickly, you know,
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.440]   while I'm at my computer doing other things.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.840]   It's true that a novel is a much larger.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.800]   Nobody has told me.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.400]   It's an escape.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:06.720]   It's a vacation, you know, versus sort of news, news gathering or reading, you know, reading quick essays.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.000]   He has one of the best leads I've ever read.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.520]   Let me see if I can do this.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:17.200]   And I'll send you to your, um, if you happen to be a writer, one of the great
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:23.760]   Benesons, looking up, a happy shoulder, is that your personal culture mind is equipped
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.040]   with its own canaries.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.040]   Holy cow, wait a minute, I got to parse that.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.040]   You have a little writer, one of the great Benesons of having a children is that your personal
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.200]   culture mind is equipped with its own canaries.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.440]   Yes, because you've read so many books on relentlessly into the future.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.080]   These little harbingers either choke on the noxious gases released by the extraction of
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:48.480]   decadence or they thrive in the clean air of what we might call progress.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.520]   Isn't that great?
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.600]   Wow. That's beautifully written.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.440]   Yeah, it's a great piece.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.640]   But you know what? Nobody's.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.160]   This is this is nothing new.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.520]   Nobody reads literature.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.080]   It's been lamented.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.280]   It's always been one, the one percent that have ever read literature.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:01.680]   Come on.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.520]   Justin's Twitter is declared dead every once a year or so.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.880]   No, Twitter is actually dead.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.160]   No.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.320]   Didn't you get the memo, Jeff?
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:10.720]   I don't know.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.600]   It actually, no.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.760]   Well, it's a stock market.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.200]   Yeah, the stock market thing is dead.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.720]   That's how you measure its life.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.040]   Why?
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.680]   So, yeah, what is, uh, so what's going on?
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.920]   The stock market apparently doesn't believe that Twitter, uh, is going to,
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.840]   they believe because of its falling growth.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.200]   But both was down A, but B, then a whole bunch of insiders' shares were released,
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.160]   I think yesterday or day before.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.080]   They, uh, they, uh, they were unlocked.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.200]   Yeah, they're unlocked.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:33.840]   So that calls.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.040]   A lot of big sell-off.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.520]   But the, but the shares were dropping long with, you know, a week, a week before that.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:45.760]   So it's just, uh, I think it's, I think it's an adjustment.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:51.600]   I think Twitter was, uh, perhaps overhyped because, gosh, you couldn't go five minutes
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:58.480]   without a TV show or a magazine or anything or billboard saying hashtag something or rather.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.800]   And so everybody thought, oh, this is mainstream.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.720]   I don't know if it's mainstream.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.000]   Well, here's Jimmy.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.960]   It's a pretty darn big.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.760]   Here's Jimmy Fallon.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.240]   He does this.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:11.200]   By the way, Jimmy Fallon, the new tonight show, does use his Twitter, I think, to great effect.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.320]   He plays a game called the hashtag game.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.080]   Let's play that.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.040]   So he just sent this out.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.240]   Let's play the hashtag game.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:24.400]   Tweet out a funny, weird or embarrassing thing your mom has said and tag this with mom quotes.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.040]   And so then what happens is now tomorrow night, the next night he'll read mom quotes.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.880]   They had a funny one.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.720]   The last one I saw was a rap.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.040]   Uh, it was a Kentucky dirt.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.840]   It was because it was in the Kentucky Derby day, May 2nd.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.120]   Kentucky Derby rap.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.120]   It was a circle.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.640]   And then they had the roots, his wonderful house band.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.440]   Uh, wrap it.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.240]   I don't know what they're going to do with mom quotes.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.520]   Maybe get Jimmy's mom to read them.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.720]   He, they're good.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.160]   They do a good job with these, I think.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:59.520]   And so, yeah, I think that there's lots of ways Twitter can continue on.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.720]   And monetize, but it may be, it's not, you know, maybe it was overhyped.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:10.480]   Or maybe this talk doesn't really do.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:10.800]   Yes.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.160]   It's a story about, uh, Loon, Google Loon.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.280]   All right.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.400]   Not doing its own thing, but now instead of least,
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.240]   leasing their balloons to the telcos.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:27.440]   I was depressed by that because I was hoping that Google could provide, um,
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:32.400]   Uber Earth competition to those said phone companies.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.000]   A lot of this comes from, um, uh, Astro teller.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.120]   Great.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.160]   Do you know Astro, Matt?
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.280]   A little bit.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.800]   He's a great guy.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.800]   He is the head of a Google X.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:47.120]   The Google moon shots and Loon is one of the moon shots.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:52.000]   And I guess he was speaking at TechCrunch disrupt about Google X.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.360]   Well, and there's a, there's a lot of interesting parts in here.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.840]   Now bear in mind that I don't, you know, have any idea what the Loon folks are actually,
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.400]   you know, pursuing, you know, on a day to day basis, but, you know, it might make sense.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.440]   If you can cooperate with some telcos, then you can test out the systems, see how it works.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.920]   You know, we're on the navigation of the Bloons, you know, see how long you can hover over a given
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.080]   place or a country or something like that.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.480]   And if you've got seven problems to solve and working with someone takes one of those
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.000]   problems off so that you can move a little faster, I think that sounds great.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.280]   And then if down the road, someone magically, you know, all the FCCs of the world agree on a,
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.400]   on a one communication spectrum that's open that everybody could use,
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.320]   then you could still explore that down the road.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:39.120]   But just to my uneducated eyes, not knowing anything inside details,
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.840]   it seems like it's a good way to jumpstart and move a little bit faster.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:45.600]   So it's not like they want to give Loon to the telcos.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.520]   It's just that you, well, for Loon to work, Loon is stratospheric balloons.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.440]   They're a, they're almost in space.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:57.040]   They're above even the weather that a bit that you bounce internet access off of to provide
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.880]   internet access to, to places you can't get wires to.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.280]   You got to have the internet access coming from somewhere.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:07.040]   It's going to, I mean, unless Google wants to build base stations all over the globe,
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:13.360]   but it makes sense to use telcos and, and others who have the access to provide the connection.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.160]   Certainly for testing, I don't think that means anything.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.760]   Don't be depressed, Jeff, it's okay.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.120]   I'm happy now.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.280]   It's part of the prog process.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.600]   I have the, the mat cuts balm on my anxiety.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.520]   Well, and it does seem like they could reverse at any time, right?
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.320]   They could decide to solve that problem.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.960]   Well, and here's the good news. He also said that they are not going to do jetpacks.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.880]   That was disappointing.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.720]   Yeah. Well, they considered it, but they were loud.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.360]   It was louder than having a Harley motorcycle on your back.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.280]   And that seemed like a good experience.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.720]   Well, you know, it's a story to be done.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.520]   Google people, Google jetpacks are going to fly over your backyard.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.600]   They're going to see everything you see as a privacy violin.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:55.840]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:00.400]   I think it's that you're going to crash into the Amazon drones and it's going to be a nightmare.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.520]   Falling, burning death, falling from the sky.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.960]   So Jeff, just back to Loon for one second.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.520]   I'll give you one more piece of balm that make, make you feel better.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:14.080]   If they're actually working and talking to telcos and talking about cooperating with them,
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.200]   to me that says, hey, Loon is still a very high priority.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.160]   People are exploring it.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.760]   They're seeing how far they could go.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:25.360]   It's much more of a concrete thing than let's see if we can get 100 balloons to stay afloat for so long.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.240]   So I, I take that as a good sign in that direction as well.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.760]   There's also a really good quote in here.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:35.280]   Apparently, we thought this is a quote from master.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.720]   We thought it was going to be an app.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:44.480]   We thought working with existing telcos and use their spectrum, buying harmonized spectrum
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.800]   was going to be absolutely critical to the project.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.560]   And we wanted to get it done before we launched.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.880]   They had worked for half a year to get the spectrum deal done and worked with a number of large
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.920]   countries companies.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.120]   I'm sorry to make it work.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.840]   Larry Page told the team, I love this quote.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.280]   You're going to hit a double.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.280]   That's not really interesting.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.560]   You're going to be really frustrated.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.000]   You're going to be really angry for a week, but then you'll get creative and you'll come up with a
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:06.480]   home run.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.640]   That's kind of an inspirational thing to say.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.200]   I love that.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.760]   And Teller does say, indeed, for a week afterwards, the team was angry and came up with something way
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.880]   better than just buying a small piece of harmonized spectrum.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.600]   Now they use a spectrum that's already exists in a given country.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.280]   So that's why you have to work with a telco.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.600]   But it's interesting because you'll only get the balloon while it passes over.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.640]   They don't stay still.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.400]   So it'll be the same balloon's passing over.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:35.040]   You got it for however long it's in the right above you in your airspace and then it moves on.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.480]   Well, I thought there was a mesh of them so that you would.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.240]   Right.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:40.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.680]   The idea is you have enough balloons afloat at any given time with some spacing between them
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.360]   such that you can do the handoff just like if you were in a car doing the handoff between
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.560]   cell phone towers or something.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.080]   And they get more bandwidth that way too because these guys have more bandwidth than Google could
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:54.400]   have gotten.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.080]   But right now, it's like all these things that they said.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:04.080]   Well, the latency, you know, the main thing to know is the latency going 12 miles is so
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:08.160]   much better than going up to an actual satellite like, you know, direct TV or something like that.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:08.320]   Right.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:12.720]   So, you know, it remains to be seen how much you can squeeze out engineering-wise.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.840]   But the nice thing is you're only going like 60,000 feet or something like that and not,
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.600]   you know, a hundred, you know, thousands and thousands of miles up.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.560]   Right.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.440]   We shouldn't do this to you, Matt, because I know you come on here as a private citizen.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.040]   You do not represent and speak for Google, but I got to ask you.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.280]   Google Plus.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.160]   Is it going to stick around?
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:40.400]   Oh, I thought there was a really good article about how, you know, Google Plus
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:47.120]   in a lot of ways was about trying to get identity situated and, you know, for a long time,
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:47.920]   you could come to Google.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.040]   You could search and we didn't know who you were, anything like that.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.000]   Only really with Gmail did we start to realize, you know what?
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.040]   It might be handy to understand who users are so that they can like log in and stuff.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.720]   And so we were always sort of behind.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.280]   We never had, you know, think about YouTube bought in 2006 and had a completely different
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.400]   identity system.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:11.840]   So I think what a lot of people overlook is one of the biggest strengths of Google Plus in my mind
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:17.440]   is it's caused Google to bring identity all under the same umbrella so that, you know,
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:22.640]   things are somewhat, you know, logical rather than just, okay, here's a silo out here in the
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.120]   wilderness that doesn't have any connection to Google whatsoever.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.440]   And I think it's been a huge success in that realm.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.600]   And I think Google needed to work on that.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.560]   And now I think we can sort of take a look around and figure out, okay, what's the next big thing
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.840]   that we need from Google Plus?
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.960]   Do we, you know, look at the web?
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.640]   Do we push within Google to make identity more strengthened?
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.600]   And I have no idea.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.920]   I don't really know what the plan is from that point of view.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.000]   But, you know, I love Google Plus. I use it a lot, especially internally.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.120]   There's a really thriving discussion on our Google Internet and intranet.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.720]   And so I hope that they keep it around and it's healthy for years and years to come.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.800]   Good. No, we feel the same.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.680]   Exactly.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.320]   The same way.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:00.800]   Absolutely.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:06.000]   And I don't look for Google Plus to become the mass culture hit that Twitter is.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.920]   That's one of the things that makes Twitter unpleasant.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.600]   But it's already bigger than Twitter in the people in the city.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.240]   Isn't that funny, huh?
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.360]   Well, and I think, I mean, here we are using Hangouts to do our radio show, right?
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.760]   And, you know, I think about photos.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.840]   So just getting identity right for those kinds of things is already
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.920]   much further than Google was before Google Plus.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.880]   Right. Yes.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.160]   That's a really good point, Matt.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.440]   If you did kind of an audit of what Google Plus has added
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.320]   and this notion of identity across services is added.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.880]   And really, we had a conversation last week about, about, you know,
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:42.320]   Facebook breaking up the app and Leo, you said that the brilliance of Google is that it's
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.880]   in number of different services and applications.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.600]   But what ties the platform it's really built on is, uh oh, our data.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.600]   But that's so it can serve us better.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.480]   And even little things, just like the authorship and on web pages and search results is such a
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.200]   big thing.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.040]   And even just, I mean, even Google now, as much as sometimes it does,
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.440]   it does creep me out how telepathic it is.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:09.520]   And the fact that I am signed in across my devices and Google now knows that I want to
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.360]   catch the new episode of, you know, the Good Life, you know, and now I know that.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.760]   I mean, I just, the services are so, are so smart now and that's because I'm signing in
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.760]   because I've created contacts because I've, you know, my content is, is travels across
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.600]   products and it was really the glue.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.920]   But where's the true believers?
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.680]   Doesn't that scare the hell out of everybody else?
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.880]   Isn't that exactly?
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.720]   Isn't that what exactly what people are worried about?
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.720]   I love it.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.440]   But if I go ahead and in fact, we had this discussion on Sunday on Twitch.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.320]   So this is good, isn't it?
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:45.040]   What is the nightmare scenario you're worried about that the ads will be targeted?
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.400]   Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.080]   You have to do the punch the monkey ads go back to 1999.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.360]   Yeah, you want to go back to those days?
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:51.840]   That's right.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.880]   Belly fat ads ever.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.400]   I don't need any belly fat ads.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.280]   I am perfect.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.800]   Well, I don't.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:02.800]   Did you see the article about the woman who conceived, she was pregnant and she decided that
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.280]   she didn't want to be tracked after she read that in the New York Times article about how target
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.120]   knew that this girl was pregnant before she had told her family.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:18.000]   I think it was Janet Vitezi who decided she was going to be under the radar about her
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.920]   pregnancy the entire time she used to be.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:25.760]   But the irony is she quit Google as a quote conscientious objector but uses Facebook.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:32.800]   Yeah, I have to admit, I read that article and it sounded like she had quit.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:37.040]   She said, "I got off Google two years ago when it changed their privacy policies."
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.280]   So this is what really kind of surprises me.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:44.560]   I'll say surprises because Google had 60 plus different privacy policies and that
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:49.680]   it doesn't make sense to have a whole bunch of silos and putting it towards one unified privacy
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:55.360]   policy is exactly what Apple and Facebook and a huge number of all these other companies do.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.720]   Like it's really correcting a historical artifact and to object to that and say,
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.080]   "Okay, Google by doing that."
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.520]   Oh my god, the universe of the company does.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.760]   So for me, Google now and all these things are hugely helpful and I understand if people don't
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.960]   want to use them or if they want to disable them and we should provide that functionality.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.920]   But for me, if the trigger is Google unified its privacy policies, well, I would rather have
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.960]   one to pay attention to than to have 60 different ones.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.920]   One for this product and one for Google Flight Search.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:30.720]   There's an unstated presumption in this article that they don't even have to examine this notion
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:36.000]   that whatever it is they're collecting this data for, it's bad. So they don't even have to examine that.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.720]   Which means that knowledge now becomes bad. It means that having a personal relationship
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.720]   with us becomes bad. And I yell at media companies for saying, "We don't know relationships.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.560]   We don't know who we serve. We treat everybody as a mass that's inherently insulting. We have to
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:53.200]   start to know people as individuals. But if this privacy that is goes too far, then that'll be seen
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.360]   as a bad thing." This is from an article in Think Progress. They said, "You said you
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:01.280]   quit Google products two years ago. What was the breaking point?" She said, "When Google knew I was
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:08.400]   engaged before anybody else, that did it for me." What? How did that happen? Well, Google reads
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:13.520]   your emails, reads your chats. It knows what you're searching for. It sees when you're sleeping and
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:20.240]   knows when you're awake. And the server is economically incentivized to remember. So what happened?
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.720]   She sent an email to somebody using the word "engage" and she saw an engagement ring add.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.440]   That's my guess. That's my guess. Yeah.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.960]   And so there's this answer for more phisation that's going on.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.040]   Exactly. I said, yes.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:39.280]   Yeah. But now I admit that even among our sophisticated audience, and I would say everybody watches
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:45.280]   this show and listens to it, these are among the most sophisticated users, there is very much this
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:51.200]   feeling that, "Oh, they're reading my email." Well, and I think that makes people who have something
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:56.560]   that they want, tied uncomfortable. And there's legitimate times when there is something that
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.560]   you want to hide. If you don't want people to know that you're pregnant, I live with a big secret
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:05.600]   before I came out of the closet that was really scary and I lived in constant fear of other people
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:13.040]   knowing. So if Google now was selling me two bride gate toppers before I came out of the closet,
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.240]   that would have freaked me out. Yeah, except it wouldn't have been meaningful because no one
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.800]   human knew it. It's just that there was a correlation between a keyword and an ad.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:26.400]   The Google products, I mean, good products, good digital products, it kind of anthropized
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.120]   themselves, right? They're friendly voice. That's a good point.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:35.200]   I mean, you know, so I'm just, I'm not, I'm not, I just am empathetic to both sides here. Like,
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:40.080]   I really, really see both sides here and I'm split on this a lot and I'm trying to offer the other
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.880]   side of the point. Not to be asking. Let me ask you all a question. I'm not coming out,
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:49.680]   I think I mentioned last week to speak to the Google privacy group about 300 people in two weeks.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:56.880]   And what I want to say at first is that I think Google has to have the absolute best practices
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.480]   there are. And then I want to say in the second half, we've got to open up, we've got to change
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.720]   this discussion from having vaults, to having marketplaces open our stuff up. Let's stay with
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:10.240]   the first half. What would you define as best practices? What should Google do to bring trust
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.680]   and faith and recognize the value of doing these things?
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.880]   Well, let me, let me, let me make it more specific.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:28.080]   Okay. Would it be enough for you if Google said, well, look, we're never going to out you
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:34.640]   to a real person or an organization or in any meaningful way. All that will happen is if we
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:41.680]   will match a keyword in your email to advertising, but that no way outs you. And we promise never
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.120]   to give that information to anybody who is. It's up to the NSA and the FBI when they come with
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.720]   a little more. Yeah, there's going to be a fudge word because except for governmental.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:54.160]   Well, and so I'll throw out a couple, you know, quick ones, which are, you know,
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:59.120]   I think there ought to be encryption and it ought to be ubiquitous between you and whoever you're
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:04.080]   talking to so that someone can't spy in the middle. We ought to offer options like incognito
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.000]   mode all over the place so that people who want to opt out or they're doing a sensitive search.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.040]   But wouldn't that undermine your business model? Well, no, that's the thing.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.920]   I think if you have an option where you know, hey, you're doing something private, you can go in
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:22.080]   incognito, then anyone who is savvy enough to care can go and find that out and use that. But if
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.400]   people, the vast majority of people, you know, they've been studies that say they'll tell you
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.720]   their password for a chocolate bar, you know, if most people don't care, then there's definite
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:34.880]   value that can be given to the average person like Google now. Well, there was a rumor that
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:40.160]   Gmail might might encounter its encryption. I mean, that you could really could implement that
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:44.560]   beautifully. Right, right. I think that would be fantastic. In fact, Gmail tries by default to
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:50.720]   encrypt mail between Gmail and other providers. So think like that or make it easier to do PGP
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:55.040]   and encryption. And then a dashboard that shows you what you know and gives you the options to
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.480]   delete it. I think all those things are really good things. And you think Google might consider
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.760]   even doing that given that it costs money in effect. It says we're going to give up that
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:08.560]   opportunity to monetize it. Trust can be a real competitive advantage. Right, absolutely. And
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.360]   what I would argue is we actually do relatively good on things like we were some of the first
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:18.640]   to do encryption. We offered incognito mode, I think before maybe even IE released private browsing.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.760]   You know, there is a dashboard where you can look at your search history and all sorts of
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:27.040]   different stuff about you. But no matter what, it's interesting that Google gets raked over the
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:32.080]   coals for things like people say, oh, you're in bed with the NSA. Like, you know, this Al Jazeera
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:36.720]   article just came out that said, oh, Google is doing some special thing with the NSA. And then
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:43.280]   you read the article and Google CEO got invited to a security summit and he said, no. And that's
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:49.600]   that is literally all that was in that particular article. And exclusive emails revealed close
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:55.440]   Google relationships with NSA. Hi, nice talk to you. Thanks. But no, I can't do that.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:03.120]   Well, great. And to be clear, like, if if the NSA, you know, the NSA's job is both to, you know,
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:08.880]   spy for the US government, but also in theory to protect US corporations from being spied on.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:13.840]   And if in part of that mission, they were going to tell companies, you know, hey, here's this
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:18.080]   potential zero day or here's this potential hole, could you close it? Like that is a good
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.400]   communication. That is something you want every company to listen and hear, oh, you know, there
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:26.320]   might be, you know, hackers from a different country trying to exploit your service. That is
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.960]   the sort of thing that most people would be happy their tax dollars are going for. So funny,
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:35.120]   the article Schmidt was unable to attend the security meeting. But here's what he wrote,
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:40.320]   General Keith, so great to see you. I'm unlikely to be in California that week. So I'm sorry,
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.680]   I can't attend would love to see you another time. Thank you.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:53.120]   Smoking gun. It's probably it's probably a that guy, Eric has so many invitations and so many
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:58.480]   things. I would hope that he has a little enough social grace to say no politely.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.120]   I'm probably a memory key on this keyboard. Yeah, F9.
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:05.200]   Yeah, I'm really sorry, but I'm not going to be anywhere near you anywhere. I write that all the
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:10.160]   time. No, I can't. I'm not going to say no, I can't be in your stinking podcast. Say I'm very busy.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:17.520]   Very busy, but I look forward to seeing you. I don't want to get near you.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:25.760]   Well, and let me just say if the if a government agency was offering ways to secure Google services,
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.400]   you know, I think it's great if Google were to participate in that sort of form, as long as the
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.560]   communications were going one way towards the companies. Absolutely. And even you should talk.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.800]   You'd need to take it with a grain of salt, right? We now know that the NSA subverted
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:44.960]   NIST official documents for how to do encryption by proposing bad standards that they had a back
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.120]   door or they could crack more quickly. So no matter what, with any source, you're going to take it
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:53.680]   with a grain of salt. But in general, if someone is, you know, willing to provide you with potential
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.120]   feedback that it can prove your services, you want to listen to that. So Gina,
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:01.360]   give another part of that, Matt, isn't it also true that if Google knew there was a threat out there,
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:06.240]   it has a moral obligation to tell other tech companies and the government.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:12.240]   Well, and that happened with the heart bleed, but that somebody, you know, somebody noticed that
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:17.040]   and they were going through all the proper channels. And I think the news leaked earlier than it
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:21.360]   was expected to. So you didn't have time to alert everybody. And when you've got something that
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:26.560]   big, you can't alert everyone without the news leaking at some point. But I believe Google was
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:31.520]   going through all the right responsible disclosure procedures. So does that, Gina,
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:36.240]   make it, would that be enough to say, we'll give you encryption if you want it, we'll give you
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:41.040]   private browsing if you want it. We'll do the dashboard to let you take out anything that we
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:44.880]   think we know about you. That's one criticism. People have the current Google dashboard. It
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.200]   doesn't let you delete everything. I don't know if that's the case or not. Would that be enough, Gina?
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.400]   Yeah, I think that's a good start. I think it's a good start.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.480]   Let's say you were living in a country where you could be arrested for being gay. Oh, wait a minute.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:04.240]   I wouldn't use the internet. I mean, really, I would try my best. Yes, if there was a place where
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:08.560]   I could be harmed or killed or arrested or whatever, and there are those places. Yeah, I mean, I
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:13.280]   wouldn't be, I used Torah a whole lot. And I just, I wouldn't use the web. I mean, I would come up with
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.800]   code words and, you know, that's what people do, right? They come up with words and phrases that
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.400]   mean other things or whatever. I mean, I'd be really, really, really, really paranoid.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.720]   We're just using Torah alone as a signal, right?
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:26.560]   Well, right. I mean, and that was one of the points that Janet made. And her piece was like,
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.800]   you know, I use cat, I was, you know, using cash to buy baby things and missing out on discounts
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.520]   that you get with those cards at Target or whatever. And whatever. And I was using Torah. And, and
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:42.080]   just the fact that I was using those things was, you know, made me look weird. I mean, you know,
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:47.040]   made me a target alone, just the fact that I was using privacy tools. You know, I thought
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.800]   another interesting point that she made is that she asked her friends and family when she called
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.480]   them or talked to them in person and said, Hey, I'm pregnant. She asked them not to post it on
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:59.920]   Facebook. And so they wouldn't post to her wall, but they would Facebook message her about being
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:04.160]   pregnant. And she said, Hey, you know, I said not to put this on Facebook. And they're like, Oh,
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:08.320]   no, but I'm, you know, that's why I didn't put it on your wall. So they're so regular users
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:13.920]   conception of putting it on Facebook was the wall. But that private message, Facebook messages was
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:18.320]   like, seemed like a private channel to them. Or as I think that this is just a, you know,
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:24.640]   a perception, a misconception that people have, you know, the idea that, you know, Gmail is, is
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.000]   private or that, you know, Facebook or Google doesn't have, you know, Google doesn't have access to
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.880]   your Gmail is, is absolutely not true. So there's an education aspect around it as well.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:40.080]   I love it that by the way that I read this article on Think Progress and get a pop up that says,
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:46.880]   like Think Progress on Facebook. Share this on Google+, I do, I get all of that.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:51.680]   Put this on Twitter. And to be fair, I mean, let's, I don't think it's fair to beat up
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:56.560]   Gino on this because I think she's absolutely right in that she is channeling a large percentage
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:03.520]   of people who feel that way. And, and to be fair, like, there's a large chunk of people who have
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:09.200]   been surprised by the revelations about the NSA in the last year and are, are concerned with
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:14.160]   validity. And, you know, if you haven't been someone who's been paying deep, detailed attention
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:18.560]   to like, Oh, when did Google roll out? It's encryption and all that sort of stuff. Then it's,
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:23.120]   you know, a relatively understandable strategy to be like, you know, okay, I'm concerned about
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:28.400]   Google and I'm just going to put that in a box. And, you know, I'll act accordingly. And if people
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.920]   want to dig all the way in, then they can find out we've, you know, fought against the Department
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:36.240]   of Justice subpoenas that were very broad and stuff like that. But it's natural that given
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:41.040]   some of the news over the last year, you know, people would, would be worried and how we address
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.440]   that and tackle that and educate it and how we respond to it and what we do better. You know,
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:49.040]   it is a, is a very fair question and something we need to think about. We're going to take a break
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:54.240]   when we come back. The change log will put Gina to work with all the new changes quite a bit
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.120]   going on this week. Yeah. With the Google, our show today brought to you by Zip recruiter. If

[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.720]   for Chad. Jason, do you know where the trumpets are kept? Oh, I got this.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:36.560]   I'm awaiting a full episode to do that. She's an interfan. She has the latest from Google.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:42.880]   A bunch of new cards and improvements to Google now coming out this week. First,
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:48.160]   Google now now works offline. So if you don't have an internet connection, you'll still see your
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:52.800]   Google now cards, your appointments and and all the other reminders. And at the top,
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:58.960]   it'll show you when was last time this was this was updated. That's great. Indoor maps and mall
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:04.800]   directories are now in Google now for Android. So if you go to the mall, you'll be able to find
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:12.160]   where that store is located. What floor and which way you got to go. And related to that,
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:17.280]   if you search for a product on Google, you're looking for a pair of boots or crib or a stroller.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:23.680]   Talk about telepathy. Google will now let you know if the product you search for, if you're near a
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:29.200]   store, if it's in the store, if the product you search by is is near is nearby. And where the deals
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.560]   are? That's valuable to me. That's what Schmidt was talking about when he said you'd be walking
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:37.920]   on the street and say, Oh, you need pants? They're right there. It's that is pretty. I mean, it's
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:43.280]   useful. And I don't think it comes at the cost of any real personal information.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:50.080]   You know, those programmatic ads that come after you if you looked at a canoe on Amazon to follow
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.920]   you around for three weeks. My fear is if I just happen to look at one thing, it's going to be
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:58.640]   constantly telling me you're near a radio shack. They have phones. They got phones. The phones
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:03.520]   here. We with from experience, we know that Google now is very easy to say. I don't want to know
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:07.760]   this anymore. Like for instance, I searched for Jeopardy once, the TV show. And for a while,
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:14.160]   I was saying Jeopardy is on and I don't really care. So I but you go in and you change
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.600]   it and you says it. There's literally says, I don't care about Jeopardy and it goes, okay, fine.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:23.120]   Yeah, you get that is this useful? Is this card still right now? And you can just say yes or no,
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.080]   or you can just swipe and I'll say, okay, done for now. Good, good to go.
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:33.360]   It's it's doesn't feel. I love now. I love now. I want to be a I want let me be clear here.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:36.080]   I want more now cards. I want more now. Me too.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:45.600]   By the way, see it says interested in Jeopardy episodes? No, no interested in community. This
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:50.640]   was the weird one for a while. I don't know why it was telling me random people's commute updates.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:56.640]   And I don't know what it says. Are you interested in community commute updates for Dennis Appleton
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:02.720]   Nielsen? I don't know why I don't know who this guy is. He must be in my circles.
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:07.120]   Maybe yeah, maybe they've turned on commute sharing with you. And this is like your way of
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:10.400]   accepting it. I have no idea. So yeah, there's commute sharing.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.160]   Yeah. It's one of the stupidest features of ways is that I really don't care
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:19.120]   when Joe Schmoe starts driving. But you know what? You might care what your wife's commute is.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:23.200]   Like if your wife's coming home from work and you want to know when to put the Brussels sprouts
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:28.640]   on. That's exactly how I how I did for Brussels sprouts. Yeah, because God, you cannot go
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:33.200]   those things away then and pick up my own dinner on the way home because Brussels sprouts are a
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:42.560]   nuclear accident. They need a Google now card that says time to put Brussels sprouts. If you're
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:47.280]   cooking Brussels sprouts tonight, you should put them on now. You should go off at seven a.m. Yeah.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:54.080]   Start cooking now. Well, you know, you got Brussels sprouts delivered by Google delivery yesterday.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:58.320]   Are they going bad in three days? Ergo, you need to put them down. That's the trick on this. There's
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.360]   a lot of things that would be useful. They need to, you know, I think they're going to need to come
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:06.560]   with a better way of managing the signals you send Google now as they get more and more signals in
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:12.720]   here. I mean, already I've got 16 different items in my everything else category. Well,
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.240]   including Leo, sometimes I want to send them more signals. I want to choose. This is something
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:22.080]   that I'm actually looking for. I'm looking for this kind of shoe. And then I not only do I want
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.920]   Google now to tell me, but I want I want I do what the merchants to compete for my business and say,
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:30.720]   here's the best deals. Right. And Google could be this is the opposite of the privacy discussion.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:36.640]   I think that Google could be a conduit for signal sharing in a wider market.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.080]   It's all about control. Just give me this. Well, that's what they I mean,
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:44.000]   similar to what they do with TV shows. Now, if you search for TV show, it'll say, remind me of
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.360]   new episodes and you can say yes or not. And it seems like products could be kind of implemented
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:53.200]   a similar way. The thing about Google now, we were just talking about this last night, which
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.320]   Jason and I were talking about it last night on all about Android is how it's kind of like
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.440]   consuming you know, subsumers superseding all these like little apps, you know, the remembering
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:07.360]   where you're parked and you know what you show you. I mean, it's it's it's wonderful. This is all
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.640]   in one place. And it's just like key, you know, piece of UI that's part of my phone. I mean,
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.760]   literally, I look at Google now, first thing in the morning, and you know, before I go to bed at
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:19.760]   night, I look at, you know, weather and whatever. But it is kind of, you know, you're not going to
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:23.680]   these other apps to do to do these things, right? Which is kind of nice because it opens up any
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:28.400]   developers to work on other things, but also not so great if you made a parking app, right?
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:33.440]   But it's interesting to see Google now sort of gobble up that functionality and just
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:37.200]   present it all in this one interface that you know, we're going to see on our watches and on our,
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:42.080]   you know, eye glasses and whatever else. I would honestly be happy if I could just,
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.440]   you know, sometimes Google now is like, do you want to use your corp account or your personal
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:50.400]   account? And I'm like, oh, yes, yes, I am me. I have all these accounts. Hey, you know,
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:58.000]   all the more the good. Listen, you're the all powerful wizard bat cuts. You got into I.O.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:04.400]   Okay, you have proven your power on earth. You once and for all solve this problem. I want Google
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:10.240]   smart. Damn it. I have two accounts. I'm the same person. Google, can I just tell you that I'm the
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:16.560]   same person? I just, I mean, nuts. Yeah, I agree. And every time I've heard you complain about
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:21.520]   Google now, I'm off on a run. And I'm like, there's something wrong with Google apps for
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:28.640]   domains and it's on the wrong account. And I think personally, it shows that Google
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:32.400]   historically has been like, you tell us what you want. We'll give you the answer. And we haven't
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:36.640]   really had that great of account functionality. And Google plus and all that stuff has gotten
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:41.760]   us a lot further. But it's still like, yep, you can have, we have both kinds of country,
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:46.640]   both kinds of music country and Western, but I like country Western, you know, show me just a hard
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:52.400]   problem. I understand. I know it's amazing. How will you? Don't be a nice guy. Don't let them
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:58.560]   off. They can figure this out. Yeah, I agree. And you know, you ought to have capabilities if
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:02.560]   you work at Google and that's your core pick out. And then when you leave Google, you ought to lose
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:06.560]   those capabilities, but it shouldn't be the end of the world. Yeah, you shouldn't lose your search
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:11.200]   history or whatever. So I wish I had those capabilities. I think this is a powerful
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:16.000]   capability. I just searched for a TV show and in the knowledge graph or whatever you guys can't
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.160]   remember the card that comes up on the right. Remind me about new episodes, I can click that and
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:25.200]   that'll just show up in Google now. That's a really nice and it's and it's not turned on unless I
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:29.040]   turn it on. And it's great for upcoming movies. Like, Oh, yeah, I really want to see the new Hunger
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.800]   Games movie when it comes out. Just tell me, you know, because I don't have a baby on gets paid
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:38.080]   attention anymore. Yeah, that's really great. By the way, do you watch open black Leo? I do. I
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:44.240]   love it. Really good. I don't have time to watch all the good TV down. All of a sudden TV got really
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:50.800]   good. Yeah. Yeah, Sunday nights are jam packed. Soon I will be able to download those shows onto
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:58.000]   my Chromebook Pixel on my beautiful clear screen. And then Leo can watch Big Bang Theory.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:09.600]   All right, before we get to the Big Bang Theory conversation again, let me carry on with the
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:14.320]   teams who have been listening. See, I told you Google knows too much about you.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:19.360]   Yeah, sometimes he's watching the show Leo. That is big data.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:29.840]   Google Maps got a huge big update rolling out now on Android Lane guidance tells you which lane
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:34.880]   you should be in before you make that turn. Why didn't other things do that? I just it's so obvious.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:38.880]   Getting a left lane now you're going to be turning left. The lane I should be for the Bay Bridge is
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:44.160]   the one that gets me off before the bridge because I'm scared of it. I know. Well, for all of us,
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:48.640]   because there is that particular on ramp, if you get on that, you can't get off. You're going
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:56.400]   to Oakland. Yeah. You can do that. You can now save maps to use offline. So are you going camping?
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:01.520]   You have some place not a lot of connectivity. You can save maps for offline use. You got better
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:08.240]   filters for finding businesses when you need them. So, you know, what is that bar open or shut now,
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:13.840]   open or closed right now. And this is really interesting. Uber app integration will compare
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:19.120]   transit and walking directions with Uber access in cities where Uber supported and only if you have
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:23.680]   the Uber app installed. Oh, you have to have the Uber app installed. Yeah, but fascinating that
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:31.280]   Uber has a an in an official position here. Yeah. Why Uber? Why not Lyft? Why not? I don't why Uber?
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:35.360]   And Google did invest in Uber. So they're going to go through that. Oh, okay. Well, there you go.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:41.600]   Google ventures. 100 more than 150 million, I think, into Uber. Really, really interesting.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:47.120]   A little weird. I thought the Uber and her integration there, but everybody loves Uber. So,
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:52.000]   well, not the taxi commission in New York, LA San Francisco.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:01.600]   Finally, Google Shopping Express came to Manhattan and West Los Angeles this week. And in fact,
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:06.560]   I was at the think up office on Monday, and I decided to try it out. And it was great. I loved it.
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:11.360]   I ordered up some snacks for the for the office and they got super overloaded the first day in
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:15.360]   Manhattan. So I didn't get a delivery time on Monday, but it came the next day. But the whole
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:20.080]   idea is that you can order stuff and get same way delivery from major retailers,
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:26.320]   Target, fairway, etc. First orders get 10 bucks off. That was a nice discount. And
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:32.240]   Google's also offering, I think it's a six month free subscription for unlimited free deliveries.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:36.560]   So really nice. It's not in Brooklyn yet, but it's coming to Brooklyn and Queen soon. So,
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:40.480]   I'm excited to impress my wife with that when that happens.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:46.800]   Dipers. Dipers of the girl. Well, you know, we do we do Amazon mom. We have like a, you know,
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:51.280]   it's basically Amazon Prime, but like a subs a subs a subs a subscribe and save, which is like
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:55.520]   send us three boxes of diapers every couple months. Yeah, which is fantastic. I love
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:00.080]   some crimes automatically. No, what's that? They don't up the size.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:05.280]   I don't have the size. In fact, I got a bunch of boxes that were too small because my daughter
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:11.760]   is growing like a weed. But yeah, I mean, especially ever since we had a baby, I realized how much we
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:16.400]   just have this parade of delivery people coming our door because we just don't have the time to go
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:22.240]   shopping as much. So I think this is good, really good business for for Google. And it'll be interesting
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:27.360]   to see how they stack up, you know, against Amazon. You saw the what was the dry goods play that
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:37.120]   Amazon's doing? It's you get for six bucks, you get a 45 pound box. Have you seen did you see that?
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:44.720]   I didn't. It's like a partner to it's called prime box. I can't remember off to search for it.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:51.600]   It's kind of Amazon Prime. My pantry pantry. Thank you very good Jason.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:58.960]   How long for the win on the draw? Six bucks, 45 pound box. And it's basically groceries,
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:04.560]   it's grocery shopping. Wow, why are you like that? There you go. Yeah.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:11.440]   They Amazon, it's good. Let them battle. That's good. Let the let the plavals begin.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:19.840]   Safe way get in there and everybody else. Come on. I mean, I think there's going to be a crash of
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:27.760]   retail real estate in this country. Yeah, I'd hate to be in a brick and mortar store at this.
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:33.920]   Oh, it's a little scary. But shopping express actually, I mean, it is local retail. I mean,
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:38.480]   from I can tell it's like a guy in a cap with a truck that runs. It goes to the target for you
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:42.880]   and brings it to you. Right. And they bought all those old Cosmo bicycles that were lying around
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:48.400]   with the big baskets, I hope. Grocery stores used to do that. There used to be a milkman.
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.680]   You're too young to remember this, but the milkman come here.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:55.680]   In the East Coast, Leo, a chip delivery guy, Charlie's chips,
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:00.560]   Charlie's chips with the repressals and chips. The chip fans here.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:08.240]   Véznet, I have the friend. I have Union County booked up. I've got every pretzel there is.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:12.720]   I remember that you had to remember the night before. I think it was Tuesday night,
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:18.800]   you had to put the milk delivery out and the empties in the box. And then the milkman
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:22.480]   had come and he put the milk and then they knew they were in trouble when they started selling
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:38.480]   milk shampoo. That was like, oh, that doesn't seem like a good thing. Sorry. That's all I got.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:41.040]   That was ladies and gentlemen. Now, Jason, you know where the temp's?
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:42.960]   Oh, yeah. Bring it to Japanese.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:52.640]   Oh, Gina's got started.
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:59.760]   You know what, Gina, you might as well throw in the Google camera update that hit today.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:04.640]   Is there an update? There's an update that allows you to take pictures while you're shooting video.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:09.360]   So they added. Oh, that's like a Zoey a little bit. Well, no, no, no. So you're shooting a video
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:13.200]   and you can actually also take pictures. You tap it. I tap it. So wow.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:17.680]   But that was unintentional. Sorry about that. Thank you, Jason.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:24.240]   Leo, I have to go in five minutes. But what? Sure, I got it. I told you to 15. You told me?
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:29.760]   When did you tell me that? That's okay. You can go anytime you want.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:34.480]   I just want to make sure before I leave that that there's a whole mess of new
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:42.000]   Chromebooks coming out. Yeah. Hey, it's Intel's doing some. It tells to a lot of them. They didn't
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.040]   announcement. So I complained about ACE or not having enough new Chromebooks because I was wrong
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:51.200]   because they have two more new ones down. Yeah. So I feel bad now because I'm starting to come
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:59.520]   around on the Chromebook thing. I wouldn't buy one. But I wouldn't buy one, but I think I
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:05.360]   understand why a school would. Yeah. Oh, it's phenomenal for schools. Yeah. I shock even Googlers.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:09.840]   I've been I've been in the room with Googlers and I point out mother not pixels, my only machine.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:16.160]   Even they look at me funny. I've been using pr pixel is my primary for almost a year now. So
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:22.080]   yeah, yes. No one go that far. I think that's crazy talk. But more and more and more we get calls
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:27.040]   like on the radio show from people I had a call. Oh, I felt so bad for very nice person.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.400]   Just couldn't you know, Windows eight was not updating and she couldn't she didn't it was clear.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:39.520]   She had no idea what a computer did or anything, but she had to have one, right? You have to have
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:43.920]   one. I said, what do you do? She said, well, I do some email and I you know, we surf and my
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:49.840]   my husband balances the checkbook. And I more and more I'm saying to normal people, you don't
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:54.240]   need the complexity of a computer. Right. You need a Chromebook. I mean, there are other people
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:59.200]   like me who need the complexity of a computer and can handle it. But also things like my parents
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:05.840]   and and viruses. Mm hmm. That's gone. She couldn't figure out how to turn the thing off.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:13.200]   Swiss series. And you know, it's not easy in Windows eight. And she said, I the guy told me to
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:23.520]   press the moon button. That's it. That's all she knew. So Chromebook would be but it's hard. But
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.120]   this is the problem. And I think Microsoft's responding to this by making Chromebook like
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:32.640]   I think they're make Chromebook like Windows machines. But the the problem is that people say,
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:38.160]   Oh, well, no, a computer equals Windows. That that's those are the same. It's a personal computer.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:42.960]   It runs Windows. And so it's hard to convince them that a tablet will work in many cases.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:47.120]   Maybe they do need a keyboard or if not a tablet in a Chromebook. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:54.240]   Yeah. A new Chrome desktop machine. Yeah. Having Intel inside helps. Yeah. I think it does. Yeah.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.320]   And there's after 11 hours on some machines. The thing is the pixel to me is the perfect
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:04.960]   combination. Good screen, touch screen, uh, and LTE on it. It's way too expensive.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:10.320]   Yeah. It's to demonstrate the idea. And if you were to get a Haswell chip in there,
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:14.960]   so the battery lasts a little longer. Oh, oh, my God. With that. Oh, Matt. All right. So,
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.880]   so going back to the power of Matt, you got Chita in the aisle. You're going to fix this identity
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:23.360]   thing. You're going to make sure that I'm about with the next generation Chromebook. Okay. Pixel.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:28.880]   All right. I promise I've been asking for Haswell Chromebooks like as soon as they came out.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.360]   I got the sense that that's not a product. The the pixel is not really a product. It's just
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:38.640]   was a process. I love this thing. And I would buy that in a second. Me too.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.160]   A reference device. I like that Matt has a honeydew list now.
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.600]   Now next time Matt, you're up there with Larry and Sergey. Would you do me a favor?
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:55.600]   I'll just put it on the Twiggy do list. Yes. I got to go. All right. Thank you, Jeff. Give

[01:05:54.640 --> 01:06:03.120]   web search results. Great to have you see his video. I got it. So the best thing that he does is the
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:08.400]   webmaster tools. It's Google dot com slash not the best thing, but the thing the public facing
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:13.920]   thing you do that we love. You probably do very important things that we don't know about. Right?
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:19.440]   In my mind, Matt is like rocky like that, like because you're always running while you're listening
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:24.880]   into it. It's always like I think about the rocky stuff. I love it. I love it.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:33.200]   He posted, let me see if I can find this. This was, you got a lot of attention for this, even though,
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:41.360]   frankly, I think most SEO types should know by now that the body is the most important part of
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:46.320]   your content, not the those meta tags. People still do that and the meta tags and the header and
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:54.080]   all that stuff. Yeah, you think it's kind of amazing. So, but you know what, I think your most recent
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:59.920]   video really gets that point across. With a quick public service reminder, I just wanted you to
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:05.520]   remember that it's important to pay attention to the head of a document, but you should also pay
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:09.440]   attention to the body. Shouldn't your head be missing and only your body be there? I just
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:14.320]   description meta tags, all that sort of stuff. So what are you wearing? He said he's wearing a
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:21.840]   green suit. Yeah, I do have a green screen suit that I use such occasions, you know, for Halloween
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:26.160]   and that kind of stuff. That is awesome. Do you have a head piece too if you wanted to be completely
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:33.920]   invisible? Yeah, it was actually flipped over on the back. So I can go visit Microsoft. And by the
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:40.000]   way, I think that's a pixel. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, everyone's in a handle show up. I can't stop
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.920]   talking with my hands. You'll see invisibility go in front of my my face every so often. I love this
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.880]   and he's got a pixel in front of him, by the way. I think we noticed that Google.com/webmasters.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:53.440]   It really if I can't believe that there'd be anybody who wouldn't know this. Yeah,
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:08:00.160]   probably are. Well, there are people who literally believe in a meta tag called the Google Pray
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:05.680]   meta tag. What? I mean, it is you it's a joke. You know, so many made it up. But if it gets
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:09.520]   repeated enough online, people like, Oh, did you add your Google Pray meta tag? And it's like,
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:17.200]   Google Pray make me number one or something like like pray like prayer. Yeah. So not pray like,
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:22.960]   like, like hunted. No, no, no, not like hunted. No, so there's a lot of misconceptions to debunk.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:27.040]   Some people still think we use meta keywords for web ranking. And we just don't. We really don't.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:35.280]   Here it is. Here's an article on the Google Pray meta tag. Google Pray. Google, please rate me
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:45.040]   high by keyword UMAX search. Oh, he put it. That is that the weirdest thing that you've ever seen?
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:50.000]   People. No, not even close. I mean, there's a whole church of Google. I mean, it's crazy. So.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:57.920]   Is the church of Google populated by SEOs? No, no, it was it was a few years ago. I think it's
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:06.400]   died off. We worship you. Oh, church. Yeah, the church of Google.org. It's the it's the home of
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:14.320]   Googleism. Yeah. Wow. Of course, it says join us on Reddit. So there may be a little confused.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:20.000]   We at the church of Google believe the search engine Google is the closest human kind
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.080]   has ever come to directly experiencing an actual God. Wow. You can tell that's from a few years ago.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:35.040]   Yeah. Yeah. So give me an example of something else crazy people have done to get number one on Google.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:41.840]   Well, people try all kinds of tricks. They're convinced if you buy ads, you'll rank number one.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:45.760]   And then there's other competing theories that say if you buy ads, we'll demote you.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.880]   And you just want to get all those conspiracy theorists in a room and let them fight it out
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:53.280]   and like, OK, you guys decide and then whoever comes out, we'll debunk that misconception.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.440]   Because there's so many. There really is. Here's the prayer. By the way, you should put this.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.960]   I have heard if you put this in your meta tag, all your hopes and prayers will be realized.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:07.120]   Yeah. Our Google who art in cyberspace hallowed be thy domain.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:17.280]   Thy search to come thy results be done on 127.0.0.1 as it is in the Googleplex. Give us this day,
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:23.680]   our daily searches and forgive us are spam as we forgive those who spam against us and lead us,
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:29.280]   not into temptation, but deliver us from Microsoft for thine is the search engine and the power and
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:38.720]   the glory forever and ever. Amen. And there it is in binary. But the weird thing is there are
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:43.440]   people who are literally creating new misconceptions. So I don't know if you saw last week, there was
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:49.600]   somebody who claimed to be a former Google employee in AdSense and you read through it and you're like,
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:55.840]   there's no way this person worked for Google. Every single thing about it is wrong. The terminology
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:00.160]   is wrong. None of the terms make sense. You double check with the ads team and they're like,
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:05.120]   we don't have any color coding scheme the way they imply. If you're a real employee,
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:09.680]   it's not hard to prove that you used to be an employee. You could say, hey, Charlie's cafe,
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:13.600]   that electric door on the left, it sticks a little bit. That would do it enough to prove it.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:18.800]   Yet this paste bin anonymous thing is like Google is trying to cut off publishers to save
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:23.200]   the money for itself. Well, we actually refund that money to publishers. So you've got some weird
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.800]   people who are just like, okay, I'm disgruntled. I'm unhappy with one part of Google. So I'm going
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:31.120]   to lie and say I used to work there. And here's all these things that people who don't know better
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:36.640]   might believe. It's weird. A couple of three actually Google acquisitions, little ones,
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:44.480]   a Domitry, an online attribution firm. I don't know what a Domitry does. I don't even know how
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:51.040]   to say it, but Google has acquired them to give advertisers a better sense of how their online
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:12:01.520]   ad campaigns are working. It's an ad metrics play. Stackdriver and cloud analysis tool.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:10.000]   But my favorite is Apatas or Apatas. If Google can bring better restaurant websites to the world,
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.600]   that's good work right there. Beautiful website restaurant. So it's a provider that does
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:23.200]   website restaurant, restaurants websites, integrating Grubhub, open table,
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:33.040]   Apatas. No more flash. Apatas. No more. Yeah. Images instead of text.
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:41.280]   So it's like a square space for restaurants. Yeah, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of, you know what,
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.800]   somebody's got to do this for radio stations. I think somebody did and but whoever it is has no
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:51.440]   taste. I've never seen more ugly websites than radio station websites. They're the worst.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:57.120]   Yeah. It's like a black background. It's really bad. Oh, and like, and well, I guess because radio
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:03.600]   stations have so many ads, they're all they're all jingly. And I shouldn't pick on this station.
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:08.000]   I just entered in some magic call sign and I found this. This is a very typical radio station
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:18.240]   website that you find the content. Good luck. Yeah. I mean, they're all horrible. I hope this
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:28.400]   is not one of my affiliates. But these guys could do a better job. You know what I'm saying?
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:33.520]   So you could go back to the head and body thing though briefly. We just enabled
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:39.760]   Twitter cards and like the OG, the meta tags and the OG, the open graph tags for sharing
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:44.240]   content on like on different social networks on Google plus on Facebook and Twitter cards in
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:50.880]   particular. And it was really the first time I've looked at the head of think-ups pages in a really
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.280]   long time because it seems obvious that it's the content that really matters. But I think
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:02.240]   people saw that those sharing hooks, that little snippet that you see with the image and whatever
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.960]   other metadata you see like in a shared social post that has to help a little bit. I mean,
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:13.920]   I like to think that Google's crawlers are getting decent data from those head tags just
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.600]   because you know people are hooking out sharing. You don't want to throw it out, right? I mean,
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:24.480]   yeah, yeah. So in fact, if you do a search for Google Webmaster Meta tags, there's an official
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:28.960]   document that says Meta tags that Google understands and we go through that in more detail. The main
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.680]   one is everybody thinks that if I throw some keywords in the meta keywords tag, that's going
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:38.560]   to help. And that doesn't help. So if we could just shift that focus to like, you know, using
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:43.760]   schema.org or some of these, you know, other ways of describing what you can or can't share or
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:48.000]   what's on the page, that stuff could potentially be useful. It's just we don't use the keywords tag
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.280]   because it's been so span. But things like, well, really, really, well, equals author, those are
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:59.680]   that's a really useful thing. Yeah, I mean, I use that. Yeah, yeah, real what? Real canonical.
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:04.240]   So you can say this URL is here, but it should be over here. And that gives Google a great hint
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:10.080]   to say show this URL instead. And again, this is all described. All of these are described at
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:19.120]   the webmaster's tools page. So here's the canonical URL explanation. This is this is you would think
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:23.440]   everybody would know this. Yeah. And actually, here's the here's the page Meta tags Google
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:30.160]   understands with Matt cuts many moons ago. That is a that is a very young and somewhat larger
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:36.400]   Matt cuts. I didn't have gray hair back then. You know, you're lucky though, when your videos,
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:42.160]   you look fatter in your old videos. That's good. That's what you want. The directional trend is
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:47.120]   the right direction. I look so much thinner in my old videos. It's very depressing. I don't care
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:53.200]   about hair color. You always want to look fatter in the old videos. That's why I only do head and
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:16:02.160]   shoulders here. You're smart. There is no record of any of this. So I don't know whether to believe
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:07.840]   this or not. This was quite a scandalous article in all things on the digits blog in the W.
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:12.720]   I almost did all things D and the digits blog in the Wall Street Journal. The Google glass
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:22.400]   parts estimated to cost what less than 80 bucks for a $1,500 product. This is from tech insights
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:29.600]   teardown.com. Google has said that's absolutely nuts, but they didn't say how much it does cost.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:34.160]   I know you don't know because you didn't build glass mat cuts. I'm not asking you.
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:39.680]   But boy, if that's the case, now some have said, well, we want to Google plastic glass.
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:46.720]   Somebody said we want to Google glass to cost a painful amount so that people will be serious
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:51.280]   about buying it. If you want to be the explorer, we know the Explorer edition's price was pumped
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:56.320]   up a bit, but that's more than a bit. I hope it's not $1,420 a bit.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:02.160]   There's no way. There's no way. That would be. Well, and I'm sure that they say, oh, this is,
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:07.040]   you know, 20 cents worth of plastic, but if you're doing a small limited run doing the injection,
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.880]   molding or whatever the plastic, that's actually a pretty large cost to do it. They say the most
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:18.800]   expensive component is the processor, the TI OMAP 4430 applications processor. That's an ARM chip,
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:29.200]   $13.96, 16 gigs of NAND memory from Toshiba, $8. But you're right. That doesn't take into account
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:34.320]   R&D. That doesn't take into account custom stuff, molds and so forth.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:39.840]   Actually, this could be good news. If you were hoping for a consumer release of glass,
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:44.640]   it means if this is, maybe when they did, maybe it does cost 80 bucks. If you made a million of them,
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:49.920]   that could be good news, right? Yeah, in which case glass might be affordable, which I mean,
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:53.680]   you know, that would be a good thing when it comes out publicly.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:18:02.000]   Do we care about four squared separating its, you know, it's a funny thing.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.880]   On the Yelp, when the Yelp pushed the update, it said we're working really hard to keep all of
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:11.360]   our stuff in one app. Obviously, a little bit of a, several.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:15.840]   I think the trend is worth commenting on. And we actually talked about it in last week's episode.
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:20.480]   It's interesting to see this sort of modeling. So we have four square splitting its app into a
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:26.240]   check in app and then to a recommendations app. We see Dropbox making carousel. And what was the
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:29.840]   other one that Dropbox did? I thought that was another Dropbox app.
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.560]   I haven't noticed on this for a long time. Evernote has food and hello.
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.480]   Evernote food and hello. And even Google did it with drive.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:40.400]   Yeah, I don't really understand that one. That's kind of weird.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:44.800]   Yeah, it is a little weird. They took the editing capability out of drive.
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.200]   And put it into docs.
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:51.680]   Well, there's a sheet app and a docs app for editing and then drive for browsing her files.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:56.720]   My naive take on that is that when you say Google Drive, people think of some
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:00.480]   storage to store stuff. And so there might have been some mismatch where people were like,
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:04.320]   Oh, Google Docs, I can understand that. That's where I edit my docs. And so maybe they were trying
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.280]   to bring that more closely in line with users expectations or what they thought the app would do.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:13.200]   You know, if you're just looking at an icon and a name, you're like, Oh, okay, this is where I'll
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:19.440]   go to edit my Google Docs or J.C. Calhoun has created a new verb for this kind of thing.
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:25.280]   It's called quick string yourself. Because remember Netflix was going to divide itself up to streaming
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:29.920]   and disk business. And one of them was called Quickster, which didn't lie. That's not a positive
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:34.800]   association. Even Quickster. No, even Quickster. Quickster doesn't exist anymore. And of course,
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:39.040]   I didn't mention Facebook, separating out method. Facebook's doing it. Right. Right.
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:45.200]   They're being Quickster. I'm very curious to get your take on a story. There was this article on
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:50.560]   zdnet about Google experimenting with hiding URLs in Chrome. I saw that. You know, it's funny,
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:55.360]   because I remember talking to Tim Berners Lee, the man who invented URLs and the world,
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:00.240]   it's incidentally the world wide web, but you might have to do that. And he said, I never thought
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:07.840]   humans would look at URLs at all. URL, the URL scheme was really designed to be machine readable.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:14.640]   And he just never thought people would say anything like www.google.com. He said, that's not going to happen.
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:21.440]   So how is Chrome doing this? Well, so this I think is in a canary. And essentially,
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:25.360]   what it does is there's a chip. I think it's called the origin chip. And it shows you just the
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:32.000]   domain name of the URL. And then I assume you can click and get more information if you want to.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.320]   And there's pros and cons. It's very rare. You see people from Google sort of disagree outside
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:40.880]   of Google. But I think Paul Irish has said, oh, I hope this doesn't happen. And meanwhile,
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:45.600]   Jake Archibald, who's also at Google, has said, oh, this can help with phishing. So that sort of
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:49.760]   shows that people have different points of view on this. And I was kind of curious, what would you
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:54.000]   guys think if Google started to show this origin chip instead of the URL in Chrome?
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.360]   Oh, that makes sense. The idea being because a URL is so complex, people often misread it.
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:04.880]   So they think they're going to Google.com when instead they're going to Google.hacker.com.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:12.880]   And so by making it more clear as being the real URL. But I'm looking at these examples
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:19.760]   from the Jake's blog. I can't tell the difference. I don't understand which is which.
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:24.320]   Well, one is Halifax.co.uk. And the other one is Halifax.co.uk.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:28.880]   Dot credit cards, dot whatever. You keep going until you get to the calm part.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:33.600]   Yeah, to the slash. Right. Yeah. Well, I've seen that. I mean, this happens all the time with
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:39.920]   phishing. Yeah, you know, I really I'm kind of split on this. I mean, on one hand, I really like
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:44.400]   the idea that a user doesn't have to deal with the URL. And I really like the changes that Chrome
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:51.600]   has made to URLs thus far, like hiding the HTTP and, you know, graying out the path,
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:56.880]   whereas the domain is black. I really like that like that. So that's happened kind of slowly over
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:01.600]   time. And it's like, Oh, yeah, why do you don't need to see HTTP or HTTPS and the lock, you know,
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:07.440]   indicated to PS. And so this seems like a natural progression. This feels like the same kind of
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:12.640]   debate that people have about whether or not the file system pad should be exposed to the user.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:17.920]   Hurley, iOS. I didn't know this. What on that Safari and iOS seven does that. So here's the
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:23.360]   example on on that where it just shows the top domain. It doesn't even show the extended domain.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:30.000]   You have to tap it to see more. That's a good way to do it. You know, when you're dealing, I mean,
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.080]   particularly someone like me, who's coming from being, you know, being a blogger, where like
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:39.680]   the idea of a permalink or, you know, the full URL was sort of very, very important. The idea of
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:44.800]   sharing URLs or sharing pieces of content or a piece of content is assigned to a particular URL
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:49.280]   that if it's, you know, structured well, it actually does read well and mean something.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:52.480]   That's part of the problem is that a lot of your URLs are not well structured.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:56.880]   Right. A lot of URLs aren't. So if this change were to happen, I wouldn't be
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.400]   totally against it, but they would have to be a piece of UI that made it really easy to share
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:08.640]   a permanent link to a piece of content. Yeah. What happens if you copy it in order to share it?
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:13.680]   It would copy the full URL. Yeah. I'm sure it would. Yeah. But I'm with you, Gina. I'm really
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:18.880]   torn because as a power user, I really want to know what the full URL is. But I can see, you know,
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:24.640]   for an average person who doesn't need all those details and might get fished. There's other ways
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:30.960]   to fish. You know, I was fished on Twitter a couple of years ago. I didn't fall for it, but it had a
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:40.080]   link to TVVITTR, which looks like Twitter, if you type it out. And it was by chance, I think,
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:43.200]   that I noticed that that wasn't Twitter. It looked like it was a login page and everything.
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:50.880]   So there's other ways besides having an obfuscated URL. People start using Bitly and other stuff,
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:56.400]   you know, they'll just mess with it. I don't think it's a bad idea to syntax highlight.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:02.560]   We could agree that would be OK, right? Yeah. Toler. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. The top level domain.
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:07.440]   Interesting. Anything out that was good. Thank you, Matt, for asking about that. I'm glad
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.640]   that we were going to. I was curious. I wanted to talk about that. Tim, you know,
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:16.880]   was never the plan to see these things. He thought only the machine would see it. I don't
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:21.520]   know what he thought the humans would see. But that's crazy.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:27.760]   Now I say things in conversation like nope.com, which my daughter is picking up.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:36.080]   Really? That's cute. You don't want to say no anymore. So you say nope.com/nevergonnahats.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:41.920]   It's really worth its way into the culture. Yeah. That's awesome.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:46.960]   His way into the culture, exactly. Yeah. There was one interesting story about the observations
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:52.640]   of an internet middleman. Yeah. This one, I actually tweeted this out because I thought this was
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:59.520]   really great. Mark Taylor writing at level three. You know, the debate is on about
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:05.840]   open internet, about what the FCC is doing or not doing to protect the internet, about the idea of
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:13.360]   charging access fees for edge providers, things like that. But this really puts some facts into
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:16.320]   the argument. Because one of the things, we had a big argument, I had an argument with Brian
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.600]   Brushwood, who has a libertarian streak on Twitter this Sunday. He said, "You don't want regulation
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:29.760]   of any kind." But when you have companies acting so anti-competitively, maybe you have to. So level
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:37.200]   three, that they're an intermediate internet provider. They provide big connections to big networks.
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:43.440]   And they have a lot of peering relationships. 51 peering relationships. That's how they
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:51.600]   get access to the rest of the internet. So if your Google uses level three, if you're Google.com,
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:55.520]   you get onto the internet via level three, they need to still get you to other places
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:26:00.480]   that aren't customers. They do that by having relationships with other big backbone providers
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:08.000]   who have relationships with their customers. So it turns out that by having 51 peers in 45 cities,
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:15.920]   they're able to reach the entire internet. 13.8 gigabits per second in bandwidth going through
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:23.360]   all of these points. They say, "It sounds technical. This is very readable." Mark does a great job
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:27.360]   of explaining this. Read the article. You don't have to be a geek to understand it.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:32.960]   He says, "The average number of interconnection cities per peer is five, but ranges from one to 20."
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:42.080]   But there's a little bit of an interesting thing happening with six companies. Five
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:48.720]   in the US, one in Europe. They're all six of them broadband providers. I think if you've got five
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:54.640]   in the US, you could probably name them. Comcast, Time Warner, Verizon, AT&T. He doesn't.
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:27:01.040]   He doesn't. In fact, he obfuscates the information. But what we did does show is a graph.
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:06.080]   Now, he says, "Normally in peering relationships, it's not unusual in a peering relationship
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:11.840]   for these switches to get saturated as traffic. Traffic moves around on the internet.
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:18.000]   They get saturated. Everybody does. Everybody in the business does is they put more equipment on.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:26.160]   What you're seeing here is a graph of saturation happening, a 100 gigabit connection.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.840]   Let's see. This is a 100 gigabit interconnect in Dallas for the week of April 3.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:37.920]   You see those flat tops on the left-hand graph? That is a congested port. The flat tops are
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:42.800]   packets not getting through. It's getting clipped at the top. And if you look at the
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:48.960]   on the right, you'll see the graph that's dropped packets. That's a lot. So many dropped packets
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:54.400]   that if you're on the other end of that connection, your video is not going to play. You're going to
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:58.400]   get buffering. You're going to have all sorts of congestion. Traffic won't get through or get
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:04.400]   through delayed. It's a mess. Now, go down to the graphs below, Jason, if you would. 100 gigabit
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:09.760]   interconnect in DC with a different peer. No congestion. So you see peaks, but those peaks are
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:18.240]   never clipped. And if you go to the right, dropped packets, none. So it is normal. This is normal to
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:25.200]   get congestion. But what's also normal is without sending a bill, you fix it. That's how the internet
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:32.160]   works. He points out, though, that these five broadband providers in the US haven't been.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:38.080]   He says, they're all large broadband consumer networks with dominant or exclusive market share
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:43.920]   in their local market. He says in countries where consumers have multiple broadband choices like
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:50.480]   the UK, you won't see these congested peers. These congested peers have been in place for well
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:56.720]   over a year where our peer refuses to augment capacity. In other words, they know there's congestion.
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:02.480]   They know there's packet dropping. And they don't do anything intentionally. They violate
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:08.400]   the unwritten compact and they don't fix it. He says they're deliberately harming the service
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:13.200]   they deliver to their paying customers. They're not allowing us to fulfill the request their
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:19.040]   customers make for content. That gives the customers a bad experience. In fact, if you look at customer
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:25.120]   satisfaction, it's very low for all of these broadband service providers. But he says,
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:29.440]   there's one purpose and one purpose only to blackmail us into giving them money.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:38.320]   To blackmail us into paying them to upgrade. And this is what we heard from Netflix.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:42.400]   But we're hearing more and more. This is not a case of this is a case of
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:50.320]   blackmailing peers. But this is also going to happen on edge networks. His final line shouldn't
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:55.680]   a broadband consumer network with near-malot monopoly control over their customers be expected,
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:59.520]   if not obligated to deliver a better experience than this. What they're doing is going to level
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:04.720]   three and say, if you would like to retry our customers, perhaps you would like to give us some
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:09.440]   money so we could, they're crying. They say, oh, it's costing us so much money, you've got to
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:14.320]   give us money to upgrade our switches. That's not what's going on. Very well explained.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:19.200]   Thank you. That's why Leo should be president of the internet. It's just it's very frustrating.
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:26.160]   Brian and others, and I agree, government intervention is a blunt weapon and can have
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:30.560]   all sorts of negative consequences. But when companies act in monopolistic ways,
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:36.000]   there is no other there's no free market force that can save you. There is no competition.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.960]   And he points out, I think very well, in countries where there is competition,
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:45.920]   this doesn't happen. If you had a choice and you were getting crappy service, you'd go somewhere else.
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:51.200]   Yeah, my home internet connection, my new home internet connection here in Brooklyn is now
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:55.360]   is definitely the upper graph and not the bottom graph. Isn't that frustrating?
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:02.080]   Yes. It's frustrating. And yeah, I don't know if the solution is to get the FCC.
[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:08.800]   I mean, my feeling is that solutions get the FCC to do the right thing and to
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:14.400]   declare these common carriers, telecom companies, regulated as the telecom companies are.
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:18.240]   But maybe that's not the solution. I don't know. I mean, we've got it. It's clearly a problem.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:23.120]   I'm glad level three step forward. They didn't name names because these are customers,
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:26.960]   etc, etc. But they stepped forward. And I think that these are very
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:30.080]   telling graphs. Yeah, it's a great piece. Yeah.
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:35.520]   It's frustrating. I don't know what we do about it.
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:39.840]   Savetheinternet.com. That's what you do.
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:44.560]   Savetheinternet.com. They have a page. What can I do?
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:51.760]   You know, you can fund Alexias, Alexis O'Hannians billboard across the street from the FCC.
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:56.800]   You can pick up the phone and call the FCC. You can email openinternet@fcc.gov.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:00.080]   There's lots of things you can do. You can write a letter to the editor.
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:06.960]   You can write to your congress critter. Lots of information at savetheinternet.com.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:11.520]   How is the billboard coming along? Oh, let's check.
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:17.440]   He did this on CrowdTill, which is Alexis's startup crowdfunding.
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:25.120]   Let me just search for Save net neutrality billboard and FCC's backyard.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:27.680]   I gave him a thousand bucks. I just wanted to jumpstart it.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.960]   He's so close. Eight days left. He needs 20,000. He's raised 15,000. That'll be another thing you
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:36.160]   could do. Give him a buck. You don't have to give him a lot. It's five bucks.
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:37.360]   Yeah, I'm going to do this right now.
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:41.120]   Yeah. Just, you know what? I think I think one of the reasons it's hard to raise the
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.800]   money is because it's like, well, this isn't going to change anything.
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:47.280]   You put a billboard out in front of Tom Wheeler. He's already getting millions from the lobbyists.
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:50.080]   Why would a billboard change anything?
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:53.280]   I make it more past it every day.
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:55.520]   You know, actually, there is one
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:03.360]   crowdfunding thing that I really am interested in. It's Larry Lessig's plan to create a super pack.
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:07.440]   Yeah, May 1.us. Isn't that interesting?
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:08.960]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:11.280]   So you're all for it, huh?
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:13.920]   Yeah, yeah. I've donated and...
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:15.680]   I should give money to this too.
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:21.280]   There's a couple groups, and this is one of the larger ones that's starting to use this idea of
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:28.560]   packs, let people spend... A pack can take lots of donor money and then spin that in
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:34.080]   some very flexible ways. So if you can use that same machinery against some of these super packs,
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:38.320]   that could be very cool. And so I think they're trying to raise a million dollars in 30 days,
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.160]   and they're actually pretty far along.
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:41.040]   Are they?
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:45.600]   Yeah, like in four days, they'd raise like half a million or something like that.
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:48.640]   So the idea is let's get Congress people elected.
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:53.280]   It's the May Day pack. Let's get Congress people elected
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:58.160]   that will vote to get money out of elections.
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:03.600]   And it actually is kind of perversely sensible. You're never going to get
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:10.240]   people who are dependent on big money to get elected to vote against big money in Congress.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:16.800]   So here's what you do, create a super pack, go out and lobby it, raise funds, get this one last
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:23.120]   election we'll pay for. Get these people in, reform the whole thing. And Larry, of course,
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:27.920]   everybody knows the guy who started Creative Commons Law Professor at Stanford and Harvard,
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.920]   we've had him on, we love Larry, he's just...
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:32.560]   This is awesome. Yeah, good for him. This is great.
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:37.120]   And his idea... You know, he for a long time was talking a lot of Creative Commons was all about
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:41.040]   getting the music industry off our backs. He finally realized this is never going to happen
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.120]   until we get the influence of money out of politics.
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:48.320]   So he said, let's go after the root cause of all of this, which is Tom Wheeler,
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:53.120]   chairman of the FCC, every member of Congress, the president of the United States, they're all
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:58.320]   basically doing the bidding of people who have deep pockets because that's how you get elected.
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:02.640]   So let's change that. Let's reform the influence of money in politics.
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:08.560]   And I think, I mean, if you look at it, they're almost up to $600,000 and it's the seventh of May.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:11.440]   So they're doing like $100,000 a day. So they're trying to get a million...
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:17.280]   You're 59% funded. Yeah, yeah. I say go way over the top because if they've got more, you know,
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:21.840]   ammunition or a pipe out or whatever you want to call it to tackle money in politics,
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:25.760]   they can have a lot more of an impact. And if you feel bad, you can say, I only want to fund
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:32.720]   Democrats or I only want to refund Republicans so you can choose. I really like this idea. Now,
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:37.200]   because it's a super PAC, you're going to have to say who your employer is. There are government.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:42.240]   There are oddly enough rules about contributions that they have to adhere to,
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:47.200]   but you don't want them pretty easy to get around. That's the problem.
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:58.800]   The website is mayonee.us. I like this idea. I'd hate to see what Brian Brushwood thinks of it,
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:05.360]   but I like this idea. I love Brian, but he lives in Texas and he's living... He lives in a...
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.560]   Just as we in San Francisco live in a bubble, he lives in a bubble. That's all. I love it.
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:18.880]   On a much lighter crowd funding note, my friend Andy Beyo actually sold his company
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:24.880]   upcoming.org to Yahoo! Back in 2005. I saw he had an announcement today at 10 a.m. What was that?
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:33.200]   Yeah. If you want to go Yahoo! calls him, they shuttered, they sun-setted upcoming. Andy had
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:37.200]   a team of people try to archive it. Then a few months ago, Yahoo! sends them an email and says,
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:42.400]   "Hey, do you want to buy back the domain upcoming.org?" He buys back the domain and he launched a
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:49.440]   Kickstarter to rebuild upcoming. Yeah, from the bottom up using modern tools, which is really
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:57.680]   kind of amazing. So, wow. That is hysterical. I think he launched the Kickstarter today and he
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:04.320]   blew through his goal. Already? It was a small goal. It was like 30k. I got to find the page.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:10.240]   We'll just search for Andy Beyo and Kickstarter. Andy Beyo, Kickstarter. Well, Andy's associated
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:15.680]   with Kickstarter a little bit, which helps as well. He helped build Kickstarter, so he's
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:21.520]   associated. He did XOXO on Kickstarter. Wow, look, 47,000 already.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:28.800]   So, what was it upcoming? Was it like an events calendar? Yeah, this social events calendar.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.520]   I remember using it. I thought it was really great. Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:35.360]   And there's still not a great events solution for the web yet.
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:38.880]   There isn't. Is it like E-Vy kind of or what is it?
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:43.680]   I think it's more like a local band is playing next Friday. I'm going to submit this event,
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:48.960]   which one of my friends are going. I don't know. I'd less like E-Vy. I thought more of kind of
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:53.840]   like a community-based events calendar. I don't know. Matt, would you characterize it that way?
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:38:00.720]   Think about Craigslist events, except with a modern UI and trying to keep all the spam out,
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:07.200]   and that sort of stuff. All right. Andy. That's the first time I can think of that happening.
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:14.480]   You got bought out. Yahoo as usual just kind of screwed it to death, into the ground.
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:18.720]   And a big company shut you down a few years past. He mustn't have that to deal that
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:23.680]   he could compete by now or something like that, right? Because usually they have non-competes
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:28.560]   and all of that. Yeah. Well, I know. Because it was a while ago, when almost 10 years ago.
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:33.120]   That's awesome. I remember there was some spam on upcoming where someone was posting spam events
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:37.760]   that were like watch free online, Super Bowl, whatever. So, I dropped him a note and he was
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:41.760]   like, can you get rid of this spam? He's like, no, I can't. I don't own it anymore.
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:47.680]   So, if he can pull that back and make it his again, that would be so cool. Yay.
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:51.920]   See, even Google, Andy. Even Google wants you to bring back upcoming.org.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:57.680]   30 grand at 90 minutes. Good for him. Hey, look who's here. Heather Gold just walked in the door.
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:02.320]   Hi, Heather. How are you? I wanted Andy to bring it back too. She says she wants Andy to bring it back too.
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.640]   Hey, we're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:13.200]   Maybe we'll get Heather to do Jeff's number or something. I don't know. She's in
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:19.360]   she's in the studio. Matt Cutz is here from the Google, Gina Trippani, founding editor of LifeHacker.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:25.040]   And our show today brought to you by and of course, ThinkUp.com. Brought to you by Twit and
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:32.960]   designs.com. 99 designs the world's largest graphics design marketplaces where we got our
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:37.200]   beautiful t-shirts designed. Our Twit hoodies. In fact, what we did is we did design contests,
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:44.000]   which you do. You say, I need to design. I need a logo. I need a landing page. I need a mobile app
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:51.120]   design. So you go to 99designs.com and you create a contest. There are more than 300,000
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:56.960]   designers. I think they did. There are more than 300 designers, 300,000. That doesn't sound
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:03.680]   possible. 300,000 designers there waiting to see your contest. And then they say, Oh, yeah, I'd
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:07.840]   like to do that. And they give you some ideas. You can go back and forth. You pick a design,
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:15.520]   pick a designer, they get paid. You get a great logo starting at 199 bucks. We like the T. Oh,
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:24.800]   they're so close. 299,762 designers. So close. We got so many great designs for our hoodie that
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:30.240]   we bought five of them. And we're going to make them all one by one. So in fact, at tspring.com/twit,
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:38.400]   our second design is now available as a t-shirt, t-double-e spring.com/twit. 99designs is so cool.
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:45.440]   We've we've really been happy with it. Logo design starts at 299 bucks t-shirts 199. And
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:49.840]   one of the best there it is. There's the t-shirt that was from a 99 designs designer. It's beautiful.

[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:42.400]   digital space. I love 99 designs. 99designs.99designs.com/twig. It is time for Gina Trapani and her
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:49.200]   of the week. I've been playing around with Google camera, the Google camera app for Android. The
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:54.480]   lens blur feature we should talk about a couple of a couple of episodes ago. A photographer at
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:42:00.000]   guidingtech.com did a couple of, actually a pretty good post about all the different ways he kind of
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.520]   experimenting with lens blur and a couple of good tips for getting lens blur to work most
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:10.240]   effectively. Something that kind of obvious, you know, have a subject real close in the background
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:16.480]   farther back. So you really get that depth of field centering your subject apparently helps a lot
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:20.960]   to get the effect that you want and just tips on kind of raising because you're moving your
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:27.440]   device in order to get the effect. So the subject centering I didn't know about. I often try to
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:31.600]   off center because that's sometimes, a lot of times better composition, but it looks like lens
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:35.920]   blur looks a little bit better. You center. So a couple of good tips there.
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:43.680]   How to use the lens blur. I have to say, I like Google cameras. It went a little bit better than
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:49.840]   the do you don't use the HCC ones. I will I will do Jeff's number of the week.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:59.040]   He says 2.5 million Chromebooks shipped last year, a 68% increase expected this year.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:10.800]   And he also mentioned that Flux. Look at that. He's such a Chromebook. She'll he loves those
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:16.880]   Chromebooks. He also mentions that Flux is a Google X project that just emerged from Google X
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:22.320]   and has received $8 million in funding to build eco-friendly buildings.
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:29.920]   Matt, you got something wonderful you'd like to pass along? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So since you
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:33.600]   already mentioned Webmaster videos, you can search for Webmaster videos and find all my stuff.
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:39.360]   We've got 500 videos, but here's a little trick that I hadn't heard about. And if I
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:44.080]   hadn't heard about it, most people hadn't. There's on the AdWords side, there's a similar group of
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:49.520]   people who film videos. And what they do is they take requests for questions on social media.
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:57.520]   So if you leave the hashtag #AskAdWords on your tweet or your Google+ post, I don't know if they
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:03.440]   can search Facebook or not, but basically just leave #AskAdWords as a hashtag. And they film
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:07.360]   about once a week, they've been filming for about six months, and they typically answer one to three
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:12.880]   questions per video. So I haven't actually told them that I was going to mention this. So let's
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:17.520]   just flood them with good questions about that. We'll be like, what happened? This is crazy.
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:22.240]   So I think that would be kind of fun. You should do this, Matt. Why don't you do this?
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:29.680]   Well, the hashtag #AskMatt. We have done a couple sessions like that. It is a lot of fun to do.
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:34.560]   Yeah. It can be a lot of work, too. I mean, I say you should do it. Am I doing it? No.
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:41.040]   I was going to say, I think that that probably has a nothing coming queries on a regular basis.
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:45.840]   You do mention this site, and this was really useful for us because we did get the warning
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:52.800]   from Chrome. This website contains malware. Our site was hacked almost a year ago.
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:59.120]   And you have a great website from the webmasters page, google.com/webmaster/hacked.
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:05.920]   What to do if you're a site owner and you see those very depressing, scary words.
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:11.600]   Yeah. We built this specifically as a multi-stage thing to take you through. Here's what to do.
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:17.040]   Don't be scared. We can help you recover. And then at some point, if you need to ask for IT help,
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:20.960]   great. But this leads you through the basic procedures of recovering from doing your stuff.
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:26.800]   Yeah. I mean, we did all of that, including get our experts to go in there, find the exploit,
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:31.360]   find out how it got in to patch that hole, and then, of course, to get rid of it.
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:38.960]   And it's hard. I mean, once that happens, just like with a home computer, there's an unlimited
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:42.640]   number of bad things that could have been done to you. So you really have to scrub.
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:46.160]   Yeah. Sometimes it's better to nuke it for more of it just to be safe.
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:48.880]   Yeah. Well, that's what I tell people to do with their home installs.
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:53.200]   You're not not going to nuke my I'm not going to start my website from scratch.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:46:03.200]   Let's just start all over again. Download Drupal, step one. Step two, pay $400,000.
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:10.880]   Step three, you have a site. God, it's expensive. We did not pay that much. Thank goodness.
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:16.080]   That is Matt Cutz, my friends. We love the mat. Matt Cutz.com/blog,
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:24.080]   two T's, two T's, and M and an S, you provide the vowels. Anything else you want to plug?
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:34.000]   What's your 30-day challenge this month? My 30-day challenge this month is to try to get good
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.080]   sleep. So I'm trying to get eight hours of sleep today. Get that. Good for you. That's why
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:42.320]   you're so happy all the time. Yeah. What are you doing to get good sleep?
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:47.840]   What am I doing? Well, I'm just trying to get to bed a little bit earlier. And if I don't have
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:52.240]   to get up, I'll set the alarm a little bit later and that sort of stuff. So, and I went for a run
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:58.560]   this morning and I actually went faster than I've gone ever before after a good night's sleep. So,
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:06.880]   ladies and gentlemen, Rocky, part eight featuring Matt Cutz as Rocky.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:12.400]   So can I tell you, Leo, I actually, so I ran the Boston Marathon two or three weeks ago.
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:18.400]   Did I didn't know that? Yeah. Well, I rock on. Did you finish? I did. Yeah. So,
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:25.040]   it turns out, you know, I can't qualify for speed. I'm very, very slow. But if you raise money for
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:29.440]   charity, then you are allowed to run in the Boston Marathon. They put you at the very back of the
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:34.240]   pack. And I have to tell you, every time I run a marathon, I start out the first hour and a half
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:37.840]   listening to Twig because I'm like, I don't want to start out too fast. We can get you all the way
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:44.560]   home. We'll make them longer. If you make it, I'll listen to it. Four hours, two episodes.
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:50.000]   Good get you the whole marathon. So great. And again, I'm very slow. But I just wanted to say
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.680]   thanks because I saved that episode so that I could listen to it on the marathon. Don't you feel
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:48:00.080]   good? I do. That's a first of all, that's amazing. All hail. Coming from the person who can't walk
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:06.560]   half a mile. Yeah. Good job. But also, I, that's so exciting. It's so cool that you're listening
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:11.280]   to us on the run. That's amazing. I put the treadmill on a 10% grade and I promptly fell off.
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:18.960]   It wasn't even going. So I'm not ready for the marathon. What is that? 26 miles? What is it?
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:25.200]   26 to. And you did it. How long did it take you? Oh, man, like five hours and 12 minutes. It
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:29.360]   took me a long time. Make a note of that, Jason, our next Twig will be five hours and 12 minutes.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:34.320]   Just the fact that we're in motion, I'd be double-fisting, you know, inhalers. I can't even.
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:40.480]   That is so awesome. Did you see Dan's go running by from Dennis Crowley for four square?
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:45.760]   He did pass me at some point, but I didn't see him go by. No. Well, then he had to walk for the
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:50.480]   last few miles. So it's okay. Did you run it? I mean, like jog it the whole way. So that's what I
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:54.720]   didn't realize is the Boston Marathon, there's crowds the whole way cheering for you. You can't
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:49:00.240]   exactly arrest. No, I had a shirt that said go, Matt, go. And so the whole crowd was, they'd shout
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:04.880]   go, Matt, go, which turned out to be a blessing and a curse because, you know, the last two miles,
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:08.400]   you're like, I just want to run. And there's like a bunch of frat boys that are like, oh, Matt,
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:15.040]   go. I just want to rest. But it was, it was really good. It was a, it was a phenomenal
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:19.360]   experience. How did you train? Obviously you had to train for that, right? So I'll, I'll do one quick
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:24.560]   plug. There's a, there's a website called USAfit.com. And what they do is they have chapters around
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:30.640]   the country. So I'm with San Jose Fit. And over six months, they take you from one mile a week to
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:35.920]   26 miles a week. And it's, it's like a hundred bucks. You get discounts on marathons. You mean,
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:40.480]   it's all normal people. Anybody can run a marathon. You just, it's all it takes is, you know, six to
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:44.000]   nine months of training. And so the season's actually starting now. Anybody who wants to run
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:49.680]   a marathon, I'd highly recommend that organization. Really? You think I could do that? Yeah, that's,
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:53.760]   I had never run more than eight miles. I'd done beta breakers and nothing longer than that. And
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:58.640]   then I joined USAfit and over the course of a season ran the San Francisco Marathon.
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:05.360]   That's incredible. Well, I mean, what it takes is a commitment and a lot of time and stamina. And
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:10.240]   yeah, that's incredible. It's incredible. And it's fine to go slow. You know, if you finish a marathon
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:15.040]   and six and an hours and 29 minutes, you still finish, right? And anybody who hears that you
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:18.720]   run a marathon, they don't ask usually what your time is. They just say, Oh, wow, that's great.
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:25.440]   I only asked if you finished and you finished. Yeah, exactly. So if you finish, you, you, you beat
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:30.320]   everyone who didn't. Yeah, all the people on the couch, all the people who didn't run. I was in the
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:36.640]   bottom 10%. So I was very slow, but I would not, I would not. If I ran a marathon, I don't care.
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:42.800]   I could be the literally 12 hours, the last guy crossing, I'd be happy. Yeah, you still did it.
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:44.560]   You mean donuts? I could eat in 12 hours.
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:51.920]   I could eat a lot of doughnuts. Matt's really, I'm going, I just went to USAfit. You're really
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:56.080]   tempted me here. You should try it. What was the charity that you raised money for?
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:01.920]   The charity was the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, which is a fantastic group of people. They
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:07.600]   really good. They had 700 runners at Boston and they raised over $6 million. Oh, isn't that great?
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:12.640]   It was very cool. And the vibe that the race was good. There were spectators the whole way.
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:17.920]   Austin Strong, baby. It was incredible. I, you know, I was ready to cry two or three times because
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:24.000]   they, you know, the signs and the cheering. Oh my God. It was, it was a good one to run. Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:30.640]   Yeah. Wow. Well, right off. Once again, Matt cuts, makes us all feel bad.
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:36.640]   No, Matt always makes us feel good. That's nice. Hey, that's so great to have you, Matt.
[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:39.120]   Thank you for joining me. I really appreciate it. Thanks for having us. You're the best.
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:44.400]   Gina Trippani Smarterwear.com. I don't know why I'm even mentioning that.
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:50.320]   Don't go there. Don't go there. There's nothing there. She has been busy doing something really,
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:55.600]   really exciting, which is Think Up. I blog more actually, Think Up's blog, which is a blog about
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:04.560]   Think Up.com. I think these days. Yeah. Yeah. You could, you could go there and think up.com and sign
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:09.840]   up. It's what? How much a year? 60 bucks? Yeah, five bucks a month, $60 a year. And you could,
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:17.520]   you could have your own insights like these. Look at, I boosted iTunes podcasting's tweet
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:24.320]   to 200 more, 1000 more people. Generously. One retweet. Actually, they were tweeting about
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:28.800]   our interview with Pomplamoose. So I guess, I guess it was, what goes around comes around.
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:34.320]   Here's, and by the way, Matt cuts. Here is my tweet linking to that level three article.
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.160]   Nice. Oh, that got nice.
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:42.880]   103 favorites. 40 replies. 102. We tweet. We tweets. That's awesome. We tweeting. They're
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:50.240]   retweeting. So it's fun to see this stuff. And you include Facebook as well as Twitter.
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:57.920]   So it's great. Instagram forthcoming. Oh, yeah. Oh, hey, look, recode followed me. I must be real.
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:00.480]   Yeah, I must be the real deal.
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:07.440]   So you too could have these great insights. If you use the F word, you get a really good one.
[01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:12.160]   Think up.com. Thank you, Gina. Great to have you.
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:17.600]   Thanks for having me. A lot of fun. We do this show every Wednesday afternoon, 1 p.m.
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:24.320]   civic 4 p.m. Eastern time, 2000 UTC. If you want to watch live, I would love it if you did.
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:28.560]   Because we have a live active chat room and it really is great to get that feedback during the
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:32.800]   show. But if you can't watch live, never fear, you can record it. Well, actually, we'll
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:37.360]   tell you what we'll record it for you. You can download audio or video, put it on your,
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:40.640]   what kind of, what did you use for a player, Matt, for your run?
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:44.320]   Pocketcast. Pocketcast on an Android device.
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:47.920]   Which is a recommend, yes, which is a recommendation I also got from Twig.
[01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:50.640]   Yeah, no, I love. Yeah, podcast is great.
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:58.000]   So use pocketcast, download it or stitcher or, you know, iTunes if you're on an iOS.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.800]   There's plenty of places you can find it. But Twig.tv/Twig has a list of them too.
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:08.240]   You can always get the show there. We thank you for joining us and we'll see you next Wednesday on
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:10.000]   Twig. Bye bye.
