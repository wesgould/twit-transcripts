[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.160]   This week in Google, the show that covers Google
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.520]   and the cloud and joining us are the usual cast of characters
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.520]   back from his Ashen event, Ashen faced trip across the Atlantic,
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.480]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.000]   You made it?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   It's a miracle.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.160]   I'll tell you about it in a second.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.640]   It's a bloody miracle that I got home.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.720]   The last man out of Europe.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.600]   Just about.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.840]   Also here with us the great Gina Trapani from SmarterWare.org.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.480]   Greetings, humans.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.440]   And the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.480]   at completewaveguide.com.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.400]   I forgot to mention Jeff is the author of what Google do.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.520]   And we are talking today about-- there's
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.480]   a lot to talk about, including the Chirp Conference
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.960]   and so forth.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.840]   What were you doing in Germany, though, Jeff?
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.240]   I was at the Republica Conference in Berlin,
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.600]   which is a gathering of 2,500 bloggers
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.360]   or thereabouts, which is probably every blogger in Germany.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.760]   But it's kind of nice because we really
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.320]   don't have bloggers get together as in the US anymore.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.800]   And it was nice.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.640]   So the first time I gave a talk on--
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.160]   it was called the German Paradox, Privacy, Publicness,
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.760]   and Penises.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.200]   I like the alliteration.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.720]   A lot of discussion of saunas.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.400]   And in fact, I invited the crowd after my talk
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.160]   to continue the discussion in the sauna next door.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.840]   And four guys showed up.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.520]   I love that.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.640]   That's great.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.440]   That's great.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.440]   So did they concur with your thesis
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.520]   that there is something about privacy that's
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.600]   a little different?
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.040]   No, they acknowledge that they're different about that.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.760]   And I push it and some see the point,
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.280]   and some don't like it and argue,
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.440]   and that's what's fun about it.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.640]   But the German view of privacy is a bit more extreme
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.240]   than even ours in the US, except for genitals and the sauna.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.960]   And--
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.560]   Actually, I would say in Europe in general, right?
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.800]   It's the EU as much as-- is it just German?
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.000]   It is the EU as well.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.880]   But Germany has its own particular nuttiness about privacy.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.640]   And so they go after Street View.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.960]   They sabotage the Street View car.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.520]   We talked last week about the Street View signs in Germany.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.240]   They know robots.txt, which I think is a Photoshop.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.520]   And so they tend to go to the extreme on it.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.760]   But that makes it an interesting laboratory
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.000]   to talk about why what is private is private,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.680]   and why what is public is public, and how that operates.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.520]   So it was a lot of fun.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.600]   It was a big crowd of 2,000, 2,000, 2,000 people.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.040]   And they also do this great thing I got to take part in.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.280]   They do a Twitter liaison, a Twitter reading,
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.160]   where they do as if dramatically--
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.040]   A dramatic Twitter reading of funny tweets.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.040]   I had a ham sandwich this morning.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.280]   It's really great.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.160]   We ought to do it here, too.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.680]   They're going to do a book out of that.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.200]   So then I try to get out of there.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.680]   But the Ash cloud was coming over Europe.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.360]   And I was to leave Friday morning,
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.040]   and Berlin was closed.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.760]   Frankfurt was closed.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.640]   I managed to grab a ride down to Munich
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.320]   with somebody who rented the last car at Munich Airport.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.880]   The fixer for-- I swear to you, a Bollywood film crew
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.760]   in Berlin, doing scouting locations,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.800]   fixed me up with his friend who was in this car.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.920]   We dashed down to Audi's headquarters north of Munich.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.800]   By the way, I vowed during the ride
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.080]   not to calculate the kilometer tower versus mile per hour
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.240]   conversion.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.440]   Because after I got out of the car,
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.400]   I realized that she was driving at 135 miles an hour.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.960]   Good.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.440]   It's 108 kilometers per hour.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.640]   That is not fast.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.320]   And so-- but then I got a cab to Munich.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.600]   And then I got to Munich and was on standby.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.920]   But I got on the plane and in the Munich airport,
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.440]   Guy turns next to me and says, are you Jeff Jarvis?
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.320]   And I said, yeah, I listen to Twig.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.320]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.160]   So we have one listener.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.480]   He listens to every Leo-- I wish I had remembered his name,
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.280]   and I hope he threw in the chat, remind me,
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.520]   because I'm terrible with names.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.360]   But his wife, his long suffering wife, was there as well.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.880]   She's in pharmacology and is forced
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.480]   to listen to every Leo LePorte production in the car.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.640]   And he's trying to convince her to come to the cottage.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.360]   And so it was great to run across--
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.280]   I hope she goes in.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.720]   Of Leo's life everywhere.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.440]   I'm going to pour a cup of coffee in my lab,
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.200]   I think, if she comes in.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.280]   Well, it wasn't the first time it happened, I think,
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.720]   two or three times in Berlin that people
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.600]   recognized me because of Twig.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.080]   Really?
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.120]   In Berlin.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.480]   Isn't that wild?
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.360]   Right.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.560]   Right.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   So hello, hello, Billy.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.040]   Hello.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.400]   Hello.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.800]   I only get recognized because of Twig.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.840]   It's fantastic.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.520]   But you both are famous in your own right.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.400]   That's what gets me.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.280]   You know, I mean, here's, by the way,
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.480]   and thanks to our chatroom, this is the--
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.240]   here's the picture of the Stutt-Epperheim, Rine,
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.160]   Naka, Kies, robots.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.520]   That's nice.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.640]   The robot start text for Epperheim user agent, Google
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.720]   Street View, disallow.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.200]   It's not allowed here.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.120]   You may not use it.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.480]   German's naughty about this.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.960]   You know, a lot of talk about Google
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.080]   has a big problem in Germany because they know it's a PR
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.320]   problem, but it's worse than I knew.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.400]   You know, because I go on and to them, I'm being counterintuitive
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.360]   about things like Street View, it gets
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.320]   on to the front page of newspapers there.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.040]   What does it say?
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.040]   What does that say?
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.640]   I nuss bloggers.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.840]   It's the view of bloggers, the Republic of--
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.320]   this is now embarrassing.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.800]   Public and--
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.120]   Oh, Jeff Jarvis show.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.560]   --show.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.000]   But because if you talk about Google and you defend Google,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.040]   it becomes news there.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.200]   Wow.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.240]   It's really pretty strange.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.560]   Interesting.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.000]   But I'm back.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.960]   And I have friends from the conference
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.240]   who are stuck over there, our friend Heather Gold.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.880]   We had dinner with her, Mika Sefri from PDF and I Thursday
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.520]   night.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.000]   And she's to go on to Finland, but who knows whether she's
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.200]   going to get the heck out of Berlin.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.120]   Wow.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.760]   Wow.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.360]   Well, I wish Heather was also a show host here at Twitter.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.360]   All the best.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.640]   I hope she gets out.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.640]   I guess, you know, why not?
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.080]   You get a little extra time there.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.840]   But still, maybe not the way you like it.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.640]   Yeah, I was thinking that if I ended up stuck in Munich,
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.520]   I could go to some saunas.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.080]   Is there any news out of Republica?
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.280]   Is there anything newsworthy out of there?
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.080]   Interesting in a lot of discussion
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.960]   on net neutrality and a lot of discussion
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.200]   that between--
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.600]   and I'm forgetting people have said it--
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.080]   but the digital bill in the UK with things going on
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.080]   and elsewhere, they're really--
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.000]   and Corey Doctor wrote a brilliant piece in the Guardian
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.520]   about the--
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.360]   I'm forgetting what it's called--
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.600]   the digital economy bill or--
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.840]   Terrible, yeah.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.800]   And saying it's war now.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.040]   And it really is war now.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.920]   And that's the talk.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.160]   That was the drum beat we were hearing in Berlin.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160]   Was a lot of that.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.720]   That it's corporate interests that are now
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.120]   trying to use government to take over the internet
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.200]   and to restrict what we can do and to kick us off the internet.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.680]   And it ain't China, but it's our own versions thereof.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.600]   And a lot of drum beat on that.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.040]   And I take a lot of--
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.720]   we need to worry about a movement.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.120]   And I go back to the--
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.200]   keep on thinking about what Gina said,
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.720]   that geeks tend to find the way around.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.080]   And now I think we've got to face this head on.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.480]   So anyway, that was Republica.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.200]   Yeah, I wonder if we should--
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.080]   maybe we need to do a show--
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.960]   take back the internet show or something.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.640]   It's very scary.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.520]   There is a KML file for the Google Earth of the Iceland
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.200]   Ash Cloud.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.800]   If you want to see it as it's moving across.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.160]   I don't know where--
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.520]   I guess the images are from NASA.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.040]   That's from NASA.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.040]   Also, Leo, I tweeted it this morning.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.120]   I didn't put it up on the feed.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.720]   There's a wonderful animation of the cloud going across Europe.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.960]   And it's spreading and spreading and spreading.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.800]   The New York Times has a great map showing every airport.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.880]   It's really phenomenal.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.760]   Europe's shut.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.960]   And people cannot get out.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.080]   When this last went off, I think, in 1811,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.680]   it lasted a year.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.200]   Wow.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.480]   A year?
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.520]   We're going to have to-- is this going to bring back
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.760]   transatlantic ocean liners?
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.440]   That's been-- I've seen tweets about that and jokes
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.440]   about that.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.640]   Robert Patterson, a friend of mine,
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.400]   did a tweet earlier and a post earlier
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.000]   about whether this is a black swan event.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.080]   And what would this do to change economies?
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.680]   Currently, you can go to Spain.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.200]   It's not yet.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.880]   You can go to Sicily.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.440]   You can go to Turkey and Greece.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.120]   But if you want to go anywhere from Iceland to that border,
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.760]   those borders, which means all of them--
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.760]   You're still going to Iceland.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.760]   Iceland's fine.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.720]   The volcano is going south.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.440]   But you can't go to Scandinavia.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.760]   You can't go to the UK.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.080]   You can't go to Europe.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.960]   You can't go to Moscow.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.680]   People all over the UK are saying
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.080]   that you're putting pictures of the gorgeous orange sunsets
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.760]   they're having there because of this.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.520]   So it's not your like in darkness underneath it.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:07.960]   Not at all.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.520]   No, no, no.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.520]   And the problem-- I read a story I can't remember where,
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.600]   but I read a story about-- it was a blogger who
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.240]   explained why this is bad.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.800]   The ash has silica in it and in the high heat of a jet turbine.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.320]   It turns into glass.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.680]   And then as it cools going through the turbine,
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.640]   it reforms and sticks to the turbine and messes it up.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.160]   It's glass.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:26.480]   Right.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.400]   Yeah, we don't want jet engines seizing.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.600]   No, we don't want that.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.840]   So you were at Ray Publica and Gina, you were at Chirp.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.640]   Yes, I was.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.800]   The first official Twitter conference.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.880]   Yeah, it was a really good event,
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.160]   except for the terrible Wi-Fi.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:42.720]   It was really good event.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.320]   Oh, no.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.360]   You're kidding me.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.560]   It was really frustrating.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.520]   I love those guys.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.600]   They put on a fantastic event.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.360]   Food is great.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.240]   The schedule is great.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.200]   Everything was fantastic.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.720]   The Wi-Fi really wasn't that good.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.280]   And it's so hard because it's like,
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.440]   this is like priority zero.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.880]   This is the revenge--
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.200]   the revenge of low week.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.160]   That must have been--
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.840]   Screw you, Twitter.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.840]   I'll give you your life.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.160]   You can have my low Wi-Fi.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.680]   So they announced a number of things,
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.600]   including an advertising model that's so far pretty mild.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.000]   In fact, it reminds me a lot of Google.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.360]   They're going to put ads in search.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.120]   It sure does.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.560]   They are.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.720]   They're calling it promoted tweets.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.000]   They're not ads, Leo.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.120]   They're just regular tweets.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.200]   Well, I looked--
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.080]   They explained.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.840]   Yeah, they're regular tweets, but they're selected
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.120]   by the advertiser.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.680]   Of course.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.960]   They're tweets that the person pays for.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.360]   They have promoted shop first in search results.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.600]   They get a different background.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.240]   It says promoted by a particular user.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.240]   And what was really cool is that they described
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.880]   that they're calling a resonance score.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.200]   They're going to assign a resonance score to each tweet.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.560]   And it's like--
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.680]   and tweets with a low resonance score,
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.800]   promoted tweets with a low resonance score, fall off.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.200]   They don't show those as much.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.040]   That's interesting.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.560]   That's what they--
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.720]   It's much like Google model there.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.320]   Or dig.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.160]   It's very much like PageRank, right?
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.600]   Or dig, exactly.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:01.880]   And the--
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.560]   Or answer.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.680]   And that word, for that sense, that you
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.680]   can't buy the top position.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.180]   Right.
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:07.680]   Right.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.040]   Number of clicks, right?
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.280]   Oh, interesting.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.560]   But they have pretty deep metrics for a given tweet.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.880]   I mean, how many people favored it?
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.880]   How many people retweet it?
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.080]   How many people reply to it?
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.960]   How many people click the link in the tweet?
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.200]   I mean, they can go, I think, a little deeper
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.360]   and figure out different kinds of interaction.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.320]   I suppose dig can do a similar thing.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.840]   So that was exciting.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.640]   So promoted tweets.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.680]   And at anywhere, they explained a little bit.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.400]   They launched a great new developer site, which
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.760]   is fantastic for--
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.120]   They're adding also an interesting feature
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.520]   for developers called annotations.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.920]   That was very exciting.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.720]   That was definitely a thing that most developers
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.480]   are most excited about.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.320]   But it's not launched yet.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.280]   So annotations--
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.120]   So, and to be able to see.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.120]   Yes, please.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.760]   So this is how I understand it.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.800]   Annotations is a way for any Twitter app
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.000]   to store arbitrary metadata in the Twitter database
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.520]   on a per tweet basis.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.240]   So I'm developing a Twitter app called Think Tank.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.840]   And I want to store extra metadata for a given tweet,
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.800]   like number of replies or number of users on my site.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.280]   They gave it a certain number of stars or any data
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.560]   point that I want, a key value pair.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.280]   So then as a developer, I can store in the Twitter database
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.080]   in my names base, in my apps namespace,
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.680]   so Think Tank, a key value pairs, whatever data
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.960]   I want to store there.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.600]   So it's fantastic for Twitter because they get more metadata
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.160]   for a given tweet.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.960]   And it's good for developers because you're--
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.480]   I mean, you're not storing metadata on your side.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.240]   That's connected to data stored elsewhere.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.440]   It's all in one place.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.800]   You could presumably display it, though, in a third party
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.160]   client.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:37.640]   Yes.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.880]   And you could certainly use it to search.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.560]   Here's the issue.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.720]   And Robert Scobel raised this.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.400]   There's no standard set of pairs, right?
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:45.760]   Right.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.320]   There is no standard set of pairs.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.760]   Although I imagine that pairs are going
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.960]   to become standardized with a base for--
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.360]   That's kind of the Twitter way, isn't it?
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.160]   Let the users work it out.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.160]   Let the users determine it.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.640]   And from what I understand, different namespaces
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.680]   will be available.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.160]   Everything will be public.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.320]   So if a great service is storing metadata that my app is
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.480]   interested in, I can access that.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.160]   So this is-- you don't have control over it yourself.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.840]   Twitter or anyone can use it.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.040]   Right.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.200]   Any app can store the data.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.360]   And any app can request the data from other apps, which
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.360]   is pretty neat.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.600]   So if the more clever everyone is, the better off we all are.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.760]   And no one can necessarily benefit alone.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.680]   Yes, exactly.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.520]   Except Twitter.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.680]   Really, really interesting.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.600]   Except Twitter, exactly.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.000]   Both Twitter benefits the most, of course.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.440]   No one benefits but us.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.880]   We benefit.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.240]   It was a really good conference.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.800]   I was struck by how the narrative that the execs kind
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.080]   of put out there was like, look at us.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.360]   We're this tiny little company.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.680]   And things got really crazy.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.600]   Really fast.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.360]   Isn't it crazy?
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.240]   All these crazy things.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.240]   Crazy.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.080]   So quickly, it's awesome and crazy.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.800]   And after a little while, it was kind of like, OK, guys.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.080]   I know you got robbed.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.520]   You know, startup childhood.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.840]   And you're only 75 people.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.760]   And you're like a couple of dudes and jeans and t-shirts.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.320]   But like, start acting like the company that's
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.840]   pushing billions of tweets around daily.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.440]   Terabytes of data around.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.920]   Yeah, by the end of the conference,
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.600]   I was kind of like, OK, I'm tired of the like, wow, this
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.640]   is crazy, dude.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.840]   Look at how crazy this is.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.480]   And I wanted to hear a little more kind of confidence.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.240]   And I'm a little more like, not confidence, but a little more.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.160]   We have it together.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.520]   And this is our plan and like, you know, going forward.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.440]   So--
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.240]   It's much more maturity than you want.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:28.760]   Mature.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.880]   And more maturity.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.720]   I mean, I understand that their growth trajectory was insanely steep.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.600]   I get it.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.120]   But yeah, I did want to see maybe a little more maturity.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.800]   I mean, it's not like, it's not like, you know, isn't used to having
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.520]   a small company get, you know, get really big or at least get
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.520]   bought by a big company before.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.640]   So it was a good event.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.480]   I'm glad I went.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.240]   We launched the White House query to the public.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.200]   Ah, tell me about that.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:53.640]   Twitter.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.320]   It went pretty well.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.880]   It was quite a scramble.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.760]   It was a crazy week.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.080]   I think Tank worked, which was very exciting for me.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.200]   That was a big few moment.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.160]   We got about to-- we're still cleaning the data.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.960]   And we're still, you know, kind of cleaning up the replies.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.520]   But it looks like we got about 2,000 responses on Twitter
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.960]   and Facebook.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.000]   There were two tweets.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.440]   And one Facebook's status update.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.880]   It was interesting that the responses came in on Facebook
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.880]   a lot faster than on Twitter.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.240]   So we learned actually a lot of interesting lessons.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.480]   So one of the questions was, what grand challenge
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.320]   should be on our nation's to-do list?
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.720]   Reply with your ID and now.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.920]   And any reply, did it automatically
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.600]   get collated by your system?
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.040]   Or do you have--
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.000]   Yes, it did.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.160]   It did.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.040]   Based on the WHGC tag?
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.920]   Based on the in reply to status ID.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.440]   So people had to reply to that particular status ID.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:48.320]   But we were also capturing any mention of @WhiteHouse or WHGC.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.480]   So that's what the data cleaning is about.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:55.040]   We're kind of assigning those stray replies to those updates.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.440]   What was the other question?
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.960]   I don't see the other one on here.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.560]   It was the same question, different wording
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.920]   on a different day at a different time.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.200]   We kind of wanted to hit the network a couple times
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.880]   with different wording at C.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.760]   So I think there's one other--
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.440]   Manic analysis to cluster them.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.840]   We are hoping to do that.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.000]   We're going to make the data public
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.200]   and hope that we get some really good semantic analysis.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.600]   And there was a lot of noise, as you would expect.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.560]   But there were also a lot of--
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.880]   Marijuana to marijuana live?
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.800]   There were fewer mentions of marijuana legalizing marijuana
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.720]   than I thought.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.480]   You're talking about the fact that the last time there
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.760]   was a poll by the White House, marijuana legalization
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.200]   topped it.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.800]   Because apparently, potheads have a lot of time
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.320]   on their hands.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.560]   Who would have thunked it?
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.080]   This is cool, man.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.080]   Cool.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:38.760]   The full 420, they do.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.320]   But this did specifically say science and tech, right?
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:41.800]   It did.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.160]   It didn't.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.880]   Hey, we got lots of replies, which
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.360]   were insert crazy political agenda, completely off topic,
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.840]   noisy response here.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.720]   Now, I retweeted it.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.120]   So since I retweeted it, that would
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.960]   count if people respond to my retweet.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.360]   Yes.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:56.920]   OK.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.520]   So you're smart enough to kind of get it that way too.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.400]   And I imagine I would bet--
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.920]   I know you don't have the finals, but I
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.920]   bet that the NASA announcements that President Obama
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.440]   made were kind of dominated.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.360]   Absolutely.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.600]   Lots of responses about space, about space travel,
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.040]   about colonizing Mars, a space elevator, human on Mars,
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.520]   by 2025.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.520]   The way that the first question was framed was the next Apollo
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.280]   landing or human genome.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.680]   What should our next great challenge be?
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.840]   And I think that really led people a certain way, which
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.760]   is why we kind of did another tweet later.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.640]   That didn't put any ideas in people's head
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.520]   and just kind of wanted to get what people said.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.680]   But we got a lot of cure cancer.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.960]   Mine was very early, earthquake to tsunami detection,
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.960]   like 24 hours early.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.120]   Aneles was a teleport visible matter by 2025.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.320]   It was one of my favorites.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.280]   I don't think Obama's going to say that in the state
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.760]   of the Union.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.560]   I'm just thinking.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.720]   I've got a lot of fun that you could put it out there.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.240]   And by the time this decade is out,
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.800]   we will be able to teleport visible matter.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.560]   It could be good.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:06.560]   Could be huge.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.360]   It could be huge.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.840]   It could be by New South Wales.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.960]   Great Scotty.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.240]   Captain, I can transport visible matter.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.560]   We've got Mark Lindford is in the studio.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.560]   He's worked a little bit on Think Tank.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.000]   He did the Windows install instructions, he says.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   He did.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.520]   He did.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.360]   Hey, Mark, thank you so much for writing up
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.840]   the Windows install instructions,
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.400]   because we didn't have them.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.960]   That's fantastic.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.720]   Mark's one of my favorite wiki writers.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.200]   Oh, there you go.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.480]   Wow, he just passed out.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.640]   Mark, are you OK?
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.440]   I think he had a heart attack.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.720]   Wow, he's excited.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.000]   So there is an interesting--
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.800]   the response to this is kind of interesting.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.200]   For instance, Bill Gross, who has TweetUp, which
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:55.840]   was an ideal lab company, is also launching kind of a Twitter
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.400]   ad sense mashup kind of thing.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.440]   Yeah, full disclosure here is I'm an investor.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.640]   Oh, you are.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.680]   He came after me on that.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.600]   And I figured you know what the--
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.600]   From now, are you--
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.360]   The band who invented the Google ad model, What The F.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.640]   He was at Overture.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.120]   Yeah, Overture, he created Overture.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.640]   And of course, Yahoo bought that, and Yahoo blew it,
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.120]   because they could have been Google.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.120]   Right.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.000]   And I'm not the best one to explain it.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.320]   I just kind of said, yeah, Bill.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.720]   But basically, it's more of a--
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.720]   his editorial view is that he liked Twitter.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.920]   He'll try to expose better tweets.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.680]   But then, this is basically a search engine play.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.520]   But how do you do it?
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.400]   I mean, you have to use TweetUp, right?
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:41.360]   No, he's done deals so far with a lot of the--
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.520]   Third-party clients.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.160]   So now the Twitter strategy gets a little bit clearer.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:51.760]   You see why Twitter bought Tweety to do a Mac or iPhone
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.400]   client, why they're doing their own BlackBerry.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.600]   They've announced that they're doing an Android client that's
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.160]   delayed.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.880]   Well, they're also replacing-- well, they've already
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.560]   replaced Bitly, but they're doing their own shortener,
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.060]   as well.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.040]   And they're going to do their own shortener.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.200]   So you see that this isn't a way of closing in the ecosystem
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.040]   to make sure that you don't see Bill Gross's ads.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.640]   You see Twitter's ads in their clients.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.200]   But who knows?
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.600]   I mean, they'll meet with them and see what the deal is.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.680]   What's interesting to me, I'll be eager to hear you report
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.360]   Gina on the mood of the developers
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.160]   at the conference giving all this.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.000]   But are you a platform?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.360]   And if you're a platform, then you
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.440]   have to be careful about your competition with your channel
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.800]   and the conflict that you have.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.400]   Those who are spreading you and using you,
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.560]   if you start to compete with them, what
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.760]   does that do to your growth?
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.280]   And I still haven't got my head around this
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.040]   about where the Twitter ecosystem looks like versus the Google
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:40.400]   ecosystem.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.320]   Yeah, where developers-- where they perturbed
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.560]   by the Tweety acquisition at--
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.520]   I think so.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:45.920]   I think so.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.640]   There was a developer meetup, which I heard about second
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.160]   hand.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.600]   I wasn't at.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.800]   And I think that some folks were perturbed or upset
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.880]   or not sure what to do next.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.080]   And there were some quips about it at the Showcase.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.360]   There was a Twitter app Showcase after the Hack Day.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.000]   And someone presented a Twitter client and Paul Graham said,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.360]   well, I don't know about the viability of a Twitter client
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:02.880]   better.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.520]   On the iPhone.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.920]   But I think the general mood was like, well, hey,
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.840]   we have to get a little more creative
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:13.160]   and make stuff that wouldn't be a Twitter core offering.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:13.360]   And--
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.040]   But I still haven't--
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.280]   Some time ago, a few months ago, when
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.880]   I complained about things that didn't use this on Twitter,
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.760]   Fred Wilson tweeted back and said,
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.680]   that's for the independent developers to do,
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.640]   and that's the model.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.200]   And now they've done this 180 on that.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.240]   And I'm trying to think of what the analogy is.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.320]   But it's the Google Books analogy.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.280]   When anywhere near the content business,
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.880]   it found itself in a huge channel conflict
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.520]   with its partners.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.600]   Twitter made a really good case for the Twitter iPhone app.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.120]   And the way that they did it is on stage,
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.640]   they showed a video of a 24-year-old Stanford graduate
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.000]   just starting to use Twitter, trying
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.600]   to find Twitter clients on her iPhone and install it.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.960]   And it was painful, full five to seven minutes.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.400]   I just wanted to just like--
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:01.920]   What?
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.920]   Was she a moron?
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.440]   Which one?
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.320]   What?
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.680]   She searched for Twitter.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.800]   It was kind of slow.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.800]   She was like, now--
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.640]   Come on, that's--
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.120]   What's this?
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.120]   Which one?
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.480]   It was convincing.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.200]   Is it mainstream?
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:13.680]   Is it mainstream?
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.880]   It was.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.360]   It was.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.440]   Well, there are a lot of choices out there,
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.240]   and there's not the one obvious choice.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.840]   So Twitter's take is like, if we offer obvious choices
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.480]   of clients for people to use, we
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.120]   will get more users more quickly.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.880]   Like, their whole thing is that the Twitter user experience
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.080]   is-- involves too many hurdles and is too--
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.280]   that they want to create a more friction-free,
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.840]   I think, was the phrase they use experience.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.800]   And the easier they make it for people
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.120]   to start using Twitter, the more users you'll have,
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.720]   and that will benefit developers in the end.
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.400]   And I'm going to say, I'm quiet.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.400]   Leo clearly does not buy it.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.400]   But you're the one who says the iPad sucks
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.840]   because it's a closed environment.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.320]   I mean, this isn't this--
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.800]   And without the finesse of Steve Jobs, the same exact thing,
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.760]   well, we're going to improve the user experience
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.760]   by reducing your choice to one.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.040]   No, but they're not reducing choice.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.360]   I mean, there's going to be the one official Twitter
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.080]   iPhone app.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.560]   With those who give you choice.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.080]   Then there are going to be developers
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.240]   who make other clients that the power users
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   are around.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.720]   So confusing to intelligent college graduates
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.520]   that we are going to eliminate all choice.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.120]   Make it easier for you.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.480]   Everybody will have spaghetti and meatballs for dinner.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.800]   But Leo, listen, on this show, we
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.280]   recommend a dolphin browser, right?
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.360]   Which is an alternative browser for Android.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.720]   And there's opera on the iPhone.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.560]   I mean, developers can continue to make clients that
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.720]   do advanced things, like mute hashtags or mute users.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.520]   And the power users will take those up
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.640]   because they want their client to do maybe a little more
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.920]   than Tweety.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.480]   So is there sense from developers
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.720]   that they're going to keep doing third party Twitter
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.360]   clients?
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.360]   No.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:48.860]   OK.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:49.880]   Just curious.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.480]   They're going to move on and do other things.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.520]   So Bill Gross--
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.520]   I think Bill Gross is motivated to do one.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.840]   I think Bill, we've got to ask a question.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.320]   I mean, good luck, Bill.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:24:59.840]   Right?
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.440]   I mean, I know you're on the board here.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.640]   And by the way, you should mention it in the tweetup
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.160]   is kind of commonly used in the parlance already.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.400]   And it's very confusing.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.440]   I thought this was the same as a tweetup, and it's not.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:09.940]   It's not.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.720]   He just got the URL and used to be--
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.720]   I agree.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.640]   And the other thing about promoted tweets
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.600]   is that it's a 50/50 rev share with the developers
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.480]   who show the promoted tweets and their search results
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.160]   in their clients.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.160]   OK.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.560]   And there's a reason.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.240]   Now, OK, so they're not requiring that a third party--
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.080]   unless-- wait a minute.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.320]   What if it's an in-stream tweet?
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.200]   And this is the next step.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.440]   Now, you've got promoted tweets in search.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.800]   Is there anything that a developer could do to say,
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.320]   I'm not going to do-- because they're going
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.960]   to do a promoted tweets in the stream, right?
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.000]   I believe that promoted tweets will show up in stream
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   as--
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.960]   That's on the roadmap.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.640]   --as they would.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.320]   Yeah, as they would is just a regular tweet when they're
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:44.840]   posted.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.480]   So if I'm a third party developer, I don't know.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.120]   There's no way I can turn that off.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:49.680]   Right.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.920]   But you know, I mean, it's a tweet.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.080]   A tweet is a tweet is a tweet.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.400]   And if someone subscribed to a user,
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.320]   they're going to show up in your stream either way.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:55.960]   Except that if you--
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.160]   --to be their gene.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.280]   It's just a user.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.720]   That user's perspective.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.120]   So Jeff who--
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.080]   --one of my Twitter tomorrow.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.960]   Am I suddenly going to be getting promoted tweets
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.400]   in my streams, whether I asked for them or not?
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.360]   No, no, no, no.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.200]   Only search results.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.840]   They will only appear at the top of search results.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.280]   No, no, no.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.040]   It's my understanding.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.000]   They're going to put them in the stream.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:13.500]   Oh.
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.880]   That's tweet up is search only, I think.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.760]   I thought Twitter wasn't a stream, too.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.480]   Oh, I'm not sure.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.040]   My understanding was that it's just search.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.440]   Promoted tweets aren't going to get pushed to users
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.000]   unless you're following the user who posted the tweet.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.760]   So if I'm following Jeff Blue, and they tweet something,
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.560]   but they also make it a promoted tweet,
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.040]   I'll see it on my stream because I follow them already.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.920]   But it will show up in search results as well.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:35.600]   But I don't know.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.480]   Ad brand says, in the stream ads to come to Twitter--
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:44.160]   let me see-- search results and relevant streams.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.280]   We'll assert ads and search results and relevant streams.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.360]   Oh, what's relevant?
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.360]   That's the question.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.400]   It's a man, brother.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.000]   Following them already, no?
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.760]   That's how I read it.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.600]   Based on purchase, keywords, and contextual relevancy.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.240]   So OK.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.240]   So if I say, God, I need a cup of coffee,
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.080]   I might see a Starbucks tweet next.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.080]   And they'll stay on the top of a given search result
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.040]   or stream rather than scrolling off the page
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.680]   as does a normal tweet, thereby giving the advertiser
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.120]   life here.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:18.080]   But only in the Twitter client, because a third party client
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.320]   is just going to think it's a tweet.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:25.920]   Well, the API will indicate what tweets are promoted.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.120]   So it's not--
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.080]   But I can ignore it.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:27.800]   --percent it.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:28.840]   But I can ignore it.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.680]   Well, sure.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.200]   You mean as a developer, you could not--
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.720]   Yeah, in fact, you know what I'm going to do is--
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.600]   I hear-- I just figured out how to sell a third party client.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.800]   I'm going to delete all promoted tweets from your stream.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   They won't show up.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.320]   Big go.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.320]   I tweeted.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.600]   But then you don't make any money as the developer.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.160]   So you can--
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.360]   You can sell a client and decide not to show any promoting
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:47.860]   a tweet.
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:48.680]   Here's an ad-free client.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.200]   You pay me three bucks for an iPhone app.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:50.720]   Sure.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.040]   That would be an approach.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.200]   I mean, it's totally opt in.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.320]   And there are guidelines.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.280]   Twitter's going to publish guidelines about how you should
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.640]   display promoted tweets.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.360]   And you should indicate somehow that it isn't promoted to eat.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.480]   I don't know how they'll enforce that.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.880]   But yeah, no, that would be a market.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.120]   Here's an ad-free Twitter.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:06.920]   That's actually--
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.480]   Actually, I tweeted the other day that I
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.840]   wanted to have a client that would
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.760]   erase any mention of mayor.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.080]   Marissa Mayer?
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:15.680]   No.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.320]   No, no, God.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320]   No.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.680]   Bear or badge.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.240]   I want anything with "marer badge" just taken out.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.440]   And I wanted--
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.440]   Oh, you don't want any four-square tweets?
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.320]   Exactly.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.320]   And I don't want any-- here I am tweets.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.240]   And I don't want any-- and I want to also take retweets.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.880]   Well, I think that's what annotation
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.600]   could be really useful for if we came up
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.240]   with a canonical set of things like this is a location tweet.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.600]   This is a four-square tweet.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.960]   You could really filter your tweets very effectively.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:42.460]   Right.
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.680]   So back to you Bill Gross, email me.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.760]   He said, those are great ideas.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.040]   And I want to do those.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.320]   So I think that the more we put in control,
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.920]   it's going to be hard to figure out how as long
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.880]   as there is a real API and as long as you don't have
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.880]   to sign your life ways to how to do it and as long as you
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.960]   don't have to get approved, which is Apple-like,
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.920]   that I don't know why I couldn't just get a--
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.440]   if I can get a browser that takes out the ads,
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.880]   surely I can get a Twitter client that takes out the--
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.200]   I'd like a Twitter client that filters out John Mayer tweets,
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:11.640]   actually.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.720]   I don't know if we could--
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.840]   By the way, here's Gina with Marissa Mayer's
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.640]   cute picture.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.960]   You make such a lovely couple.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.560]   What was this?
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.160]   Was that a chirp?
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:20.760]   That was a trip.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.160]   That was after the showcase.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.960]   So during the showcase, there was a couple developers
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.120]   presented their iPhone client.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.480]   This is the one that Paul Graham said,
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.640]   oh, I don't know about the viability of an iPhone client.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.440]   But the client had advanced filtering, right?
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.880]   So you could filter out hashtags.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.160]   You could mute users.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.880]   You could say, block all the four
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.400]   Scrads.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.640]   That is a power user Twitter client.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.560]   And I think that there may be room for that in the ecosystem.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.960]   So I forgot what it was called, Agora.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.320]   Agora, I look it up.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.520]   But yes, that photo of Marissa and Mayer and I
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.440]   were taken-- it was literally a 30-second interaction.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.840]   And I think I managed to not make a fool of myself,
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.160]   although it was a big risk.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.400]   Oh, and she knew who you were, I'm sure.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.800]   She did not know who I was.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.480]   I said that I co-host this week in Google with you
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.320]   and Jeff Jarvis.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.880]   And she said, oh, she was blank when I shook her hand.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.120]   But then I said, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.600]   And she said, oh, yes, we work with him on what will Google do.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.000]   So I was like, yeah, I know Jeff.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.720]   I was going to get a t-shirt.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.680]   You should just say, turn on Google Goggle, Marissa.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.520]   You'll know everything there is about me.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.760]   Just make that-- the special in-house.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.760]   I think it's already built into the brain there.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.640]   I think it's built into--
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.360]   You are-- yes, I know you.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.640]   You are-- Jeff Jarvis.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.120]   Yes, yes.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.080]   I know who you are.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.200]   You should have said life-hackers.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.520]   She would have jumped for joy.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.520]   Come on.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.440]   Oh, yeah, I doubt it.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.320]   That you wrote a book about-- did she
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.440]   know that you wrote the book on Google Wave?
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.840]   I wasn't going to pitch her book to--
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.840]   Oh, I'm shaking.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.680]   I already felt like too much of a fan girl.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.840]   I didn't want to be too-- I was like,
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.720]   we would love to have you on the show someday.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.920]   And she sort of looked at me kind of blankly.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.480]   So I didn't--
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.680]   Listen, on the media this morning,
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.920]   Clay Shurkey was re-prezying the rant post that
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.480]   got him into some adulation and trouble,
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.080]   saying that women need to be better at being
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.240]   self-aggrandizing jerks and promote their own stuff.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:02.760]   Yes.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.480]   So I'm not necessarily taking a stand there, but I-- yeah,
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.600]   you should have promoted it, Jake.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.920]   You should have been a self-aggrandizing jerk, Gina.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.160]   I don't understand why.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.160]   Yeah, you would--
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.160]   There's my book.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.160]   And it's very bad to be in a jerk.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.000]   Believe me, I know plenty of self-aggrandizing jerks
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.120]   who happen to be female.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.160]   And it's not-- it's not attractive either way.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.160]   It's not attractive on guys or gals.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:20.640]   It isn't.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.000]   It isn't.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.640]   But you know, yeah.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.040]   I just thought she would have fucked you,
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.920]   because somebody actually liked Mike's wave.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.440]   You.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.440]   By the way--
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.040]   I'm not totally taken, but it kind of led a lot of people
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.520]   to comment on levels of attractiveness, who was more attractive.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.400]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:37.960]   Isn't that nice?
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.960]   So is the risk when it's like--
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.880]   It is not nice.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:40.760]   Well, I did it.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:41.720]   I said you're a cute couple.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.560]   So I--
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.240]   Oh, that's OK.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.520]   It was fine.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.360]   Totally fine.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.600]   By the way, the chatroom has no idea who Marissa Meyer is,
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.400]   but they certainly know who Gina and Jeff are.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.400]   Marissa Ho--
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.400]   Thank you, Kevin.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.200]   She'll also see-- get her on the show, which I did propose
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.440]   earlier on.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.280]   We would love to--
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.360]   I'd love to get her on the show.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.920]   I tried to picture on getting on the show,
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.680]   but she didn't seem very eager to give me her assistance.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.160]   No.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.160]   My suspicion is--
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.160]   I'm not going to make this still.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.600]   We're not going to get high Google executives on the show,
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.640]   I don't think.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.000]   I think that's a challenge, Leo.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:13.480]   All right.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.000]   See.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.440]   All right.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.280]   I'm going to take that challenge.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.040]   Well, I'll try.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.240]   You know, I remember the days when Google was young and brash,
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.680]   and I told you this story before,
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.200]   where I was invited to dinner with Larry and Sergey and stuff.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.920]   It was by a PR firm.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.440]   Like, it was like, we need to promote Twitter.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.960]   Those days are long gone.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.960]   Nobody-- nobody-- nobody asks us to--
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.080]   She was the only woman on the panel in the showcase,
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.840]   kind of offering her opinions on the apps that were presented.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.960]   And she was really good.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.280]   All of her comments were really--
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.120]   Well, she's the UI expert at Google.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.160]   She's the one who designed Google.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.560]   Yeah, she's the VP of product, right?
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.920]   Does she have anything to do with Wave and Buzz?
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.680]   I mean, as far as I know, every single product that gets
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.880]   released goes through Marissa.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.360]   So I imagine--
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.520]   Those don't seem to have that Marissa--
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.200]   you know, that Google touch, that radical simplicity.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.240]   And the Buzz grew up.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.720]   I would love to know what Marissa's friends list looked like.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.720]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.360]   Indeed.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.120]   Indeed.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:12.600]   Indeed.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.240]   Let's take a break.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.360]   We're going to come back.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.360]   Gina Trapani from smartaward.org and Jeff Jarvis
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.400]   from buzzmachine.com.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.400]   We're talking about Google and the cloud on this week in Google.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.200]   I don't know why I say that since everybody probably knows.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.320]   It's my old days in radio.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.440]   It's called the re-intro.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.120]   Before we go on, let me re-intro the folks at Citrix,
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.000]   who do those great remote access products.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.560]   They're so well known in enterprise.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.760]   You say the word Citrix, everybody
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.880]   knows what you're talking about.
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.360]   And they make great consumer products.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.200]   And they have a couple of new products
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.360]   we're going to be talking about more on the show.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.800]   One of them is not exactly new, but it's updated.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.080]   Go to assist express.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.080]   I've used for years, and I love it.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.240]   We used to use it on the screen savers.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.800]   Now it's faster, easier, and boy, there's no better way
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.240]   to support family, friends.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.280]   If you're an IT guy or a support person,
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.200]   this is a great tool for you.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.440]   You could try it free by going to go to assist.com/twig,
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:14.040]   g-o-t-o-assist.com/twig, and checking it out for 30 days,
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.280]   absolutely free.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.320]   It's remote access, but there's some features
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.360]   designed for the support pro, for instance.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.000]   And I used this myself when I was on the line with my mom
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.600]   and she was complaining I was on Skype.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.640]   I said, well, here, click this link.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.000]   She didn't have anything installed.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.600]   She clicked the link 30 seconds later.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.040]   I am inside her computer and fixing the problem.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.560]   You could do unattended support.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.440]   You could do eight sessions at once, which is great.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.200]   If you're doing a scanner install,
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.720]   you could just move to the next session and the next.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.200]   And the next.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.320]   It has a built-in feature that'll tell you
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.400]   what operating system, exactly what version's running,
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.880]   what software and running in the background,
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.280]   including security software.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.880]   You could drag and drop fixes from your computer to theirs,
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.640]   and on and on and on.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.200]   It is just fantastic.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.720]   And of course, completely secure, 128-bit SSL point-to-point.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:00.920]   PC and Mac.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.880]   So you can run it on Macs to fix PCs and vice versa.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:08.440]   And you integrated live chat so you can talk with their support
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.040]   T online as you're doing it.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:10.840]   I can go on and on.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:11.560]   I want you to try it.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.520]   That's the best way.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.720]   Go to gotoassist.com/twig and give it a try.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.880]   I use it now all the time.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.760]   They do have day passes for those of us who are amateur
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.160]   support professionals.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.360]   You can just get a day pass and fix all the family's
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.240]   computers at once or get the month to month.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.360]   Go to assist.com/twig-try-out for a month free.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.560]   I think you're going to like it.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.440]   Google has gotten to the Twitter story, by the way.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.200]   Now, Google had real-time search for a while.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.680]   And now they're doing it.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.560]   What's new?
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.480]   They've added a new means of--
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.320]   I mean, it's the thing that day life and where I'm a partner
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.160]   in Google News and such have done them having a timeline
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:51.640]   of the tweets.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:58.000]   But now Google has added a timeline to current tweet search
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:58.600]   so you can go back.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.240]   You can see the activity.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.400]   So I think one of the things I put up on the feed
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:08.120]   was the search or the use of the word "ash" in tweets.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.640]   The weird thing about it is, hashtags don't work.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.000]   I couldn't get a hashtag to work.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Really?
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.040]   But words work.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.000]   Well, I guess then just leave off the pound
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.200]   and you got the hashtag, right?
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:19.720]   Exactly.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.320]   But it was odd because you think--
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.480]   well, unless you want to search specifically for things
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.200]   on that topic.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:30.200]   Oh, the great-- the hashtag for the "ash" story is "ash" tag.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.120]   And it's taken off to work.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.400]   Even Louftansa is putting out tweets about being closed
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.560]   with the "ash" tag.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.720]   Oh, man.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.320]   This is why I love the geek community.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.320]   Right?
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:43.720]   I tried.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.520]   I made my first German joke on Twitter
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.240]   in the midst of driving down at killer speeds to Munich.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:53.880]   And the word for "a-hole" in German is "arschlock."
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.360]   And so I said just "ashlock."
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.360]   Oh, I like it.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.520]   I like Germans.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.800]   We're all correcting my spelling.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.000]   Oh.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.280]   Then thought I was rather rude.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.320]   Oh, no.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.280]   You forgot to explain a joke to a German guy.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.920]   Well, of course you do.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.000]   But you-- this is a surprise.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:10.800]   It was weird, though.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.760]   I clicked on this link to look at the timeline, which
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.440]   is super cool and interactive and all that.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.160]   But if you search for another--
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.560]   every time, every other term I search for, like Sean White,
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:23.000]   for example, I want to see what people said when he--
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.320]   I get no results.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.240]   Is that just--
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.320]   Am I being crazy?
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.640]   Oh, put quotes around it because I'm
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.520]   getting all sorts of weird crap that has Sean and White,
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.640]   but not Sean White together.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.400]   OK, now I've got quotes.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.200]   That's what it says.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.840]   Didn't work for you?
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.320]   Sean White's in the Today Show.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.760]   You know, I must have configured my Google search to be--
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.400]   There's only like five of them.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.680]   That's strange.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.200]   What?
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.760]   That's weird.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.320]   Do-- do--
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.320]   chirp.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.960]   They're not-- are they not searching the firehose?
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.560]   They have-- must have the firehose, right?
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.360]   They're not going to be bust.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.680]   There's a lot for chirp.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.960]   And this is just two days worth.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:57.880]   There's a lot more for--
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.800]   You can go below that.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.920]   It has older at the bottom of that.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.760]   I'm trying to click my video screen to click on it.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.280]   Where?
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.280]   Where?
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.640]   If you click back up to the timeline,
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.960]   right below the timeline, you'll see the two little double arrows
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.040]   to the left.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.600]   Ah.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.080]   Now I can go back in the timeline.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:15.760]   You see it's just beginning.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.240]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:20.760]   I'll show--
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.920]   Yeah, there's something about my setup
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.280]   that's great because I'm not getting--
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.280]   I'm not getting results.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.600]   Not to figure that out.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.400]   Huh.
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.600]   Do you have to be logged in?
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.160]   I am logged in.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.320]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.200]   I'm crushing.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.520]   But for a while, tweets have been searching up in my--
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.760]   showing up in my search results.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.320]   That's-- this is just--
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.320]   In addition to that.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.360]   Just another way to deal just with that.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.440]   This is sort of replay.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.440]   I feel like this was in response to the Library of Congress
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.240]   thing, where it's like--
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.240]   No, OK.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.320]   Can I bring--
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.400]   Is this a stupid press release or what?
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.840]   The Library of Congress is going to--
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.100]   what?
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.840]   Store the tweets.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.120]   Yeah, all public tweets.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.320]   Billions of public tweets.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.800]   OK, so I did a little math.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.320]   There's 50 million tweets a day right now.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.480]   And let's say that there have been 50 million tweets
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.560]   for the last four years.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.800]   And each of those tweets is the maximum 140 bytes.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.880]   That's about nine terabytes.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:21.040]   It's two, three, maybe four hard drives.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.400]   In the closet, in the back, in the Library of Congress.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.320]   Well, they should have been saving the web and things of that.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.680]   My point exactly.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.360]   Because, for instance, now you've got a tweet.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.560]   And I just-- I was looking at your tweet that links back
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.840]   via Bitly to this Google search.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.560]   Click it in the Library of Congress,
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.640]   and you're going to get nothing, because they didn't store
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:43.120]   the things most tweets are referencing a web page.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.680]   So there's nothing there.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:49.560]   So all you're really getting is ham sandwich.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.920]   But you could do some really cool sentiment analysis, I think.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.440]   You could.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.280]   I mean, we've seen lots of nice mashups.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.320]   But your point exactly, Jeff.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.040]   It's really you've got to store the whole web.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.800]   Yeah, the Library of Congress thinks this is valuable,
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.200]   which OK, fine.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.560]   But they've done nothing.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.720]   As far as I know, look at no fingers to store the web.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:12.480]   And that's had to be a private effort of--
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.480]   Brewster Kale.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.120]   And services, so thank you.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.480]   I told KGO Radio asked me for an interview on it,
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.760]   and I said, I'll do an interview.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.960]   And I said, but next time, call Brewster Kale
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.440]   and see what he thinks about it, because of course,
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.200]   he's doing the internet archive.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.120]   Now, we just said, OK, maybe it's 9 terabytes for four years
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.040]   of Twitter.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.160]   It's that much a day.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.160]   He's storing huge, vast quantities,
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:37.440]   and he's working with a library of Alexandria all over the world.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.800]   And he's really doing this amazing internet archive effort.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.920]   Yeah, I mean, no doubt.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.240]   The internet archive effort is amazing, and definitely
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:44.880]   admiral.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.240]   And the Library of Congress has our tweets.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:51.040]   But there's something-- I mean, tweets are--
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.920]   there's such a simple data structure and very discreet.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.240]   Well, you know better than anybody.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.720]   They should at least have a copy of Think Tank in there.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.200]   Yeah, I mean, you can really do a lot with a certain phrase.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.640]   I mean, you can do certainly a lot with an archive
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.360]   of the entire internet.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.600]   But there are certain characteristics, I think, of tweets,
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.400]   and that they're quotes.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.920]   They're things that people said who
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.640]   have a social graph, that they're contained when
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.080]   they're certain.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:19.880]   There's just a very strict and simple data structure that
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.440]   lends itself, I think, to analysis that maybe you wouldn't
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.040]   be able to do as easily or wouldn't be as straightforward
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.960]   as analysis on the entire web.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.320]   Currently, I agree.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.960]   And what we want is if the Library of Congress
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:37.920]   is there to store our culture, get the whole thing for crying out loud.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.440]   And yeah, that's why it's been the money.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:44.200]   Take Brewster out of his economic misery.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.360]   Yeah, I'm sure he's spending a lot.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.720]   And there's also rights issues.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.120]   He's storing stuff even though he knows perfectly well
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.400]   that he doesn't have the rights to do so.
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.680]   He couldn't possibly have the rights to do so.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.440]   I mean, anyway, Bear tells me in our chat
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:00.320]   from the Library of Congress he's storing all government sites.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.240]   And--
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.680]   That's exciting.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.000]   And political sites as well.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:06.600]   I don't know.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.480]   You know, I'm surprised we haven't heard--
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:12.120]   I joked also there was a New York Times story about coupon barcodes
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.800]   carrying data with them.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.000]   And there's-- well, I think our reporter now
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.320]   has a save get key to put in their privacy advocates our concern.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.320]   Yes.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.680]   I'm surprised we haven't heard that with the Library of Congress.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.960]   I thought that would be the way we have it.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.720]   The government's story in our tweet so it all goes out.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.080]   Well, who owns our tweets?
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.000]   Let me ask a question.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.040]   And this actually came up.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.640]   Merlin Mann, I love this.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.280]   You probably saw it.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.680]   There's a Twitter book, Twitter aphorisms or something,
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:38.320]   on Amazon.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.800]   And Merlin Mann posts a review saying, you know,
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.720]   they didn't ask me that my tweets are in here.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.560]   I'm pissed off.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:46.520]   You shouldn't buy this book.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.040]   And there's like 80 other people.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.640]   It's got a one-star rating.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.000]   It's like panned.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.040]   And then after the fact, the company writes to Merlin saying,
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.680]   oh, we're going to use your tweets in the book.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.200]   And he said, it's like the burglar coming back afterwards
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.080]   and saying, and you mind if I steal your stuff?
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:05.520]   He says, until they return my stereo system,
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.240]   repair the broken window and say, I'll never do it again.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.120]   I'm not satisfied.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.320]   Who owns our tweets?
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.000]   I mean, it's nice of Twitter to give them the Library of Congress.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.560]   Do they own them?
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.560]   It's a good question.
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.280]   They're only giving public tweets.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.080]   Oh, that's good to know.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.240]   It's only public tweets.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.280]   It's not tweets on protected accounts.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.800]   So that's first.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.600]   By the way, there was a Harper Collins book of tweets
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:30.760]   before that, as I understand, did get permissions.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.000]   What's his name from Gawker?
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   Nick Denton.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Nick Denton did a book.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   He asked me.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   I know.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   It was another guy.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   The other Nick.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Douglas.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Nick Douglas.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   After he left Gawker, he-- and he emailed me and said, is it all right?
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.800]   He asked for permission of everybody he used.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.240]   He sent us all a copy of the book.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.240]   He did it the right way.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.240]   And I think that's--
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.240]   Is he putting us--
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.240]   --GOS right now.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.680]   I think-- I remember Twitter saying, we do not own your tweets.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   Yes, they did say that.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.600]   You know, the New York Times quoted one of my tweets
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:00.600]   and the way to any--
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.600]   We're trying to change the rights to any--
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.600]   Sorry.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.840]   No, I was going to say, I mean, I think people handle it differently.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:10.040]   The Times quoted one of my tweets and didn't ask for my permission.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.360]   And to me, that's fine.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.360]   My tweets are public.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.320]   It's your opinion in a public place.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.320]   I'm in a public place.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.320]   All my tweets are public.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.560]   I feel like they're absolutely-- you know, it's very used to quote.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.920]   Now, is it fair you used to take a bunch of tweets and make a book out of them just by
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.320]   virtue of the fact that they're tweets?
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.240]   I mean, I understand why Merlin was upset.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:29.760]   Here's the thing from the TOS at Twitter.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:34.520]   You retain your rights to any content you submit post or display on or through the services.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:38.040]   By submitting, posting or displaying content on or through the services, you grant us a
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:43.200]   worldwide, not exclusive, royalty-free license with the right to sub license to use copy,
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:48.280]   reproduce process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, distribute or burn it on.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.280]   I made that up.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.880]   Such content in any on all media distribution methods known now or later developed in this
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.880]   moment.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:58.360]   So, Twitter acted within accordance of its agreement.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:02.760]   And presumably, the authors of that book asked Twitter and Twitter sub-licensed.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.600]   So-- and it's true.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:08.480]   I mean, what-- okay, let's say they quoted your blogs.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.320]   As long as they attribute, they don't have to ask permission, right?
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.320]   Right.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.800]   I guess the different-- and I agree with that.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   Absolutely.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.760]   And I agree with Gina that I think the distinction is public.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:22.160]   But there's no sense of fair use in Twitter versus a blog.
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:27.240]   And a blog, if you quote the entire post and cause no reason to go to that post, then
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.360]   a blogger will complain the same way the New York Times or the Associated Press will with
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.080]   some right, I think.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.080]   Yes.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:36.680]   What are you doing in a tweet quote 70 characters?
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:37.680]   Right.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:38.680]   Yeah, that's the question.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.680]   It is what it is.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.760]   Yeah, I mean, if someone took one of my blog posts the entire thing, wholesale and did
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:47.240]   a book called Great Blog Posts and didn't ask me, that would be upsetting, even though
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.040]   it's a public web page, you know?
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.040]   Right.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.040]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.040]   And I think it's a really good thing.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.040]   And I think it's a really good thing.
