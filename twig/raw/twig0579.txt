[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.280]   Wait a minute. That's not Mike Elgin.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:14.960]   Mike Elgin-Botham is when you leave us.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.240]   If I could have his wine and food collection. I know. And he's going back to go. They're going
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.320]   back on their gastro Nomad Road and everything. I'm just so jealous. Stacey though, look where she
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.640]   is. She's somewhere magical with trees and plants. That's a great. Now you've got it, man.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.840]   Look at God. It's locked in. You're up at an eight. I think you need a little bit of art on the wall
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.640]   behind you. Oh, please. There's art over there. If there were art on the wall behind me, it'd be
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.880]   too much. There's art up there. There's enough art. There's, oh, well, I don't care about your world.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.840]   There's art over there. The presentation of your world to art. He fancies himself. Hold up.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.120]   Hold up Mr. Moon-Mayer. There. Now you can see a little bit more of my art.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.360]   Yes. Yeah. I see. I see it. Oh, just a hair. It looks fine. Don't listen to him.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.520]   It looks cool. Andrew Weismann's room. Oh my God. I want it. Oh, is this another one on,
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.440]   by the way, that? I don't know if they did it or not, but oh, man. Oh, you can see the art in the
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.240]   big view. See? We see it. We see it. Yeah. Yeah. That's good. All right. Okay, that's better. All
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:41.880]   right. That there's a
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.120]   Jeff Jarvis who has a, he's just because he has a 10 out of 10. That's all. He's just,
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.520]   so. And by the way, the winner of the Scoop Award.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:02.440]   Congratulations. Thank you very much. It was fun. They showed, I somewhere I have that video,
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.760]   I should actually show it. They showed a video of all of Jeff's friends saying how great he is.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.120]   The kind of things you usually only hear at your funeral. Right. Exactly. It was nice to get that
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.880]   when you're still alive. It's nice. Yeah. I saw was going to be in Hamburg last week. I was going
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.560]   to have good fish and a little award. Nice meeting. So that was scheduled. I got a presume at 6.30 in
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.440]   the morning. Sorry, I'm not laughing. I'm just like, no one should have to speak. Chairman at 6.30
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.480]   in the morning. That's just too much to ask. Too much to ask. And there's Aunt Pruitt, my friends.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:46.040]   Yay. Pruitt, grew it. He's the host of Hands-Off Talk, and Hands-On Wellness.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:56.440]   And it's very nice to see you. Welcome. You too. We came in to a fun little Google event.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.800]   This morning, all jazzed. It was the lowest energy. Did you guys watch it?
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.800]   Well, I watched. I did a really cool event beforehand, and I can tell you all about it if you want. But
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.480]   I clicked over to this. And I was the only thing I ever come to Google events for is Mark Spates'
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.320]   outfits. And he did not let me down this. Thanks, Mark. Oh, I'm glad you got something there. He
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:29.880]   was the guy with the red lapels on his high college. It was wild. Exceptionally well put together
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.960]   Maruti over the way buttoned down with his, and I've seen his jacket before a bunch, but the thick
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:43.960]   velvet, it's not velvet, it's a thick tweed, grave blazer. But the overall combo was like,
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.720]   yeah, it was a super layered, it was a super layered look. Well, not can we see this? I want to see
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.920]   this though. Oh, yeah. Let me play the video before you call it. I was teaching class when all this
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.920]   was all you were having fun. Oh, you didn't get to see it. I know what I get to see. I have called
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:03.080]   him the best stress man in IOT. And I think I am totally right here. He is. He's not talking about
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.480]   Mac lethal. The, no, no, I'm not talking about this.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:20.920]   Apparently found somebody who could talk really fast. That was the most energy on the entire event.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:31.240]   It was a very, it was a weird event, don't you think? It started out with just the name of it.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:38.120]   Was it launch night? Yeah, launch night in at 11 in the morning. Here's Mark Spates's segment.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.960]   Well, it'll hold the Pacific time, you know, you people. The Mark Spates segment was with the oddly
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.400]   loopy Mark Ronson. And the Beatles and Motown, they have a sound and it's such much outhood,
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.600]   the 808 drum machine, K-pop analog and digital. So many great songs. Hey, Google personality
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.080]   times a million. All right. Awesome. That's already winning. Hello.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:09.080]   Just a little bit more of the sound of Mark. That matches the Nest Audio device. Yeah. Nice.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.600]   I tell you, even on the stream, the Nest Audio device sounded really good. The center of your
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:21.320]   whole home audio system. The whole idea of this is it's a better speaker than the little
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.720]   Nest. It's only 99 bucks. So it's somewhere in between, really, the little
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:33.080]   Nest Assistant and the big Google Home Max, right? I like the Max. Yeah, but the Max hasn't
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.280]   been updated for like three years. And I was, I'm actually in the market for, because I have a large
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.640]   open floor plan. I want to, I was either going to get an Echo Studio, but I was also waiting to see
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.160]   what this was going to have. So I could do it Echo Studio or two of these, I think.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:53.880]   It's, you know, I mean, the physics gets involved when a speaker of that size can only sound so good,
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:00.600]   especially the low end. But it's still good enough for just probably a room. You don't,
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:05.960]   unless you're an audio file or whatever, you just want the audio of the fill your,
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.360]   your living room, fill your kitchen or whatever. You're not trying to. Well, without distortion
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.560]   or anything, you know, yeah. So I get that. We'll have to, we'll have to order one to hear one.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:21.800]   You know why that outfit was such a great combo, by the way? Because it echoes the idea of a
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.200]   provide kind of thing, but it's not. That's what it is. I think that's really a good.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.600]   It was a good, you know, I didn't pay that much attention to it, but especially the mix of the
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.720]   burgundy or the dark red with the gray. The burgundy and gray is nice. Yeah, very pretty.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.440]   How many layers does he have on? Three. Must be the one.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.360]   He probably is wearing an undershirt is my guess. One more. One less than Steve Bannon.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.440]   Clearly doing this wrong.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:55.960]   And I mean, truly, he, he always, I mean, I've met him before in person, just impeccable style.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:02.520]   Well, you told him that in person? Yes. And I tweeted out, I mean, I am like his biggest style fan.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.080]   I don't even care. I've known him since he was at Logitech. So.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:13.080]   So one of the things these speakers do is multi-room sound. Sonos took offense. They actually,
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:19.720]   on Monday, sued Google for infringing five more of their wireless audio patents.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:27.560]   Their first suit was last January. Wow. The federal cases put on hold while the International
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.600]   Trade Commission received, reaches a decision on whether to block Google's allegedly infringing
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:39.640]   products from the US market. The new case filed in the Western District of Texas. Always
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:45.960]   red flag. It's getting better. Is it? Or rather, it's, it's changing a little bit, but yeah, it's still,
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.400]   I mean, it's still has a well-deserved education. It was the Eastern District of Texas.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.800]   The Eastern District of Tyler. That was bad. Tyler. And this is in the Western District.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.280]   According to the Verge, an emerging patent lawsuit hotspot.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.000]   I think the Eastern District may have dialed it back a little so the Eastern
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.600]   is like, we don't have any economy. There's nothing out here but sagebrush.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:17.160]   So apparently Sonos says they actually infringe a hundred of our patents.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:25.800]   So Google countersued. So we'll see, you know, it's one of those things. But it is the case that,
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:31.880]   you know, Sonos's secret sauce was that multi-room sound. So if Google's doing that now at a hundred
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:37.560]   bucks a speaker, that might be a little bit of a threat to Sonos's business. We'll get, we'll get
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:43.480]   some and we'll hear them. They're not yet available. And let me see, I'm checking the Google store.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:50.120]   I also got, we, they also got a new Chromecast with, with the new used to be Android TV now.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:55.320]   It's Google TV once again. Remember in the early days, Jeff, it was, it was Google TV in the
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:01.000]   beginning. Yeah, I do. I had a Logitech review Google TV. Yeah, absolutely loved it. And then it
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:09.160]   became Android TV. And now it's a Google TV again. So don't know what's going on with that. This,
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:15.240]   all of this stuff, by the way, was nothing was a surprise. All of it we'd seen either in rumors,
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:22.280]   sneak releases from Google or most likely in the stores. For instance, the Chromecast,
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.040]   which has been available in some Walmart's and best buys for five days.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:34.440]   And really? Yes. Yeah. So it wasn't much of a shock. The price is good. Home Depot had them too.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:40.600]   Home Depot. Yeah. $49.99. I was a little confused because I'd heard you were getting six months of
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:45.560]   free of Netflix. We would have made that a remarkable deal. But in fact, you have to pay more for the,
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:53.240]   including the Netflix bundle. That's $89.99. It has a Netflix dedicated button, which probably
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.280]   explains the bundle. It also has a YouTube dedicated button. I kind of play you though,
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:05.960]   the video from it because they likened it to a bowl of the remote control. It has remote control,
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.680]   which is a first for Chromecast. That's how it has a button. Yeah, they lie and the remote
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.080]   could also button for Netflix and YouTube, which you can make either YouTube or YouTube TV. But the
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:22.280]   funny thing is they likened it to a bowl of candy, which is not the first thing I'm looking for
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:31.240]   in a remote control, especially since the kids might eat it. The new YouTube TV's, a new interface,
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.600]   but basically the same functionality. They did mention a lot about HBO Maxi. We were
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:42.200]   missing so many technical details. HBO Maxi currently won't work on my Android TV from
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.680]   Nvidia, the Shield. But maybe they've made a deal and maybe that's what they were trying to
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.800]   tell people. They didn't really make that clear. Did you know the Nest, the new Nest
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:58.360]   speaker thing, the Nest Audio? It's got the same machine learning chip as the Nest Mini from last
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:05.240]   year. It's got one terra ops of processing power. It's entirely new. It allows you to access and
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.920]   command your things faster. But they didn't talk about any of that, which
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:15.640]   I guess is part of this point of all these virtual events. It seems like they're talking
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.400]   more to the buyers as opposed to the tech restaurant. It was just an ad. It was like a telling.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:25.640]   We're going full Apple on these and it sucks as a reporter. Even Apple says more than this.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:33.880]   Yeah, I just, I want to laugh. Apple is a little more proud. It was 29 minutes and 59 seconds.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.800]   It was exactly. It's nothing. 30 minutes went very quickly. It was just an ad,
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:45.160]   basically prerecorded, which is what the last Apple was to. Once you take the screaming,
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.240]   roaring geeks out of it, it's an information. That's what I was saying. Yeah, that's why I'm a
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:57.560]   little disappointed because the fun of, well, as a member of the tech press, I want there to be
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.800]   something for us. Fine if you're going to do an ad. But then I need to have some content around
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:07.640]   this that actually tells me, hey, this is new, this is exciting. All they're doing is just giving
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:13.000]   me a reviewers guide, which I'm kind of like, eh, and they're not even awesome. So you want
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   something a little more hands-on in these demos? Because it could emulate that, right? Or simulate
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:29.880]   that. Well, better demonstration or just meteor. I'm doing a call Friday with Google to dig deep
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:35.880]   into the technology. But that's what you want. You want that as part of these events because
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:41.000]   otherwise I'm just sitting through a freaking ad. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it was. It wasn't even a
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.440]   very energetic or enthusiastic ad. It was kind of like, I don't know, maybe that was just me.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.160]   But it felt a little innovating to me. It was like, oh, yeah, we got some stuff.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.600]   For instance, the phone, which is very, look, the phone strategy, please ask them about this.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:04.920]   It's very confusing because they basically announced a Pixel 4A 5G version, which pretty much seems
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:14.520]   like the Pixel 5A. It has the same camera as the Pixel 5. You know, the 3A was this.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:20.520]   It's very confusing. I don't understand what this, what the role is in this whole thing.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:27.480]   Will there be a 5A? What would it be? It's very similar in every respect to the Pixel 5 with 5G,
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:32.200]   but it's just less expensive. That is one good thing. The Pixel 5, there is no XL,
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.240]   but the Pixel 5 is 699. So they were able to get the price point down.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:44.840]   Two lenses, a wide angle and a regular lens. I think there's some new features, I guess.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.160]   Wait, can we talk about the best feature?
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.760]   Are you talking about the wait for me on hold until somebody comes back?
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.520]   Yes. That is just, I would buy a new phone just for that.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.280]   I suspect you'll get that on your old phone because that sounds like a software feature.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.200]   It's all software. It is. Yeah.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:06.680]   We're pulling back from $1000 phones. That's nice. I'm actually okay with that.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.960]   I don't know about everybody else. Me too. No, that's good. Absolutely.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:17.160]   And we haven't had, I mean, the form factor has been stable for a while. I think if you look,
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:23.000]   what we're going to see is, I mean, it's not worth it to put out a new, a full new design.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   That's a lot of manpower and testing and things to do something like that.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.800]   When really, you could probably just cram some software updates and slightly tweak the
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:39.640]   hardware in a way that's necessary, like adding a 5G radio. So I kind of look at this as at least
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:45.880]   they're not putting a lot of effort in and re-wrapping, I'm going to say old technology,
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.120]   even though it's not really that old. I mean, it has this, it has the new Snapdragon, not the
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:58.520]   plus, but the 785 regular every day. I think it's a C or something. The Qualcomm 785 regular
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.400]   standard. Regular every day standard version. I wanted to be a ball. But is this still worth 700
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.920]   bucks, though? I don't know. Maybe it's just me. I don't think maybe the ones these days should be
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:14.920]   the over 600 times. There are plenty of good choices, even at four at 500. So maybe, yeah, maybe not.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:21.240]   What's the difference that there was what you were going to Leo? So the difference between the 4A and the...
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:26.760]   Let me pull up their comparison chart. Because it's...
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:35.400]   You need the comparison chart to figure out what you're getting. So the 5 is 699, the 4A,
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:45.160]   5G is 499, the 4A is 349. The biggest of the three, by the way, weirdly is the 4A,
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:52.760]   which is 6.2 inches. The 5 is 6 inches, and then a little smaller, the 4... I'm sorry, the 4A is
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.440]   those 3 images with the exact same size. I don't think they look like it.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:03.560]   They have got rid of the chin and the bezels at the top and the bottom. It's pretty... They go
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:16.760]   almost edge to edge. So the displays are both 1080. I think you're getting 90 hertz only on the 5,
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:30.040]   up to 90 hertz. HDR support is available on the 5 and 4A 5G, but not on the 4A. Battery life is
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:37.720]   longest, I think, on the 5 because they put a pretty big 4,080 milliamp hour battery in that 5.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:48.360]   But 8 gigs of RAM in the 5, the 4A and 4A 5G have 6 gigs of RAM. All three have 128 gigs of storage.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:56.360]   The 6765G with OctoCore is in both... Now this is where it gets...
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:03.080]   It's really confusing. Why would you buy the 5? Yeah, well, good question. It's in both the 5 and
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:11.880]   the 4A 5G. They're both 5G. Yeah, they're both 5G. And who wants 5G, really? Cameras are identical
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:19.880]   in the 4A 5G and the 5, a little bit less of a camera in the 4A. Now, it really feels like the
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.360]   4A 5G should have been the 5A, but I think maybe they wanted to reserve that for later this year
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:30.840]   when they'll do a 5G. Oh, no audio jack. There is an audio jack on the 4A and 4G.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:36.680]   Yeah. That is literally it. That's pretty much it. I would consider a premium
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:41.880]   feature that there's an audio jack. Yeah, but in fact, the premium is they took the audio jack off
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:49.240]   and they made the screen a little smaller. So I honestly really confused. I just don't get what
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:55.160]   Googles up to. I really don't. I feel like we were even asking on Twitter on Sunday. I think
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:01.960]   Mike Elgin was asking, "Should Google even bother making phones anymore?" Oh, please, I'll tell them.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:08.600]   Well, the sales figures are very low. It's apparent in the way they announced all this,
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:15.000]   that it's just their heart's not in it. No, they're shrugging. But see,
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:20.760]   doesn't this type of development take a couple of years? So is it safe to assume they've stopped
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:27.080]   development because this phone was probably in the works two years ago? This is just inertia.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:36.760]   The train hasn't completely come to a halt yet. Yeah. Oh, yeah. One more thing.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:42.600]   Yeah. It really, I mean, and again, I'm asking, maybe it was just me and I'm projecting on this,
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:51.320]   but it really felt like they weren't enthusiastic about it at all. Like even the late night, the night
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:21:01.240]   in thing was like, yeah, put on some socks, get some popcorn. Maybe it feels wrong to be excited
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:07.400]   about things that are as silly as gadgets in the midst of what is arguably a trying time.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.200]   Actually, that's an interest. Maybe it's a corporate decision to be sensitive.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.720]   Read the room. Maybe they read the room. Maybe that's it.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.640]   Oh, that's interesting. That is interesting, Stacey. I give them a point for that.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:25.800]   I'm still at all. I want to pay 700. They didn't read the room well enough.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   So maybe you will when I tell you that hold with me apparently is not available on any other phone.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:37.720]   It says specifically, I don't think there's any reason for this except sales specifically only
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:45.160]   on the Pixel 5 and 4a 5g and only in the US when you call it. I would buy that just for that feature.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:51.320]   So we've all done that. When did I buy the last phone? You call Comcast and they say,
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:57.560]   and operate your call is important to us. An operator will be with you in 27 minutes and they
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:06.360]   start playing Kenny G. Then you just sit there as if the company has suddenly put you in
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:12.440]   suspended animation and you can't do anything because you know if you miss it,
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:17.800]   then you got to start it all over again. So this way apparently, now I'm not sure I would trust
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.880]   it, but you let the Google Assistant wait and hold for you. Then when somebody comes on,
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:29.560]   it'll say, "Hey, they're on." And after you call, you can share your audio and transcript to help
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:38.920]   improve hold for me. Oh man, I bought my 3A last August. So you're still still a year away.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:48.600]   You can actually turn this on when you're on a call, but important, hold for me may not detect
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:54.600]   when the representative returns to the call in every situation. You can't do anything with your
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:02.520]   phone, like play music or other audio, when hold for me is active. I think I hold off on this for a
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.520]   little bit. I think they were trying hard to find one. Yeah. They're putting out an idea. The
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:12.120]   intern has an idea here. The whole people have, right? They don't think about that.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:19.720]   Yeah, that feels like somebody had a bad experience with hold, right? And it was like,
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.560]   I totally could do something about that, which I would totally do if I had the, I'd be like,
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.960]   "Oh, screw you, Comcast. I am totally engineering my way around this problem."
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:36.120]   So this is actually good. They even have the video. Your call be answered in the order it's
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:41.000]   received and it says, "Oh, somebody's talking to you." I presume the assistant comes on and says,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.640]   "Hello, this is Leo's phone. I'll get him. He'll be right there. He'll be right with you."
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:53.000]   I like the idea, but let's think about the customer service rep on the other end of that call.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.800]   Yeah, they're waiting for you. The likes of Comcast. That's been getting their butchered on
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:04.680]   for the last hour because their service is so bad. They get the opportunity to hang up and clear
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:16.280]   out that queue by one more call. On the other hand, if customers are just 10% less angry
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.880]   when you get them on the line, that's true. Just 10%.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.480]   It could be nice. Yeah, I'll give you that.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:27.400]   That's true. I try really hard not to take out any of my frustration. I always take a deep
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.240]   breath before doing anything with a customer service person because it isn't their fault.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.360]   That's true. I encourage everyone even if it is frustrated.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:42.040]   So based on what we just saw, would you pay $200 more for the Pixel 5?
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:46.920]   That would be no, sir. I feel like not. There's nothing. Yeah.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:52.040]   That's a price you like, right? Yeah. Is that okay?
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:25:00.520]   $4.99 is reasonable. Honestly, the 4A has features, the 4A 5G has features over and above
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:06.600]   just the 5G. It really is the 5A. They really should just have called it the 5A.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.000]   Yeah. I don't get it because it's got more battery. It's got a bigger screen.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.920]   It says, in fact, it's got the biggest screen Google offers now, 6.2 inches bigger than the
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:26.360]   5. Very weird. It feels like, hey, we got 100,000 of those screens left. Why don't we make a phone?
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:32.120]   I was just thinking about that. Yeah. Maybe they could only buy certain parts in bulk.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:39.320]   So they were like, just jam it in there. I don't want to care how she has tried as Canon with their
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:46.120]   R5, the way they marketed that piece of equipment to be sent by camera when it clearly is in a
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:53.080]   case. It stops working after 30 minutes, etc. So I have to say, I loved the Pixel phones.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.320]   I loved the Nexus phones and I love the Pixel phones even more. I think the original
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:03.480]   OG Pixel. I love the clean and joy. Yeah, they were great. But what's happened is Samsung and others
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:12.680]   OnePlus and Motorola are very clean and Android now. Even Samsung is barely modified.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:20.040]   I love the Pixel phones, but I'm definitely not in the market for a new one.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:26.600]   I like it. Now you know, in a year, you don't know how I feel now with no Pixel book.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:31.720]   I held out the tiniest hope. They'd say one more thing.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:38.760]   Did you see Kevin's story from late? Was it last week? Yeah.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:46.360]   We talked about it. Kevin's an optimistic, civilized, decent person who tries to find
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.840]   the positive things in life. And I don't. He basically said the Pixel book goes fine.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:56.600]   Just get it, Jeff. He might as well have put that. Just get it, Jeff, in the article, to be honest.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:01.480]   I'm getting the go. I'm getting the go. Good. Well, so what's happening to mine right now is the
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:07.240]   battery gets down to about 40% and then suddenly zero. Yeah, yeah, you need a new battery at least.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:12.200]   The new, okay. So they announced the new Chromecast. We talked about that.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:21.720]   Doesn't work with Stadia. So this is just Google all over. It's like, we couldn't get in touch with
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:29.640]   that team in time. So we were wondering during the event because, you know, Stadia, if you got the
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   pro version at the beginning, you'd get a Google Chromecast Ultra to play games on your TV with
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:43.560]   Stadia with that's great. But this new Chromecast is Google TV and Google TV, formerly Android TV,
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:48.520]   never worked with Stadia. So Jason and I were wondering, well, what does that mean? Is this going to,
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:54.200]   is it? Well, now we know it's Dieter Bohn asked and he said, no, though, the new Chromecast will not
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:59.960]   support Stadia, not at least at launch sometime in the first half next year, it will update.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:06.040]   Yeah, that makes sense. Just just fix the code down the road, please, for the four people on Stadia.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:16.680]   I'm thinking people increasingly are going to say, I don't trust Google to stick with anything.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:23.640]   I just don't. Now, I love the Nest stuff, by the way. I might well get that little Nest because I
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:32.760]   love my big Google home, Hub Max. And I love my Google Nest Hub Max. Can they fix the freaking naming?
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:42.360]   So what the Max speaker I like, the Max display I like, too, actually. So I could just say I like
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.840]   the Maxes, both Maxes I like. Maxi Maxi. Maxi.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.040]   Okay. Are we going to talk about Amazon's devices at any point? Oh, yeah. I know this is this week.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:01.000]   Well, I'm getting the Google announcement out of the way. I think we've done it. We've actually
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.800]   had more time talking about it than they did. But just not surprise me at all.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:13.880]   Well, wait, wait, you didn't do the new, more helpful editor for Google Photos.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:20.200]   Yes. Oh, that's right. You could take pictures in the dark, which was exciting. Yes. And they have a
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:26.120]   new lighting in the Google phone, a new lighting. You can move the lighting around. I don't know
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:30.440]   if that's going to be in photos or not. But they said, and you can even do this with a five-year-old
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:36.360]   picture. So I suspect it's actually in photos that you could pick a lighting point. That's a nice
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:41.320]   feature, right? And as long as it looks, doesn't look like you're doing that. Yeah, just do it
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:47.560]   tastefully. Some people will get pictures about it. You know, they'll have the light on one side
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.080]   and the shadows on the same side of the light. Right. So, yeah.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.680]   That's a good point. Pretty cool. I've watched it now. That's pretty cool. Yeah.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:00.760]   Is that on the, should I show that? Is that on the page? Apple has done several of the ladies
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.080]   in the way Apple presents. It's pretty cool. Yeah.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:07.960]   So there you have it.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:15.480]   There you have it. You speak in the room, sir. It's been nice. It's over now. We've talked about
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:20.520]   everything Google the shows over. That's it. It's done. Did you celebrate? Did you celebrate
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.600]   Google's 22nd birthday? Maybe that's it. They're just getting old.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:35.240]   22nd isn't old. It is for Google. They had a giant socially distanced. They did a zoom call.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.080]   Oh, I'm sorry. Google meet call for their birthday. Stacey is the official
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:45.240]   definer of old. 22 is not old. We should bring in my daughter for that. Yeah.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:54.840]   We would all be old. Yeah, you're old. Oh, dish. All right. All right. We can take a break and
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:00.600]   then come back. I think we got, I think we launched night in. We got everything. All, all.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.440]   Well, you just compare that if we, you know, if we go back like five years to these kinds of
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.320]   announcements versus sounds. It's used to be so exciting. It's.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:14.520]   There's a new fall TV season. You can't wait for these sitcoms. It's like that. Actually,
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.960]   isn't it? There's, you know what? There's a new Buick this fall.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:24.920]   And you, all right. Let's watch. This is, I might as well do this because
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:32.120]   if you missed it, they made a little video 90 seconds total to get the meat of the show in here.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:36.520]   You want to watch this? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A little 90 second interlude.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:43.560]   There was a kid playing drums. There was lots of people in their houses.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:51.080]   There was that's so much wonderful content. She was unaccountably looking off camera the whole time.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.200]   I hate that. She was looking over my shoulder. I don't know why.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:59.720]   I hated this. She's looking at a two time case. Someone else.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.720]   Well, they didn't. Okay. So just a tip. You could, you can put the prompter on the camera.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.880]   Just a tip. I'm just saying. No, that's what they're doing. No, no, that's what they're doing.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:12.440]   It's time for multiple. So they're doing the, I'm talking off to here, which is really kind of
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:17.240]   rude, but that's the way they record this. Well, but you know what? Yeah. Okay. So I know that.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.800]   I never seen your profile. I know that thing, but this is the thing.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:27.480]   They did that. But even, even the straight on shot was over your shoulder.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.640]   Well, that's looking over your shoulder. So they did. That's, that's the, as if she's talking to
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:36.760]   someone. Yes, but who? I know. Jeff, he belongs on a coin.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:45.400]   What a file. Say everything that it looks like. It's very distinguished. Patricia.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:51.240]   Yeah. Oh, you do belong in a coin. Regal. I want a Jeff Jarvis quarter.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:59.480]   All right. That's the thumbnail. Jeff, when you die, I promise I will work to memorialize your
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:03.160]   profile in a quarter. What I die. Thank you. Very.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:09.640]   Well, I don't get a silver dollar. I get a damn quarter. Thank you very much.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:13.320]   I was going to say, you should put him on a wooden nickel. Don't knock a quarter.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.240]   I don't want to knick a wood nickel. I can guarantee, actually. I'm sure I could find
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.920]   something. I respect that. I want, I want it to be scowling. Let's see.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:25.880]   You don't have to be angry. He looks like our eight. Our eight president.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.920]   Little no Jeff Jarvis, president Jarvis.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:35.400]   Which is my, wait, wait, wait, which is my better side.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:44.760]   Okay. One or two or two. No, you're showing. You need more of a percent, not a three quarter.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:50.200]   One. All right. Well, go to two and show us the actual profile, not the.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.320]   Yeah. Yeah. Look straight ahead. You look at two.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.080]   Right. Look, Lauren, one of the left.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.440]   The closer does turn a little bit more to us.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.880]   Smidge more.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.000]   Yeah. You have quite the.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:01.560]   It's quite the.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.720]   One's better. I do. I do.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.280]   Let me see. Let me see.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.240]   Big as in the family. Can you do a two shot and see?
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.120]   We've got the bigger.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:14.040]   Oh, okay. All right. Yeah.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.800]   Jammer B is going to kill us all.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.000]   We'll do it in post. We'll do it in post.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.240]   I feel like Leo, you have, you have a.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:29.560]   Jeff, your nose doesn't slope down as much as Leo's does. And Leo's yours has more of a slope
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.560]   happen. Slope. What do you mean slope?
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:36.360]   There are words. I don't actually, I didn't even know what a strong jawline was until forever
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.920]   ago or a craggy facial feature. So I don't know how to describe.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.960]   Oh my God. So my.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:41.960]   My.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.560]   Yeah. Your nose is bigger.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.760]   Your whole.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.840]   I wear the schnives award.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:51.080]   His nose is bigger than mine. I have a big nose.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.200]   I have a big nose too.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.440]   I'm laughing.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.720]   My kids deny having the.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:56.120]   Okay.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:56.760]   Okay.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:56.840]   Okay.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.240]   Two shots.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.840]   What do I turn this way or?
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.440]   That's other way. Other way.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.320]   Anyway, other way.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.480]   Well, okay.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.280]   Now here.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:08.600]   Okay. Yeah. Stay looking there for a second. Don't look at the camera.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:13.160]   Uh, I really still think Leo's is bigger. What do you think? And.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.520]   Uh, no, I'm going. I'm going. Mr. Jarvis.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.440]   Yes. So hard. All right.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.000]   Jeff and Jeff care is definitely bigger. Much poof here.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:23.240]   Much.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:23.880]   Yeah. It's.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.040]   It's the schnaz show.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:31.320]   Meanwhile, I'm back with.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.520]   I just got to be the.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.360]   Okay. Look, look, these.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.160]   The schnaz show.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.120]   The schnaz. No.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.560]   This is these are the three colors you can get.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:43.080]   Doesn't this looks like some sort of medical device? Like maybe, I don't know,
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.720]   a heating bag or something. It's very ugly.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.920]   A lot larger. It's but I mean, it's still just a.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.840]   It's just hanging off your TV.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:56.280]   And then they like they likened the remote control to a French macaron
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.640]   cookie, which was.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.760]   What? No, that is not like a macaron.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:05.640]   Well, actually, they said a bowl of candy, but next to it was not candy,
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.680]   but a French macaron. So I don't know what they're.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.000]   They don't know for.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:11.960]   I don't agree with third.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:15.240]   I don't like their whole design philosophy. I'll be honest.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.080]   I don't like the laws and shape of the speakers.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.840]   Oh, oh, Selena Gomez.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.440]   Well, you just missed her.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:26.920]   I watched the event. So I saw her.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.960]   You saw her. Yeah.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.200]   There's your buddy and his grain burgundy.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:35.080]   And then this guy played drums with some kid.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:37.000]   Well, the kid's famous.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.320]   Oh, the kid's famous? Like on YouTube famous?
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.200]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.280]   There's Mark trying to keep his head up.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.440]   Here's these phones. We don't know why they exist.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:51.640]   And then there's hold for me extreme battery saver, which kills background tasks.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:56.680]   And then some guy was playing in the park on his phone, Stadia.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:00.040]   Cinematic pan is interesting.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:03.000]   Here's the portrait light and the night sight.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.720]   Mark Levois is gone.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.320]   So again, they feel like they're just running on inertia at this point.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:13.960]   Did you like the camera features, particularly?
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.920]   Or was there anything you saw there?
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:21.160]   They really do much for me because it's just something that's going to roll out to all of the
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:21.960]   phones anyway.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.280]   I figure a lot of these features are just software.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:30.280]   So they may hold off as they are with the hold feature, but I think ultimately,
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.560]   we'll anybody will get them.
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:37.400]   All right. Well, there you have it.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.040]   Who has the confetti?
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.640]   I think you're going to say the biggest.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.240]   Whoo.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.280]   So it was a split decision on the schnaz.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.080]   What was Carsten's side?
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:54.280]   Carsten, I think, gave me the bigger nose, which I can't decide if that's.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.560]   We could make y'all stick a ruler next to your nose and decide.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:58.760]   I mean, that'll be next.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.400]   Curically, we could.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.920]   That's the T's the next week.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.440]   I could I could count it in pikas or points.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.080]   Pikas.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.040]   Oh, there you go.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.160]   I have one of those in my.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.360]   I still have.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.560]   I have a pikas.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.840]   I don't have a pikas.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.160]   A ruler.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.360]   Problem is, how do I get past that?
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.000]   I guess I go.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.680]   No, I can't go this way to go through my face.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.360]   So never mind.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.840]   Never mind.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.800]   This is this lady's gentleman.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.440]   Gutenberg woman.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.760]   You haven't assessed called a pikapole.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.120]   A pikapole?
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.160]   I have a pole because you.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:27.320]   Yes.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.840]   A pole because you'd pull the type because you got a little hook.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:35.080]   It's a ruler with a little hook at the hook and it's got inches and agate and six
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.040]   and 12 points and points points to what how type is measured.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.400]   I never 12 points.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.600]   Right.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.120]   12.5.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:42.360]   See.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:47.240]   Everybody puts 12 points in their in their Microsoft Word.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:50.520]   You know, we we use those measures going way back, my children.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.520]   What's an agate?
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.760]   I own one of these that I don't know.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:39:00.280]   Well, agate in most nomenclature was the it's not this is not the proper,
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.520]   but but we called the tiniest type for like sports that was agate type.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.440]   Because it was it was very small.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.120]   What's it mean?
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:08.680]   I can measure, but still.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.240]   What's it mean when you say I was busting my agates?
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:15.720]   I never heard that.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.960]   Boy Leo that that just went nowhere.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:20.840]   Yeah, no one understood that joke.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.640]   I heard during these trying times, some people are actually hiring right now.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.000]   I heard that too, it.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.320]   You know, there's lots to think about these days as an employer.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.400]   Hiring can be challenging, can't it not?
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.800]   That's why you need Zipprecruiter.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.840]   Right?
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.760]   Ziprecruiter, our sponsor of the hour.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.800]   We actually were big fans.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.160]   We use Zipprecruiter ourselves.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:47.400]   So did Monica Starks at her construction company GS groups.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:52.600]   You know, a hard time filling a key role because there were so many candidates out there.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.840]   She wasn't sure if she was getting the right person.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.520]   She actually switched to Zipprecruiter.
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.200]   She wasn't her problem.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.040]   Wasn't that she didn't have a lot of candidates.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.240]   It was figuring out which of those candidates is the right one to hire.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:05.640]   Ziprecruiter's technology makes it so easy.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:12.440]   They identify people with the right experience for your job and actively invite them to apply.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:16.200]   That's one of the great reasons we use Ziprecruiter.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.000]   And you should too.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.200]   You can try it free at zipprecruiter.com/twig.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.800]   Monica found Lamont Jenkins.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.200]   She said Ziprecruiter sent her Lamont's profile.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:29.480]   Five minutes after she posted the job because he was such a great match for the rule.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.560]   That's actually not at all unusual.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.680]   We had that experience too.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.960]   I've told the story.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.480]   They posted at breakfast and by lunch, we had three or four really good candidates.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.200]   She was worried.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.960]   She said, "I can't fill this job.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.640]   I'm going to have to do it myself."
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:46.680]   Ziprecruiter is so effective that four out of five employers who post on Ziprecruiter get a
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.160]   quality candidate within the first day.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:54.840]   Of course, we've mentioned before, one of the things Ziprecruiter does that's so awesome is it
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:59.640]   posts you're listing to over 100 of the best job sites on the web.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.280]   So you're immediately casting a wide net.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.640]   But they don't stop there.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.960]   That matching technology is so cool.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:10.520]   It scans thousands of resumes to find people with the right experience and then says,
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.040]   "Hey, you should apply for this job."
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:15.400]   They reformat the resume so it's easy to read them.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:20.600]   They even will star the best candidates and say, "You should look at this one."
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:25.080]   It's like having a really good assistant working with you on this,
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.120]   doing all the hard stuff.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:30.440]   So you could do the important thing which is hire the right person.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.040]   You've got to see this for yourself.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:38.120]   Try Ziprecruiter free, absolutely free at ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.120]   That's ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.480]   T-W-I-G, ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:47.720]   Ziprecruiter really is the smartest way to hire.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:54.040]   Pixel 5 event in the books.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.720]   After 30 minutes, it was like, "You're done?"
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.320]   Wow, okay.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.160]   We've been waiting.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.520]   Was it last week?
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:09.960]   It was the week before that all the news was, "Oh, the DOJ is about to sue Google for any trust.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.760]   Nothing, crickets."
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.880]   We keep seeing that story though.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.840]   It's going to be next week.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.760]   It's a few weeks ahead, just a couple of weeks,
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.560]   and that week's.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:21.080]   I wonder if it's now going to be after the election.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.520]   I'm not sure what's going on.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.000]   Feels like there's a hold up here.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.760]   The DOJ money, you think it's money?
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:34.440]   The DOJ is telling the state's attorneys general about it,
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:37.800]   because they would love to line up 20 or 30 of these guys, maybe 50.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.600]   Who knows to get involved?
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.760]   So maybe that's what the hold up is.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.360]   Meanwhile, Google, go ahead.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:50.040]   I was going to say, or maybe the state's attorneys general are worried about suing the
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.440]   Department of Justice for various election issues.
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.440]   So they could just be busy.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:58.360]   I feel like just about a month from the election,
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:04.200]   it probably a lot of stuff's on hold at this point, I would think.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:09.320]   But anyway, too many people are shoveling, trying to unearth some things.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:13.720]   Or cover them up or dig them out.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:18.040]   Google, as you know, and Jeff, we've been talking about this,
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:23.880]   is upset about the Australian government's plan to make them pay
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.040]   for the news they put in the snippets at Google News.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.840]   Is that official now they're going to do that?
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:31.560]   Or they're still--
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.120]   It hasn't passed yet.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.160]   It hasn't passed yet.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:39.960]   And that's why each tech company is threatening pretty harsh responses.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.200]   Like they could walk away.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.520]   Google's not hesitating to lobby.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.320]   In fact, they hired an Australian comedian,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Greta Lee Jackson. This is Google's Australian Twitter account.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.040]   Google Down Under.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:00.040]   We asked comedian Greta Lee Jackson to help illustrate something serious.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:05.880]   Google isn't against a code of conduct that governs how we work with Aussie news publishers,
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:09.160]   but the draft code is absurdly one-sided.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:09.960]   True that.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:13.160]   What's watched the video to learn how that works?
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:18.360]   Google explains arbitration under the news media bargaining code.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.720]   With comedian Greta Lee Jackson.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.960]   Proposed laws can be confusing.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.680]   So I'll use an analogy to break it down.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.160]   Take a seat.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:31.880]   So this bus we're on picks up people at their homes and drops them off at restaurants all across town.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:35.480]   Sure people could have walked or driven themselves,
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.600]   but the bus is convenient.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:40.040]   Under a new law being drafted, the bus driver
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:44.520]   would need to pay the restaurants delivering those customers to their doorstep.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.400]   Sounds weird, huh?
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.280]   But that's not all.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.440]   It's a little different.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:56.920]   It's as if the bus was serving them a little bit of food from the restaurant
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.600]   on the way to the restaurant.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:03.880]   So that is all we need to make you owe your taste temptation to make you happy and want to be at the
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.240]   restaurant, which is good for the restaurant.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:11.000]   The restaurant's point is, but maybe they're going to eat so much of the sample food on the bus
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.080]   that when the bus arrives, the restaurant will say, "Take me home. I've got it."
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.760]   No, no, all that happens is they spray this
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.840]   smell of bacon.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.520]   Well, that's where the dispute is.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.040]   What are we getting on the bus?
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.000]   Well, let's continue on.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.040]   Let's just smell a bacon.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.680]   This labored metaphor continues.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.680]   I don't share how much she should pay.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:35.560]   Nothing that she brings to the table is counted as part of the negotiations.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.760]   Stop there for a second, will you?
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:37.480]   Not the thing.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.320]   Is this about the arbitration?
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.760]   Yeah, because what happens is, and I talked to somebody at Google about this,
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:49.480]   they are not, Google and Facebook are not allowed to argue that they have anything on their side
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.080]   of the equation of value.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.920]   They're not allowed to say, but we send traffic.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.400]   Shut up.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.200]   You can't say that.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:56.680]   What?
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:01.480]   The only thing that has value in the arbitration is the snippet, the content,
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.800]   the soul that they're seeing.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.120]   Oh, so.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.400]   Wait, is the content the bacon or the smell of the bacon?
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.880]   They want content is the parsley.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:21.480]   They want the bus to pay for the smell of bacon on the way, and the bus driver can't argue.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.920]   Yeah, but the restaurant, I'm bringing the restaurant customers.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.560]   They can't argue.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.760]   I'll give you a different one.
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:32.840]   So if you go to a concierge at a hotel, something I never do and say,
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.440]   what's a good restaurant?
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:37.000]   They're going to send you to the most desperate worst restaurant that, of course,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.760]   pays the concierge to send you there.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.200]   Oh, that explains a lot.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.840]   So the bus driver says, this is a good restaurant.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.280]   I'll drop you off.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:47.560]   In the normal world, the restaurant pays a kickback to the bus driver.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.040]   Right.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:48.600]   Vice versa.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:49.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:51.000]   In this case, it's vice versa.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:52.040]   All right.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.400]   Tell the bus driver, you got to pay for having brought us a customer.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.440]   So let's watch this again.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.120]   Now that you understand what they're talking about.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:58.600]   That's not all.
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:03.640]   Even when she agrees to pay and starts to negotiate how much she should pay,
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:08.120]   nothing that she brings to the table is counted as part of the negotiations.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.120]   Not the fact that she's delivering customers to the restaurant.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.280]   Not the cost of running the bus.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.960]   Nothing.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:21.560]   Restaurant owners putting a bill on the...
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.760]   What's more absurd?
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.960]   She'll also be asked to cover some of the restaurant's costs too,
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.560]   like half their electricity bill.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:29.640]   Is this a joke?
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:30.520]   No, mate.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.160]   I may be a comedian, but this is no laughing matter.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.640]   Google isn't against a code.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.720]   We're just asking for a fair one.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.320]   #affaircode.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.360]   So, okay.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.680]   Maybe not the best analogy.
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:45.480]   Yeah, but they try.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.880]   Because the real issue, I mean, all of that stuff is actually an issue,
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:50.360]   an issue.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.200]   I agree with Google and that.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:56.280]   But there's also this issue of, does the food you're serving people on the bus
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:00.280]   satisfy them to the degree that they don't end up at the restaurant?
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.200]   And that's kind of...
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.040]   Isn't that what the publishers are claiming?
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.360]   Is that snippet satisfying?
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.600]   So they're trying to be traffic to us.
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:12.440]   I think it's true for some of the people.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:18.280]   I think probably some people will be satisfied with the smell as opposed to the bacon.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.480]   And some people won't.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:23.480]   And I think everyone's trying to grab everything they can.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.360]   So it makes sense.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.080]   And this is...
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:28.040]   This is where it...
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:28.280]   This is...
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.960]   This is why we have these discussions.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:33.720]   This is where the legislation is.
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:37.240]   So what we're hearing is the first step in any negotiation,
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:42.440]   where both sides kind of intransigently says, "Well, here's our attitude."
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:46.040]   And both cases are a little bit off.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.920]   Like what they're going to do is figure out something in the middle.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.120]   Is that what you're saying, Stacy?
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.200]   Leo, Leo, no, they're not.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.800]   Because Google cannot.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.160]   I think it's a bit...
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.680]   Chef, Jarvis.
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:01.400]   Leo just asked me a question to clarify.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.520]   Yes, you were like...
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.240]   Why didn't you hear that?
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:03.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.200]   Food!
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.920]   I will answer on her behalf.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:08.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.280]   I apologize.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.200]   I'm going to get 20 angry emails.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.240]   I apologize.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.280]   That was unintentional.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:14.920]   I apologize.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:19.640]   We at the point where both Google and the Australian publishers
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:22.360]   are stating the most extreme version of the case.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:25.720]   Stacy Higginbotham.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:26.600]   Just Stacy Higgin.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.080]   This is actually a good question for Jeff.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.240]   You were just asking my thoughts to clarify.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:35.160]   My thoughts in Jeff just was like, "No, no, no."
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.160]   You're feeling...
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:37.880]   You should not shut up.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:38.360]   Shut up.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.240]   No, I'm not.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.520]   No, all right.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:40.920]   Jeff.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:41.800]   No, go ahead.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:46.200]   I mean, is there a middle ground to this where...
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:49.080]   Like, is this just a preliminary negotiation?
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:53.160]   My first answer is...
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:53.400]   No!
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:57.480]   But reality was something.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.600]   Maybe first say different analogy here.
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:00.920]   Yes.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.520]   I walk by a bakery.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:04.600]   I smell the wonderful bakery.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:08.600]   I rarely go in to buy that croissant, but I've smelled it.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.920]   I'm just saying.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.560]   Basic metaphor there.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.920]   Should I pay for that?
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:15.560]   Should the...
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:17.000]   You should pay for the smell?
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:17.320]   No.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.680]   Did the smell stop me from buying it?
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:18.840]   No.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:20.360]   You're probably improving negative.
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:23.800]   Oh, if I hadn't smelled it, I would have bought the croissant.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.080]   No, because I did smell it.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.040]   I buy the croissant.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:26.440]   Maybe.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.480]   Sometimes I don't.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.480]   Because I'm lactose.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:30.440]   No, I thought lactose.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.080]   What are you?
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:31.480]   Anyway.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.560]   Although the publishers are almost...
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.640]   The publishers are almost saying,
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.120]   Google should pay us for the advertisement.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.280]   Right?
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:42.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.560]   I'm not going to talk to myself about my excitement.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:44.280]   I didn't hear you.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.320]   It's okay.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:45.640]   Go ahead.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.120]   Stay safe.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.760]   No, I was going to say,
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.400]   in cases of justice,
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.200]   proving a negative is really difficult,
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.800]   but sometimes it's worthwhile.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:00.120]   And so I would say that even if they are trying to prove a negative here,
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.400]   that's not a reason not to try.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:06.040]   So you keep using that phrasing,
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.320]   and I see the point in it.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:10.440]   And I see the point in the publisher side.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:14.840]   So I think it's worthwhile to try to prove that negative
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.520]   as part of these negotiations,
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.600]   because we are trying to establish rules
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:21.480]   for something that's really important to both sides going forward.
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.480]   And so that's what we need is research.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:23.720]   Right?
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.720]   So we need data to prove that.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:28.520]   And I'm surprised that I've never really seen...
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.840]   I did have some data back in the day
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.600]   with a company that I worked with
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:34.680]   that was doing embeddable content.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:38.040]   And the funny thing about it is the data clearly showed then,
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:43.880]   showed, that's plural, yes, that the bigger the snippet,
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:46.760]   the better the click through.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:47.800]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.960]   The bigger the sample,
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:53.000]   the more your content was an ad.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.080]   And people would go through from an embedded or a full embedded article,
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.560]   and would click more often than from a snippet,
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:03.640]   and then in turn engage with more articles.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.200]   So we're doing this very speculatively.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.720]   It's like the filter bubble argument,
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:10.360]   where the research says there isn't such a thing as a filter bubble.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.640]   But we still argue as if there is.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:17.080]   Now, back to your question, Leo, in terms of negotiation.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:21.240]   My first argument is no, Google can't pay for it,
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.920]   because if the newspeople say, "Pay for my content,"
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.840]   then everybody will say,
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:29.240]   "On the whole internet, pay for my content,"
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.440]   if you're linking to me.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:32.040]   And that kills the business model.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.680]   On the other hand, Google has already, I think,
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:35.880]   and I've said this out loud,
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:37.160]   I've written about this,
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.440]   and Facebook have both set a very dangerous precedent
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.680]   by, in fact, paying for news.
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.680]   Facebook is doing it now in the US.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.800]   Google has said they will do it.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.160]   They're said in Australia,
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.160]   "We're willing to do this, but if you pull this law,
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.440]   we're pulling out and you're not getting a penny."
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.040]   You're not getting anything.
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:55.400]   So I'm pulling out in one definition or another.
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.080]   So, yes, you're right.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.680]   There is a negotiation going on,
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:04.600]   and but I think it still sets a very dangerous precedent
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.080]   for Google, especially.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.520]   Okay.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:14.600]   I thought Google's explanation was pretty good,
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.160]   but missed a little bit of the new one.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:17.720]   It's hard.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.280]   It's hard.
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:18.840]   It's hard.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.520]   And it's interesting,
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:23.400]   because what they could have said,
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:27.560]   and I think probably wisely avoided is,
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:29.720]   and there's a risk,
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.920]   if this law passes,
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.080]   we're just going to stop doing news,
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:36.040]   and sending any traffic to newspapers in Australia,
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:38.280]   which is what Facebook has said.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.040]   They decided to go--
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:40.760]   It's fake.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.160]   That's the nuclear option, I guess.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.680]   Well, Google has nuclear options too.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.200]   We just don't know what one day might choose.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.840]   But I'm just saying they didn't even mention that they had them.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.000]   Not yet.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:51.400]   Not yet.
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:56.280]   But I think what I'm told is the privately things are hinted.
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.120]   Yeah, I'm sure there's nudge, nudge, wink, wink.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:00.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.000]   You wouldn't really, would you?
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.680]   Want to try this?
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.000]   Nice.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.120]   It's a shame that nice internet you have.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.080]   That's what it's like.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:09.800]   It happens to.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.000]   Too bad if everybody's using big.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.360]   Hey, sad news.
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.960]   I didn't know, and I probably had,
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.320]   I know this would not have,
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.360]   uh, left Facebook.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.960]   The original Farmville is still on Facebook.
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.240]   What?
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.360]   Yes.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.840]   But not for much longer.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:31.560]   It's going to.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.600]   It's all that fake.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.040]   Hey, that's rotting in the field.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.720]   It's appeared at the end of the year because it's,
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:36.920]   it's a flash game.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:41.400]   I had no idea that Farmville,
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.840]   which I spent on many hours harvesting phony wheat.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.600]   I had no idea.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.320]   This was, this was back in like 2009,
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:55.160]   where it had more than 10 million daily active users
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:56.920]   in fewer than two months,
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.520]   is according to the Verge.
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:01.160]   30 million people at its peak played Farmville.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:06.120]   Zinga became, this was the creation of Zinga, right?
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.480]   Rocking record revenues.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.240]   Zinga, racking up.
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.320]   Zinga now owns the old tech TV building,
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:12.520]   so they've dated okay.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.760]   Do you play Farmville, Ian?
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:18.440]   No, sir, but I remember when that came out and that's when
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:22.760]   I started to notice the, the addiction of a phone.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.480]   Oh, it is.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:23.800]   Yes.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.000]   So a difference.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:25.720]   Yes.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:28.120]   Holding that phone in their hands and they're talking about
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.720]   plantin' this and doing that.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.800]   And then like, you know nothing about farming,
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:35.320]   but yet you cannot put this phone down, you know.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.960]   I played it so obsessively.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:42.680]   My wife at the time said, are you farming again?
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.360]   I said, yes.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.960]   And she said, why don't you take up knitting,
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.200]   at least at the end of it, you'd get a sweater.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.600]   Right, you get something productive out of it, right?
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.600]   You're right.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.720]   Stacy, did you ever play?
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.360]   No.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:58.760]   No.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.120]   She can't play any game.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:01.960]   She has a sweater as a result.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.000]   Look, but she's wearing.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.760]   Worshey.
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:05.320]   She crocheted.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:09.960]   No, I don't, I don't play like video games so much.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.800]   Not because I just, they don't interest me.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.960]   It's not because I have like any highfalutin'
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.000]   I'm better than other people.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.840]   It's just that they don't want attention.
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:17.400]   I don't want your daughter.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.680]   No, she's kind of worth the same way.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.040]   We'd rather read a book.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:22.680]   That's good.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.120]   Or knit a sweater.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:28.520]   I mean, it was nice to see words with friends catch on
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.280]   and people were addicted to that.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:31.160]   Oh, I played that on it.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:33.800]   You know, this was vernacular, vocabulary.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.320]   You know, it's like, it's like, stimulus.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.440]   Well, it just went with a person.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.000]   That was fun.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.440]   You'd meet your friends, you'd play.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:42.840]   I could see, I didn't have as much of a problem with that,
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:45.720]   but the whole farm bill thing and just seeing how people were
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.880]   so addicted to it, it bugged me.
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:50.120]   And I was like, nope, that's not going to be me,
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.000]   but the fall on the way.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.520]   Last game I played was on CD-ROM, literally.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.440]   Wow.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:56.920]   Was it missed?
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.440]   Missed.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.080]   Missed.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:56:59.560]   Yes.
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:00.200]   Was it?
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:00.840]   It was.
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:01.160]   Good.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:01.960]   Yes.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.440]   Wow.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:04.280]   Stacy, Higginbotham.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.000]   You know what?
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.600]   If you guys like gaming,
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.200]   and you're of a certain age,
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:11.080]   I'll just, because we're talking about this,
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.960]   my friend does a newsletter called 40 Bit,
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:19.800]   and it is a gaming newsletter written by someone who's about
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:22.680]   so designed to evoke that nostalgia.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:23.560]   And it's just talking about
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:27.160]   gaming from a casual old person gamer's view.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:27.640]   I don't know.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.120]   I like it.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:28.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:29.400]   Oh, dish.
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:29.880]   Sorry.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:30.920]   40 is all.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:31.800]   All dish.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:33.000]   All dish.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:33.640]   Okay.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:38.760]   I think I'm actually too old to listen to that old gaming show.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.040]   Yeah, I think I'm big.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:40.760]   It's a newsletter.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:41.720]   It's not a.
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:41.880]   Read it.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:42.920]   It's 40 bit gaming.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.960]   So read40bit.com is the place.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:46.600]   40 bit.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:46.920]   Okay.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.480]   It's a newsletter about video games
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.200]   written specifically for people who are older with
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:53.800]   many responsibilities and not much.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:57.240]   Older than what, Stacy?
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:01.720]   Well, it ends with like class of 90 rules.
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:04.280]   So that's a little older than I am, but you know,
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.400]   it's just fun.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:08.520]   So, but he covers newer games, right?
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:12.280]   Yeah, he covers the news, but he covers it from the standpoint of like,
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:12.680]   I don't have time.
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:15.800]   Somebody who hasn't played anything since Django.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:19.640]   No, it's, it's the idea that you don't have time to like,
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:22.600]   because a lot of gaming publications are super intense.
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.560]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:28.040]   So this is like a, I'm interested, but I'm not that intense about it.
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:30.360]   So it's like, hey, how much does Stadia cost?
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.840]   Is Stadia better than Luna is, you know, whatever.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:33.720]   Oh, I see.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:34.280]   Okay.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:34.840]   Oh, cool.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:39.240]   Well, and he does, he does quote Kevin Tofu.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:43.560]   So Kevin actually occasionally will write for him,
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:48.360]   just because, yeah, it's a guy I used to work with.
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:49.000]   Nice.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.360]   I think so.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.720]   Did you play this concept?
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:53.640]   I did play missed.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.560]   And did you play this?
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.000]   That also may be the last game.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.200]   No idea what that is, sir.
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.720]   No, M-Y-S-T.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.960]   Oh, that's a shocker.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:05.560]   Oh, that was a classic game.
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:06.840]   He might, I don't know.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.040]   It's funny.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.720]   I wasn't in a gamer.
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:15.000]   I played Nintendo and say games and play station and I played Oregon Trail,
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.440]   but most of the time, I was just, right, this wasn't about games though.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:21.000]   This was about kind of like, look what my computer could do.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   Uh, yeah, it was a pretty like PC thing.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.120]   It was kind of a puzzle.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.000]   No, I thought it's cool.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.360]   You can play it in an Oculus Rift now.
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:31.720]   I couldn't see.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:34.360]   You can tell you have to have a Facebook account.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.920]   You can, yes, you can go to the Rift world.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.360]   It's a match.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:38.840]   Don't raise that.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:39.720]   It's going to set them off.
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:40.520]   It's not going to stop.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:41.160]   And play missed.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.600]   Don't, by the end, going to be.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.520]   This is nothing like the original.
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.960]   The travel, this movement, not because it was required,
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:50.840]   but because it was the start.
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:52.040]   But it's from the same company,
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:53.560]   Cyan, the original missed.
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:54.920]   They're still alive.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:58.280]   I think the original missed, wasn't it a hypercard stack?
[00:59:58.280 --> 00:59:59.800]   I feel like it might have been.
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:02.520]   It was very limited by the technology available.
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.040]   This is better, Ant.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.320]   This will give you what it looks like.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.520]   The promise is very static.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.480]   This will release date 1993.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.840]   It's pre-web.
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.680]   It was a puzzle game.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.200]   So this would, in a real game,
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.400]   look like you could, you know,
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.600]   press the buttons and do stuff.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.760]   And you could, but it wasn't animated.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.120]   It would just, you know, it would.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.800]   There was a little bit.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.520]   It had some animation.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.600]   There was a little bit of animation and sound.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.840]   So it was, you know, for our age,
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.800]   but it was beautiful.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.080]   I mean, look how gorgeous it was.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:29.560]   It was pretty.
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.120]   And it was the play.
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.840]   I mean, you'd get kind of hyped up about the puzzles,
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.000]   but overall it was not like, you know,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.160]   do you do something that your, like, a heartbeat would get up.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.920]   Here you are on the Missed Island.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:41.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:45.240]   So Oculus Quest is going to have a 3D.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.800]   That will be kind of fun.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.040]   I'm starting to think I should have a Facebook account,
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.200]   not because of this, although that's one reason.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:01:00.680]   But because basically now if you have any Facebook,
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:01.960]   you can get all Facebook.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.880]   They're taking Facebook, Instagram,
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.440]   Messenger, and WhatsApp,
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.000]   and they're merging it into one big,
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.600]   not one app, but one account will serve you on all of those.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.800]   I thought they did that years ago.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.080]   Now with Oculus.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:17.640]   Now with Oculus.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.240]   There was some, there was some,
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:25.000]   there were some walls, I guess.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   I don't know about the personal information.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.400]   I'm sure traveled completely, poriously.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.960]   But they wanted some autonomy for each of the groups.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:35.400]   But they've, you remember the Yankoom and the creators
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.040]   of WhatsApp kind of left and didn't care for them.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.320]   Bit by bit, these people left.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:45.640]   And so all kind of the tables cleared so the mark could unify it.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.360]   The Fast Company article by Harry McCracken
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.040]   talks to Stan Chudnovsky,
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:57.320]   who came to Facebook and is running this.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.880]   He talks about the Zuckerberg Manifesto
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.840]   we talked a lot about last year on, you know,
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:06.840]   encrypted privacy focused social networking.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.560]   And that's, I guess, what's going on.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.600]   Yesterday Facebook introduced a count center,
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.720]   which is a single hub where you can view change
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.680]   and settings across all the Facebook platforms.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.600]   You can log into each service.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.280]   You can automatically cross post.
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:25.400]   I don't think they had that before on all of them.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.920]   So you could push out something on Messenger, WhatsApp, Facebook,
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.240]   and Instagram all at the same time.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.720]   That gave Instagram messaging features,
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.320]   which it had lacked before.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.200]   Well, they had this little weird messaging,
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.840]   but now it's based on what's at,
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.440]   or I'm sorry, Facebook Messenger.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.680]   And if you're on Instagram,
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:48.120]   you'll be able to chat with friends on Messenger and vice versa.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.960]   You're right.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.320]   - It's totally mixed up.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.760]   - In the face of antitrust, this is interesting choice of timing.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.120]   - And privacy.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.400]   - And privacy.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.480]   Well, but everybody's kind of known.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.920]   You've any one of those.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.600]   - But it used to be that used to be,
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.560]   oh my God, they're going to do that.
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.200]   We have to shut them down.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:04.760]   This is awful.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.640]   And now it's kind of people's in.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:06.280]   - All right.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.680]   - You kind of German word of the day.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.960]   - Dotten Schutz.
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.160]   - Dotten Schutz?
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.440]   - Dotten Schutz.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.160]   - That is Dotten.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.360]   Vassus Das.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.160]   - Data protection.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.160]   It's the only word they have for privacy.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.200]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.480]   They don't have a word privacy.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.360]   - Not really.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:26.360]   I wonder if some of this, I've been wondering,
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.640]   we're a month from an election,
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.600]   we're three months if President Trump doesn't win.
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.080]   We're three months away from a transition of power.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:37.400]   I wonder if between now and January 20th,
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.720]   we're going to see companies saying quick.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.120]   - Fix this.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.880]   - Do as things as quick as you can.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:46.200]   - Oh, so they're in there as a precedent.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.640]   - Before the new regime,
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.320]   not that the new, if there's a new regime,
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:55.080]   the new regime couldn't still say, hey, antitrust.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.640]   But right now where it maybe is perhaps a more favorable
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.840]   antitrust environment.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.520]   - So what else would you expect them to do?
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:03.800]   Amazon, I would imagine would do things too.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.800]   - I think Amazon is, let's in fact.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.240]   - Are they not already doing it?
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.600]   - We'll talk about what Amazon's doing.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.640]   - You're welcome.
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:10.680]   You're welcome.
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:11.960]   - Well done.
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:12.760]   A nice--
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.120]   - Stacy's been waiting for this.
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.160]   - Yeah.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.680]   - I have been--
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.000]   - All right.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.520]   Well, then I'm going to make you wait a little longer.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.280]   Let me do a commercial and then when we come back--
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.320]   - Wow.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.200]   - The tease.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.160]   - I do like doing that.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:28.840]   When we come back, we will talk about all the things Amazon announced,
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.920]   including a new gaming service to compete with Stadia,
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.400]   Google's gaming service, called Luna.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.880]   But first of all, you know what?
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.640]   You're not going to mind this ad because I know you know Stacey all about Twilio.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.640]   Twilio's.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:44.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.480]   See, I knew I would get that right.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.840]   - I just wrote about them today.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.960]   - Aren't they awesome?
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.720]   They just actually did something new, didn't they?
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.000]   And it's not in the ad copy.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.400]   But they just announced something.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.040]   I'm trying to remember.
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:54.760]   I saw the news.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.840]   - Their IOT platform.
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:57.320]   - That's what it was.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.280]   - Microvisor.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.800]   You can go to my site and read all about it.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:00.520]   It's like, ready?
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:06.280]   Twilio Super Sim had a baby with electric imp and they created an IOT platform.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:11.880]   - What's really cool about Twilio is platform is a perfect word for Twilio.
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:14.680]   It's a communications platform.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:20.280]   And if you're a developer, but you want to add all these great communications features
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:23.880]   to your app, to your tools, the place to go is Twilio.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:31.240]   I even do it because I just love being able to engage with the global communications network
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:34.120]   in my programs with just a few lines of code.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:39.960]   Twilio lets you engage customers on any channel, anywhere they are,
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:46.600]   from text messages to emails to phone calls to video and more one single powerful platform.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.960]   And yes, now an IOT platform as well.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:51.640]   And let me tell you, they do this at scale.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:59.320]   Twilio powers 795 plus billion interactions across all channels with 5 nines of uptime.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.280]   That's 99.999% uptime.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:07.800]   3 billion phone numbers available across more than 100 countries.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:11.080]   I mean, Twilio lets you do anything you want.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:15.080]   Blue Apron powers their newsletter emails with Twilio's SendGrid.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.160]   Netflix uses Twilio.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:20.120]   You probably do too for two factor authentication.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:27.480]   We love Twilio's Authy, but Netflix uses it on their side to make it easy for you to really secure your account.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:33.880]   If you ever order a ride or groceries from Lyft or Uber and you get a text message,
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.520]   it's on its way. Guess who? Twilio.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:41.480]   Twilio. Product and operations teams use Twilio to create new ways to communicate with
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:46.600]   their customers inside their applications ranging from account notifications with text messaging
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:51.000]   to chatbots to securing online accounts with two-factor authentication.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.840]   Marketing teams love Twilio to get the word out, connecting with leads over text messaging and phone calls,
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:00.920]   send campaigns over email, build chatbots to answer questions.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:06.760]   Customer service teams build global contact and support centers with Twilio Flex, a fully
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:13.640]   programmable contact center application platform. Twilio gives you the tools to add
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:20.600]   communications to whatever you're doing. It lets your developers control the global communications
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:25.320]   network with just a few lines of code. You don't need to be some specialized telecom network
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:30.120]   engineer, and that's why Twilio is such an important innovation because it used to be you really had
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:35.560]   to know how this stuff worked. You had to be a super guru. If you already know, if your
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:40.680]   developers already know how to build web applications, you've got the exactly skills you need to
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:46.520]   build apps that can text, call, chat, video conferencing with a few lines of code from Twilio.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:51.320]   It's because Twilio is built by developers, for developers. So, strengthen your customer
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:57.400]   relationships by uniting communications across your entire business. Go to Twilio.com to learn
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:04.440]   more today. Twilio.com to learn more today. It's time to build with Twilio.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:11.240]   So, the super sim module, which is Twilio's...
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:19.000]   It's their connectivity module that you can, that you basically buy and they give you
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   access to whatever cell network you need. And they bought an IoT platform provider, Electric Imp,
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:31.720]   that does security updates, that basically gives you a... They made a module that had Wi-Fi or
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:39.320]   cellular on it that was designed to automatically check for security flaws and it would...
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:39.960]   Perfect.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:45.160]   What sort I'm looking for. It would automatically update those and keep that consistent for you,
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:50.440]   so your team doesn't have to do it. And that was the key with Electric Imp. So, with this,
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:55.400]   their platform takes all of that and brings it down to microcontrollers, which are the tiny
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:59.640]   embeddings and things that sensors and your washing machine maybe. So,
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:06.040]   what they're doing is with this platform, when you buy a module from them, you get the remote
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:12.120]   debugging, remote vulnerability checking, and the ability to program in whatever language you
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:17.160]   want without having to, again, worry about what the cellular provider is doing. So, you get to do
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:22.200]   all of that and you get to do it for one price for 10 years, which is really awesome.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:27.000]   Oh, so this is nice for consumers too. This is not just an enterprise play because
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.440]   this is the problem making consumer devices. Yes, this is why your metal or your pet net goes
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:37.160]   out, and why you have to buy a weak subscription now. Because they don't make enough money,
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:42.440]   when they just sell the hardware, now you've got to keep supporting it forever. So, this makes it
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:46.440]   much more doable for them to continue to provide firmware upgrades and security support
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:52.040]   on these products without charging a subscription, or even maybe a lower subscription fee.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.440]   Yeah, this just still feels like an app, but it is actually a big deal.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:02.520]   Oh, no, that's huge. It competes with Microsoft Azure Sphere, but Azure Sphere only works with
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:06.520]   A-class processors and other things. So, this is for my performance.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:12.600]   It makes IoT more secure, I'm all for. I did finally, I was talking about this the other day,
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:18.280]   upgrade my whole home network. We put in ethernet everywhere, but I also put in Ubiquity,
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:24.760]   Gear, Ubiquity, Dream Machine, Pro Switch. I mean, actually, that's more the router, and then a
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:31.800]   PoE switch and a bunch of- I thought you had a rackness. Yeah, well, I got rid of it.
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:41.720]   So, I wanted- I need for a week. For a week, I had a rackness. I wanted, oh, long, I wanted
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:46.920]   something like Ubiquity or Ruckus, something I could control. But the installer who's putting in
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:51.480]   the wiring also does home theater and all that kind and said, he talked me into it. He said,
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:55.560]   "Oh, no, no, no, look. It's the same hardware, but here's the difference.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:01.480]   This has a capability that I can- if you're having a problem with your network, I can log in
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:05.640]   and fix it." Oh, he's got the hook in your mouth, huh? And he said, "And I'll never charge
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:09.240]   you for that." I said, "Oh, well, that's good." Because part of the reason- main reason we're
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:13.320]   doing it, that I was saying earlier, is Lisa now works at home. She was complaining about
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:17.960]   stuff going out and stuff, "I'm at work. I can't help." So I thought, "Oh, nice. It's basically
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:23.240]   somebody else will be doing the IT." So we put it in. And by the way, this gear is not cheap. It's
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:29.560]   more expensive, but much more- twice as much as Ubiquity. It's premium priced. I'm sure there's a huge
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:35.320]   markup. And it worked great. It's not that it worked with great, but then the installer disappeared.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:41.000]   And like, there's lights on in the bedroom from the access point. I want to turn it off. I can't.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.320]   I want to change the password, the default password on the gear. I can't.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:51.800]   I go to the support site. I leave a ticket. Crickets.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:57.320]   This gets better. I email. He's never going to charge you because he's never going to do anything.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:01.880]   It's like, I don't want- I mean, look, I appreciate you keeping- if you would do it,
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:08.280]   be my IT guy, but if you disappear, so I call him up and said, "Finally, I found his phone,
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.800]   his mobile phone." He said, "Well, he's just calling me on my mobile phone." I said, "But dude,
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:17.080]   you set up a support site. You said email. You set up all this stuff, and I have to call you on
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:21.320]   your cell phone. What if you're not home? What if you don't answer?" So I said, "Come get it. This
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:26.520]   is not working for me." So he took the Arachnist stuff out, and I had to pay with stocking fee,
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:29.000]   but at least he was able to- Yeah, I was going to say there was one more thing with that.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.400]   Well, cost me to give it back. I had to pay to give it back. But I understand that it's not brand
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:40.440]   new gear anymore. So there's a restocking fee, and I just put ubiquity, and it's so much better.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:45.160]   And you know what, Stacey? Do in the VLAN for your IoT stuff? Trivial.
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:53.400]   Oh, yeah. Everybody is everybody's favorite. Yeah. So, so simple. So I'm very happy, except that I
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:13:01.480]   can't get in right now. Okay, so you may not stay happy forever. I don't want to sound like a
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:05.960]   malcontent, but I don't know. So I'm pretty- You know what? Here's the problem. This is why I wanted
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:11.880]   him to do it. I think I did some security thing that now I can't get in this. I have to probably be
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:17.640]   on site to get into it, because I'm at logging in, and it won't log in. So I have to figure that
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:24.440]   one out. I might have to reboot everything. Is Lisa able to work now or she- Yeah, yeah. No,
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:29.800]   it's all working. I just can't get into it, which is good probably. That's security. They have a-
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.960]   There's a lot of security in the Ubiquariq here. And the other thing that's very interesting,
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:41.080]   and I never really knew before, constant scans. They're a constant. So I turn on, they have a AI
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:48.440]   threat protection tool, which I- You could turn on. And I'm getting scanned maybe 10, 15 times a day
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:55.800]   by- From all over the world for- Mostly for Tor exits or Tor nodes. Apparently they're looking-
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:00.280]   There's probably some hack with a Tor node or an exit node. So I'm getting scanned for that.
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:07.160]   A couple of times it got scanned for Net Biosport 139. So there's people. There-
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.920]   Most people you just don't know, because your gear is not recording it or not telling you.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:17.480]   And I, by the way, this gear is all 100% stealth. They're going to shields up. It's
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:22.360]   Steve's a sight. It's not responding back. So we're just getting scanned. They're not
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.600]   being- The attack doesn't go on because they don't hear anything back. But still,
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:30.680]   the fact that they're scanning on these ports, I'm sure they're scanning the whole internet on
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:36.840]   these ports all the time. I remember years and years and years ago when I was trying to
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:42.520]   muck around with networking and things like that in the house and put FTP software on a computer
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:47.480]   to see if I could transfer files and watching those logs on that FTP software. Oh, constant.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:53.640]   Yeah. Oh my gosh. Like, where is this coming from? You know. Amazing.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:57.320]   All right, Stacy, you've been extraordinarily patient. I gave you a little Twilio.
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:59.480]   Keep you happy.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:08.760]   Just like Chris Wallace said, here's a question you're going to like, Mr. President.
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:11.720]   Don't leave it. You don't have to answer it.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.760]   You don't have to answer it, but here's what you're going to like. You like this one.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:28.280]   It's okay. It was 2020 hardware event, which I didn't even know about. I was kind of perturbed.
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.960]   It's like, wait, they had a hardware event. They didn't tell me. Well, it was a streamed.
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:37.960]   Yeah. It was. And you would have known about it if you had if I had been on the show that
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:41.080]   we before, because I would have told me about it. I would have been like, guess what's it
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:47.080]   tomorrow you go? But it was very exciting. Last Thursday. Last Thursday, it was.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:52.760]   I was actually surprised because Amazon had been releasing all of this really interesting news
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:56.280]   ahead of the event. I was like, oh, maybe they're just not going to do the September event where
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:02.920]   they like release 120 pieces of news all in like an hour. But no, that still happened. So,
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:08.280]   so how was it? How did you join the event? Was it them? If it wasn't streamed, how was an event?
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.560]   Did the tree fall in the forest? It was an invite for the media in this virtual
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:21.000]   private conference. So there was a stream. But we couldn't watch it. It was on Amazon Chime. So,
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:27.240]   you know, how many times have you used Amazon Chime? Is that like their doorbell?
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:33.560]   That's their teams slash zoom slash. Oh my god. Did you have to? Okay, tell the truth. Do you
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:39.800]   have install it just to use it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, no, there was a web version. Actually,
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:43.720]   for this one, you didn't have to what? Okay, I lied. I had an interview that was on Chimes
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:49.000]   afterwards. So maybe the whole event was on on Chimes. Okay. Scratch that whole thing. I'm unsure.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.600]   So they had a platform. It's a new video. Was it live or was it like the Google event today?
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:17:01.960]   Just kind of can't. It was pre recorded. It was pre recorded in the places that the event is
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:07.160]   normally hosted. So David Limp came to us from the spheres and talked to us.
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:13.560]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that's where they usually hold the event, which again is not streamed. It is
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:17.800]   only for the press. All the previous ones have not been streamed either to my knowledge.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:22.760]   Unless last year's. And how many and how many things did they announce?
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:28.280]   I don't remember. You know, I just I gave up, but they did say they had some really nice
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   stats, which was that like, oh crap, hold on. Let me just pull up the story because there's a lot
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:42.360]   of data here because they released a bunch of news. The biggest news items, I thought, and I did
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:48.360]   a story about this and it's worse. I'm not it was really about the data. Yeah. So they announced a
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:52.920]   bunch of products. So some of the products they talked about ring had some interesting products,
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:58.680]   including the always was it always on cam? I can never deal with their names.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:04.120]   Always home. Always home cam. That's the that's the one that got the most
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:09.640]   attention because it was a drone that flies around your house with a camera checking things
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:17.400]   out when you're not around. Right. So everyone was like, what the heck? Crazy. It was crazy.
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:27.240]   Is that $249 $249 $99 ring doorbell on a drone? And but they also announced a ring camera for
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:32.920]   your car. Oh, they announced a ring connect, which is an API that connects your car. Hold on. Hold on.
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:36.040]   Hold on. Say there. Yeah. Sorry. It can't report you what way.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:44.120]   Your car externally. Extraly. Okay. So it's a dash cam. Actually, a dash cam. Sorry. Yes.
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:47.160]   Okay. And they also actually have a way so you could say,
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:51.960]   Madam, a I'm being pulled over it would automatically start recording,
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:54.280]   which people kind of glossed over, but I was like,
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:19:01.160]   Oh, that's big. Yeah. Yeah. I had the owl cam for a long time. And that was another feature. You
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:08.280]   had to say, okay, presto. It would record. Actually, you would take the recording from the
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:13.160]   it would start backwards. Because it was always right. Which because if you have an accident,
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:17.640]   you know, you want to record the things leading up to the accident, it didn't have the the cup
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:21.880]   cam because that would because I don't think you could just say record everything from now
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:27.080]   until I tell you stop. Yeah, that's basically what that is, which I thought was an interesting,
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:33.800]   one, it was an acknowledgement of ring has historically been working with police. And this is like,
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:39.160]   Oh, hey, we're working with you too. They also announced encryption for ring cameras and the
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:45.720]   data that is pulling. So the idea being that, Oh, hello, yes. Right. Can't believe they didn't have that.
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:56.040]   They were just streaming in the clear. I guess. That's all they know they couldn't have been
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:02.120]   streaming into the clear. They they get they basically, they probably, let me I don't remember
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.680]   because nobody paid attention to that part. Again, these are like in this event, it's one sentence.
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:12.680]   Oh, it's end to end encryption. So they don't have access to it. That's huge. Because they really
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:17.320]   got a lot of criticism because that video can be shared with the police, although not without
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:22.920]   your consent. But I think there are people were kind of nervous about what happened to the video
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:28.440]   that your ring doorbell took actually took my ring out and replaced it with a hello door from
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:36.440]   Nest. Yeah. And the biggest news for most normal people is that the echo now has a new form
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:42.520]   factor and that form factor is a round ball. It's an orb. This actually, this is exactly
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:50.760]   what Google with its whatever they call their Nest speaker is going to get same price, 99 bucks.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:57.400]   It's a smaller fabric covered form factor offering supposedly better sound three inch
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:02.520]   woofer dual tweeters Dolby sound processing. We're going to have to get both and just do a head to
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:07.320]   head I think. Sure. Which one sounds better? Although really your decision
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:12.200]   shouldn't, should mostly be on which platform you're going with echo or Google voice, right?
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:20.840]   Yeah, I do both. But yeah, but yeah, but we're weird. Is it interesting that it supports Zigbee,
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:27.160]   BLE and Wi-Fi? Yes. And it also adds a new radio. Sidewalk.
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:34.840]   So to me, this was the announcement that had the most interest, not the sensor that you put on
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:39.160]   your mailbox so that you know you've got mail. So they didn't actually announce sidewalk though
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:44.520]   at this event. They announced sidewalk couple of days ago. That Monday beforehand. Yeah. Do we
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:49.640]   talk? We you weren't here. I wasn't here. On Twitter Sunday a little bit. Oh, we did talk about it.
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:53.480]   Yeah. And I was still a little bit confused about it. Oh my gosh. We didn't have space.
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:58.200]   Oh my gosh. We got we got the person. We got the person. Before we do that, Stacy, turn your
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:02.280]   head sideways. I want to see your profile. Oh, no, no, I'll go ahead. I won't make you do that.
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:07.080]   I have a petite. No, you have a petite nose though.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:13.640]   Oh, well, I've broken it at least. Well, I broke it once and I didn't heal. It healed broken
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:18.680]   because when I went to the ER, they were like, it's not broken. And then past I went up later.
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:23.400]   I was like, it is clearly broken. But you know, it gives you the you know, every,
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:29.720]   every beautiful person has some unusual feature that draws the eye. So it's good.
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:35.800]   Yeah. You don't want to have regular features. Right. My facial features.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:43.000]   So let's talk about. But I hope the I hope when you got in that street fight that you gave it as
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:50.920]   good as you got. Oh, no, I passed out and I fell. Oh, you didn't have to tell me that. You could
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:55.320]   say you should know. I just I had a I had a health thing where I passed out a lot.
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:58.040]   Yeah. No, that's terrible. One of the downsides of passing out.
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:08.120]   Sometimes you land in your nose. Wow. So sidewalk. I'm really excited about this. And
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:14.680]   all of this. So what Amazon basically said all the way back in 2019, they were like,
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:18.440]   hey, we have all of these ring devices that we want to stick on the outside of the house,
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:25.320]   but connectivity out there really sucks. So we need to solve this problem. So what they did is they
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:30.840]   invented it. A technology. It's a wireless protocol called sidewalk and sidewalk low,
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:36.600]   low bandwidth, right? Doesn't transmit a huge. It's not another Wi-Fi. Okay, sorry, sorry,
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:43.960]   save your questions or comments. Don't hit me. Don't my nose. All right. So
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:52.760]   so what it is, is it's this protocol that lets you send tiny amounts of bandwidth
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:58.600]   and data back and forth and then Wi-Fi is the back call to the whole like to the internet itself.
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:02.760]   So these are not directly connected to the internet. They're connected to some sort of hub in your
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:07.640]   house. That's important. So you have to have a sidewalk hub, but most of these ring cameras
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:13.400]   would be almost any ring device you'd have would be. And what it's going to do is it's going to
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:18.680]   do so. And then it uses your Wi-Fi to get back. Even these echoes, even these echoes are hubs,
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:26.040]   sidewalk ridges. Right. Yeah. Okay. So that's the idea at the time they launched a dog collar
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:31.080]   because they were like, Hey, here's a dog collar that you can use to track this dog all around
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:36.920]   the neighborhood because it's shared. Well, this is but that presumes that your neighbors are also
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:45.640]   installing this, right? Dude, I'm just gonna go have a cookie. You take a ease up Johnny,
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:55.720]   may ease up. So what happened last week is Amazon said, Hey, that test we did with the dog collar
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:01.720]   in like 700 ring cameras and stuff in LA. That was great. We're gonna announce that we're gonna do
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:07.560]   this everywhere. So the new Echo devices that you buy have a sidewalk radio in it. The new
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:12.520]   era routers that you buy will have a sidewalk radio in it. Several of the new ring devices will
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:17.240]   have a sidewalk radio in it. And what they're going to be doing is the giant mesh network that
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:23.720]   transmits data. Again, not a lot of data, just a little data. And they're going to use people's
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:28.680]   wireless Wi-Fi networks as back all. So you have to agree to do this, right? You have to say,
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:32.520]   yes, share my bandwidth, because it is going to take just a little bit of your bandwidth, but not
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:38.520]   much. Jamie Simmanoff was like, it's like borrowing a cup of sugar. And the net result of this is
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:47.560]   there is a huge network for things out there now that people can use. So I can have my dog
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:53.000]   tracker tile actually said that they were going to put tiles on this network. And so
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:26:02.120]   this is a big deal because a lot of IoT devices don't need a lot of data, but they also don't
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:05.400]   want to spend like a lot of money for a cellular connection, which is a usual wire.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:13.480]   Disconnected IoT. Yeah. So this gives you a low cost, highly available network. And because
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:18.920]   Amazon's embedding it in their devices, they can create this network everywhere.
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:26.440]   How many, so I'm trying to figure out what neighborhoods is going to be available in or not,
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:31.720]   because how many devices, like does everybody in my neighbor have to have some device that's a
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:37.960]   bridge or? And how does it get to the street? Like my Wi-Fi doesn't get to the street. That's
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:43.000]   the whole point. So I would have to have not only an ear or an echo or something.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.920]   Because you're locked in my house, then I'd have to put one of those sensors,
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:51.080]   because it's mesh, right? So if I put a sensor on my mailbox, for instance,
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:55.800]   now I've extended it out to the street and I could conceivably be part of a mesh network.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:00.840]   But how nearby does the next one have to be? What's the density required for this?
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:07.000]   So Amazon hasn't talked a lot about this in I apologize because somebody is trying to get into
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000]   my iTunes account from Madrid. So I'm kind of like, what's happening.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:17.960]   My name is Tethi Higambatham. You're kidding me, it's a bad word.
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:23.320]   No, you're going to die. It's not me, I swear to God.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:28.200]   No, I have a suspicion to it is. It's not nefarious, I hope.
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:31.160]   Okay, you asked a question that was a good question.
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:36.440]   Yeah, well, all of this depends on a certain density of network so that it works.
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:41.640]   So they're using sub-gigga hertz. The theory is this is going to be...
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.240]   915 megahertz, right? Something like that.
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.200]   915 megahertz.
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:48.840]   And this can go roughly about a mile.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:54.600]   So from a density perspective, most cities, as long as people have Amazon devices,
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:56.600]   you're probably going to...
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:00.680]   In other words, if there's somebody within a mile of me with another Amazon device, we have a network.
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:03.160]   Yes.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.720]   My dog, you wouldn't be able to keep on my dog.
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:05.720]   And they opt in.
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:07.480]   And what?
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:09.640]   They opt into sharing...
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.040]   They have to say they want to participate.
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:15.320]   But my dog, you wouldn't have the granularity of location.
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.480]   You know it's somewhere within that mile.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:18.600]   You'd have to...
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.600]   Well, you're triagellate.
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:21.880]   Does it triagellate?
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:22.360]   Oh, like triagellation.
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:23.800]   How does it determine location?
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.640]   I'm assuming...
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:26.120]   Is it by strength?
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:26.440]   Okay.
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:31.080]   I don't know if they're doing RSSI or they are just saying,
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:32.920]   "Hey, this Amazon's located at this address."
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:38.840]   This particular node that it talked to is at 1415 Avenue A.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.640]   So you don't have to have the sidewalk,
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:43.560]   mailbox, or the side...
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:47.560]   You don't have any sidewalk external devices.
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:51.880]   You're participating if you turn it on in your euro or your echo or whatever.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.560]   And now you're part of the larger mesh.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.320]   This is interesting.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:58.440]   So we talked about this on Sunday.
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.880]   I hypothesized that really,
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:03.400]   this is because Amazon's a logistics company.
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:08.440]   And the real benefit to them is in delivery trucks and things like that.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:11.160]   It could be for that.
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:11.640]   I mean, it's like...
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:13.640]   Oh, sorry, go ahead.
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:14.120]   No, go ahead.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:14.760]   No, you go ahead.
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:19.080]   No, I was just going to say it will help with asset tracking for anything.
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:22.200]   But it also gives Amazon...
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.960]   This is a problem that we have yet to solve with IoT.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:31.720]   So now there can be lots of low cost connected devices
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:33.720]   that report back occasionally or...
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:34.200]   It's pretty cool.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:35.720]   Is it...
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.160]   See, that's my question.
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:45.240]   This sounds pretty cool, but what would give people the incentive to actually opt in
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:47.640]   when they think about the larger scope of all this?
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:49.320]   This isn't just there...
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:53.080]   That's going to be the trick, isn't it?
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:57.720]   The trick is going to be you've got to have a tile tracker or a mailbox sensor,
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:00.360]   or one of the other devices that uses this.
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.760]   Then you'd opt in because you want to participate.
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:05.080]   What's the lowest cost tracker?
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:06.040]   That's the good question.
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:09.080]   So can you imagine that Amazon puts one of these in every package?
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:09.560]   Box.
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:10.120]   In every box.
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:10.840]   That's where I was at.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:11.480]   Every box.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:13.640]   And so you know exactly where your package is.
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:16.920]   If it's arrived, if it's been stolen, you know all of that information.
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:17.400]   I think that's...
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.000]   This is still too expensive for that.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:19.480]   Oh, it is.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:19.960]   Okay.
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:23.400]   Unless you're doing something really...
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.480]   Unless it's a higher value item.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:28.600]   Because it needs a transmitter, it needs a battery...
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:31.640]   Got a transmitter, you've got a battery, you've got a microcontroller,
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.200]   all of that.
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.280]   This is not like a passive RFID 10.
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:35.640]   It's like five-stage.
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:36.360]   All right.
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:41.320]   But it is conceivable that you could have an RFID reader.
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:43.000]   That's where I was going to go with that.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.480]   I was like, you could put an RFID reader on your package box.
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:48.120]   Right.
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:50.040]   So instead of taking a picture of my package,
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:53.240]   when you just dump it in the thing, it's like, boop, arrived.
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:56.120]   So that is an option.
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:31:00.360]   What might be interesting, ideally if you're a thief stealing packages,
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:02.440]   you probably aren't going to be
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:06.760]   running around with reading camera devices in your car.
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:07.400]   But maybe you do.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.720]   And if you pick it up, maybe it reads your package there.
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:10.360]   That would be a while.
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:12.680]   Amazon's going to have this in their trucks, Stacy.
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.320]   Right?
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:17.880]   So what is Amazon learned by driving around with their trucks?
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:22.360]   What, you know, like the old Google got in trouble for sniffing your Wi-Fi,
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:26.280]   for mapping purposes.
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:30.280]   What can Amazon's trucks learn as they go by?
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:35.000]   I mean, they could learn who has Amazon devices in their homes,
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.520]   like, but Amazon doesn't know that.
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:36.840]   So they already know that?
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:41.320]   Because usually, I mean, when you log into an Amazon device,
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:44.360]   you usually give it your address so it can tell you things about that address.
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:49.480]   Another thing Amazon is doing is they're putting in an AI chip
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:55.000]   in the AZ-1 neural engine edge processor and all of their devices now, too.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000]   What's that all about?
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.200]   What's their goal with that?
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:31:59.320]   Okay.
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.600]   So we're off-sideblock.
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:02.280]   But I wanted to make one more sidewalk.
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:02.520]   Okay.
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:04.680]   More sidewalk.
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:07.640]   Come on back to the drone before you leave all this.
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:08.840]   Yeah, we're not done with the...
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:11.000]   Who's on-
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.200]   I think having Amazon, because this is basic infrastructure,
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:17.320]   think like AWS has now become a basic infrastructure.
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:21.160]   What Amazon is doing is providing basic infrastructure for an IoT network.
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:24.840]   You see Apple doing something similar with Apple tags,
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.600]   which I know they haven't announced.
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:30.200]   But what I think, and I'm surprised, and I'll bring this back to Google,
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:32.280]   that Google isn't doing something like this,
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.640]   because Google's usually fairly astute about infrastructure.
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:39.000]   And it kind of signals to me that Google's...
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.400]   I don't know if they're just not thinking this way,
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.960]   but they're like, "Eh, IoT connectivity."
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:47.720]   They all sort of have the range of IoT products that Amazon does.
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:49.400]   They don't, but Google...
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:51.880]   I mean, Google's Google, they could figure out a way to...
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:52.360]   They could.
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:54.600]   And I mean, they've got Android phones out there.
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:55.720]   They're listening to business.
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.560]   Oh, yeah, you could put it in phones.
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:02.120]   So anyway, so I just want to try it back to Google for everyone,
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:03.800]   who's like, "Why are we still talking about Amazon?"
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:05.560]   No, no, this is a huge story.
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:09.480]   I think Sidewalk is a really interesting...
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:13.560]   And by the way, I should have been paying more attention to it,
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.080]   because they announced it last year...
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:17.800]   I painted it into this whole time.
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:18.280]   I know.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.000]   He did.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.520]   Which means I should pay more attention.
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:22.360]   I've been on the floor before they announced it.
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:25.720]   I said, because Jamie actually came to a conference,
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:29.320]   a chip conference that I was at, and he talked about what they were going to do.
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:30.200]   And then they announced it last year.
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:32.200]   Do you think this is Jamie Siminoff's idea or...
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.520]   He's just intrigued.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:37.000]   I think Jamie saw the need.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.920]   This is not a need that...
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:41.880]   We have all in the IoT space seen the need for this.
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:46.840]   Jamie, I think with Amazon's scale, suddenly realized that he could make this real.
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:47.320]   Yes.
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.280]   We've seen...
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:50.120]   And I'll give you a sneak peek,
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:53.000]   because my IEEE column doesn't come out until like November.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.920]   But what's happened in 2020 is a big business model shift
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:00.360]   for low-power wide-area networks for the Internet of Things.
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.840]   And so we've seen a bunch of companies come out
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:06.120]   with options that we haven't ever had before.
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:09.320]   So I think we're actually going to get always on trackers,
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:12.840]   and the ability to track our dog, and the ability to track our kid,
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:14.680]   and sensors that I could...
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:17.560]   If I want to test my neighborhood's air quality,
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:19.960]   I can just stick them in trees and make them work,
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:21.560]   and gather all this data.
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:22.920]   So it's going to be really cool.
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:25.000]   So when Lo banned with...
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.520]   So how much data can you send?
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:29.080]   Or you just send it over a lengthier period of time, I guess?
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.760]   So I am begging...
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:34.200]   I've been begging Amazon for three weeks now to give me something...
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:36.840]   Give me a person to interview on sidewalk,
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.120]   because I have had...
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:40.120]   When they announced it back in 2019,
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:41.480]   because I'm such a nerd, I was like,
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:43.240]   "Oh, tell me more!"
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:44.200]   All the limitations.
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:47.000]   You immediately saw what was going on with that.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.600]   Because it is.
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:49.640]   It's a whole new network.
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:50.520]   It's really exciting.
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:52.520]   For me.
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:53.400]   Sorry, y'all.
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:54.200]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:55.000]   No, no, no, no.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:55.560]   You're not alone.
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:56.440]   Put it down.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:57.640]   No, this is really interesting.
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:59.800]   What's the standards piece here?
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:03.800]   Interoperability with anybody else grows and cons.
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:07.640]   So Amazon is using their own proprietary thing.
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:09.240]   They're probably going to tell you they're using it
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.680]   because it's more secure.
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:12.440]   Their rival networks send it,
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.800]   just raise $16 million.
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:16.680]   Their rival network that's doing this in the utility space.
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:18.680]   I've got the helium router behind me.
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:22.120]   They're doing both Laura Nguyen
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:26.360]   and also just a proprietary low-power wide-area network.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.720]   There's less satellite options,
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:28.680]   but those are super expensive.
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:30.200]   So we're not going to count those here.
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.560]   There's SIG-Fox.
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:33.960]   The telcos have NB-IOT.
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:35.960]   So right now, there's no standard.
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:38.520]   Amazon is not promoting a standard.
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:40.680]   So we're all hosed on that front, Jeff.
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.600]   Thank you.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.360]   I knew you'd know.
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:46.360]   Sorry.
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:47.000]   Okay.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.960]   I've got two things.
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:52.680]   The ring mailbox thing, which I actually like.
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:56.280]   Do I have to have all kinds of Amazon hardware
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.600]   to make that work or can that operate just kind of independently?
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:01.080]   Only your neighborhood has to really have it.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:03.320]   No, but you need this little sensor.
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:04.200]   Something.
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:04.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:05.320]   You have to buy the sensor.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.920]   On your mailbox.
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:07.720]   On the mailbox.
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.320]   I buy that on the mailbox.
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:09.960]   I buy that.
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:11.080]   Do I need any other...
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:13.160]   Let's say the rest of my house is all Google.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:14.360]   Can I use the mailbox sensor?
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.760]   Yeah, you would need one Amazon.
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:17.240]   How about you name it?
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:20.520]   Well, even then, how would it report back to you?
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:24.680]   You have to have an Amazon app and the A-word app on your phone
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:27.880]   and an Amazon piece of hardware to get the notification.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:29.560]   Do you have to have an echo?
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:31.960]   No, I don't think you have to have the hardware, right?
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:33.240]   You just have that on the side.
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:34.840]   What's your A-word app attached to?
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.760]   It's attached to the sidewalk, I guess.
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:39.160]   Your A-word's attached to your app.
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:42.120]   So if you download the Madam A app on the phone.
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:44.920]   And you say, "I have a mailbox sensor." That's enough.
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:48.040]   And I don't know the answer yet, Jeff.
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:50.600]   And I'm sorry for not having the answer.
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:53.640]   Amazon, would you answer Stacy's call and give her somebody?
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:54.280]   Come on.
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:55.320]   Are you all dependent on her?
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:55.560]   Yeah.
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:58.040]   There are lots of other people.
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:01.800]   And let me, because seeing it, did the story about the thing.
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:05.560]   Because this is actually the number one thing that people ask us for
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:06.680]   on the IoT podcast.
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.520]   And we haven't had a great solution,
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:11.160]   except for like build your own LoraWAN network.
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:12.760]   And you know, get a LoraWAN sensor.
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:15.400]   You say, "Lora, L-O-R-A." What does that stand for?
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.320]   Long range?
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:17.800]   What is it?
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:21.960]   This is the 900 megahertz.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:25.240]   Yeah, I don't know what Lora stands for.
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:27.720]   LoraWAN.
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:31.720]   Low power wide area networking protocol.
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:32.760]   Yeah.
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:38.760]   So that's a networking protocol for these long...
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.040]   Sorry.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:41.720]   LP WANs.
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:44.360]   Low power wide area networks.
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:45.880]   I'm going to bet.
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:47.400]   I mean, maybe it doesn't require it,
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:51.480]   but I'm going to bet Amazon expects you to have at least one Amazon device in the house.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:51.960]   Let me see.
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.800]   That supports sidewalk, Jeff.
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:55.080]   But you might do that.
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:55.080]   You might do that.
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.640]   Get one little echo sphere or a...
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:00.040]   So yeah, let's talk about the new echoes.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:03.800]   And the smart chip that Amazon developed to build into it.
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:04.040]   Yes.
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:07.080]   This artificial intelligence chip that's in them.
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:07.800]   That's amazing.
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.320]   Yeah. So if you buy the 50...
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:14.360]   So if you buy the new echo dot, the cheapest one is $49.99 right now.
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:17.640]   Or I think there's a discount and it's about to be prime day and blah, blah, blah.
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:21.960]   So if you have that plus the sensor, you should be good.
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:30.440]   But inside all of the new echo devices is a new Amazon machine learning chip.
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:31.000]   What's it called?
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.320]   The AZ1.
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:33.800]   What is it?
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:35.000]   I just had it in front of me.
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:37.080]   And it's gone right out of my head.
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:40.840]   AZ1.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:45.800]   And this is a neural edge processor designed by Amazon.
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.120]   This is interesting because there's a ton of companies trying to
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:50.920]   edge processors for machine learning.
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:53.080]   And Amazon was like, eh, none of y'all are any good.
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:54.280]   We're going to build our own.
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:58.440]   And what this is going to do is allow faster processing.
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.200]   So faster response times.
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:03.080]   And on device processing.
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:07.160]   And on device processing for the natural language processing.
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:13.160]   So it's going to understand what you say locally and deliver responses if it can.
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:14.920]   You know what I hope it'll do?
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:17.800]   It'll let me create my own trigger word.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:20.920]   So I don't have to say the A word anymore.
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:23.320]   I feel like we should be getting there.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.840]   Well, you can also just say computer.
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:28.600]   Yeah, you can say Amazon computer or ALEXA.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:32.920]   But I feel like if it has this chip in it, there's some hope.
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.880]   Then it could recognize a different word.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.200]   It's a little bit smarter.
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:38.440]   Yeah.
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:39.720]   What is it?
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:40.200]   What is it?
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:42.840]   When it says neural edge processor, what does that mean?
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:46.520]   Is it lower power processors designed for edge devices?
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:47.640]   Yeah.
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:52.440]   So there's two things to know about machine learning models.
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:54.680]   One is the training, which is super power intensive.
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:56.600]   It happens on GPUs in the cloud.
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:57.720]   The other is inference.
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:59.880]   This can happen in the cloud or on the edge.
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:02.840]   And the edge is basically any device that is not a server in the cloud.
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:08.360]   And what you're seeing in that inference is when they run the model,
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:10.280]   they take in the data that you're giving it.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:13.640]   So the new data and they run it against the model they trained on.
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:14.600]   But they can't learn.
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:15.880]   It can't build a new model.
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:19.800]   It can only apply its inputs against an existing model.
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:25.080]   So the edge stuff though is interesting because it used to be like you'd need,
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:26.920]   if not a GPU.
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:29.400]   And NVIDIA does make lovely GPUs for the edge.
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:32.520]   Intel makes lovely CPUs for the edge.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:38.600]   But what you're seeing is a lot of companies doing even lower powered stuff at the edge.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:42.120]   And this is important not for the Echo devices as much,
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:45.000]   but a battery powered Echo device.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.680]   Or maybe something that has a battery in it,
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:51.560]   or is even plugged in and you just don't want to use as much power,
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:55.800]   you can do things locally that allow it to run faster,
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:57.080]   like recognize a person.
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:00.600]   Or maybe it's your video doorbell that doesn't have access to a lot of power.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:05.160]   It can actually do image recognition with an edge processor.
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:05.960]   Does that make sense?
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:09.320]   By the way, another thing they ask you might want, Jeff,
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.640]   they have a car alarm that uses sidewalk.
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:14.920]   $60, it goes on the OBD-C port,
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:18.040]   which means it gets power from the car and it has no monthly fee.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:20.920]   And it senses broken glass.
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:22.120]   Why do you think I want this?
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:24.200]   Because your car gets stolen all the time.
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.440]   Oh, don't you park in New York City?
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:28.600]   Not anymore.
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:31.720]   I thought you were in those mean streets of Jersey.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:33.960]   When you park again on the mean streets,
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:36.440]   I think that's really interesting.
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:37.720]   That's a $60 car alarm.
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:42.360]   It doesn't make sounds, but uses sidewalk to send you an alert.
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:43.160]   Yeah, thank goodness.
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:46.120]   It will also know if you're being towed.
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:48.200]   Yeah, don't you hate that?
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:49.960]   It will know if you're being towed, Jeff.
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:53.080]   So it can say, hey, you're being towed right now.
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:57.000]   See, these are the kind of things you can start building when you have
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.880]   a reliable network connection anywhere you go.
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:02.440]   And it doesn't require a subscription.
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:03.240]   That is exciting.
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:03.560]   Yeah.
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:04.120]   Very exciting.
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:04.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:06.520]   So also in a tile.
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:13.480]   What is the cost of the relevant hardware in a tile?
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:18.360]   A tile goes for, like, between $12 and $20.
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:22.040]   So my hunch is the bill of materials in a tile is probably,
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:24.440]   I don't know, what's divided by $10.
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:27.560]   So $1.20 to $2.
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:29.080]   See, I wonder what--
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:31.320]   how cheap does it have to get?
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:34.680]   Because that would be sufficient to do the Amazon box thing, a tile.
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:35.960]   Five cents.
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:37.560]   One cent.
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:38.520]   That's the goal.
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:39.320]   That's the goal we have to--
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:43.800]   you're trying to get to, like, in the RFID or the Disposable Space.
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:46.760]   Well, any sort of packaging or disposable.
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:50.040]   Now, there are companies, Jeff, that let you--
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:54.200]   that do returnable, like electronics that you stick into a package.
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:56.840]   And then when you're done with it, you just drop it in the mail.
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:42:59.960]   So there's--
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:02.280]   I can't think of the company, but I interviewed their CEO,
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:03.400]   and it's a cool device.
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:04.760]   But again, that's more for--
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:08.840]   that's not for your, like, bottle of Windex that you bought from Amazon.
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:09.240]   Right, exactly.
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:09.800]   That's exactly.
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:15.160]   So by the way, I'm surprised we went so quickly over the home drone.
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.000]   I'm a bad--
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000]   We just got sidetracked by Cywa.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:19.640]   It's interesting.
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.080]   It's interesting you say that.
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:22.040]   So here's the drone.
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:23.000]   It's got a base--
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.240]   what two words I'm going to bring up that I've heard of.
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:26.200]   Moral panel!
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:27.320]   Oh, here it comes.
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:29.640]   Here's the drone.
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:33.720]   Actually, I was so surprised, because Lisa, my wife won't let me have a camera in the house.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:38.440]   She says, "Well, I might walk around naked, and I don't want that video on the internet."
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:38.840]   So--
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:40.920]   but she immediately loved this.
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:42.520]   What?
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:43.160]   Yes, I know.
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:44.840]   She said, "We're not going to get that," right?
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:45.320]   She said, "I don't know.
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:46.040]   We should definitely get it."
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:46.920]   250 bucks.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:51.000]   It is because the camera's not on when it's in the base.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:51.480]   Right.
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:52.440]   It's controlled by you.
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:58.360]   And it only leaves the base when you're not home and you say, "Hey, what's going on over there?"
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:00.120]   It'll fly your--
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:00.840]   It's terrible to catch.
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:01.400]   When you--
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.000]   It'll terrify them, because it's noisy.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:06.600]   When you intentionally-- so, by the way, they're not trying to make it stealthy.
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:10.680]   When you first get it, you have to map your house out.
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.520]   You have to teach it where you want to go.
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:16.920]   Actually, and this is maybe moral panic territory, because you're basically saying,
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:18.760]   "Here, Amazon, look at everything I've got."
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:21.480]   Here's my home.
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:22.040]   Have a look.
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:23.720]   But you need to do that if you think--
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:25.000]   We've been doing that with our echoes.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:25.400]   Yeah.
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:29.160]   But this is-- you actually have to show it everything.
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:29.640]   It is.
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:32.920]   It has-- obviously, it has obstacle avoidance.
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:34.120]   It's not going to fly into anything.
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:36.440]   But you want to say, "There's the kitchen.
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:37.400]   There's the living room.
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:38.760]   I want you to go here, here, here."
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:39.720]   Take the tour.
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:42.920]   So that seems reasonable.
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:45.640]   And it only records when it's in flight.
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:49.400]   It's loud, so there's no sneaking up on you.
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:53.320]   That actually has a deterrent effect, too, because it might scare bad guys away.
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:57.320]   It would scare me away, if all of a sudden I'm robbing the house.
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:57.880]   One of the biggest--
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:59.000]   He's coming after me.
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:05.240]   It also helps Amazon develop more contextual intelligence about your home.
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:07.960]   So it's Amazon knows that you have a--
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.000]   Oh, as in seeing it.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.760]   Oh, it looks like you need a new Breville.
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:12.360]   That's a nice way to put it.
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:16.200]   No, I'm just saying-- like Amazon knows you have a kitchen, right?
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:20.520]   Because you've labeled a room kitchen in your Echo devices, if you have them.
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:21.640]   So it knows you have a kitchen.
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:23.960]   It knows that you have maybe five lights in the kitchen.
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:24.760]   It knows you have--
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:27.000]   She spent that much money for June oven.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:27.960]   Oh, she's a mark.
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:29.480]   We're going to sell this sucker.
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:31.320]   We found another one.
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.040]   It is less.
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:38.760]   So it is less about product marketing, although I thought they should do that with the cameras that they did have.
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:44.440]   But it's also a way to give Amazon more data about context,
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:49.560]   on what's in your smart home, so you can control it in a way that's a little bit more intuitive.
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:53.880]   So I think we're going to start seeing that.
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:46:00.040]   So like, remember when iRobot announced their kind of smarter version of the room buzz that you're like,
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:03.160]   oh, go under the table and clean up the crumbs.
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:05.720]   And the robot would be like, I know where the table is.
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:06.280]   I'm going to go.
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:10.280]   Amazon's going to give that ability-- well, it will have that ability.
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:14.360]   I don't know if it'll give that ability to others, but it will certainly use it in their own device.
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:17.400]   And that's really how we talk about robots then.
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:17.960]   That's interesting.
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:23.960]   It's a lot of this stuff is very futuristic and honestly kind of cool.
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:27.720]   I mean, I mean, and also,
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:30.520]   fitting a knee.
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:35.320]   It's not like some of the stuff like that Amazon band that they announced a couple of months ago
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:38.680]   is like we're just going to throw spaghetti on the wall and see what sticks.
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:44.040]   But this all like the car alarm, the car alarm for 70 bucks,
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:49.800]   or this Alexa guard, which is actually a new kind of home security feature,
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:54.760]   which can call a helpline and get an ambulance or the fire department.
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:47:00.840]   All of these things are very aggressive in targeting established markets,
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:05.800]   you know, but doing it in a way that only Amazon could do because of sidewalk, because of scale.
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:11.160]   I could see why you might look at this and say, yeah, I think we're going to be in Amazon home.
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:16.200]   Do you think, Stacy, have you heard people be scared about this or feel like it's
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:17.480]   seen at was?
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:24.840]   So I did a poll actually on my my Twitter followers who are obviously self-selecting in,
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:26.520]   you know, that they follow me.
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:34.440]   But I had, let's see, almost 500 people answer and I was like, hey, will you buy the 250
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:42.680]   of the 249 99 ring camera and let's see, 87.9% said no.
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:49.240]   Really? 12.1% said yes. Oh, and there were 489 votes.
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:55.720]   So this is obvious. I mean, again, this is not totally relevant, but people really did not want
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:48:00.680]   this thing. The use cases that people did want it for actually were really interesting.
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:05.000]   Like a second home, they wanted to be able to go through after Hurricane and see what leaked.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:13.800]   For the normal person, I feel like it's kind of overkill just because, I mean,
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:20.200]   how often are people coming into your house to rob you and you're going to notice that?
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:24.040]   Like that feels like a such a manufactured thing.
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:26.200]   It's very rare. It's very US-
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:34.600]   rip. The only use case I can think of is back when Kyle Finn was a little bit younger.
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:39.480]   And every now and then, I wanted to know what that little turd was doing in the house.
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:43.800]   And I could just fire that up and he's talking about his dog as a child, by the way.
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:50.680]   Oh, I was like, you can't use it when people are home, right?
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:54.280]   Right. Well, you could, but it seems like.
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:49:00.440]   Well, they would know. Yeah. It's not a spy device. And they were very careful to make it not be.
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:05.800]   Right. So I just looked up because I was curious, who's more trusted? So Casey Newton
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:11.720]   in March of this year, I just put it in the bottom of the rundown under other.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:19.720]   So Amazon 91%, Google 90%, so they're both right up there as to who you can trust your
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:25.800]   house with who you can trust the stuff with, right? YouTube 90, Netflix 89, Microsoft 89,
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:32.680]   Sonos 86, Apple 81. That's so surprising. Way down there.
[01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:37.560]   Why don't you trust Apple more Instagram 72, Facebook 71, Twitter 61.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:41.880]   Right. So you trust Facebook so much. Yeah, I know.
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:46.760]   So but the point is that Amazon and Google are right up there tied at top.
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:51.880]   And so yeah, I'm going to trust them with my phone. I have Nest here or I'm going to trust
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:56.920]   them with iPhone. I have Madam A here, right? And then all the things that can come out of that,
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:04.360]   if they don't ruin that. I wish we had more time today. This has been, there's so much to talk about.
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:11.240]   Yeah. And speaking of Google just for a quick, these Fitbit, they did a deal in Europe. So the
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:17.960]   Fitbit deal can go ahead. So they made more privacy concessions on that. So that's, you know,
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:22.760]   what were they? I don't know Stacy, you have to actually actually actual facts. You want
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:26.520]   freaking facts, not just a headline. I'm just a better guy. I don't know. It's on the I think
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:33.080]   it's on the window. I am going to defer this week on the changelog because really the biggest
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:37.000]   part of the changelog we are you want to do that. You even want to do that. I know.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.080]   I spent the whole half hour for a staff hour talking about new stuff from Google. I think
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:45.400]   we did the changelog. There's, you know, there's little things like for a while they were going to
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:50.760]   turn off the unlimited meet Google meet stuff. They've said, no, no, no, people are still using
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:56.200]   it. So we'll keep that going until March. But most of the most of the changelog stuff is minor
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:51:00.200]   compared to what we just read in the room. Yeah, I'm reading the room. Thank you. That's the new
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:07.800]   phrase everybody's using it. Be careful because robots are hanging from the ceiling.
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:13.640]   Just want to mention that. Oh, oh, that's what I saw today. It was so awesome.
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:19.080]   Okay, Toyota Research Institute showed off all the robotics research they were doing.
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:25.320]   And the coolest takeaway from it. Bar none was the fact that in Japan, they realized that the
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:29.960]   robots could not navigate people's small and somewhat cluttered homes. Don't make them walk around.
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:35.880]   They built a gantry in the ceiling. Yeah. And the robots hang from them like bats. This robot
[01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:41.400]   is cleaning things like a bat because robots don't know up from down. They don't care.
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:47.560]   Okay. Yeah, I just wanted to share that because like instead of the launch or the whatever
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:51.160]   launch night in the, I skipped the first like 15 minutes because I was still like
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:58.520]   listening to this presentation. It was so much better. They even get these bat robots to load
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:06.120]   the dishwasher. Oh, the whole thing was so amazing. I feel like the work they're doing on unsupervised
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:13.800]   learning, teaching the robots in virtual environments is really cool. They have put massive paths. So
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:19.400]   and we've talked about like with robots, how they they're trying to make it mimic humans. So one,
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:24.440]   they're safer. You know, in case they go crazy and try to kill you. But two, they put cameras in the
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:30.440]   pads so they can check how hard a robot is gripping because otherwise a robot doesn't know how hard
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:36.360]   it's gripping something. It's like to crush the cop. And so yeah, and just so much fascinating,
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:43.800]   so much. Your first robot might be a Toyota. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thank you for, thank you for
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:48.040]   bringing that up. I'm always looking for stories that will make Stacy squeal with joy.
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:54.520]   How about this? Stacy Stacy, oh, as your last question, basically Google says that they will not
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:59.080]   use Fitbit data anyway for advertising. Let's get it closer to a deal. They said no, that's what
[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:03.720]   they said the last time. And that's just a stupid reason. That is a dumb reason because
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:07.800]   Facebook Google doesn't want to use it for advertising. They want to use it. They said their pledge was
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:13.480]   insufficient. Okay, hold on. I'm trying to read this quickly. Stacy's point is well taken though.
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:19.800]   That's the least of the value of the data that they were getting from one of these devices.
[01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:24.600]   There's a lot more they could do with it, especially if you had sidewalk and you could
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:29.960]   know where everybody is at all times. But Google won't get sidewalk and Apple's gonna have their
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:35.160]   own thing and that's stupid because network infrastructure should be a public utility or at
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:38.840]   least standardized so everyone can use the same thing because otherwise we're locked into these
[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:43.800]   ecosystems. And that is how I really feel. I do hope my version of Jeff's moral panic. I do hope
[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:54.280]   you do not buy the eye kettle from smarter technologies because apparently smarter's eye kettle had a
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:54:02.520]   vulnerability it never fixed. So as an experiment, a researcher at a vast reversed one of the
[01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:09.640]   reverse engineered one of the older coffee pots to see what he could do. And he turned it into
[01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:20.920]   ransom ransomware. The coffee pot demands coin before it gives you a cup of coffee.
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:25.720]   You could trigger the coffee maker to turn on the burner to spend water,
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:31.960]   spend the being grinder and display a ransom message all while beeping repeatedly. And the only way
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:38.120]   to stop it is to unplug the power card. Look, it's got a little devil, a little devil. It says,
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:43.880]   basically IOT is not going to let you into your house. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Watch your machine back.
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:51.880]   Go to this address and give me Bitcoin. That that chip has actually been so it's using a chip
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:58.520]   called the SP ESP 80 8266, which has a known vulnerability that can't actually be updated.
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:03.240]   Oh, it can't be fixed. Well, there you go. Yeah. So any device with this particular
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:11.480]   the ESP 82 66 and the 32. So now it's spitting out hot water. It's grinding beans and it's saying,
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:18.120]   give me money. Thank you very much. That's yeah. We talked about that on the show.
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:23.640]   Did you? It's a good story. I love it. It just shows you. Boy, there's so many wonderful
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:29.000]   there's there's the chat room was talking about the wise headphones. Is that old news? No, why?
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:35.160]   Well, that change was going on about that day or so. They're going crazy man. They're releasing
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:41.000]   new products. I just went to the wise site. I can't believe all the stuff they're selling now.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:49.080]   Headphones, doorbell, doorbell, thermostat. We love these guys. And I know Stacey, especially,
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:56.200]   because they're in the Pacific Northwest and they're offering products at a ridiculously low price.
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:59.960]   Most cases without subscription, they've got scales. They've got smart bands,
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:06.520]   but we've always loved the cameras. The $20 wise cam, the $30 pan cam. They've got bulbs.
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:12.120]   Do you how much of this stuff do you have Stacey? Look at the lock. I think I have one of everything.
[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:16.440]   The only thing I don't love is the band. I just thought the band was stupid. You don't need that.
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:21.400]   It's $25 is the advantage. It's good for 25 bucks. It's a fit. It's mentioned on hands-all wellness.
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:26.680]   Oh, did you try it? Sorry. Did you review it? It's good for 25 bucks. Yeah, the price is right.
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:32.360]   Did you review the scale? That will be this week, Cash. Oh, good. It's only $20.
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:34.920]   There's a pro tip for you for a smart scale. Yeah.
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:39.400]   If you set it up with two users and they're in the same weight class, which my husband and
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:42.600]   I are apparently within 10 pounds of each other because we're at the same size.
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:48.440]   He set it up, which means anytime I step on the scale without my app to be like,
[01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:50.840]   I'm uncertain about my weight. So I'm not going to record it.
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:55.960]   It automatically thinks I'm him. So when he stepped on the scale, all of my weight
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:02.120]   did it went over to him. He was like, what is happening? I've seen that that similar behavior
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:07.080]   with that other scale that I reviewed, I believe it was cardio, cardio base.
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:15.000]   I came across that with the boys. It freaked out whenever the boys got on it,
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.120]   because they suspect in my weight. And then it's like, wait a minute, dude,
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:22.680]   you just lost 100 pounds, which has happened here. Oh, no, this one knew that.
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:27.880]   Yeah, this one did not freak out about me losing 100 pounds. I'd forget it.
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:33.960]   My mind definitely knows the difference between me and Lisa, but then we're not in the same weight
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:39.400]   class. I'm trying to get my husband to eat more. So I don't have to ask, but it's not working.
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:46.440]   He's a flyweight and you're a welterweight. I don't know why I can't tell the difference.
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:52.840]   Anyway, yeah, good on wise. They're not, do not count them out of it, but I have to say,
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:58:00.120]   this sidewalk thing is really in a trash book standards, because if you can't sneak in on it,
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:03.400]   then you lose some real value. It was the network value. It's the facts problem.
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:09.560]   That sidewalk thing, again, it's still a little bit over my head, but you were talking about
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:16.120]   the packages and having like towels and packages and things like that. But is an Amazon pushing
[01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:22.760]   some sort of like a new wave delivery system, whether it's the electric vehicles and
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:29.240]   markets talking about autonomous and yes, and also to make sales. Yeah, it does. No, the
[01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:35.400]   Bezos, for whatever you think about Jeff Bezos, he's definitely strategic. He is playing
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:41.400]   chess 10 moves ahead of anybody else. Right. The lone game. Yeah. Yep. He's good.
[01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:47.480]   And actually the only thing over your head, Ant, is those robots. So I'd watch that.
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:54.360]   Yeah, you're going to you're going to have in those tiny Japanese houses, those robots are
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:58.440]   running right into you. I wish they'd clean up in here, Dan. She's something.
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:03.160]   Jeff, just watch this videos. Yeah, just a little
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:08.120]   awesome note from Carsten, the new Taco Bell quarterly is out for fall. That was my
[01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:10.680]   put in there. I'm on it. It's very good.
[01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:20.440]   Is that a taco? A fine art rendering in the oil of a taco? No, that's the actually that's the
[01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:29.160]   roll up. That's the crunch wrap. The title of the painting is adoration of the crunch wrap.
[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:34.760]   But oh Lord, it's really in this. Is it fiction? What is it? It's on it.
[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:40.440]   What's everything? It's poetry, it's art, it's short stories, it's essays. It really is.
[01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:44.680]   They are so good at marketing. No, this isn't them. This is not them.
[01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:49.000]   It's not them. No, this is just my simple pleasure. Yes.
[01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:55.000]   When the world wants you dead, Taco Bell can keep you alive.
[01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:00.600]   Let's do a dramatic reading for a few steps. You learned the price of your life when you change
[02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:07.720]   your name and gender in Nebraska's cold wilderness. Your fear was always Chick-fil-A's shadow and
[02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:12.840]   to a lesser extent. Cracker Barrels. There's proof in geography, you say.
[02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:16.360]   How the closer you live to a Cracker Barrel, the more likely you are to die,
[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:21.640]   trans, or queer, or in any shape or form, but God's sanction sits in straight. At least you say,
[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:29.320]   you'll always have Taco Bell, a Baja blast, a place to be as open and vegan as you need to be.
[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:36.360]   There's vegan food at Taco Bell. I never realized Taco Bell was so progressive.
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:44.840]   This is why you see some, like, a lot of vegetarian Indians love to go to Taco Bell.
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:52.440]   In my life dissolved like a cinnamon twist on your tongue and all you had left was the sweetness
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:01:00.200]   and shadow of a life. Taco Bell, refuge for the vegan stoner and trans woman, even if tonight's
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:07.640]   meal is just rice and beans and lettuce on a limp tortilla. Even if we're together here,
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:12.920]   in my beat up you, scarfing down seven layer burritos in the death throes of Nebraska's
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:19.560]   capital city debating whether or not marriage is a viable system. This is bizarre, but I like it.
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:24.280]   That's Lane Chasing. It's America, damn it. It's America. Yeah.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:31.720]   She's got it going. Clearly a 20 year about a cheese case. It is. And the thing about
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:37.160]   parenthood by Adam Shaw trying to decide that one year old that they had to have their one
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:41.080]   year old eat Taco Bell and decide what would the appropriate dish be?
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:49.480]   Please don't do that. Please. Hands still raised by daughter,
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:53.800]   squeezed her fist, cheese squirming its way out from between her fingers. The screams started
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:59.400]   back again, beginning at mild and beginning to wear past hot and back up to fire. She slammed her
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:06.840]   hands against the high chairs. No, no, that's not right. By the way, good news. Here comes hard
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:13.080]   Topo Chico. Stacey, I know you'll enjoy this. We talked about this. I am so pissed and
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:16.280]   Coke. Oh, that's it. I'm done. I'm done.
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:24.760]   Molson Coors is going to work with Coke to bring the alcoholic version of Topo Chico
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:30.920]   hard self. It's sacrilege. It is sacrilege. I might actually drink some.
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:36.520]   The benefit of Topo Chico was that it was wonderful to mix in drinks, not that you needed to have.
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:42.520]   Okay, I'm done. You wanted that. You could have bought white claw.
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:49.240]   Oh, gosh. No interest in either. Actually, I was interested in this story. We'll quickly,
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:58.600]   and then we'll wrap things up. Starlink was actually used in Washington state after wildfires
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:05.560]   to give disaster relief workers online access, SpaceX Starlink. I think this is the first
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:11.960]   rollout of Starlink. This is the one with the satellites that they're launching. The Plan to
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:17.960]   be at 12,000 Starlink satellites in the next few years. Right now, there are enough
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:22.280]   up several, I think almost more than 100. I can't remember how many launches they've had
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:27.400]   to actually provide connection to the town of Malden in Washington state.
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:33.320]   It's being organized through the state's emergency management division, which is
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:38.920]   pretty cool. There's the little Starlink dish, and it's attached, and you have a phone there,
[02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:43.480]   and Wi-Fi, and there's even a little charging station there.
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:45.400]   We got such a 1980s phone.
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:51.400]   Wow, it's hanging on the wall of the fence. They need a longer cord, though, really.
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:53.400]   To do it right.
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:56.120]   You're going to go. It's in the middle of nowhere. You don't need a longer cord.
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:59.560]   Yeah, but it's not whether you're going somewhere so you can wrap yourself around with the
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:00.840]   claw. Okay.
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:01.320]   Okay.
[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:02.280]   Fancy you're talking to.
[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:10.440]   All right. Okay, coming up next, I think, unless you guys see another story that you really
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:13.960]   want. There's so many stories, and there's so many things I wanted to talk about.
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:15.000]   Did you know I got a quick question.
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.080]   Have you heard of Perma.cc before?
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:19.720]   No, what is Perma.cc?
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:30.760]   Perma.cc. So for academics making links to web stuff and Link Rot, you go into Perma.cc,
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:34.840]   and I guess what it does is must copy the page as you had it.
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:35.800]   Oh, it's a Perma link.
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:36.440]   It's kind of a fight.
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:39.560]   Do they tie into the Internet Archive?
[02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:40.360]   Because they should just like that.
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:41.080]   I don't know that.
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:41.960]   That's what I was asking.
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:46.840]   Is it free to use? Somebody's paying for the server.
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:52.760]   It's so, wow. This is great because frequently,
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:56.760]   I would always use a Perma link if I could, because stuff frequently changes.
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:59.240]   Right in the book, I've got footnotes with links in the mail.
[02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:03.000]   I went back to what Google do is some of the stuff's gone.
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:06.680]   So they say libraries, faculty and journals, courts, and everyone.
[02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:08.360]   And I had not heard of this.
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:11.640]   I had not either.
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:16.200]   From the Harvard Library Innovation Lab at the Law School,
[02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:19.560]   it's made by a consortium of libraries.
[02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:24.600]   Anyone can sign up by creating a account that's free from anyone associated with a
[02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:30.760]   registrar organization. So the theory is you would then go through somebody else.
[02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:34.120]   Maybe academic libraries and courts could become registrars for free.
[02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:38.280]   And then other organizations would charge and then users would have access.
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:40.920]   So you wouldn't probably go to Perma.cc.
[02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:45.640]   You would have a short a link from say your local library.
[02:05:45.640 --> 02:05:49.960]   Links will be preserved as part of a permanent collection of participating
[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:50.840]   libraries.
[02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:54.200]   We can't be guaranteed these links will be preserved forever.
[02:05:55.160 --> 02:05:58.600]   We are hosted by university libraries that have endured for centuries.
[02:05:58.600 --> 02:06:01.800]   We're planning to be around for the long term.
[02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:06.120]   That's really cool.
[02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:07.480]   I thought that was really interesting.
[02:06:07.480 --> 02:06:11.640]   So in order to use this though, you'd have to find a group.
[02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:12.360]   There's an individual.
[02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:14.040]   No, you can create an individual account.
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:14.520]   You can.
[02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:17.800]   Yeah, if you go back to the bottom and it says for anybody.
[02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:21.000]   No, go back, go back, go back to the homepage.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.520]   Home page.
[02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:23.320]   Home page.
[02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:23.960]   Okay.
[02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:25.240]   No, right there.
[02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:25.880]   No, no, no, no.
[02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:26.280]   All right, page.
[02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:27.320]   Home page.
[02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:28.520]   Now go to the bottom.
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:30.040]   Sign up and use Perma.
[02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:30.920]   No, go to the bottom.
[02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:32.120]   My future was individual.
[02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:33.000]   Listen, I don't know.
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:34.040]   I don't need to be going to all of this.
[02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:34.600]   I'm doing it.
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:35.800]   I'm doing it.
[02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:36.440]   All right, let's do.
[02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:39.160]   We would be the funniest old couple, wouldn't we?
[02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:44.440]   My house is big and maybe I'll go to the beach.
[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:44.840]   I'll go to the beach.
[02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:48.120]   So one of us is is Felix.
[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:52.280]   I'll be Felix.
[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:53.000]   I think you're Felix.
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:53.800]   You could be Oscar.
[02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:55.000]   I'll be Oscar.
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:56.120]   New users can create.
[02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:57.720]   Is he any idea we're talking about?
[02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:01.080]   No, no, no, no, no, coward.
[02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:02.520]   No, coward.
[02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:05.320]   How about Neil Simon?
[02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:07.080]   Neil Simon, that's it.
[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:07.720]   There you go.
[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:12.200]   New users are able to create 10 free links on a trial basis.
[02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:14.680]   And then you have to get a paid subscription.
[02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:16.520]   So it isn't free, but that's okay.
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:16.760]   Cool.
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:19.160]   It shouldn't be free for that to work.
[02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:21.800]   So anyway, I just wanted to mention that.
[02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:23.400]   Any academics in the audience, I'm sure.
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:24.600]   You should have made that a pick of the week.
[02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:25.240]   That's awesome.
[02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:26.520]   Didn't we mention?
[02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:27.320]   Why don't you pick?
[02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:29.880]   I do numbers because Carson won't let me do picks.
[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:31.640]   Carson has no say in it.
[02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:34.520]   Would you like to do picks?
[02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:36.680]   I'll do numbers.
[02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:37.720]   You want me to do numbers?
[02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:38.600]   All their numbers.
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:40.360]   I don't know.
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:42.200]   Why do we do numbers?
[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:44.920]   In the very first show, I pointed to some number.
[02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:47.400]   Leo said, we should do a number a week.
[02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:48.040]   A big go.
[02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:48.760]   Ever since then.
[02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:49.160]   It's fun.
[02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:50.120]   Ever since then.
[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:51.240]   It's such a surprise.
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:52.120]   All right.
[02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:54.760]   Did we talk about number 92?
[02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:55.560]   Row 92.
[02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:56.840]   Row 92.
[02:07:56.840 --> 02:07:57.640]   92.
[02:07:57.640 --> 02:08:01.240]   The wheel spins round and round and where it stops.
[02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:04.040]   Come, recognition for Amazon go.
[02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:05.320]   This is their new store.
[02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:05.960]   I've got one that's the one organic too.
[02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:07.960]   So instead of...
[02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:12.600]   So you wouldn't have to use your phone.
[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:15.160]   You would already know who you are from your palm.
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:16.120]   Right.
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:17.640]   You have to train it with your car.
[02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:19.560]   You train it...
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:22.440]   Well, you go to the store and you train it.
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:25.320]   That's nice because I don't have to carry my phone with me all the time.
[02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:29.720]   Okay. But then Amazon has an irrevocable biometric device that is in terror,
[02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:30.920]   biometric attached to you.
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:31.320]   There we go.
[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:31.960]   More authentic.
[02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:32.920]   That feels like a step too far.
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:33.960]   It's not moral panic.
[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:35.080]   That's just being smart.
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:37.080]   You can't change your palm, Jeff.
[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:39.080]   I mean, you can't.
[02:08:39.080 --> 02:08:39.400]   It's irrevocable.
[02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:40.360]   It's going to be very painful.
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:41.160]   You're not going to like it.
[02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:43.240]   It's going to involve some dune level box action.
[02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:44.520]   But you know what?
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:44.840]   You know what?
[02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:46.040]   That's why I brought it up.
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:47.960]   You are a Quizak Tederak.
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:48.520]   I knew it.
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:53.480]   See if you all would freak out about it or if anybody even cared,
[02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:54.520]   but I'm with Stacy.
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:54.920]   No, you're right.
[02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:57.720]   It just seems like it's stepping over the line just the big two.
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:09:01.000]   There was a time when at Disneyland,
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000]   you could use your thumbprint for a pass.
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.920]   Steve and I talked about that because that's giving Disney
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:08.760]   forever access to your thumbprint.
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:10.920]   So use your knuckle, we said.
[02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:15.160]   They didn't look out of my knuckle.
[02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:18.600]   I think we're going to be in a world where nobody wants to touch anything.
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:20.280]   We're already there in restrooms, right?
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:24.280]   I go into a restroom and I pre my hands under the faucet
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:25.640]   and say, why won't the water come out?
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:27.720]   Because it still has a thing, right?
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:31.720]   Don't touch with an Amazon ghost store.
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:35.960]   You what all this is doing is saving you an extra 20 seconds of
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:38.040]   fumbling for your phone, opening the app and then.
[02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:41.320]   I wish whole foods would do this too.
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:44.760]   Because I always have to open my app and take the whole foods out.
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:46.360]   That's a pain.
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:47.560]   That's a pain.
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:50.040]   That's a pain from my 53 cent discount.
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:56.440]   Next, your picks of the week and poor Jeff has to do a number.
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:00.840]   Poor Jeff.
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:04.120]   All right, let's start with Stacy though.
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:05.720]   Okay.
[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:07.560]   You're a pick of the week because I'm sure you have something.
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:08.680]   Ooh.
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:09.160]   I do.
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:10.360]   I like it.
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:15.240]   All right, this is just data.
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:19.960]   This isn't an actual thing, but it's CloudFlare.
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:22.600]   Just launched today, a service called Radar.
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:26.120]   And all it is is data about how the internet is performing,
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:27.400]   how traffic is performing.
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:29.880]   You can filter through by country.
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:33.080]   You can see top domains in certain areas.
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:35.400]   This is good.
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:39.560]   They at this point, they know everything that's going on in the internet.
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:41.720]   So much of internet traffic goes through CloudFlare.
[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:43.800]   And you can see--
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:44.760]   Including ours, I might add.
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:45.240]   --the TDoS attacks.
[02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:46.920]   You can see--
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:48.840]   And there's some really good things like,
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:53.000]   "Hey, 75% of global traffic right now is HTTPS.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.800]   Yay, sadly, hopefully 20% of our traffic is IPv6."
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:03.960]   And I also thought the amount of bot traffic was like,
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:05.480]   "Hodang."
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:06.920]   It's a lot.
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:11.080]   Actually, I'm going to tie on to that because they also just announced
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:15.000]   a competitor to Google Analytics that is privacy forward.
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.280]   So CloudFlare now does analytics as well.
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:21.400]   I presume it's the same ID,
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:23.720]   JavaScript, snippet on your website, and so forth.
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:29.000]   Privacy-friendly web analytics, and it's free.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.760]   So it's just came out.
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:34.040]   You have to get on a wait list.
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:37.240]   But I think this is really interesting.
[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:39.400]   Almost everybody, we use Google Analytics.
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:43.080]   And we get flagged for having a tracker on our website
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:44.520]   because we use Google Analytics.
[02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:47.240]   So I think this is great.
[02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:49.720]   This is CloudFlare's new.
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:52.920]   I bet you goes hand in hand with radar.
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:54.120]   Because it's something--
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:56.760]   Yeah, I imagine it's pulling data in from those trackers,
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:57.800]   but I could be wrong.
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:02.120]   Yes, you install a JavaScript beacon on your site.
[02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:03.880]   Start collecting metrics.
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:06.600]   So this is really good.
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:08.040]   Actually, it also points out--
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:09.960]   you don't have to do that if you're putting--
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:11.880]   you're proxying your website behind CloudFlare,
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:13.400]   which many, many people do.
[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:15.640]   So there you go.
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:19.240]   Jeff.
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:21.400]   All right, this is a good one.
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:22.040]   This is a good one.
[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:22.040]   Okay.
[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:25.320]   So @Jack just gave $10 million
[02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:30.840]   to the Anti-Racist Center started by Ibram Kendi,
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:33.160]   the author of the wonderful "How to Be an Anti-Racist"
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:35.560]   at Boston University.
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:36.040]   Nice.
[02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:39.800]   Very smart to get Kendi and to start the center.
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:42.760]   And then Jack was smart to say here is no strings attached,
[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:43.240]   $10 million.
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:45.800]   I have to give Jack a little credit,
[02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:48.920]   because he's been pretty generous with his money.
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:48.920]   Cool.
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:50.360]   And quietly.
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:51.400]   Well, not that quietly.
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:52.040]   He does treat--
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:53.400]   Well, no, he adores his things.
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:56.520]   He uses it to endorse, but he doesn't make all kinds of--
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:59.560]   no brass band with a check.
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:05.240]   Mr. Ant Pruitt, you have something, I think.
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:06.520]   Yep, I do.
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:09.400]   I just want to give another shout out to a friend of mine
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:11.720]   and a creator, Mr. Steve Brazel.
[02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:14.840]   He has a show called Behind the Shot TV,
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:17.800]   where he sits down with some of the great photographers
[02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:22.760]   all over the world and walks through some of their iconic shots
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:26.280]   when last week he sat down with Mr. Joel Grimes,
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:27.720]   Cannon Explorer of Light.
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:28.280]   I love this--
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:31.560]   This shot, this cowboy shot.
[02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:33.960]   Yes, he shot that in Arizona.
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:37.160]   And what's it called?
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:39.480]   At the actual world of cowboys, you usually are.
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:39.960]   Nice.
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:40.680]   That movie set.
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:43.000]   I can't think of the name of it now.
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:48.200]   But that's about four or five different lights in there.
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:49.240]   Yeah, you could tell.
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:50.600]   But we sort of could tell.
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:51.080]   But yeah.
[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:53.640]   And he shot a bunch of different shots
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:57.480]   and just composited all together to that one beautiful shot.
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:14:01.400]   And it's just the thought process behind that was just amazing.
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:02.680]   Even down to looking--
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:04.200]   If you look below the table,
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:07.160]   look at how the shadows fall up on the table.
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:08.120]   So smart.
[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:08.440]   Yeah.
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:10.600]   That's just thinking about that kind of stuff.
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:13.480]   That's something I love about a lot of the photographers out there.
[02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:16.760]   And this show, the show that Steve does is outstanding.
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:17.880]   It's allowing me to--
[02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:18.920]   I see your Frederick--
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:19.400]   I think their break.
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:21.960]   Sammons got that wildlife photography.
[02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:24.760]   Sammons, the 49ers photographer was just on there.
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:25.880]   Oh, neat.
[02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:29.160]   And he did one with a gentleman named Jeff Harmon.
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:33.400]   I think that was the one before the Joel Grimes episode.
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:36.440]   And Jeff Harmon is a hobbyist photographer,
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:39.080]   but he's freaking good at it.
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:42.040]   He's so good at it.
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:43.800]   But it was an astrophotography shot.
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:44.600]   I think it's right there.
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:45.080]   Nice.
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:46.920]   He's like photographing the Milky Way.
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:47.560]   Yeah.
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:50.200]   And he did that with an APS-e camera.
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:50.760]   No.
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:51.000]   But--
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:52.200]   Oh, it's gorgeous.
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:53.320]   He's so good.
[02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:54.440]   Yeah.
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:55.640]   Really gorgeous.
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:57.240]   But behind the shot.tv.
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:14:57.880]   Check him out.
[02:14:57.880 --> 02:14:58.840]   That's my man Steve.
[02:14:58.840 --> 02:14:59.480]   Very good.
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:01.080]   Good.
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:01.560]   Wow.
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:02.600]   What a show.
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:05.160]   What a jam-packed full of adventures.
[02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:06.920]   Excitement.
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:09.560]   Nose comparisons and more.
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:11.720]   I can't wait--
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:12.600]   You don't get that on that--
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:12.760]   Shnaz.
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:13.800]   --of his schnaz.
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:15.400]   Shnaz.
[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:15.960]   Shnaz.
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:16.440]   --shnaz.
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:16.920]   Robots.
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:17.560]   Shnaz.
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:18.040]   --shnaz.
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:18.520]   Everything grows.
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:19.000]   Everything grows.
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:19.880]   That's it.
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:20.760]   That's the tease.
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:21.720]   Drones.
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:22.680]   Robots.
[02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:23.320]   Shnaz.
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:26.840]   And a little bit of sidewalk.
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:27.880]   That stays eager by the--
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:28.520]   Of course.
[02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:30.920]   You can see how valuable she is to this show.
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:32.680]   Stacy on IOT.com.
[02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:35.000]   She's the guru of IOT.
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.960]   Very lucky to have her to explain all this stuff.
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:39.160]   Subscribe to her newsletter.
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:40.040]   Listen to the podcast.
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:42.680]   She does the IOT podcast with Kevin Tofel.
[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:45.240]   And thank you for being here.
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:45.960]   We appreciate it.
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:46.280]   Thank you.
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:46.920]   Yeah.
[02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:48.920]   Jeff, what were you saying?
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:49.800]   Did you have something to say?
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:52.760]   Shnaz is one Z, I think, cursed not two.
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:53.720]   Only one Z.
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:54.360]   It's a short time.
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:55.960]   Gosh, I thought Shnaz had two.
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:57.720]   Really?
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:15:58.040]   All right.
[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:03.640]   Jeff is, after all, a professor of--
[02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:05.880]   I have it right here.
[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:06.840]   Some other, somewhere or other.
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:07.720]   Something or other.
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:10.440]   He is the director after all of the Townite Center
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:13.320]   for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Neumark
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:16.200]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:18.760]   of New York Scoop Award winner.
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:21.960]   We're going to do our own award soon, right?
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:22.760]   Like the Pulitzer.
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:23.640]   It's just going to be this.
[02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:27.320]   Yes.
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:29.800]   You can make a coin, a big coin.
[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:34.920]   That would be like an Antoinette Perry Award at Tony.
[02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:35.480]   It's got to--
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:35.880]   That's right.
[02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:36.280]   That's right.
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:36.760]   Yeah, I see.
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:37.320]   Just calling it.
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:37.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:42.440]   I should play the video that they made for you
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:44.040]   at the Scoop Awards, actually.
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:45.400]   Maybe I'll do that at the end
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:48.600]   after all the acknowledgments so people can see it.
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:50.520]   I think it's OK for me to play that.
[02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:50.760]   Yeah.
[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:51.240]   Yeah.
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:52.040]   It was pretty cool.
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:53.000]   I didn't know they gave it to you.
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:53.320]   Yeah.
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:53.560]   That's right.
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:54.360]   Yeah, they sent it along.
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.720]   Because they actually will-- you will see,
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:16:59.640]   because you're in it.
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:02.760]   I mean, they show your reaction to it and all of that stuff.
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:03.400]   They do.
[02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:04.600]   Oh, that's nice.
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:05.080]   Oh, that's nice.
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:05.640]   Yeah.
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:05.880]   All of that.
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:07.160]   Yeah, so I'll find that.
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:08.120]   We'll play that at the end.
[02:17:08.120 --> 02:17:08.840]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:09.960]   Yeah, that was really cool.
[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:13.160]   And I recorded it much longer.
[02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:16.600]   I did about 40, 45 minutes on how great you were.
[02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:18.840]   They only used a few seconds, but it was--
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:21.560]   You know, just take my word for it.
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:24.120]   That's Aunt Pruitt, host of--
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:28.440]   host of Hands on Photography and Hands on Wellness.
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:34.120]   Twit.tv/hop and twit.tv/how.
[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:35.800]   And it's great to see you.
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:36.600]   That's right.
[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:37.560]   Thanks for being here.
[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:40.360]   Thanks to all for being here.
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:43.320]   We do this show every Wednesday.
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:45.160]   Right after Jeff gets out of class.
[02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:50.200]   That's around 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2,100 UTC.
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:53.800]   Live streams available at twit.tv/live.
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:54.600]   We have a couple of notes.
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:59.480]   For some reason, TuneIn has decided to ban all international
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:02.440]   podcasts from TuneIn UK.
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:03.720]   UK only.
[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:09.000]   It was a court decision that they decided to honor extremely.
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:12.360]   So we're not available on TuneIn UK.
[02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:14.840]   So if you're listening to UK, use Spreaker.
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:16.840]   There's other ways to listen to our audio.
[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:18.680]   That's at twit.tv/live.
[02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:19.720]   The other note is I know--
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:22.040]   and I've really been meaning to talk about this.
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:24.760]   A lot of you watch on Roku or used to,
[02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:25.800]   because we had a Roku app.
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:30.600]   That app was not updated for some time.
[02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:32.360]   The guy who wrote it for us--
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:34.280]   great, Houdini7.
[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:36.520]   You might run into them in our chat room for time to time--
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:41.160]   took a real job and couldn't write software for anybody else.
[02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:42.520]   So it didn't get updated.
[02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:45.000]   We knew that Roku was going to change their API.
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.720]   It took them a while, but in the last couple of weeks,
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:49.800]   that app has now stopped working.
[02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:51.720]   And so I'm hearing howls of pain,
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:54.360]   I didn't realize so many of you watched on Roku.
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:55.400]   I'm thrilled.
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:57.240]   There are still other ways to watch YouTube,
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:18:59.480]   Twitch, both have Roku apps.
[02:18:59.480 --> 02:19:03.000]   So there are other ways to watch, but I apologize.
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.120]   It's kind of out of our hands.
[02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:05.800]   They changed the API.
[02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:08.120]   And the guy who wrote it's gone.
[02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:09.560]   And it's not calling.
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:12.040]   He's just not working with us anymore.
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:14.040]   Fable wants to write a Roku app.
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:14.920]   Let me know.
[02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:16.040]   Let me know what we'd like to do.
[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:18.680]   I used the YouTube app on my--
[02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:19.560]   I think it works fine, right?
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:20.040]   It works just fine.
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:20.680]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:21.320]   The YouTube app--
[02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:25.080]   that's one of the reasons we didn't run out and get a new one made.
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:27.560]   Because there's YouTube, there's Twitch, there's Ustream.
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:30.600]   You know, there are lots of other ways you can watch on Roku.
[02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:32.920]   I realize a lot of people liked Roku a lot.
[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:34.520]   Oh, Twitch's app is defunct too.
[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:35.720]   Well, there you go.
[02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:36.280]   Oh, wow.
[02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:37.320]   There you go.
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:37.800]   Wow.
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:38.120]   Yeah.
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:40.440]   The wheels are coming off the bus, man.
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:45.720]   You can--
[02:19:45.720 --> 02:19:47.880]   you don't actually have to watch a live stream anyway.
[02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:51.960]   You can always get it on demand at the website, twit.tv/twig.
