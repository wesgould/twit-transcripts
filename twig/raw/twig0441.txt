[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.160]   But I thought about what it is and you know what it is. It's about the future the future my friends
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.240]   As it includes Google Facebook Twitter the internet the internet of things
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.000]   That's because we've got the great Stacey Higginbotham on a regular basis. She's the expert on IOT at Stacey on IOT
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.480]   .com. That's where newsletter and podcast live. Hello Stacey
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.640]   Hello
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.640]   And I'm happy to
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.600]   Normally Jeff Jarvis would be here, but he is in Davos hobnobbing with the president
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.880]   And Rupert Murdoch that should be fun. There's a room I'd like to be in
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.640]   So and we thought we would get him on if we could from Switzerland
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.960]   But you know it's late at night there and he says there's more interesting conversations. No, he doesn't but I'm sure there are
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.160]   I'm sure he's thinking it and he would be right to to be honest. Yeah, if you're
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.720]   Why yeah, you could do this at any time
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.440]   But the good news is
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.000]   To fill Jeff seat today. We've got the great Matthew Ingram
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.640]   From the Columbia journalism review
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.960]   Hello Matthew good to see you for duty
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.080]   Good to see you too wearing his newsguised shirt proving that he is a googler
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.440]   A Google out go it was that is that in Arizona? Was that in Arizona this year? It is. Yeah
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.680]   They have one in Arizona every year and then there's one that moves around in
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.400]   conjunction with the Knight Foundation. Yeah
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.480]   Matthew we should say Matthew and Stacey worked together not once but twice
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.360]   We sure did
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.280]   Gigah home and fortune and it was great both times and their refugees
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:25.240]   From those and they are here with us today. It's what makes three. So it is three times. You're right come to think of it. Yeah, that's right. Yeah
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:34.560]   Third time lucky did you I you know there's a lot of we could talk about you know androids 8.1 showing Wi-Fi speeds and
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:42.160]   YouTube TV having less than 300,000 subscribers and Facebook giving people a chance to rate news organizations
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160]   And we'll get to all of that
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.840]   But I I was kind of captivated by Steve Yeges post this morning on medium
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.240]   Yeah
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:58.320]   And I thought that he raised some really interesting issues why I left Google to join grab
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.880]   He was an engineer at Google well-known engineer Google for 13 years
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.480]   And he left because he says Google is no longer innovating there
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.600]   chasing competitors instead instead of serving customers
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:23.280]   Gatekeeping and risk aversion are Google at Google are the norm rather than the exception
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.880]   Yeah, I think he's got a point yeah, I think he's got a point
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.880]   I mean I he put into words obviously I don't work at Google
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.840]   But he put into words some of the things that I've thought about things Google is doing there's a lot more
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.440]   risk aversion there's a lot more kind of you know do the things that are safe and and kind of
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:51.240]   incremental stuff and I miss I mean we've talked about this before I miss the old Google where the moon shots and right you know the
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.240]   stuff where they were doing things
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.160]   Because they wanted to change something for the better not just because they wanted to sort of make incremental revenue
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.800]   He brings up you know all of the kind of failed Google initiatives like Google+ and Aloe and reader and hangouts
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.720]   And and and you know I mean we talk about it sometimes too, but he also says and I agree with this
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.640]   I love the people at Google. They're super smart and world-class and always humble
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.560]   individuals he says Google though has gotten less humble
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:29.880]   He says company strategy is a mess Google no Googlers people working there know this is happening. There's frustrated by it as you are
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.520]   but their leadership is
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.000]   Failing them and that's mostly because Google has become a hundred percent competitor focused rather than
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.320]   Customer focus, but I'd say this is the innovator. So I'm anyway. I mean this is this this also strikes me as a very
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.440]   engineering oriented
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.480]   like oh, yeah, I mean as any company and I was on this side
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.080]   I mean I remember showing up at giga home one day at our home office and there were like 80 people there
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.720]   And I was like what the heck happened wow all these people
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.400]   And even then I had very similar complaints
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.760]   I'm like oh we don't focus on the important stuff everyone wants us to focus on this other stuff and part of that is
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:16.920]   It is part of be it's moving from being a company that has created something really amazing
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.040]   to
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.040]   being a company that
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:28.440]   Shelters and in protects what they've created that was amazing and then tries to continue building and this is inevitable again
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.560]   The innovators know you're right. This is a company inevitable. This is the life cycle of a well
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.960]   It's something different well, it's related though. The innovators dilemma is that once you're
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.960]   Well, but yes, but the problem is it's I think it's psychological in every way once you're a success
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:52.160]   It's hard to throw away the success right and approach the next thing with beginners mind you you don't want to cannibalize your existing
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:00.760]   Product and it's hard for you to see the opportunities that exist that's and I think maybe maybe it was naive to think that Google
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.200]   Could kind of avoid that or would be able to kind of continue being the same kind of company it was before
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.440]   But I still sort of miss it in a way. I mean, oh, yeah, that's a very
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.860]   Adolescent viewpoint and I think this is part of like
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:21.880]   Are you saying the James day more memo minus the sexism?
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:29.720]   No, I mean maybe I think this is endemic to both Silicon Valley and to a
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   class of people who are
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.880]   Disruptors and I think
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:41.520]   This is a very important class of people to have I don't want to denigrate this but we've kind of in
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.120]   the tech world put this is
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.440]   All you're listening. Oh, you're totally you're totally
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:53.840]   And I think if you're that kind of person. Yes, that would drive you move on you go a new startup
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.120]   Yeah, so you're saying this is a middle-aged company and this is what you do you yeah, and that's fair
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.240]   It
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:07.000]   That's that's a life cycle that all companies go through just like people can't stay out of lessons forever
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.440]   Like you might want to but you see that you know
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:16.760]   45-year-old guy with you know a toupee and his is 20 year old girlfriend in the red sports car and you're like buddy
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.560]   You're not fooling anybody. Yeah, just
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.240]   mature I don't know. I mean that's
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.560]   I mean I actually think Google to be fair does do a pretty good job of continuing
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.880]   To do stuff that is you know not just
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:39.560]   Incrementally protecting their business, but they so they're still doing lots of stuff that's interesting and they're still doing lots of stuff
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.800]   That but I mean I sympathize with this guy's point
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.000]   Maybe he's just not kind of for Google like it is now he wants to be a startup in fact
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.200]   That's kind of what he says which is fun. He was at Amazon for seven years before he went to
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.560]   Google he does talk though. I thought this is kind of interesting about
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.200]   being at Amazon and hearing Jeff Bezos in 1999 saying we're dead and
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.280]   I thought that was really kind of an interesting
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:11.080]   Both both you have to say both Amazon and Google have are well aware of the problem and have done what they can
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:19.980]   To prevent it in Google's case. They kind of every line of businesses treated like a startup has a justified its existence its revenue
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.880]   That you know they really wanted everybody to act like a startup even in a big company
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.640]   For Amazon, I think it's it actually starts at the top with with
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.960]   Jeff just spanking people a lot
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:42.680]   Literally well, maybe I don't know anyway. Don't know anyway. There's thoughts of tears. We know that let's not go there
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:51.160]   And things are getting faster wasn't it Justin Trudeau who just did a speech about how this is the slowest we're going to be innovating or
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.240]   Like the next hundred years at this we're innovating so fast right now, and it's the slowest. We're going to be innovating
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.240]   Wow, I think you know, I think that's accurate. That's really I know I do
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.040]   You know, he's he's Prime Minister of Canada. I don't know
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:10.320]   I repeat my question, but that's a reason he's got ministers. It's a reasonable projection. I mean, that's what
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.000]   That's what Ray Kurzweil
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.320]   said in his book the singularity
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.320]   near is that
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.520]   the pace of growth is
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.200]   Is is exponential that it's not it's not it's not a straight line, right?
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:31.240]   It's a hockey stick and it's not just it's not just that change is occurring quickly, but the rate of change is increasing
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:37.280]   It's nicely and now Ray unlike Justin Trudeau, maybe Justin read the book in that book
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:44.360]   He has graph after graph after graph showing hockey sticks basically in many sectors of the economy
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.960]   And so I think that that's that's fair to say so what that means is if you look ahead
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:55.600]   Yeah, everything's going to be growing at a fast if anything's right if anything that means companies like Google should be
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:03.120]   more adaptable or they should be trying to evolve faster instead of getting less adaptable
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.760]   Google has done
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.400]   I mean he talks about Spanner and Waymo
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:13.360]   Does he talk about like TPUs and the work that Google's done on machine learning good point? I
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:19.360]   Mean yes, they have been neck and neck with Facebook and maybe Facebook was a little bit ahead of them for a while
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:25.400]   But Google had Jeff Hinton right actually before Facebook hired Jan Lecoon who now is
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.280]   in second command there so like I
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:36.840]   Can selectively look at a lot of things and say that that was dumb or that but I don't know
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.360]   I
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:48.880]   Do you think that they're particularly machine learning as far as Google's kind of smart assistant stuff is concerned that is looking forward?
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:54.880]   I think there's going to be stuff. They're doing there is going to be applicable in all whole range ways that we haven't even discovered yet
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.240]   Maybe to this point just a minute ago
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:07.160]   Stephen Gillette announced that Google was going to spin off one of its ex companies Chronicle
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.880]   Which is a security company and their goal is to speed up security?
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.200]   To speed and impact a security teamwork by a factor of ten
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:23.720]   To keep up I guess with this with the speed up in the security flaws
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:30.720]   That couldn't be more timely that's the kind of thing. I mean yeah, that's it so this is Google X
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.920]   They have their moonshots. This was one of them and
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.780]   They found it in 2016 and a year and a half later now they're
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:45.080]   Watching it as a company. So maybe maybe maybe you're right. You know what? I think Stacy that you that's well put this is a
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.680]   particular kind of person
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:54.640]   Who needs a certain kind of company to scratch his itch? Yeah, and admittedly Google is not that company anymore
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:13:00.560]   But that's not that's normal. It's not necessarily a it's not and this is the key is it a bad thing or not?
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:07.280]   It's not necessarily bad thing. It's just a middle-aged company without the toupee the red sports car in the young, but I do think that it's
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:15.760]   Okay, I'm gonna say something about Silicon Valley and ageism. I do think that's a very big thing for Silicon Valley. They focus very much on
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:25.560]   Disruption at the expense sometimes of scale and scaling in a mature fashion and I think
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.240]   part of that is because Silicon Valley tends to hire younger and
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:40.520]   Get rid of or not rehire older. So I think that might be kind of those two things are related
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:46.360]   Yeah, and I think as an old person, you know, I'm in favor of people respecting
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.400]   wisdom and
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:55.960]   Grey hairs and all that other stuff, but I also think it's a it's a tough challenge for a company like Google or Microsoft or Amazon to
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:02.400]   to keep enough of those types of people around and and in places where they can
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.200]   experiment and achieve interesting things and
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:11.240]   Because you need them right you can't have just all those people but you need them
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:17.760]   But they need to be in certain roles and then you need other people who are gonna do the pouring stuff to keep the business going
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:24.480]   Actually, you gotta have that mix that that's the big problem at Google is that everybody wants to be working on the next shiny new thing
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.120]   And he wants to maintain the existing code base
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:32.280]   Right and that's a problem with I mean, that's a problem endemic
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:40.120]   I actually wrote about this a couple weeks ago, but that's a problem endemic to it in a lot of ways and as we bring and I'll bring
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.200]   Internet of Things in here, but as we bring it and
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:49.920]   Sensors into old school industries like utilities and nuclear power plants and blah blah blah
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.640]   That is a huge culture clash because these people are like no, I don't want the new thing
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.640]   I've got to keep this running and
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.240]   What is this agile move fast and break stuff?
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.560]   No, get out of my get out of my nuclear power
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:11.080]   And there was a lot of criticism of Google. I remember certain products, you know many of whose names I forget
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.800]   Where they got a criticism for you know, oh
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:23.040]   Remember that thing remember that thing that you kind of built into your user base. Well, it's gone now and
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:29.080]   So good luck actually yeggy writes a follow-up post read a follow-up post today in medium
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.800]   Saying I'm getting lots of calls from reporters
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:38.280]   Asking me for a hot take on my claim that Google has lost the ability to innovate, but I'm since I'm busy
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:43.360]   I'm gonna just most big companies don't innovate at a large scale. That's normal
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.680]   You have two perfectly valid alternatives for responding to market shifts
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.960]   You can acquire the innovator or one of their competitors or you can build your own competing product and compete head-to-head
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:59.200]   Acquisitions happen all the time Google buying YouTube Facebook buying Instagram Amazon buying Twitter all good examples
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:05.080]   And then he's talking about he's talking also about where he sees the next big thing which is I think
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:13.200]   Truthfully the more interesting half of the memo because he's explaining why he's going to grab which is a ride-hailing startup in Southeast Asia
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   But he says that in in the Southeast Asia where cash it's mostly a cash economy
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.400]   People live on their smartphones
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:30.080]   there's an opportunity not just for ride-hailing food delivery and
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:36.880]   At some point once you've got your once people have you have to have your grab app on their phone
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.840]   payments
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.840]   So he's got interesting
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:49.680]   Road map he's totally right about that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean there's an argument to be made that lots of those countries
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:56.760]   By kind of leapfrogging straight to mobile right without going through the intervening periods that we did
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.960]   have actually
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.560]   Accelerated like they're actually now on the leading edge instead of catching up
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.800]   Yeah, well the US is a classic example of the opposite not catching up
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.720]   And I think to be honest, maybe we don't want to get into this but I think you could argue that that kind of
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.080]   move fast and break things
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.840]   mentality
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:23.880]   When when it's done at a company say the size of Facebook can have some significant negative impacts
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:30.840]   I mean they've been moving fast and breaking democracy, you know, which isn't really the kind of thing you want to encourage I
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.000]   Just read an article. I thought it was very interesting
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:41.320]   Or maybe it was a Twitter a tweet but somebody pointed out that all of the people who were involved at the beginning of Facebook even including Mark Zuckerberg
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.960]   but
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:48.280]   Are basically put don't use Facebook like normal people do they have very?
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:53.560]   You know limited or no experience, you know, and of course who was it? Was it Sean Parker and others who?
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:58.640]   decried social media and yeah, yeah, I'm a fellow happened
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.320]   Yeah, and
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.320]   None of them use Facebook
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:10.680]   So we're just the suckers who are still using it well and didn't Tim Cook say that he would never let his nephew use a social network
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.480]   Yes, yeah
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.960]   Very famously Steve Jobs wouldn't let his kids have iPads
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.840]   You know, he thought that they should grow up without technology, so
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:26.200]   Maybe they know maybe it's still a convellino something that we don't know so I will say
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.200]   in the in the
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:34.840]   Kids and technology this is a thing that I've noticed and then I talked to some of my friends who are not in my
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.840]   Who are out of town?
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:42.000]   So their kids are not friends with my kid, but my daughter spends all day long
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.800]   She doesn't actually she hates her phone. She has a phone for like emergency calls
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.560]   She never remembers to charge it. She doesn't want to look at it
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:57.040]   She doesn't want to text anyone and her friends have phones too, and they're very similar and I don't know if this is an age thing
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:02.120]   But instead, you know, she walk it when she gets home she goes upstairs to her room and just turns on
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.400]   Hangouts and gets on hangouts with their friends, and they just hang out
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.440]   But they don't actually talk to each other right and they don't always have the video on
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:15.640]   Right some of them will have their video on all the time. That's it. That's just with each other. That's a yeah
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:22.120]   That's parallel play on the internet. Yeah, that's interesting because that's what my kids did particularly
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:30.440]   Abby the older one so that was ten years ago. They would be doing homework with but they have video of everybody on the screen
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:36.320]   And they'd all be doing there and then they could chat I did that that is very interesting. Yeah, it's interesting
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.320]   I think it's so I'm like looking at
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.360]   That and I'm like huh she she likes having the am I mean
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.840]   It's basically like having your friend ambiently in the room via technology
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:51.120]   And you know she she goes downstairs to dinner and comes back to them
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.920]   so I'm yeah, she hates the phone and she hates being
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:02.000]   She does not want to be instantly accessible via text or pick up the phone
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.200]   I mean if I if I ping her like I use the Madam a and I'm like
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.920]   hang out or drop in on
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:17.520]   My daughter's name she'll do it, but she'll talk to me for a brief second, but it's very strange. I just I don't know
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.200]   By the way, she gets old I there was a company go ahead knows
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.480]   Be my guest there. I was just gonna say there was a company
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.920]   I can't even remember the name of it
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.760]   But I wanted to do this at Gago and had a bunch of remote offices. They set up a giant
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.120]   To be on a was a Facebook on a cart
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.920]   He's a wall of Skype
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.600]   No, this wasn't a wall of Skype. This was a window
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:46.200]   They called it so it it literally just had a camera in their remote office and people would just walk by and they would wave
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:51.080]   Or you could talk to them very common. Yeah, it was just like a window that you so there was no
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:56.400]   You didn't have to go and do things in the window and they didn't have sky paying out
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.960]   So they didn't have conference calls. It was literally just to wave or to you know
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:07.920]   It was just a virtual window into the other way that was yeah, it was sponsored go to meeting and that was a big use case
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:13.080]   For go to meeting they would just leave it running all day. Yeah, so the people in remote offices would just be part of the
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.560]   And I guess that's I mean look at it. Yeah, look how I mean I'm sitting here by myself
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.960]   You guys are on Skype. I mean this is how we do our shows
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.900]   One day I'll have the tactile punch Leo button. I
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:31.520]   Think this is a for that reason alone. This is the better way of doing things
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:35.320]   Yeah, you can't find it is more virtual. I
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.240]   Don't think this is bad at all. This has become I
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.040]   Mean I know I'm sure I'm sure
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.000]   Biologists and sociologists would say oh no no no it's a it's a it's a not a
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.360]   Full experience, you know you somehow it's missing
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:57.680]   Something but I think it's pretty close well. Yeah, it is sure it is but I think we have more
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.400]   We have more variety of experiences now whereas it used to be totally binary
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:09.420]   You're in Canada Stacey's in Texas. I'm in California, but we can have a round table conversation
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:16.920]   Admittedly, it's always better if you're all here, but that's that's hard to do exactly and before you had to be in a room
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:22.180]   Physically with someone and then you know the telephone and the telegraph and so on extended things now
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.800]   We've just got more ways to interact
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:31.840]   I know my my wife used to talk about our daughter and say I wish she would you know go play with her real friends instead of
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:38.080]   Spending time online, but but for her those were real friends and she was spending time with them. I
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.080]   Yeah, I kind of prefer it
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:49.640]   That's true, you know, you don't know if I've taken a shower today, so I don't need to like it
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.240]   I'm basically not wearing pants. Yeah, I mean, you know, there's a lot more freedom
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   I I remember what a shock it was when I found out that Terry gross on fresh air rarely is in the same room with her
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:06.480]   Yeah, you guess they never say that but most of the time people are at another public radio station. Yeah
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.960]   I've done that and it's yeah, every time I call it. This is weird
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:15.980]   Yeah, people who are good at it can make you feel as though you can't like they can erase that distance
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:20.280]   Yeah, I think if you didn't have video the show for those of you listening in audio if I mean
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:25.200]   I don't think there's Skype is good enough now that I don't think there's a much of a difference between you being in studio or not
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.560]   Anyway, Jeff and I get that when we talk about it work
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.360]   That's that is the big thing
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.560]   But you know if you don't know what to listen for you wouldn't even know that but you're right
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:39.240]   That's one of the reasons people talk we get people complain all the time about people talking over each other and they don't that's because they don't know
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:45.120]   We're all it's all this right. All right. I'm late. I by the way, I say see I'm a little bit I
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.840]   Can't say mad at you. I'm a little bit mad
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:54.040]   I'm a little bit grateful because I got went out and got those hue ambient lights that you talked about the hue goes
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.920]   And I like those yes, and then I had to get a base station to control them
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:04.960]   And then I had to get a few more bulbs and then that wasn't enough and I have more bulbs coming
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:10.560]   Now your heart well, it's funny because I had had hue when they first came out
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.240]   And richer colors are so much everything's better
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:21.920]   I and then I had it like the Sun when the Sun went down my my TV room would light up and and stuff and then when I moved
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.480]   I didn't you know
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.280]   I put them in a box
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:31.160]   But I didn't set them up and I very recently actually gave them away to somebody and now I'm all now they sucked me back in again
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.480]   My but it's great in my office
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:38.360]   You know what I'm not gonna put them in the bedroom because as you know if the power goes out and
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.800]   Comes back the hues are on full
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:49.520]   And I've told the story before as I apologize if you heard it before but I I like oh
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:56.280]   What happened I when I got my phone and I'm trying to find the hue app and Lisa said dummy and went and turned the lights off
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.040]   Because they were
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:06.480]   But I I kind of I'm not gonna put them in the bedroom, but I kind of I kind of like it
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:11.080]   I want to do the ambient. What is that environmental thing where the TV matches the oh?
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:19.240]   Yeah, that's awesome and now they're actually pushing that so I did it years ago when they launched it with Sharknado we
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.360]   It was you have the only problem with as you have to watch Sharknado
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:29.560]   Well, so my husband and I we popped some popcorn and we decided cheesy movie night we turned on the hues
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.400]   You had to actually have the app open and listening to your television
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:38.240]   So it knew where it was but it was awesome because when the thunder would happen your hues would go
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:44.000]   Like lightning and then when the shark fit into a person the lights go red. It was so campy
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   It was like it took it up like now
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.960]   11 speaking of latency
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:54.440]   Is there any I mean that would be no good if you're watching TV in three seconds later does that no
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:26:01.800]   It was right on it was right along with the soundtrack and they've done now. They've got it much better
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.440]   It's much nicer. They built like an SDK for directors
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:11.640]   So somebody's doing the humics when he does the audio mix he's doing the nice. Yeah
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.320]   so
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.320]   Yes
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.560]   So I but you have to put it in with like the movie
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:25.320]   People have to put it in so it's only gonna be a few things at first that are optimized
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.800]   Well, I noticed that they gave me a number of channels that I can use
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:35.720]   With it so I guess so apparently it syncs up with cocoa
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.760]   Here's some here's a video of the hue lights
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.440]   Let me see do we get the
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.480]   So so those are the those are the orbs behind there
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:50.360]   We were talking about the go. Oh look
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.720]   Lou
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:59.920]   He lives to this with the television a while back, but now it's doing it with the actual content
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:06.680]   So what's the experience like is it feel like a better experience
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.040]   I guess for Sharknado. It's great for shark
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:17.920]   So with it, I mean Sharknado just they were like how campy can we make this by golly and it it really did
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.880]   It made it much more fun. I mean, I'm not gonna lie. I was like the first time the lightning flashed
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.880]   I was like whoo-goop
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:29.680]   And then I giggled forever, you know whenever the cheesy effects happened so
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:37.000]   There are more subtle things like it would be nice like imagine like watching alien or something scary
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.760]   Your lights kind of we're giving this this clue and it just kind of more immerses you and it is it make or break?
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:48.160]   No, it will it matter for something like cocoa? I don't know. Maybe a kid will like it
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:54.640]   I mean they think those things to like kid books right now. You can read your child a story to a Disney book and
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:01.360]   You know the hue light will turn colors with the pages on. I mean it's kind of silly
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:05.920]   I so I don't sure what it's gonna take to set that up, but I have plenty of
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.920]   devices
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.680]   Well, I will tell you your other thing. I'm sure you have it
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:18.240]   But let me see what I have the the the goes and then I have a bunch of bulbs and they're all in my den
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:25.160]   I have one in my I mean I know Stacy gets a referral fee for everything. I don't I don't get anything for this
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:29.160]   It is cool. You hear it with Google home or Amazon's echo
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.920]   So it's cool that I could say echo turn on the lights in the den
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:40.280]   Mm-hmm. That's pretty that's pretty neat. Yeah, that would be and if you do the echo if that echo is only in your den
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:45.040]   And you group those lights with that echo you can actually just say turn on the lights and it will turn on the light
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.200]   Explains it because I go to the kitchen and I say echo turn on the lights in the den
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.200]   She says I don't know what you're talking about
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:56.040]   So I must have paired it to a particular echo to the oh
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:05.280]   Confusing here's a video. We just got dimmer switches up here. So Patrick Delahanty has
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.840]   given me a video from Engadget of
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.840]   shark nato
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.640]   Oh, there you go sci-fi sink. Oh
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.560]   blood red oh
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:20.080]   My yeah, I don't know about that. Oh, it's so campy fun
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:26.120]   Maybe I'm old but now it's it's purely cheese. It's awesome cheese
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.680]   Now this is remember on a there's here. They're watching on a MacBook here
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.280]   So it's a tiny screen if you had a big screen it wouldn't be the lights would not be overpowering
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:39.760]   The video like they are and a big screen would be the light lights would be accident
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:45.000]   What are we watching shark nato baby? Oh, okay. Sorry. I'm not that I know it just sets it
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.320]   It's I haven't look a ferris wheel has got moose
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.840]   That's a quality film right there
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.280]   Well the title says it all
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:02.840]   Oh, Hugh disco. That's what you need for that is you disco. It's a four dollar app. It's on Android and I
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.040]   Thought I had to buy more lights
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.960]   Anything you play if I
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:15.360]   It'll do different lighting patterns. So all of our dance parties. That's like a light
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.680]   Yeah, so can you do an actual disco though?
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.840]   Like a disco ball. I have one of those two. Oh
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.960]   Well, it is a party at Stacy's house. Oh wow
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.120]   crazy, I
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.440]   Don't know if you can do a disco ball
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.880]   You could do strobe if you really wanted to upset the epilex in your life
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:41.040]   But I do that with the nano like what we have the nano art plus the hue lights going
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.040]   man
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.040]   It's pretty awesome
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.400]   I don't also there's a hue party app as well. There's a lot of apps
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:55.560]   Hugh disco is not from it's not from Phillips though. No, it's not cute
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.320]   But he recommends it they have an app store in there. Yes, they have an app recommended thing
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.960]   All right. I don't know how I got off on this yesterday
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.560]   President Trump
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.560]   struck out at Samsung
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:12.560]   Where I don't even understand this is this is the
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.960]   There by the way, it's been debunked 50,000
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:21.960]   You know it let's not even talk about it, but I wonder I mean, okay. Yeah, let's why give why give in why I give
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.960]   off
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:38.280]   Kids nowadays kids in your smartphones the verge used crowd sourcing
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.080]   to solve the Google I owe puzzle
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:47.400]   More than a hundred discord users helped us at the verge to solve
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.960]   the puzzle so what you had to do is
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:57.320]   Is you starts with the tweet? Let's see if I can find the tweet now. That was last year's
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.800]   There's a binary tweet
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.120]   Pin to the top of the Google
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.560]   developers Twitter account let me go to it
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:11.400]   And I don't know how to how it goes from after that
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:18.600]   But this is this is this is the tweet and and if you look at it's obviously zeros and ones it's binary
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:23.440]   So we first you have to figure out what that is. Maybe it's a URL. It's probably not long enough to be a URL
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.960]   but
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.800]   But they nailed it. They got it. I
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.600]   out
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.160]   2018 will be May 8th through 10th at Shoreline
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:37.920]   You have to apply to a buy a ticket February 22nd, and I'm sure Stacy you'll be there
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.480]   Nope, no
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:45.960]   You can watch most of it online. I know there's I don't even know why we go to these things anymore
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.800]   I said after going to last free stuff. No
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.120]   What do they don't you know it's
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:57.960]   What do we get this was free this year? I don't even remember wasn't anything great, but one year was cardboard
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:03.840]   Wasn't it cardboard? Yeah cardboard you could get free at like best buy and that was a bad example
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:13.280]   First the image and the Google developer to translate from binary and points to Google.com/io from there
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:17.680]   You're taken to a Google Maps page with a splash screen
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:23.240]   Let's see go behind the scenes. It says with oh look at this
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:29.680]   Using Google technologies. This is Street View. Should we go inside? I don't know I
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.240]   Don't have a badge. Can I go in?
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.640]   You can
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.080]   Oh
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.400]   No, I'm looking at the window. They don't let you in
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:46.160]   Okay, that's it. I'm sure there's more you got to explore around
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:52.200]   Okay, so okay, you're taking a Google Maps page of the splash screen once you begin walking around in the Street View
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:59.560]   You can walk into one of the company's office buildings if you explore throughout the room an identification icon will appear over different items
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:05.480]   There's so far there's a calendar showing August 5th, which is National Sister Day
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.040]   a plate of sushi and the sister carry book
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:14.400]   If you go try to get through the door on the other and you're supposed to enter a city name that Google seeks
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:21.320]   Based on all the sister clues we discovered that the city the game was looking for was Mountain View's sister city Iwata
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:25.680]   Jeez you really have to be yet fortunately
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:30.160]   9 to 5 Google. I mean it goes on the next location is a meeting room
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.160]   I mean
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.760]   Adolescent
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:44.540]   Time for this yeah, what's well heard what any programmer on a deadline is thrilled to be doing this right then write that's a login code
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:51.640]   It's it's very much targeted towards the people I think they're trying to attract
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:58.320]   I'm reading a wonderful book that Jeff Jarvis recommended from Kurt Anderson
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:04.400]   who was one of the founders of spy magazine has been around and it's called fantasy land 400 years of
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:12.640]   fantasy in America and it ties right into something that's always bugged me which is that we are we are all
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:21.360]   Adolescents now right between cosplay and Star Wars and action figures even full-grown geeks are
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.480]   Acting like 12 year olds right true
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.440]   Is that so bad? Yes, that's mostly I don't know
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:40.560]   Growing up isn't that great. Let's admit it
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.160]   It's boring. It's it's stressful
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:52.400]   I mean if some guy wants to spend his weekends making a giant mech suit that he can wear to go to some cosplay event
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.920]   I don't care. I think that's great, you know
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.640]   Okay, so you'd be at a bar drinking watching football
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:05.560]   Can we talk more about chronicle because I still don't yes other than using Google's infrastructure to
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:09.260]   Scan your data to detect security risks
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.840]   what's
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.160]   It's just is that it?
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.800]   This is this is where like I was reading about it and I'm like
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:22.120]   I'm gonna have to talk to somebody at Google because I I don't I
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:30.720]   Don't understand what's two services security intelligence and analytics platform for enterprises and
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:38.640]   an online malware and virus scanner called virus total. Oh wait a minute. I know virus total. Yeah, that's been around for a long time
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:46.720]   Google acquired that in 2012. Mm-hmm. I have to say Google has a very good reputation
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.400]   for finding zero days in fact it was a
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:57.440]   Google research team that found among others, but they found specter and meltdown mm-hmm and
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:02.880]   Maybe this repute they're trying to capitalize on this reputation
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.960]   We talk all the time
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.600]   About Google's security research teams. I don't know if they'll be in chronicle or not
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.240]   Well, that's I mean they're saying that you have access to Google's info
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.760]   So this is gonna be built on Google's infrastructure. So it is
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.960]   But then it sounds like you would give them all your business data and they would use their infrastructure
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:28.280]   What could possibly go wrong with that that is kind of what it sounds like
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:34.200]   So I'm not trying to be snarky. I would you run I'm just trying to understand what it is
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.800]   I think
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.680]   Actually though if you're a CIO at a fortune 500 company
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:45.960]   Maybe you're scared to death right maybe it maybe not a fortune 500 because you've got the resources
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:50.200]   But maybe a fortune 1000 or even a smaller company you're scared to death
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.560]   because you see all these other come Merck took
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:58.600]   last year 300 million dollar right off because of
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.480]   Want to cry ransomware
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:05.120]   This is terrifying you look at what happens Sony Pictures Entertainment
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.960]   You look at what happened to
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:12.200]   Sheldon Edelson's casino back-end company
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:19.840]   I mean these are companies big enough companies to have absolutely great security and they're not doing so I think there's probably a fairly hefty market
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.840]   set for people saying help and
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:27.840]   I think you'd probably trust Google that there's an as there actually I wonder this for some time
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:32.440]   Is there ever it been any record of Google's security failing?
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:36.200]   Not that I can think of even Apple, you know with the
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.280]   iCloud hacks
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.040]   Has it has a bad tracker?
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:45.120]   I can't think of a single breach of Google services or systems not one been hushed up
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:50.240]   Now now Matthew do you don't have any evidence of that?
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.440]   What would they say at the CJR
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:59.880]   Take news well it's possible, but I you know nowadays
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.920]   I don't think you hush stuff up
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:07.760]   I don't think there has been and I think that's one of the few companies you can talk talk about even Facebook's had you know
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:13.400]   Slip-ups remember Mark Zuckerberg's private photos got posted to his public timeline
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:22.440]   That's never happened to my knowledge at Google both Google and Amazon seem to have I can't think of anything with Amazon
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:28.560]   So either actually come to think of it so I could see why you would trust Google
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:37.280]   You know until well your desperate your desperate issue though is how far as Google can encroach on your
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:44.200]   Data-to-day business. So kind of the issue that companies who are in the logistics base are now thinking about with Amazon
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.880]   They're like, oh, I don't want to give Amazon all my data
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:53.800]   Right actually and people are gonna point out well Google owns Android don't they and there have been plenty of Android exploits out there?
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:57.880]   So maybe not to mention all the major tech companies have
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:04.840]   You know I've been handing data to the government pretty regularly. Yeah, they can't help it if they ask nicely
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:11.860]   They can't stop it you could fight it, but you're gonna lose occasionally they sue, but they don't sue all the time
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:17.160]   No, I'm like, I don't know where their moral compass is and it may not mesh with mine
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:21.240]   And there's no published rules. So gosh, this no
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:24.480]   Secret courts are the best
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.480]   Yay, we're gonna talk about Pfizer
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.580]   Pfizer did get Pfizer did get
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:35.760]   Renewder the section with 702 the Pfizer super secret. Yeah now
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.920]   Check me if I'm wrong is I read that that only affects
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:49.440]   If foreign nationals overseas nobody in the US at all not even foreign nationals in the US, right? I
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.640]   Don't know
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:57.960]   Not sure about that the reason I read that is because
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:04.360]   That's why the president was glad to sign it because it wasn't involved in spying on his campaign, right?
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.200]   702
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.200]   under authority
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.400]   Oh, no innocent Americans may be caught in
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.240]   upstream
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:20.240]   Surveillance or provided they're not the target right so they can be sort of caught in the natural damage provided there
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:26.680]   So 702 says collection of foreign intelligence from non-Americans located outside the United States
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.960]   So you can't obviously you cannot target Americans, but
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:35.640]   You can happen to get some information from the max
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:41.600]   Dently right so if for instance you were to call the Russian ambassador in Russia
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.520]   From Trump Tower
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:50.080]   That call would be swept up. It's supposed to be a mask to the American is supposed to be masked
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.220]   Yeah, there was an excellent good wife on this
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:56.960]   I get all my best stuff from good wife. Yeah
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:03.480]   So 702 which would have sunset it has been renewed to another five years. I think
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:11.200]   Because basically every all the security establishments and intelligence agencies said we really really need it
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:17.680]   And you don't want to be to be even though we can't tell you specifically what we've done with it or whether it works or not
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.960]   I mean if you're a member of Congress or a senator
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:24.800]   You don't want to be the guy who voted against that and there's some massive terrorist attack, right?
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   You don't want to be responsible
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.800]   You don't be
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:33.920]   That's the same sort of thing that gets enterprise software sales that you know exactly
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:38.360]   That are not in business. Yep
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:45.600]   Hey, you want to talk about net neutrality. Let's take a break and then talk about net neutrality. Okay, some good news
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:51.440]   Some good news out of the great state of Montana. It is okay
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.080]   Alright, let's talk about that. All right, this is where Karsten Bondi apparently is
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.920]   We're gonna talk about Burger King and we could talk about Burger King
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.160]   Is there a totally talk about is there net neutrality at Burger King
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:05.680]   Really after the break you can see the video. Okay, I can't do it. I'll do it
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.760]   I'll do it. I'll do it. But first a word from our sponsor rocket mortgage
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:15.000]   From quick and loans quick and loans the best lender in the country number one in customer satisfaction
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.960]   Year after year according to JD power both in mortgage approval and mortgage servicing
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.520]   And that was even before they invented rocket mortgage
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:30.720]   Which to me as a geek is the number one way to apply for a home loan or a refi because it's entirely online
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:35.720]   No more going to the bank. No more going to the attic to get paperwork
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:41.640]   You could do it all online. You could do it from your phone at an open house and it takes minutes
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.680]   This is awesome
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:48.480]   The next actually right now go to rocket mortgage.com/twig
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:53.320]   Book market maybe even get the process started so that it's there. It's in your phone
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:57.520]   It's ready to go and then if you say you're in an open house and you say I want this house
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.520]   I want it. I love it. I want it. I need it
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:05.540]   You can just finish the process you give them some basic information that's already in your head name address birthday
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:09.040]   Social that kind of thing they have
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:17.320]   Relationships with all the financial institutions secure secure connections so they can say with your permission. Okay. Let's let's pull this stuff
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:22.400]   They crunch the numbers all of this is happening like lickety split because it's computerized
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.400]   There's no humans based on your income assets and credit
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:31.680]   They will analyze all the options out there and they'll provide offer you the ones that you qualify for
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:39.280]   You choose the term the rate the down payment and the loan is yours. You're approved big green button right on the screen approved
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:45.720]   Show that to the realtor. Press the button that says print out a letter if you're if your realtor really wants a piece of paper print out
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.720]   And you could do that in

[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.760]   Google
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.760]   Google Google Google
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:25.160]   Net neutrality so I'll give you what I you know, maybe it's the good news state of Montana
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.360]   Has voted
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:32.080]   That if you want to do business in Montana as an internet service provider
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.640]   You have to have you have to be net neutral
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:43.960]   That's a good thing right what's what could possibly that's that's definitely good news if all the states do this if California
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:48.240]   It would be a big thing Montana's I mean it's populist, but it's not like
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:54.840]   I'm just saying that Montana like a rural area most of them don't want to serve rural areas anyway
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.240]   Because it's highly expensive
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:01.200]   You know if they can get out of that they would so imagine if
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:07.480]   You're like you have to be net neutral. They're like, oh, okay. Never mind. Bye. Bye. You know, it's cool
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.320]   It was an executive order the governor Stephen Bullock
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.920]   Just declared Monday that any internet service provider with a state government contract ah
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:22.600]   Cannot block or charge more for faster delivery of websites to any customer in the state. I mean, whoever
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.920]   Of course remember the FCC said we don't want the states to make their own rules
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.680]   Right, so there could be legal challenges
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:37.120]   But I admire them for doing that. I mean, it's I think it's still worthwhile that they that they're even trying to do it
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:43.120]   That's better than lots of places and then this one Randall Randall Stevenson of the CEO of
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.800]   AT&T
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:52.880]   Said AT&T is committed. They bought big full-page ads in a bunch of newspapers
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:59.720]   Saying they want net neutrality AT&T is committed to an open internet. We don't block websites
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:06.400]   We don't censor my content. We don't throttle discriminator grade network performance based on content they were a mirror rating
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:13.840]   Well, and they also want Facebook and Google their arch nemesis is nemesi. I don't know
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.360]   nemesis to be
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.880]   nemesis
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:23.560]   To be subject to regulations as well, right? They are trying to this is their okay. I'll go for that
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.920]   Damn it. It's a it's a different
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:32.720]   They need to be regulated in a different way. I'm not gonna argue that we should not do some form of regulation over like
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.800]   Maybe data monopolies. I actually had a guest on my podcast talking about
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:42.040]   What an anti-competitive regime for the 21st century looks like and it was really interesting
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:46.480]   I have to know when you read that it's AT&T you have to scratch your head and go okay
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.120]   What are they up to because they have never been really?
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:53.200]   They want their they want their definition of net neutrality
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.440]   So their definition includes allows them to do things like zero rating
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:00.560]   Which I think should not be allowed
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.840]   They they want the Congress to pass and which by the way
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:09.920]   I think the congressional solution is the right solution if you can get if you can get congressional agreement and we're one vote
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.320]   Away in the Senate, but that doesn't mean it's given close to passing in that house
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:22.960]   Congressional action rights AT&T is needed to establish an internet bill of rights that applies to all internet companies by which they mean us and
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:27.680]   The information services and guarantees neutrality transparency
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.800]   openness
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:35.920]   Non discrimination and privacy protection for all internet users, you know, I don't tell me why that's a bad thing Stacey
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.600]   so my my issue is
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:43.040]   regulating ISPs net neutrality is a solution for
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:48.840]   Providing lack of competition. It's it's a lack of competition at an infrastructure level
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.120]   Now it is the right solution
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:58.800]   So common carriage type of rules are the right solution when you're dealing with physical infrastructure in a non-competitive market
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.520]   now where it gets interesting and is
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:06.840]   When AT&T is like let's let's do the same rules will follow the same rules that Google and Facebook do
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:13.600]   I don't think that's right because they're in a very different competitive environment their competitive environment isn't necessarily based on physical infrastructure
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:16.520]   Although their data centers are a huge element of that right?
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:21.200]   But they're in their competitive advantage is based on data
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.240]   So then they should be regulated based on
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:28.760]   That competitive advantage. So you what you really need is two separate laws
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:34.680]   And you can talk about yes, you have other Google is still, you know, I use duck duck go
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:38.200]   You know, I don't have to use Google you could use being blah blah blah
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:45.480]   But you know there is a data monopoly developing among the big companies and we do need to look at that and figure out a solution
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.520]   for
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:51.880]   Making sure that having all of this information doesn't create a
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:58.120]   barrier to other companies being able to come in and innovate and that's that's fine
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.600]   I think that makes sense. I just don't
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.240]   cause
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:09.400]   Putting the same rules around them in AT&T don't make sense at all because AT&T is providing
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:15.240]   Physical infrastructure physical access exactly. Yeah, I would agree. I mean there's definitely issues around
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:21.760]   Facebook and Google and probably Amazon - I mean yes competition sort of competition policy
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:28.000]   Just isn't equipped to deal with things like network effects and you know
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:34.160]   It's it was designed to to deal with physical assets like I control all the railway cars
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.360]   Or I control all the barrels of oil or whatever
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.040]   Facebook doesn't control anything
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:46.720]   Tangible except a lot of data that people willingly provide it which is a completely different animal
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:54.280]   Meanwhile Amazon Facebook and Google are spending more money lobbying than ever before
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:58.080]   That's because they know this is coming. Yeah
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:06.320]   So it makes sense something trying to think something is coming so actually
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.880]   Doesn't really sound like that much
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:12.680]   No, but Congress is cheaper than you think. Yeah, I suppose
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:16.280]   Particularly cheap
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:24.640]   All right, so Amazon spent 12.8 million dollars lobbying four times what is spent four years earlier Facebook
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:28.840]   spent also a record amount 11 and a half million dollars Apple spent
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.520]   seven million dollars
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:38.560]   Of course, you know 12 million for Jeff Bezos. That's like me spending a buck 50 on a cup of coffee. It's it literally is
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:44.680]   It's actually probably less than it's probably less than that he's so somebody I saw it
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:49.360]   A spreadsheet because he's worth 113 billion dollars
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:53.320]   Let's say I'm worth a million dollars
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.160]   He's worth
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:52:03.560]   113,000 more than I am right so that means that every one dollar I spent every one dollar spend
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:11.000]   No every one hundred thirteen thousand dollars. I spent is worth one dollar to him. Yeah. Yeah, so 12 million dollars is like 10 bucks
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.960]   Yeah
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.960]   It's a little more than 10 bucks
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:21.120]   It's like I think someone probably has it in his wallet. He probably has it in the cushions of his couch
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:28.120]   Someone said his net worth increased 2.8 billion daily and and that's 10 times as much
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:35.640]   That's in a single day. That's 10 times as much as all the cashiers that who work in retail in the United States
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:41.840]   By the way, that number is gonna dwindle quickly Amazon go opened on Monday the first convenience store with no clerks
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:49.440]   And I cannot I did am I a bad person for saying I cannot wait for them to open here. I
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:52.680]   Love the idea walk into the store
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:59.160]   You scan your phone, right? Because you know, I think eventually they'll use Bluetooth L or something to identify you but
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:03.600]   So eventually I think by the time it gets here you won't even have to scan your phone
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:07.160]   You'll just walk in take what you want and walk out and you'll be billed. I
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:13.400]   Love that no scanning of any kind and just take what you want. What do you like that? Take it?
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:19.840]   You want that take it? It's a it's a dream for everybody. It's a dream for Jeff because you're gonna take more stuff
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:25.920]   And it's a I'm not sure it's I'm not sure it's a dream for poor people. No, I think it's a dream
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.840]   It's a dream for rich people. You're right. Yeah people with
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:34.720]   Income but you still have to shop if you have to shop wouldn't it be better just to put that peanut butter in your you know
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:38.680]   Pocket and walk out don't bring small children though because you know what children do they just grab
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:46.640]   You come home you have eight bags of M&M peanut M&M's. I mean convenience wise. It's it's definitely great
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:50.400]   It sounds fantastic, but you know what better what?
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:54.600]   Pick up groceries to her pickup. Yeah. Yeah, they just bring it
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:58.120]   I need they bring it to you. You know what they need is pick up and put away
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:03.160]   Okay, I can put away my groceries. No, no, I'm lazy. I want to be
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:07.280]   Like I'm I'm willing you know if they take out the shopping trip
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:14.920]   I am willing to put away the groceries. What was remember when Amazon key came out and they were gonna let give their drop off people a
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:19.200]   Apartment or whatever again if they put stuff away, I'd go for it
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:25.160]   Well, someone said the next the next evolution will be Amazon warehouse where you literally just live in the warehouse
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.400]   Stuff doesn't have to come to you at all
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:36.200]   Just bring it, but isn't really Amazon go am is exactly that it's basically a little Amazon warehouse
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:39.280]   Yeah, and you just you do the pick and pull
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:44.000]   You go you pull what you want you walk out the door. That's it's exactly what that is
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:50.080]   It's a little mini Amazon warehouse and I expect that I'm sure you know, there will they'll need people to
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:57.680]   Calibrate the video cameras or you know stock the shelves or something right you you work at home Stacey
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:03.080]   So you know, but if you were working downtown you would love it that when you you know lunchtime came you just go
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:06.960]   You went down and by the way, it wouldn't necessarily be of any particular size
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:11.840]   It could be like that but they go thing the the fake but they guys. They're just a vending machine
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:14.480]   Could just be a little closet in your office. You just take stuff from
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:17.280]   No, that's been a very popular
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.840]   idea for years is
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:25.760]   That kind of stuff vending machine if actually Facebook has had their own little vending machines that
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:32.200]   Distribute office supplies with your Facebook ID. Really? You know, you just go and you just take you take your keyboard or you take your
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:36.220]   What I don't know. Yeah, they have vending machines full of stuff
[00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:42.280]   You actually use your badge you just scan your badge you grab the thing Christmas day this year
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.440]   I didn't know about this
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:48.040]   But something the charms just gave me the link because it was part of the regional version of the New York Times
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:53.040]   They talked about businesses a growing number of businesses that don't take cash at all
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:57.120]   Yeah, it's all credit cards or debit cards
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:02.360]   Or Apple Pay so I don't carry cash, but my daughter
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:06.760]   Doesn't she she carries cash we pay her
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:13.080]   Yeah, I mean she doesn't have to Amazon now has allowances. I could hold all of her money towards
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:18.240]   Amazon she's 12 11. She's 11. It's a little young for credit card. I guess
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:25.840]   Right. So what do you do and honestly, you know how credit cards used to pay a prey on you know kids in college?
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:31.800]   I don't actually think kids in college should have credit cards. That's true, but that's how you
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:38.440]   Have a kid in college and I can agree with you a hundred percent last night Henry said
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:44.320]   He has a credit card of mine ink for emergencies both my kids for emergencies
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:52.600]   Emergent he says okay if I go Christmas shopping with my your credit card. That's an emergency Henry. It's January 24th. What are you talking about?
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:59.180]   That's what all the sales are yeah, he's going emergency shopping
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:02.360]   Christmas shopping
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:05.360]   So there are a number of businesses in Petaluma
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:08.480]   I guess we're very old-fashioned that don't take credit cards that only take cash
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:14.000]   Which is a big annoyance because you know always have to remember to have enough cash to be here lunch
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.560]   But I guess the real trend is going the other direction
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.880]   Wow
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:29.440]   So what do we do if you're I mean we're entering a really interesting world of work your your kids your child Stacy our
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:34.640]   Our kids are all of our kids are already older and suffering
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:40.240]   The world of work is just yeah falling apart. There are no entry-level jobs
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.960]   That's the thing cashier
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.960]   cab driver truck driver
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:49.680]   Disappearing my first job was a cashier. Yeah
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:54.160]   Yeah, my first job was working at McDonald's I use I suppose they still have people there
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:58.080]   But that's not for long how about this gas. How about this Burger King? Oh?
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:04.760]   Yeah, we forgot to talk about that yes, I am really jumping all over today. I apologize
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:10.120]   Burger King deviously explains net neutrality
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.680]   By making people wait longer for whoppers
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:22.960]   That is pretty awesome. Is this real? Yeah, they really did this to people and recorded it and apparently some people whopper neutrality
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.520]   net neutrality was just
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.480]   And it's very confusing
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:36.760]   For what it's worth just look I know whatever stops me on the streets and asked to find these
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:43.040]   Cuz if they did and they recorded it they wouldn't use it they wouldn't use it all right
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:48.040]   It's the same thing with you know they do that on the late shows right they ask people who's the president of states
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:54.320]   Eugene Debs and then actually that's exactly what you start with
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:58.480]   Revolutionary for the
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.920]   King Kong and
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:07.760]   And everybody laughs at how stupid people are but that's because they as as 20 people to get the really done I presume
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:12.120]   Maybe not okay. Sorry back to the back to the
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:24.520]   Number 98 you got the whopper. Yeah, so you got the slow access whopper pass
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:30.960]   It's on the menu right there at the fast medium and slow slow
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:36.040]   DPS fast MBPS or hyperfast MBPS MBPS
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:37.520]   MBPS
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.520]   Working burgers per second
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:45.120]   Well, that's that's how you get it fast. It's the highest priority
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:48.680]   This is like a laden's it's only like 15. Yeah fast lane slow lane
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:51.240]   So like maybe like 15 20 minutes he gets it
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:59.040]   Money selling with chicken sandwiches and chicken fries and now they're slowing down the access to the walker
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.960]   You give an option of chicken sandwich or I don't want a chicken sandwich
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:12.480]   I admire burger for for being willing to annoy the hell out of it. I wonder if anybody got the sandwiches ready
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:16.200]   I'm just not allowed to actually get it. You can't give me the sandwich. It's ready
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.760]   But you can't give it to me the Walker neutrality was repealed
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.760]   They vote
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:27.320]   See like you got the best
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:35.520]   That is my favorite hurting are you kidding me some guy actually paid
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:42.240]   My name is one burger for the burger you want to
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:51.760]   Here's what I'll do you have the bag and I can put it in the bag in 42 seconds
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:01:02.440]   Don't make the rules. I presume these guys are not actual employees
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.200]   Unfortunately, we have to they have to be asked. No, they're good
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:09.920]   I was being taken advantage of in a sense. Just as a customer coming in to get their food
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:14.440]   It's felt like a power move. They already changed the policies overnight or whatever
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:22.200]   I didn't think that this is brilliant ordering a waffle. Thank you burger king eyes up to net neutrality the wapper actually
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.840]   Tell me about net neutrality. It's stupid but true
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:32.200]   Stupid but true that is that's my favorite. I am gonna cry. It's it. That's awesome
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.400]   Why did the king do that?
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:41.480]   That's brilliant. I don't like the king. I know the king is creepy as hell. Can I use a creepy as heck?
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.800]   But that was a good video
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:49.000]   Stupid but true. I had somebody call the radio show. Yes, you're Sunday
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.440]   Matthew and say is there what is going on with net neutrality in Canada?
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:59.320]   And I said, I don't know what is going on with that. I said, you know as
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:03.400]   You know, if it's bad here it might be bad up there. I don't know what's going on
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:09.800]   I mean nothing really like it hasn't changed. You have it right. Do you have it?
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.920]   No
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:18.680]   Okay, so we we kind of have it but not really I mean our market is very different
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:25.800]   We only have really two major carriers. No competition. Yeah. Yeah, so it's not really
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:31.400]   And maybe we should have had net neutrality a long time ago. Yeah, the thing that's
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.600]   That's disturbing the more recent thing is that
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:40.120]   The carriers are basically arguing that they would like to have
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:48.200]   A special organization that decides what websites you can go to and what websites you can't go to
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:53.880]   Yeah, so it's it's a little like do you remember soap and peepa? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's sort of like that
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:57.640]   So they want to have a privacy or sorry piracy
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.560]   Council
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.560]   totally independent of course
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.920]   That would decide which websites you could go to or not go to
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.840]   and
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.480]   So that they're kind of lobbying the government to give them
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:12.280]   Not to give them to give this totally independent
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.400]   piracy council uh that ability
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.120]   Do you have burger king uh in canada?
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.760]   We do have burger king just check it
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:23.960]   I am now going to shop. I'm going to go buy a wapper
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:28.360]   At full price not as good as harvies though. No, rappers are terrible, but
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:32.360]   I really they're finding amazing people didn't just leave though
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:39.240]   That so they were arguing. I'm sure a lot of clearly it's wearing and I'd say but you don't know you already paid your money
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.800]   Yeah, I suppose you're not going to leave without your burger
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:48.200]   Even if it's going to take them 42 seconds was the guy who paid 26 dollars a real dude though like did someone actually do that
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.840]   I don't know
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.840]   You got to really want a burger
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:04:00.120]   Uh, those were actors people who have identified them. In fact, one of them was reagan burgers the guy who gave him a tv ads
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:05.320]   Um, but I just I really think gosh kudos to burger king
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.320]   If you see a metaphor if you yeah, and if you'd see more
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.600]   American brands stand up for this
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:18.040]   I think this would not be it would be a little bit more of a fair fight frankly
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:22.920]   I feel like my friends in dc who have fought for net neutrality for a while
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:30.360]   They've said basically that the big brands who were behind them the last go round have not been behind them this around they've been very much
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.960]   They've been very ambivalent
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:39.320]   And washington is very aware of that and that's why they can do it
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:45.000]   Yeah, that's why pie was like, yeah, yeah, I don't care. This is going to happen
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:52.360]   That's interesting and why do you think that is stacy is it because they're the incumbents and they don't need to worry about the little guy getting
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:05:01.720]   Shaft. Yeah, I think part of it's they're the incumbents, but also they're about to engage in they're prepping for war with congress over
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:08.440]   They're data practices. So part of it is just hey, we fought this fight by golly and
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.320]   We're about to have some big fish to pray
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:14.360]   Like breaking democracy fish
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:22.360]   Wow, wow, wow and then there's the atlantic article on raising a social media star and I bet
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.240]   I bet both of you looked at this and went knock on
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.320]   Yes
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:30.920]   I didn't read it. I I bookmarked it, but I haven't gotten there yet. So
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.800]   it starts off with
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.600]   Jonas bridges
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.600]   when 14 year old
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:44.840]   He's not 14 anymore when he was 14. He ran down the stairs of his land of home shouting dad. I've got a thousand fans
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:49.880]   His father rob ridges hardly took notice a few days later Jonas barreled into the living room saying
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.840]   dad i've got 3000 fans now
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:58.200]   Several days later 5,000 and if I get to 10,000 I get paid for it
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.520]   Finally rober bridges turned to his wife and said Denise. What the hell is he talking about?
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:10.680]   This was he was uh rapidly becoming famous on you now, which I don't know of a social video platform
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.720]   He'd been hosting live streams from his bedroom
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:18.920]   Under the pseudonym. Whoa, it's Jonas now if you see a picture of Jonas you see
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:24.680]   The secret of his success is blue eyes blonde hair and a very adorable pune
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:29.640]   And you know, you know, frankly, I think it helps a lot to be super cute
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:32.440]   These dudes. Yeah, it's always
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:36.200]   It's always helped hasn't it
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:40.200]   He's he's kind of a teen uh, he's kind of a teen idol
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.440]   um
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.440]   and and I think they say uh
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.400]   let's see
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:51.800]   Parenting these young stars is not easy as social platforms rise and fall
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:59.240]   moms and dads across the country with zero experience in the entertainment industry are seeing their families lives transformed apparently people call
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:05.000]   You know offering management deals some of them legit some of them scammers. Yeah
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.440]   There was a great article. Um, I'm trying to remember if it was the lannick or new yorker
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.920]   It was about a girl
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.560]   slash woman. I think she was 18
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:18.840]   19 and she wasn't
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.760]   Anybody famous and she didn't think her father was a doctor or something like that
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:27.400]   but she had developed this massive following on instagram because she was attractive and
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.920]   She kind of was on the periphery of sort of rich people
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:36.520]   So she got invited to things and she would she was making tens of thousands of dollars a month
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.280]   just
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:43.560]   sponsorships and you know endorsing things and but it there was this undercurrent of
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:48.200]   She clearly was not happy. So now it was like a job
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:53.800]   You know, yeah looking the right way and going to the right parties. Yeah, it's notoriously
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:58.200]   And depressed. Yeah, it was it was kind of a just very very disturbing
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:03.400]   Article because she couldn't actually enjoy any of the normal things than an 18 or 19
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:07.000]   That person would do because she had to keep thinking about am I going to the right parties?
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.760]   Am I seeing with the right people?
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:13.880]   Do I look good? Am I gonna get those ads or whatever? But we know as parents
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:19.320]   If you're you know, if your daughter Stacy suddenly said I'm gonna do this
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:25.240]   It doesn't you it wouldn't do much good to say well, what's not gonna make you happy? You can't do it. Yeah, true
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:28.280]   You just try to set realistic expectations
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:31.240]   I mean like my daughter looks because we have a youtube channel
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:35.000]   She was that was the most exciting thing. I think I've ever done in my life for her was
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.680]   Create a youtube channel first like the podcast stuff and
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:43.960]   She's like how many subscribers do you have like every day for the first like two weeks?
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:48.440]   She's like I was like, I don't I don't know and she was baffled that I didn't know and then she was like
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:56.040]   I'm you only have 43 and I was like, that's okay. It's new. You know, we're not really marketing it. She's like oh
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.040]   Oh
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.320]   It's it's
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.440]   Huge social currency for them. Yeah, my son
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:05.880]   My son says please let me run your instagram account
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.840]   I could get you so many more follows and likes
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:13.320]   It's like no, Henry. I'm really happy with the number of follows and like it's a different
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.360]   They for them. It's the most important things
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:19.560]   It's terrible puts on them. I think is there was a kid
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:24.520]   I was over at a friend's for dinner and and another friend was there who has a son
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:30.040]   And I think he was 14 at the time and he I was interviewing him like I usually do
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:34.840]   You know, what kind of social media do you use? Are you on twitter? No, only weirdos are on twitter
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:39.160]   Do you he said you know, I like instagram and I said oh i'm an instagram
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:43.400]   And he said oh how many followers do you have and I said, I don't know. I'll look I'll look it up
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:49.080]   Oh, I've got like 5500 or something. He says what and he jumped up off the catching he ran across the room
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:54.280]   And he jammed himself in be beside between me and my daughter where there was no room for anyone to sit
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:58.520]   And he was like he was like, what do you post? What kind of hashtags do you use?
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:03.480]   How did you get so many followers? What do you and I was like dude? I just post photos of like
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:10.680]   Kayaks and sunsets and stuff like I don't know why I don't know why I don't know why even use hashtags
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:17.080]   But he was obsessed. He would not let it go. It's huge. It's huge for them. Now a lot of this goes back to vine
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.120]   Yeah, which twitter bought and killed
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:23.960]   You get ready. It's coming back coming back fine too
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:27.160]   or v2
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.360]   Uh, so the guy who founded vine
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.680]   Dom hoffman
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:37.560]   And sold it to twitter somehow. I guess he's not doesn't have an on computer. Maybe it's expired
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.120]   he's going to create v2
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:44.600]   Yeah, don't call it. Don't call it vine to v2 the reckoning
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.960]   Uh
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:54.120]   I so they okay twitter acquired vine in 2013. So yeah, yeah, I'm sure the non-competives run out
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:58.040]   Uh, so he says that it's going to be a little bit different
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:03.880]   Um, he says don't call it vine. Yep, because we don't want to get sold. It'll be v2.co
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:09.960]   Although look at the vine logo and look at the v2 logo. You tell you tell me
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.120]   uh
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.920]   Similar sometime in 2018
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:19.400]   He says hopefully when it's warm in the northern hemisphere
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:22.440]   Whatever that means
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:27.000]   You know, vine was an amazing vine was an amazing thing that it was it created
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.560]   Many superstars and the creativity that you could see on there
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:38.760]   I was I know I talked to people at twitter at the time about how I thought twitter was not taking advantage of vine the way it should have
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:47.560]   Um, and I know a lot of this sort of stars quote unquote on vine felt the same that they were not getting right kind of paid attention to the way they should have been
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:54.120]   Their videos will range much like vine from two to six and a half seconds vine was six right
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:59.880]   Yeah, six or eight or maybe it was a little longer. They'll loop over and over just like vine
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:06.200]   Uh, there will be no color filters face filters or geo filters at least to start. I don't know
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:10.520]   He says we we don't want and we'll also take down copyrighted content
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.560]   Um
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.120]   He's getting a do over how nice for him to do over
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:19.800]   Back at it again with the white vans. There will be
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.320]   stricter moderation
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.640]   No name calling
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:28.680]   Her harassment director indirect will be allowed
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:34.280]   He wants to remember watching my daughter the people she followed on vine. There was a guy who
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.920]   clearly wanted to be
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.760]   An actor or might have been an actor and he was doing these little bits
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:44.120]   So it was just like a little it was like he was work shopping characters
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.680]   And he would do these little bits where it was like six seconds of just a character
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:53.080]   And it was fascinating. This is by the way where logan paul started the
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.200]   Yeah, reprehensible who is now back
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.320]   He has posted a new
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:03.320]   Uh, any video suicide and pledged a million dollars
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:09.960]   To suicide prevention anti suicide video. I think what did I say suicide video anti video suicide
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:16.280]   Well, no arguably the first one was an anti video suicide. This one. Yeah is an anti suicide
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.040]   But he's not in preferred anymore, right?
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:22.440]   They they took him out of the preferred. Yeah, he already lost a lot of revenue presumably
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.440]   And then they changed the criteria
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:27.800]   But he must have made a lot of money if he's donating a million dollars
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:30.840]   I think he made a lot of money. Holy cow
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.800]   Uh, wow
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.480]   Well, I mean
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.360]   Kids
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:41.480]   So a couple things kids have always been super passionate like tweens and teenage
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:42.440]   Right
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:46.600]   girls. I mean, that's right. That's they're known for that and they have been over the
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:48.760]   You know forever
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:51.720]   Even the Salem witch trials. Let's go that far back. Wow
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:52.920]   So
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.920]   if you if you think about
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:14:02.200]   YouTube in these like the the stars there it makes total sense that this becomes this huge social currency
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.560]   It becomes all important in their lives and they go
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:12.200]   Crazy in a way that is weird to us because we're we're beyond it, but well, it's just like
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:16.840]   It's like hollywood like child actors, right? Except now anybody
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:21.560]   Can be effectively a child actor by having their youtube channel
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:25.160]   You but you see the way you become famous is more
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:30.520]   Yeah, is less remote. I mean you become famous because you interact with these people. Yeah
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:35.240]   But there's still the same push for sort of everybody wants to see someone
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.920]   Flame out publicly everybody wants to see something
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:44.840]   Horrible happen then there's the redemption story. I mean, it's a classic, you know, it's happened with every
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:49.320]   Young actor I can think of and and musicians too like jason beber
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:58.200]   So here's some names that you may remember from why I had to mention him jesse smiles
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.240]   Amy Marie gertner
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:04.600]   Sean Mendes Sean Mendes Carter Reynolds
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:07.720]   Casey james
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.720]   Lance 210
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:15.080]   Brandon cavillo now, where are they now? I wonder us the duo a bunch of them are on youtube
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:20.520]   Yeah, a lot of them went to youtube like logan paul and his brother Sean Mendes went platinum
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.200]   Is he famous? Oh, yeah, he's like a
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:33.080]   Do you sing with island records? Oh my god, yeah, so I guess you guys have nothing to do
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:36.360]   but sit inside and play guitar and do cheesy pop songs
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:41.160]   We are the thing down you better take care. I could tell what he's singing
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:47.480]   My box there he's singing the railroad trilogy. I think yeah, that's it
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:52.440]   Lance 210. I mentioned him the us dude Nicholas McGallis
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:56.760]   Tell me if any of these are famous besides mendez david lopez
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:00.040]   Distorm power
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.640]   They're all but that's funny. Is there all really short six second clips? I mean they're
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.280]   It's really kind of weird
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.520]   Matthew Espinosa jack and jack
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:14.360]   Thomas sanners leeley pawns his huge. I remember I remember she's still a these people could be famous and we would never know
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:21.880]   Well, they were really famous. I mean, okay. They couldn't go in. I didn't know who they didn't know but they couldn't go in public
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:27.880]   I mean they were that famous bret revere there were teens around if there were teens around
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.720]   This guy is mentioned in the atlantic article
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:37.720]   Uh, he went he his parents didn't know he was famous until he went to a hockey game
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:41.240]   And a mom comes down and sits next to him says
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:47.000]   My daughter's having her 13th birthday party here. They're up behind us. Could you just wave at them?
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.040]   And he waved and they went crazy screaming and his dad said what the hell
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:54.360]   [laughs]
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.320]   What what what?
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.440]   Uh, I still see leeley pawns on twitter
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:08.440]   I guess you know for the thing is it's for a particular. This is this this is a medium of six second
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:11.080]   site gigs basically
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.120]   mm-hmm
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.120]   but some of them are really
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:16.120]   Powerful in a weird sort of way. Yeah
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.920]   But I mean not that one
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:22.120]   Yeah, that actually speaks to a universal experience for all women
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:27.800]   Because leaving your phone in the cab and then running out having it fall out of your pocket as you sit down. Yeah
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:30.280]   Yeah, that happened to lisa. Yeah

[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:44.040]   I think yeah, my favorite was when they would act like multiple characters in a single right
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:48.360]   They put a lot of work. I mean these are a lot of work. Yeah, gerry perp drank
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:51.240]   That's not a real name
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:55.320]   Sorry josh peck

[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:19.720]   I I could see like the temporary popularity of these but
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:23.400]   Again, it's good. That was what we call it's yeah
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:31.400]   And this is super shareable. It is super super sure. Yeah, that was good enough to sit there for an hour and watch a show
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:35.720]   Yeah, and it's all kids talking to kids right? These are all teenagers pretty much
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.400]   Oh, he's in the same movie as that other one that guy above no
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:44.440]   Yeah, the other one had a lot of spell. Yeah, we're gonna find out more about this movie. Did they ever come out?
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:49.080]   Hmm. This is an expelled star. This is an older
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:52.760]   article
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:55.080]   This is three years ago

[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:07.080]   Uh, five out of ten on IMDB. Yeah, that's pretty bad
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:13.800]   It's not great. I have a recommendation for y'all. All right. I know I know we're not there yet
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.000]   but
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.440]   what
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.200]   Paddington too
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.200]   It was so good
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.200]   It had 100 on the
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:25.560]   scoring run tomatoes movie of all time
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:30.280]   Ladybird was there but then one jack asked gave it a negative review
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:34.040]   So that if you get 100 means there are zero bad reviews
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:36.840]   Yeah
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.880]   I mean
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:40.760]   Someone has probably come in and given it. It's it's very cute
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:45.240]   I mean, obviously you would not go to see this if you were, you know, not into it
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:48.840]   And I live by rotten tomatoes, but I don't think this is gonna get us in the theater
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:55.240]   This this may not be for you, but as a like I mean, I have to go to lots of kid appropriate shows
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:20:00.920]   And this one was really fun and it was it was just a sweet good movie
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:06.840]   Well, you know what I you would I'm Hugh Grant, isn't it? What I was young. Is he you patting to?
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:14.120]   No, he was the he's a villain. Oh my gosh. Should he is hilarious also? It's a live action anime musical numbers are yeah
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:20.360]   What I I loved this book when I was a kid and I read it to my kids. I'm pretty sure I certainly never read it
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.760]   the original one
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:26.280]   Blow me down
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:30.280]   We've got a cup to raise what's he like?
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:35.560]   He likes his marmalade. I have a feeling he'll go for
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:39.480]   Oh
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:43.640]   Yeah, he's famous for his blue raincoat and his red hat. Yeah, yeah
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:47.800]   So the first pattington's really cute and I think it's like on Netflix. So
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:55.560]   Again, you may not watch it, but like it's got a lot of slapstick humor. It's a well-done family movie basically
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.240]   Nice
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:59.880]   So yes, you don't have to like it's not for everyone
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:03.640]   It's not it did it get an Oscar nod
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:09.480]   I don't think so. Yeah, someone in the chat room said I want to see pattington versus Ted
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:13.640]   Yeah, that's kind of the good bear versus the bad bear bad bear
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:17.480]   No, the animated features is it would it be that's the problem with these mixed ones?
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.480]   You don't know if it's animated or what
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:24.440]   The part of it is the nominated animated features are boss, baby breadwinner cocoa Ferdinand
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:30.920]   And cocoa is really great cocoa supposed to be very good and it's fantastic. The breadwinner is really good
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:37.240]   Okay, it's very depressing, but loving vince boss, baby. Yeah boss, baby loving vids is for grownups
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:41.960]   That's an animated story about vince van goh, but it's not that's amazing too
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:44.360]   I it's like his paintings came to life right came to life
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:47.720]   It's incredible the amount of work that went into that film is mind-boggling
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:51.000]   Well, especially since vince it's not painting anymore
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.560]   right
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.040]   You have to get people can duplicate that style
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:04.600]   Android 8.1 now can display your Wi-Fi speed before you connect so you know
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.080]   If it's worth connecting
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:12.120]   When you see a public Wi-Fi hotspot, it will be labeled very fast fast, okay
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:17.080]   Or slow and I bet 97 percent of the time it will say
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:23.400]   Slow to zero. Yeah public Wi-Fi ain't no I noted for its speed. It's almost always the worst
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:29.080]   Yeah, well, it's also full of all sorts of malicious goings on which I imagine
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:35.720]   But I think they under provision as well. I'll bet you. Well, why would you over provision? Yeah, maybe like
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:42.200]   You're like cleaning the streets or building highways with enough capacity. Yeah putting enough bathrooms around
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.640]   Why would you don't even complain Matthew?
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:47.640]   Even complain
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:54.360]   So did you any of you watch the event that msnbc did with recode a cariswitcher and our amelba
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.000]   a member and
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.720]   Why was this a big deal?
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:02.840]   Send her a chai season wojiski on stage
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:08.120]   Sorry, why was it a big deal that he said because this is where he said that he didn't regret firing that dude. Yes
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:13.240]   Yeah, yeah, so why was that that was like because you know why i'll tell you why
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:20.760]   Because ceo's never saying anything interesting true. That's the true the best they could get out of him was that and
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:25.080]   Sundar pachai compares the impact of ai to electricity fire
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:29.000]   Which he's done at google a bunch of times. I know I know
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.200]   That just tells me we didn't miss it. We didn't miss anything
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:37.800]   I think fire. I would still give it to fire myself. I think he's more like electricity
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:41.160]   Yeah, you know, yeah fire is the big winner in that
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:48.840]   For sure. I think if you look at historically, I would say fire win. Kevin kelly actually we did a triangulation with kevin kelly
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.920]   He's we wrote his last book was about
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.160]   the future and he
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:57.640]   He talked he actually said that it's going to be very much like when electricity became widespread
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:02.760]   What all the inventors did was they would apply a thin layer of electricity and they get this new invention
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:08.200]   So he he said for instance look at the pump, you know and the out in the yard the hand pump where did you get your water?
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:12.520]   They applied electricity to it, something you've got running water and he says ai is going to be like that
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:15.800]   You're going to take existing and I think he was he was absolutely right this year
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:22.200]   Take existing technologies and you apply a thin layer of ai and you've got an ai sand and arguably the internet did that as well
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:25.080]   I mean, yeah, I was just in the earlier day days you had
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:28.680]   You know bob and tugs electric company provided
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:33.880]   Lights for like a block and so you had hundreds of thousands of these little
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:36.760]   electric providers and then they all got rolled up and
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.640]   I
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:46.680]   Is going to put it self-driving vans in Atlanta more and more you know, you're going to be able to try an autonomous vehicle
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:49.400]   As they I'd love to yeah, I would too
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:56.120]   What do you think south by you think just a lot of vehicles? Yeah, they usually have autonomous vehicles
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:01.560]   So by I believe they I wanted an autonomous petty cab
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:08.600]   Okay, oh like an autonomous moped kind of thing. No, you know how they
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:14.040]   Have those were basically around so you would have to build a robot
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.400]   That would pedal. Yeah, that's silly. That's anything
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:22.920]   Robl had told dancing robots didn't they see yes, okay. That was that was so
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:27.880]   I know it was stupid. It was offensive. Don't get me and it was stupid
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:32.360]   I just you know what's stupid is that robot? What's her name the one everybody keeps?
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.600]   Sophie talking to yes
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:43.320]   It's so bad. It's not a robot. No, it's it's terrible. It's no more a robot than that chest playing
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:45.400]   machine
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:51.800]   Do you remember the guy in the movie big where you went up to him? He was on like the midway? Yeah, it's a midway
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.960]   Yeah, it's old star. She's a robot like
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:58.680]   Programers player. Yeah, it's a it's a thank you
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:06.680]   You are less than 10 percent of google account owners are using two-factor authentication. I was just reading this
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:09.160]   I'm using two factor. I'm using two factor
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:13.000]   Two factor away. We're not in the majority of both that doesn't
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.040]   We're good people. Oh
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:24.520]   Why do not I mean I explain this every week on the radio show, which you know, I assume the radio shows where I talk to the most
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.240]   Normal of people
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:29.240]   Never read our show. Yeah
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:32.680]   You don't listen because you're not normal
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:41.080]   Uh, yeah, no, it's a it's a pretty big deal this this way. Okay. It's on 200 stations across the country. Oh, okay
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:45.000]   Uh, and it's uh, you know, it's a call-in technology show
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.920]   Oh, okay. Yeah, and so I answer questions, but I I talk about
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:51.720]   I try to bring
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:56.760]   the you know the level of understanding that we all have and the level of the conversation we all have two
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:02.120]   People who aren't as obsessed with technology. We are and I think I I
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:05.880]   I told my doctor is hard to explain though like too far like once you
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:08.680]   A it sounds nerdy
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:12.200]   But even after you explain it that it's kind of hard for people to understand
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:19.240]   How it works unless you show them so like I'm never gonna get yeah my mom to do two factor ever
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:25.880]   My mom just you factor. I just told her that it prevents the government from spying on your computer
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.720]   Ah
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:31.320]   Liar okay. That did that work. That's the one thing it doesn't do
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:39.880]   My mom can barely use email. So yeah, you know getting her to use two factors or loss cause but
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:44.680]   You know, I I got my daughter to set it up. She called me in a panic the other day saying
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:48.040]   Google says somebody's logged onto my account from New York City
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:52.920]   It was a I was an ipv6 address. So I think it was not probably
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:55.800]   Anything bad it wasn't a regular ip address
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:58.040]   But I said okay
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:03.480]   Well a couple of things you should do immediately one is change your google password and to turn on two factor
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:05.880]   And she did it now what I told her is
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:09.000]   She has an iPhone and get the google app on your iPhone
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:16.360]   And when you go to this google security page and you enable two factor say that you want a notification from the google app
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:20.280]   As the factor that doesn't so there's no entry of numbers
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:26.680]   Right when you log in that microsoft does this too. It's actually so much easier when you log into your google account
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:31.240]   It says okay. We're gonna look at your phone and say yes if you approve this
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:34.360]   That's as easy as you can get right. No, you're right
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:37.000]   In the text message
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.400]   It's easier than authentic
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.280]   Because it fortune we actually had to use
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:45.960]   Because of Bloomberg we had to use authenticator, right or we did yeah
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:49.400]   No, we I mean we had Bloomberg terrible most but you know I wasn't in the main office
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:52.920]   I never used him but and a fortune we had hard keys, right? We had the
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:56.520]   We had to do yeah, we had hard keys. Yeah, the RSA hard keys
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:03.400]   RSA in the computer and you had to change your password every 90 days that we had which we now know is wrong
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:07.000]   I know I hated it. Yeah, it was always a bad idea. So
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.000]   I think the real problem with two factor and the thing that's I bet you more than 10 percent of tried it
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:17.640]   Is that some apps particularly since we're in this app driven world now because of the smartphone
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:23.640]   Don't understand two factor and so you have to create a application specific password and that is bad
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:28.680]   It's a pain. Yeah, not only a pain. It's just crazy and it's bad. It's a thing and it doesn't work
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:33.480]   And so I think that's probably what happens is people go. Yeah, this is I'm not doing this anymore
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:35.480]   and I think a lot of people like
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:38.280]   it will take a
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:41.960]   Significant negative event for them to sort of realize that this is important
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:45.480]   So in the same way what happened to my daughter. I think if that hadn't happened, there's no way
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:48.680]   I could have just said oh you said in the same way my daughter lost her phone
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:51.320]   And she had not backed up any of her photos
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:54.520]   So she lost all the photos of this European trip she went on
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:30:01.560]   And so instantly she realized the value of packing up your phone, but it took till that moment
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:07.960]   She was like, oh, yeah, I know you're supposed to blah blah blah, but I just never did and then all of a sudden it became much more important
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:10.440]   That's like renters insurance
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:15.640]   You never get it until something happened. That's we're all we're all stupid. We're all lazy
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:20.920]   And actually I remember thinking I had my laptop stolen when I was in Italy
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:23.320]   Someone grabbed my bag off the train
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:28.440]   And I was glad then that I had two factor on as many things as I did
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:33.400]   All I did was log out of my google account and basically everything was
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.960]   inaccessible and luckily I had my phone
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:42.840]   YouTube is asking for non-disparagement clauses from musicians
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:46.520]   Before they'll promote your music
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:50.600]   You have to say we will never say anything bad about google
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:55.640]   That seems like a lot apparently that's not the norm in the music industry
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:31:00.760]   Which I like you could you could trash your record label apparently you're a
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:03.720]   As
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:07.080]   Seems to be a pretty popular thing. That's interesting
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:12.760]   I find it hard to believe they could enforce that but well if you want the promotion
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:16.280]   music and original series creators
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:23.640]   So I know you I know you want to talk about this jeff jarvis certainly would but I know matthew would like to talk about this
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.120]   crowdsourced
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:29.880]   ratings for news sources on facebook facebook which is just
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:32.680]   Ruggled coming with up with some sort of solution
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:38.360]   To the perceived crisis and fake news and I say perceived because I don't necessarily even buy into this
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:44.520]   Now is saying well we've decided what we're going to do is do surveys
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:50.680]   And ask people whether they trust news sources kind of like Yelp for news sources
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:56.760]   Well, so what they say is that they're going to and actually adam misteri who's in charge of
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:02.600]   the news feed has been responding to a bunch of people on twitter including me about
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.760]   this and
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:08.520]   They haven't gotten into a huge amount of detail about how it's going to work. I know
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:16.680]   Um somebody i'm trying to remember it buzzfeed that Alex cantor has the has the cellics got the survey. There's two questions
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:20.120]   Do you recognize the following websites? Yes or no, right?
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:24.360]   And how much do you trust each of them entirely a lot somewhat barely not at all
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.240]   so the most charitable
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:30.360]   interpretation of this survey is that
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:34.520]   They're going to use your your answers to those two things
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:40.520]   Along with the reams of data that they have about you and your behavior
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:47.160]   From all the time you spend on facebook in order to come up with a trust ranking so that it's not like that
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:52.840]   It's just another questions. Yeah, right. It's another signal. They're going to look at what you clicked on how long you spent on it
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:57.560]   They're going to look at how much you know about different things how familiar you are with different things
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:01.800]   but I I think adam did admit that it's this is a
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:06.520]   It's a very nuanced question. Do you trust something?
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:15.080]   They're the problem is that I just finished writing about a big survey that gallop and the night foundation did about trust in media
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:20.680]   And what they found was it split along ideological lines lots of other researchers found this too
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:23.480]   So do you trust the media?
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:29.000]   Gets completely different answers depending on whether someone identifies as a republican or a democrat
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.400]   And so do you trust the new york times is going to get a completely different
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:37.880]   Response so is do you trust fox news so the problem is they're gonna have to
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:40.520]   in order to get at the real problem, which is
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:42.840]   the website that
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:50.200]   You know creates itself last week and comes up with a real sounding name and posts a bunch of garbage in order to get at that problem
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:52.760]   We're gonna have to find a way around
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:55.160]   the ideological kind of rift
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:34:00.120]   That exists when you ask people if they quote unquote trust the media
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:05.400]   Strikes me though that it wouldn't be really easy to pinpoint those completely fraudulent clickbait sites
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:12.200]   Like that's the theoretically that's the easiest thing. Yes. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know the hard ones are the ones in between
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.280]   right
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:18.440]   So they post something this happens all the time craig silver minute buzzfeed is
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:22.200]   Has a PhD and this stuff basically they will post
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:25.400]   True things and then something completely fake
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:31.720]   So it's not all completely fake or they'll post things that have a grain of truth, but they're completely distorted
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:33.640]   um
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:37.000]   So it's hard. It's not just 100 fake all the time
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.720]   It's like most good con men they tell you the truth is the time exactly
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:44.920]   Really?
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:46.920]   Are you telling me the truth right now?
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:49.080]   um, I
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:51.320]   You'll never knew
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:57.320]   But I mean facebook's let's face it. They have a hard it's a problem. Do yeah, and I think they
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:00.200]   They don't really have
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:05.960]   The tools or it's not in their dna to kind of do this stuff their dna is
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:08.840]   Build things really quickly roll them out
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:13.640]   Get people to engage on your platform the end so they're good at that
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:19.960]   But that what we're talking about and what zuckerberg is says he wants to do which is to
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:24.440]   prioritize quality engagement and meaningful
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:30.200]   discussion over just sort of raw engagement. That's a really really hard line of thought
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:34.840]   Even though in my I was going to say there are people that I know
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:41.320]   Who are huge trump supporters who will spend lots of time talking and debating over?
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:48.840]   Mm-hmm truly fake stories and they will be meaningfully engaged and exhibiting that sense of community
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:54.840]   So the last thing I wrote for cgr was about how I actually think their changes could make it worse
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:58.920]   So if they're looking at like you said meaningful discussion
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:05.720]   Engagement people spending lots of time, you know, what's really engaging garbage like totally made up
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:08.120]   That's what the pope says
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.680]   And the pope is right the pope says
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:15.800]   Fake news the devil came up with it. I think he says that there might be a little
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:18.360]   It says fake news goes back to the garden of eden
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:26.600]   Okay, the church has announced that there will be a world day of social communications this may
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:32.760]   And so he was I guess talking about that and actually I think he's not
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:35.560]   Too bad on this he says
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:39.080]   Fake news is effective because like the snake in the garden of eden
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:42.280]   It mimics real news
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:48.520]   And it captures people's attentions by exploiting emotions like anxiety contempt anger
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:54.920]   Yeah, he's totally right about that. He says social networks are the ideal delivery system untrue stories can spread
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:59.480]   So quickly that even authoritative denials fail to contain the damage
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:03.720]   And that turns people the absence of
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:09.560]   Opposite viewpoints turns people into unwilling accomplices in spreading bias and baseless ideas
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:11.640]   Of course the pope very famously
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:14.280]   endorsed donald trump during the election
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:17.480]   in in what is often used as
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:25.560]   The definitive example fake news that was believed and spread and probably had some impact
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.960]   I will say
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:29.960]   If we're talking about fake news
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:32.040]   The big book there's some
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:33.640]   Fact-based
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.640]   sourcing issues there
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:41.880]   I don't know that the pope wants us to look too closely into but he's got a point. He definitely
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:44.760]   I don't know about the snake
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:49.880]   Problem is that fake for all we know. Yeah, the problem is that facebook
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:54.440]   You know whether they say they do or not if what they want is engagement
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:59.480]   You know things that make people mad and yeah, they're optimized for fake news, aren't they?
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:03.640]   Yeah, they're effectively a machine for confirmation bias
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:06.840]   And that feeds into that that whole problem
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:15.320]   Uh, this probably goes right in the same bucket as uh, donald trump's anti-sam-sung tweet ruport murdock put out a statement
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.960]   saying
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:21.320]   That he wants facebook and google to pay him
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:24.520]   And that's how you trusted publishers
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:29.800]   It should pay those publishers a carriage fee similar to the model adopted by cable companies
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:37.080]   And that would solve the fake news problem because cable is what we want to look to as an example for how things really work
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:39.160]   Well, the cable industry. Wow
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:45.400]   You figure he wrote this in the middle of the night and he just gave it to somebody and said here put this up
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:51.160]   So, I mean facebook does pay content companies who pays them a revenue share. Oh, well
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:54.840]   There you go. Yeah, let's make money on the show. Yeah, so it's not a carriage fee
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:56.440]   But
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:00.200]   You could argue maybe they should pay more. I think jona paredi said that he thought
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:05.480]   Facebook could pay more they probably could they certainly have both loads of cash money, but
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:10.600]   Structuring the internet like a cable like the cable industry is not I think the solution
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:14.120]   We'll actually be talking with this about this
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:20.840]   Uh with an old friend, uh, andrew kean who's going to be on triangulation in a couple of weeks
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:26.360]   He says rea rea mark zuckerberg is rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.840]   Oh andrew
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:31.480]   Andrew is uh speaking of link bait. He's a master
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:34.040]   He sure is of the well-turned
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:36.280]   infuriating phrase
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:41.800]   And I look forward to getting him on he's a lot of fun. Yeah. Yeah, he's he's a hoot
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:46.760]   Uh, let's see facebook has invented a new unit of time
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:56.200]   Okay, this was reported like super snarky, but I mean this is actually no, this is actually technical common
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:02.280]   In not maybe not common in engineering, but like you you definitely create a measurement that works for the problem
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:06.280]   You're trying to start which is all they did. Yeah, but from a headline point of view
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:11.160]   This is what you would have to call it. It's called the flick or frame tick. It is one
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.960]   I uh can't even read this number 705
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:20.840]   70 billion 560 million. I don't know it's one tiny bit of a second
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:24.440]   And uh, you know who I bet came up with this
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.280]   Colleen
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:30.920]   She works in streaming video at facebook or old engineer. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:36.200]   As this has her uh, I hope she trademarked it the flick
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:42.600]   Yeah, and everybody it snarked about it. I'm not snarking about it. It's uh, it's for video. It's you need it
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:46.360]   Um
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:50.520]   Down to 20 cities for amazon all the ones you expect and toronto
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:52.600]   Yay
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:56.520]   Yay, and austin and austin really austin in there too
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:59.320]   Damn with the only non east coast
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:01.560]   Good old austin
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:05.800]   Well, the reason they're all in these coast because they already are on the amazon's already all west coast right? So
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:07.480]   Yes, I I
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:09.960]   They need to kind of so they can be really hot or really cool. Yeah
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:15.080]   Yeah, basically maybe they'll have uh, they'll they'll move the hq based on the season
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:17.960]   It'll be
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:23.800]   Q they could have too apple says it's going to invest a significant like 30 billion dollars of the repatriated money
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:27.080]   It's going to get back from it's overseas cash
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:31.000]   Building a second headquarters and the rumor is in reno no vada
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.240]   Really and the reason is actually their second largest
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:40.600]   There's a big. Awesome. We know because it'll be a helps call help center
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:45.800]   Oh, that's what we had it's a good lots of room expensive cheap real estate. Yeah, exactly
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:52.120]   And actually that's why people were in austin del had the best man del had that's true. Yeah, it was that's right
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:56.040]   Yeah, well apple centers here nest supports here in austin
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:59.320]   Um, it's a lot of companies. We're all in ireland now or something
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:03.480]   No, a lot of a lot of high value call centers are in austin
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:06.440]   Um, maybe high value is the wrong way to think of it
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:10.840]   But we have a lot of that industry and then what happens is like when apple bought in trinsidy
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:18.440]   That they they come and they find oh hey, there's a great ship design community and lots of educated people who don't want to move to california
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:20.840]   So it's not a bad place to be
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:24.280]   Says the lady who's lived here for 20 years
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:29.480]   Former twitter c o o and anthony natto
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:36.120]   Uh, this is okay. This story comes from before he announced his departure from twitter
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:41.480]   But I thought it was interesting. It was a ces. He says that streaming devices like apple tv firet
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:45.160]   Chromecast or on the chopping block there in five years
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:49.320]   They'll be gone and just go right from your phone to it. I think he's right. Of course. I think he's right of course
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:54.360]   That's right. Yeah. Yeah, I mean my tv has chromecast built in. I don't even use a chromecast right
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:43:00.280]   And of course he's assuming that twitter will be the source of a lot of that stream. Mm-hmm, but he won't be there anymore
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:03.400]   No, because right after that he left
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:08.840]   He's gonna become the CEO of a startup financial startup called sofi
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:13.080]   Which we may recognize from scandals such as
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:16.840]   Are they that don't have sex in the stairwells one?
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:22.520]   Actually, let's google sofi and stairwells. I don't know, you know, uh, let's
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:27.000]   I that sounds vaguely familiar. No, you think of xenofits
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.520]   Oh xenofits. Oh, don't confuse sofi
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:33.720]   with xenofits
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:35.560]   Sofi is a
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:41.880]   Financial business refi kind of thing. Yes, but they had a scandal their scandal was was a bad loans
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:47.080]   Oh, okay. Uh, hold on. No, there was there was something. I think you're right
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:50.600]   Yeah
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:54.120]   From goldman's twitter though. He came from Goldman Sachs to twitter
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:59.560]   in 2014 and was instrumental in push the push for live video
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:05.480]   He did the deal with nfl for the football games and of course twitter's it's gonna be interesting to see what
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:07.560]   whether they like how
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:10.520]   Things changed strategically because he did push that
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:15.960]   A lot and in a lot of ways he was the sort of he was the only full-time senior
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:20.440]   Employee. I mean jack is a co is a sort of part-time CEO
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:23.160]   CEO at square as well
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:29.400]   Um, so everybody always looked to Anthony as kind of the guy who actually ran things. Oh interesting
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:34.120]   So it'll be that's a big that's gonna leave a big hole. That's for sure and twitter
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:40.840]   Has a lot of holes like it doesn't need a big hole. Huge turnover in the executive suite huge
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:44.040]   Yeah, this is just one more to add to that list
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:48.200]   So it'll be interesting to see what happens
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:54.200]   Stocks not really do it very well either 4% down on tuesday when this came out
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:45:01.400]   But the stocks oh yeah, so they had the frat house atmosphere and bad underwriting. So I knew there was something
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:03.480]   uh
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:08.040]   Me too, uh them too. I guess we have new hashtag them too
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:11.720]   Uh
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:16.520]   I love this article in the verge. It's really not you know completely about us but uh
[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:19.240]   Flats of off writing about
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:22.200]   Headphones buying headphones at 2018 is going to be a fragment and mess
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:26.280]   Not the least because of apple's iphone 10 and google's pixel to
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:29.560]   Well, that's garbage
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.920]   No headphone jack. So that's a problem and then you've got all the usbc
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:37.800]   lightning
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:41.400]   I don't even I am so frustrated. It's a mess
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:46.840]   There's also now competing codex you've got apt X yes l deck
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:50.360]   It's just uh that's so we're going backwards now
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:53.240]   It's a tower babble
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:55.800]   Like headphones used to be the one thing where yes
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:59.160]   It works the analog any kind of
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:02.200]   Mini jack because you have the worst thing you have to do is buy an adapter from a
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:08.760]   Full size to a mini jack here. Here's where we need like some regulation. We just need some standards for these things darn it
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:12.440]   Well, I don't actually want to regulate this but i'm like come on people
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:15.960]   And the market doesn't help because frankly people buy into a single system
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:20.200]   So if you're an iphone user they do you know what your solution is it's very specific
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:24.280]   But it doesn't work on necessarily and everybody seems to be fine
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:28.280]   Apple buyers seem to be fine with every year or two buying
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:33.160]   500 worth of new dongles so they can connect all their stuff
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:36.040]   I don't understand that at all
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:44.440]   But now that i'm living it I kind of I honestly think if I could find a decent phone like with a headphone jack my next phone me
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:47.000]   Like it's not
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.640]   The next year rebel
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:51.160]   rebel
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:53.720]   rebel is that a main right back oh
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:57.800]   Resis
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:01.240]   Do not have a cell phone. Wow that would be a big resistance
[01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:03.720]   Flip phone
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:05.800]   They don't have headphone jacks either. I might point out
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:07.160]   Yeah
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:12.360]   Stripe I don't know it took them so long as ending support for bitcoin payments on the stripe platform
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:20.360]   Just like everybody else for the same reasons that it takes a long time for an extra transaction to clear and it costs
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:22.920]   20 bucks
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:24.920]   Yeah, I mean bitcoin
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:27.640]   It's it's no longer what it
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:30.520]   Set out to be it's no longer
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:39.400]   Convenient or useful or a good store of value or good for transactions and the volatility makes it really bad for buying stuff because you
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:42.040]   You don't pay a dollar if you don't know what you're gonna pay
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:48.440]   You don't know what so I will say though that I recently did get a press release from the aura family dentistry
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:53.720]   Which is the 11th dental practice accepting denta coin denta coin okay?
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:56.200]   They have their own
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:00.120]   Call me when they're gonna. We're complaining about fragmentation in
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:05.400]   Head sets. Can you imagine fragmentation if every single industry gets its own currency
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:08.520]   What about don't you explain do they accept those coins?
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:14.600]   Oh coin gone back up father robert has what a million of those coins got some in the ungodly amount because it was a joke
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:16.440]   It was a joke
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:21.320]   Yeah, actually though. I think the but I think this stripe thing is I mean it's clear the bubble is gonna burst
[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:28.280]   There's this for sure too volatile too unpredictable too expensive. It's not a good payment solution. I really
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:33.160]   Go ahead you first
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:38.200]   I thought it was nice how he described it as an asset not a currency, which was a very polite way
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:42.280]   Yeah, this isn't liquid. It's good for speculating. Yeah
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.960]   And I read a great I say I can't remember who wrote it now about how
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:50.840]   Basically bitcoin has become everything that satoshi nakamoto
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:55.880]   Invented bitcoin to to sort of yeah, not be yeah
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:00.760]   So it's become the opposite of what it was supposed to be in almost everywhere. It's not good
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:06.760]   What about icos we've not talked about it on the show because it's complicated
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:14.040]   Initial estimate actually but it is kind of initial coin operate offerings and the the big hook this week is telegram
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:19.560]   Which is doing yeah a massive ico of as much. It's just getting bigger
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:26.200]   They're thinking now two billion dollars. So the idea is that you buy
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:29.960]   What are they called?
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:37.240]   Telecoin you buy their cryptocurrency as an investment in telegram
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:42.120]   And then do icos are they like stock do you get part ownership?
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:46.440]   That's the big question. That's the big question and it's why the SEC kind of
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:48.840]   needs to
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:53.560]   Make regulations in this area or somebody does because the whole point of doing icos
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:56.360]   Was that they weren't treated like equity?
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:59.960]   So because they theoretically had utility
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:02.280]   and there's all kinds of
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:04.760]   arcane regulations around this, but if something has
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:08.680]   Utility if you can enjoy it or use it
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:15.240]   In and of itself if it's not just a certificate that represents a share of a of a company
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:22.360]   Then you it's not not considered equity. So, uh, I think the class if you can pay your dentist with it
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:27.640]   Or if you can use it for some other reason so so the classic case was baseball
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:32.040]   Cards so baseball cards even though you can buy and sell them
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:37.240]   They're not shares of a company and they're not currency because you enjoy them
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:42.520]   Having them and you enjoy them for that share certificates. Nobody
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:46.200]   Very few people enjoy them for the certificate
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:51.160]   They and they like it and invest in it because it gives them a share of the profits of a company
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:53.480]   So the idea was tokens
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:57.320]   Were because they had utility they were not shares not equity
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:02.600]   But you could still raise a ton of dough with them. So the last thing I saw from the SEC was
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:07.560]   a release the basic season whoa, just whoa, like everybody
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:12.920]   Settle down. We're going to do something in this area, but there's as far as I know there's been no
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:16.520]   Concrete moves to either regulate them or
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:19.960]   Shut them down and there's a debate about what?
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:23.240]   Utility represents so some tokens give you
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:25.960]   effectively time
[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:27.960]   or processing
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:32.200]   Time on on a bitcoin mining
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:37.720]   One of the one of the reasons people are interested in the telegram icos because these coins called grams
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:40.360]   Which won't be issued for another year
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:48.200]   Are intended to be used as a basis for transactions on telegram right for payments and kick kick was going to do the same thing
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:51.960]   I don't know if they actually did one but they were going to use it for transactions on their own
[01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:54.600]   Huge messaging platform. It's in fact
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:58.520]   Uh, it was shut down in iran because it was dominant in iran
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:03.320]   It was why it was being used to help organize so then if you can use it for payments, it's not equity
[01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:07.720]   So then it's not covered by the SEC so you'd be buying into a payment system
[01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:15.080]   It's a payment system. Yeah, it's a currency therefore you have to go to the place that regulates currencies
[01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:20.040]   It's currency investment, but it but Stacy's point is a good one. What if everybody has their own currency?
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:23.240]   Uh, who the heck determines
[01:52:23.240 --> 01:52:31.240]   The exchange rate like there's no central bank to tell you this coin is worth x or it's exchangeable for y or
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:37.080]   What gets really interesting is i've talked to like i've talked to some people doing like energy
[01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:38.760]   tokens
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:44.920]   Based on basically smart metering. So there's like a group in australia that's doing a very interesting thing with this
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:46.520]   They did an ico
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:48.200]   um, and they
[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:52.520]   You know, you you bought into their token system and that allows you to buy and sell electricity
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:59.240]   Solar electricity generated by your neighbors at a lower cost because it was a it was a edge of the grid
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:02.520]   And so you didn't pay the transmission costs from the
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:06.360]   from the real electricity provider, I guess
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:13.320]   Um, so what I thought was interesting though is what happens when you buy into that system and you're buying selling your electricity
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:19.080]   Using these tokens, which does have a value and it doesn't feel radically speculative
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:27.880]   What happens when you want to leave that system like you move? It's illiquid. Yeah, right? And so and that's always been the challenge is
[01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:32.440]   It has to be
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:39.160]   Yeah, I mean you have to do remember the early early days of internet payments and there was beans and flus
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:45.400]   One of them one of them would be Goldberg was involved in the entire bucks
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:48.200]   Yeah, actually they're still around but
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:53.880]   They got a special dispensation believe it or not from the government to issue their own currency
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:54:02.920]   But anyway, so I remember those days everybody well i've got 50 beans or i've got a hundred flus or whatever and and it quickly became nonsensical
[01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:08.360]   But I mean work about it apple pay isn't really any different nominally apple pay is dollars
[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:13.480]   Right, but the way apple pay you know the payment system and messages works is
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:19.240]   You don't cash out of it. You just you could cash out of it, but you just kind of keep it there
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:21.080]   It's in a way. It's its own currency
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:25.000]   You know it's well in the thing is it's guaranteed to be translated into dollars at some point
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.720]   So that's the thing you need someone to basically guarantee
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:30.360]   That there will be value
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:34.920]   For you if you want to cash out and use the money to go buy a house or something
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:42.280]   If you're just speculating you probably don't care, but if you actually want to use it as a store of value or or transactions
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:44.680]   You need someone some authority
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:48.680]   That will tell you that the value is going to be there when you need it
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:52.760]   Y'all are about to stand at the old standard. Yeah, you're
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:56.840]   This is fiat money all of this like it's all fiat
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:59.080]   But the thing is that
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:04.280]   Ones of fiat banked by the full faith and currency of and Satoshi Nakamoto
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:09.320]   And one is or a bunch of miners in china and the other is backed by the
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:13.640]   Faith and credit of the united states government, which is it right, you know, that's a little more substitute
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:17.160]   Eoretically theoretically theoretically the u.s. Could default
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:22.040]   The u.s. So these currencies these currencies remind me a lot more of currencies in
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:27.960]   Small countries where the government changes rapidly and the army takes over periodically
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:31.560]   Right and the value of them literally changes day by day month by month
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:36.120]   There's always an underground currency that people actually use instead of the real currency
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:42.280]   And people are carrying around wheelbarrows full of many of these governments solve this by tying their money to the u.s
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:43.320]   dollar
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:46.200]   Yeah, the fascinating thing for me is that is that
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:49.080]   cryptocurrencies effectively
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:51.480]   Just reveal the sort of central
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:56.440]   Fiction about money, which is that it has any value at all. I mean we don't have
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:01.400]   Like pieces of paper that we exchange with people that have colored pictures on them
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:06.360]   Don't have any inherent value. Right. They have value because a bank somewhere
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:09.960]   Said that it will accept them at such and such a value
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:11.960]   Well, some some people are still backed
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:15.560]   I think aren't some countries still on some sort of gold standard
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:17.880]   They're not
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:23.240]   Imaginary because the value of gold is not based on its true industrial value. It's based
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:30.920]   On its trading value. It's trading value and if you want to look at something that's a crazy market gold is what's the original crazy market
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:34.200]   That stuff changes value for no reason whatsoever
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:38.280]   Like the actual underlying value of it is infinitesimal
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:41.320]   The thing that interests me is I was on a panel about
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:45.160]   Cryptocurrency a little while ago and that guy from the bank of Canada was there
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:47.800]   And the bank of Canada is the central bank
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:50.280]   It it regulates the entire banking industry
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:56.200]   And he said that they were thinking of creating their own cryptocurrency. So is the bank of England
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:59.000]   Yeah, and the bank of Israel
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.600]   So now you've got a central bank effectively, but now they're competing with every other cryptocurrency
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:08.360]   But that's a currency really what I think they're also then competing with their own currency
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:14.680]   Well, I think what they're saying and I think this is actually really interesting. It's not about it's about blockchain
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:19.240]   They want a transparent fast decentralized way
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:23.640]   Of recording transactions better than their current system
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:26.280]   Which you could argue is the real value
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:29.240]   Right. So cryptocurrency is fascinating. We'll totally argue that
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:36.840]   Bitcoin is there's a lot of hype and it's fun to watch but the real value is blockchain and that sort of distributed ledger
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:42.840]   Approach to all kinds of information not just I mean currency is just a tiny tiny
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:48.520]   Fraction of what blockchain could be applied to that's what I find interesting. So stacy. What is blockchain?
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:50.920]   Um
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:52.760]   I'm glad he asked you
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:54.760]   Excellent. All right
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:59.160]   It is it's just a distributed letter. It's a technology that allows you to
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:06.520]   Write information to and read information from many distributed notes. I I'm not going to get into like super technical
[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:09.080]   Let me try it this way a
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:10.280]   transaction
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:15.160]   Of value transit currency and money is all about value. So it's like a battery for value
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:18.920]   You know a battery takes electricity generated stores it till you need it
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:24.920]   In you know in the earliest days before money you would do chop some wood for somebody and she'd give you a pie
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:29.560]   And there was a direct thing, but now we got a problem if I want to chop some wood, but I don't want pie
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:32.760]   I want to get some shoes from over there. We have some way of storing value
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:36.600]   Could be puka shells. It has been or cowrie shells. It has been
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:41.480]   Could be strings knots in a string it could be rocks rocks
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:45.080]   It could be anything but you want somewhere to store that value in that everybody agrees
[01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:47.400]   That's worth an hour's worth of chopping wood
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:51.240]   And then so you can exchange it around the problem with this is
[01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:55.400]   That's easy to do when there's an actual physical thing that you exchange around
[01:58:55.400 --> 01:59:00.520]   But in our modern world it is impractical to exchange physical things
[01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:05.400]   So it's all become bits. So now what you need is some way to record
[01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:08.680]   That leo earned this many bits
[01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:16.440]   That he's given this many bits to stacy that stacy's given this many bits to matthew and you want some way to do that efficiently
[01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:22.120]   securely in a trustworthy way otherwise you got a real problem
[01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:26.840]   And that's the idea of blockchain is it's not and no bank normally now
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:34.520]   Mastercard does it or visa does it or the bank of canada does it and they keep the ledger and you trust they're going to do it right
[01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:37.800]   But it's centralized what they would like is some way of
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:45.720]   Recording this in a trusted fashion that everybody agreed on but no one it's completely decentralized. No one
[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:51.240]   That for me was the key the key thing that satoshi nakamoto wanted to do it
[01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:55.400]   Wasn't just the mining and the crypto and so on it was the distributed
[01:59:55.400 --> 02:00:02.600]   And non centralized nature of it so that in effect everyone who does the a transaction is a bank
[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:09.960]   And is a transaction processor and has a copy of the ledger and can read it right the ledger
[02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:18.280]   This is old here's the but let me give you a story that I wrote about this all the way back in 2015 about why blockchain matters
[02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:29.480]   And basically it's because we need something that is yes like matthew said that is not necessarily secure because there's actually
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:39.320]   Issues about that but something you can authenticate and that is scalable and that's the key you need it to be scalable and for scalability it needs to be decentralized
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:47.560]   And that's that's why it matters and we're talking I talked to companies who are doing blockchain based security for iot
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:51.160]   I talked to micro payment people they're very fascinating
[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:52.760]   and
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:57.000]   So once you take it outside of cryptocurrencies, which are interesting but
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.800]   are really a side show for
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:03.720]   figuring out how to use blockchain for
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:07.240]   Things that will actually be world-changing. So
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:14.600]   I don't know what to say about that and there's there's different variations like that like ideas
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:20.120]   Sorry, I think you could argue the side show the financial side show is actually
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:22.760]   one of the ways that people are
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:27.880]   Trying to generate money to do the other things that are interesting. Oh, yeah, everybody's
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:33.400]   I wrote about a distributed computing platform that basically you can link all your
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:37.480]   Computer like any computing element in your connected home for example
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:42.360]   You could link to solve edge problems problems at the edge. So machine learning type problems at the edge
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:44.680]   So think of it like setty on your desk
[02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:46.600]   so
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:48.040]   they're
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:54.360]   They're using a blockchain technology, but they're also thinking about doing an iCo because it's an easy way for them to raise money now
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:58.360]   And then they'll use their currency as a way to trade value among that system
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:01.320]   I feel like
[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:04.680]   The currency is kind of a side you don't need a token
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:09.480]   But they're using it as a way to make money and I think that's going to cause a lot of problems kind of like back in the
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:12.040]   2000s when we had all those crazy.coms
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:17.160]   Yeah, there was actually a lot of value created then with well, and that's what I was saying
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:21.000]   The value it reminds me of the early internet
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:25.000]   There were so many dumb things and everybody just took whatever they
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:32.200]   Did and added the word internet to it or had a website in the same way long island iced tea changed its name to
[02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:36.840]   Long Island blockchain so that everyone's just adding that to kind of
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:42.760]   Get on the bandwagon, but underneath there is something real just like there was in the early days of the internet
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:46.600]   It's just gonna take some time to get rid of the froth
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:53.320]   You know and to see what the actual real applications are there's a journalism startup called civil
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:56.360]   Um, they're gonna do an iCo they want to use
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:59.560]   blockchain and the sort of distributed ledger as a
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:05.480]   as a tool for distributing and paying for independent journalism. That's an interesting idea
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:12.360]   So and and there's different types of blockchain implementations. So that's something worth noting
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:18.600]   There's like bitcoin ethereum everything's done in public a lot of private companies said I don't want my data
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:22.920]   In public I want it private IBM created hyper ledger. There's
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:28.760]   New variations where there's the so-called blockless blockchains that you know aren't as
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:36.760]   Slow and heavy there's a problem with the way bitcoin and ethereum do it because you get these massive ledgers at everybody else's store
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:42.040]   So that's not a problem though if you think about it is trying to create a currency
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:49.240]   With some sort of stored value the stored value though wasn't an hour at chopping wood. It was an hour of gpu time for example
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:50.600]   right
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:56.680]   So although there is an issue on resource use with bitcoin someone said to to generate a single
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:03:59.960]   bitcoin takes you know as much power as
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:06.440]   So that's if you think about it as an economic unit though, so people you know chopping wood
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:13.960]   You know take energy they require calories in what we've done is we've transferred all of our our work as it were
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:16.440]   to a digital
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:22.280]   Now the work is not us. We are not the productive entities and that's a that's a huge
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:25.240]   Sea change if we think that's actually gonna happen
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:28.520]   Well, yeah, but I mean
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:33.240]   It's it really doesn't matter where the work comes from what the work is as long as we all agree
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:36.760]   On the value and the units and so forth
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:40.520]   Yes, but where I think is that really valuable?
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:47.560]   And I don't think we're there yet because if all we did all day was trade bitcoins that were blockchain or ethereum's or whatever
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:50.360]   Well, but the market the market determines
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:55.720]   What real world value you know is that 10 is that are those 10 000 bitcoins worth two pizzas
[02:04:56.280 --> 02:05:00.280]   Or are they worth two houses the the market?
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:03.320]   This is the problem is why it's really volatile right now
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:05.960]   But at some point you'd think the market would settle on a value
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:10.920]   Well, there's dozens of different markets. That's the problem. Yeah, it's not just bitcoin
[02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:18.200]   There's like 20 different, you know cryptocurrencies that are all going up and down in value because people are arbitraging them
[02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:21.560]   Um, and whenever there's money involved
[02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:28.680]   There will be people who want to steal the money and there will be people who want to arbitrage the value between one and the other
[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:35.240]   And so think of bitcoin think of this as all a out of town tryouts
[02:05:35.240 --> 02:05:38.200]   For some system
[02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:42.760]   That is ultimately going to replace our current financial system. We're learning right now
[02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:47.960]   What works what doesn't work? Well, you don't want a 200 gigabyte ledger. That's not going to work
[02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:53.880]   it may not just replace a financial system though it might also replace credentialing or
[02:05:53.880 --> 02:06:00.040]   Identity it, you know, there's all sorts of interesting applications beyond financial system
[02:06:00.040 --> 02:06:07.720]   So don't just mean there's of course medical and government authentication, right? Is that the fundamental problem authentication and validation?
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:13.720]   Of transactions one of the problems for sure. It's one of the problems. We can't you can't think of it. This is like as a binary
[02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:15.880]   so
[02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:18.760]   Uh, and I mean they are not as secure as they should be
[02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:23.160]   Okay, well, so that's that's that's something of all the value
[02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:29.560]   All the ico value think someone said 10 of all the ico value that's been created today was stolen
[02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:36.920]   I think it was 20 percent was a 20 percent. It was a big number. Anyway, I feel like even even something so no
[02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:38.920]   Instead of 20 percent
[02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:40.440]   Is it huge instead of yeah?
[02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:46.120]   Instead of thinking about value think about just tracking something so understanding where something's been
[02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:53.400]   And that's how like oh god who's who's using the blockchain to track turkeys tyson perdue? I think it's perdue
[02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:56.760]   Um, but those are the kind of things that become
[02:06:56.760 --> 02:07:04.760]   They're not doing it nay. Yes. It's a little bit of like he but they're actually tracking it for foodborne illness purposes
[02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:08.760]   So you like so so they're really interesting things
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:16.120]   That will come of this and I don't know how much of it actually will be money because we have a decent monetary system
[02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:18.600]   I think we're gonna have to eliminate some fees
[02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:24.440]   Um, and it's gonna have to become a little bit faster and block chain would allow some of that
[02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:28.120]   And I think there are you know, we should admit there are some kind of
[02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:36.280]   Creepy aspects to a central or not centralized but a ledger a single ledger that keeps track of all your transactions
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:38.120]   however small
[02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:41.320]   Um that you engage in as you move around the internet
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:43.880]   Uh lots of things could be done
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:50.040]   By tracking not just you but your car your dishwasher your car all your smart devices
[02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:55.560]   Everything you touch. Um, you know, there's lots of ways that information could go wrong as well
[02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:58.600]   17, well, you would know my turkey ended up at my house
[02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:04.760]   And then that would make me happy that would make me the idea is that the cdc would say oh
[02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:08.040]   Stacy just reported that she's you know cut seven
[02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:12.600]   Seven 23 of all the bitcoin is missing
[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:15.400]   Yeah
[02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:20.200]   So I mean satoshi nakamoto has like a million he's got good clifton's a bitcoin
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:22.840]   Yeah, wherever he is whoever or whatever or
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:27.640]   I mean at this point you have to think he might not be alive. He hasn't moved any of them
[02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:30.920]   it seems unlikely that he's still alive, but
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:33.960]   but i'm much more interested in this sort of
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:38.920]   Other like ethereum interests me a lot more than bitcoin because there's a lot more you can do with it
[02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:43.000]   Um, icos for example. I think we're something that ethereum came up with
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.560]   um the whole idea of having tokens that
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:51.160]   Have value on the network that think in that can then be exchanged is it kind of?
[02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:53.960]   It's a second order
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:57.240]   valued whereas bitcoins. It's just hey you have a bitcoin at the end
[02:08:57.240 --> 02:08:58.600]   um
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:02.200]   You know to see kind of how value can be generated within
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:05.240]   that network, um
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:08.520]   brings like opens up a lot more possibilities
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:13.080]   For other things. I have avoided bringing this up. I'm glad I brought it up with you two
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:15.960]   I think that was this has been very educational
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:21.080]   Thank you. It's a fascinating area security reporter. There you go. That's true asked. Did I?
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:26.120]   So I brought it up with the right two people jeff would have been snoring by now. So it's okay
[02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:31.400]   Uh, we'd still be talking about albums. We would be we would be let's take a break
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:33.640]   And we can get some pics from you folks
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:35.880]   Right after this
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:40.200]   A word from our sponsor word press you talk about success word press
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:42.120]   runs 29
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:43.560]   percent

[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:17.320]   They had to keep it secure that turned out to be a lot of work

[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:31.560]   I came across something I thought was funny
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:35.960]   This isn't really a tip or anything useful or anything like that, but I
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:38.760]   Who said you said no one said useful
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:42.280]   This is totally not useful. It's useless
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:45.160]   But I saw something
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:49.960]   It's behind a paywall, but the wall street journal had a story about how the internet was filling up
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:55.640]   Because a lot of uh, indians are sending millions of texts that just say good morning
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:13:02.760]   So I did a bit of reading about that and uh, it's just a funny story. There's so many people
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:09.640]   uh and most of what they're doing they just got phones or and so the first thing they want to do is send
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:13.960]   A cheery greeting to everyone they know and you know you multiply that by
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:19.720]   Hundreds of millions people that's a lot of messages. So and there is network slowing down
[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:22.760]   I just think it's funny that people are saying good morning. I
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:26.280]   It's it's the cutest thing ever in the wall street journal article
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:33.160]   They have some images good morning to my life's rose your fragrance makes all of life's thorns worth tolerating
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:38.920]   They talk about this fella dish rush charmer 71 years old. He likes to send good morning
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:42.840]   messages on his phone. He wakes up and sends them to 51
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:46.280]   Friends and family on what's app?
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:49.160]   But there is a google tie-in because google's
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:51.720]   files go application
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:54.040]   Has been modified
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:58.840]   You know, it's it's the application you put on your android phone that goes through your phone and clears up old files unused apps
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:01.000]   Things like that modified to delete
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.680]   Good morning messages
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:10.120]   I just thought you know if if you're going to have a reason why your network is slow or your
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:15.400]   Bandwidth slowing down and you're running out of data. I think sending people good morning too many
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:17.960]   Messages is a great reason not a bad thing
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:22.920]   Uh, they they interviewed the journal interview josh woodward the google project manager and mountain view
[02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:28.440]   Who led the effort? We were trying to deconstruct what is the dna of a good morning message for months?
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:35.160]   He said it's been a lot of hard work to get it right early versions were picking out photos of children wearing t-shirts with words on them
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:40.280]   They unveiled the app last month in new deli the morning message deletion function
[02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:44.680]   Prompted the crowd of media and government officials to break out in applause
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:50.440]   Yeah, it's cleared up on average more than a gigabyte of data per user
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:58.280]   I think this is an awesome reminder. The world is an awesome place. It's like a unique place and
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:04.920]   Localization still matters. I thought it was great prime minister. Mody sends out good morning messages
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:12.680]   Uh, here's a guy who's a morning message maniac who sends he spends 45 minutes every morning
[02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:15.320]   Sending the images are important. They're like
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:23.800]   Inspirational, you know, so there I think google said there'd been a tenfold increase in the number of google searches for good morning images
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:27.560]   Well, and this guy con wajat Singh
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:30.440]   Created just for this audience
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:33.400]   wish good morning.com
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:38.120]   Where you can get your good. So if you want to join the the good morning craze
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:44.520]   Here's one for your mom. I love you mom. Good morning
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:50.040]   Good morning dear mom dear mom our house is a home only because of you. I love you good morning
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:55.640]   Isn't that great? I'm a daughter would be so into these. I think she would send these sweetest thing ever
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:16:01.080]   Like if your phone crashes, it's not fun or you're or you use up all your internet data
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:06.040]   But I think it's it's a pretty good reason you could take care of this by just deleting the message after you get it
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:08.120]   So that's why there's a nap
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:11.720]   I am going to start sending don't be surprised
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:15.160]   If you all start getting good morning messages from
[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:18.280]   Uh
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:20.280]   Stacy you got a pick for us
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:22.280]   I have a tip
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:27.480]   Your audience probably knows about it, but I figured they may not and it's worth sharing
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:29.800]   Um, okay, so
[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:34.920]   What was it? Oh, yeah Netflix voice match. I'm like, what was it? I don't even remember for a google home
[02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:39.160]   So basically, you know how you can match your voice to google and you'll
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:42.360]   That works for some people
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:44.760]   It doesn't work for my daughter and I but that's okay
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:48.680]   Amazon's voice match doesn't work between my husband and I so I you know
[02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:51.560]   You do sound a lot alike
[02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:55.400]   They don't think we do because she is a child and her voice is that of a child
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:02.200]   But that's okay, and I don't particularly have a childish voice. I don't think no
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:07.480]   Richard yes, it's it's puzzling to me, but
[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:10.280]   I'm okay with it. I'm like this
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:12.760]   She said hello echo
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:16.920]   She she doesn't but she sounds like a kid. I don't know
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:19.400]   It's very different
[02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:21.800]   So you can tell when you tell
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:27.800]   Hey g fire up next Netflix, which is my shortcut for firing up Netflix
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:34.200]   Uh, no, I'm just not triggering. Okay, you're not saying I'm trying to be respectful. Uh,
[02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:37.320]   So hey g fire up Netflix
[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:42.040]   It now knows that I have asked for it and it will go to my profile
[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:45.320]   So it will not show me, you know, all the crazy stuff that
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:50.120]   Actually, it won't show me narcos and all of the other stuff that my husband watches
[02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:56.360]   Um that I'm kind of deep into violence scary. He's got a thing for those Mexican drug lords. So does my wife
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:59.240]   They should meet each other
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:02.600]   She there you she reads every but she is so into this
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:08.200]   We have we have like all the Pablo Escobar. We have all the newer ones. We have them all
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:10.440]   yep
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:12.280]   Yeah, so
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:14.280]   That I thought was kind of a nice
[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:15.720]   Tip
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:19.000]   So to find it and to set do it you go into your Google home apps
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:23.160]   You have to go under the more settings or end of the settings thing you have to go under more
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:26.840]   And then you should be able to link your Netflix account
[02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:33.960]   So you also have to link your Netflix account and then poof there it is carsten just carsten just sent me a good morning message
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:37.560]   Nice. Good morning carsten. That's so sweet
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:43.880]   This is so suck up. You are a good boss, but most importantly you are a greatest human being
[02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:47.000]   nice
[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:51.560]   Not the greatest just all greatest one of the greatest
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:56.120]   Well tying into yours. You know that today we've been waiting for it
[02:18:56.120 --> 02:19:03.320]   Uh google play books added audiobooks. Mm-hmm. That's right and it happened. I'm looking at it
[02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:07.160]   I'm looking at mine now enjoy ebooks. That's pretty handy actually comics and more
[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:10.440]   So you know, it's not our favorite
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:13.080]   bookstore audible our sponsor
[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:17.240]   Uh, but they have a lot of books. I presume they have probably all the books
[02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:22.040]   The only thing that would lack is the audible originals audible records a lot of stuff
[02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:25.800]   And you can ask and this was always something I I preferred echo because of
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:31.560]   Uh, I could say echo read my book, but now I can do it with google play if I buy the book
[02:19:31.560 --> 02:19:34.280]   on google playbooks
[02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:38.840]   Now I have this problem
[02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:43.400]   Fragmented audiobooks fragmented audiobooks. I don't know where my library lives
[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:46.440]   I
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:49.880]   Can't we'll do a google's it's not a skill recipe
[02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:55.160]   Something Leo. I was gonna mention remember us about Canada and uh
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:58.280]   neutrality. Yeah, yeah, so
[02:19:58.280 --> 02:19:59.960]   um
[02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:01.960]   Basically the bottom line is in
[02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:05.160]   A big part of the debate in the us is whether
[02:20:05.160 --> 02:20:09.160]   internet providers should be considered common carriers. So in Canada that
[02:20:09.160 --> 02:20:12.120]   Is not a debate they've been considered
[02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:14.200]   basically
[02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:15.400]   utilities
[02:20:15.400 --> 02:20:20.280]   Under the telecom important that's from the beginning. So yeah, so there's been no debate about that
[02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:24.200]   And also the CRTC is a lot less politicized than the FCC
[02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:26.840]   So there isn't as much kind of back and forth about
[02:20:26.840 --> 02:20:34.920]   You know does the FCC chairman want it to be this way or that way and who's lobbying who and um, it's just a lot more boring basically
[02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:37.160]   Yeah
[02:20:37.160 --> 02:20:43.400]   Yeah, we like a good fight here in the next but it also means that we've had things like data caps
[02:20:43.800 --> 02:20:44.680]   uh
[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:49.560]   Forever right as far as I can remember and I know both rogers and uh
[02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:51.320]   tell us
[02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:57.560]   Uh mess with skype because I experienced oh sure direct. Yeah, and they they do what they call band with shaping
[02:20:57.560 --> 02:21:01.560]   Which is one of my favorite terms. Yeah, um, which is basically throttling
[02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:07.000]   Um, and they've had repeated arguments with the CRTC about whether they should be able to do that or not
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.920]   Um, so it's it's not that we don't have issues. It's that
[02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:18.440]   Regulatory wise it's um, there isn't as much debate about how to handle it or what applies right
[02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:22.120]   Well, and the big the big band with shaping, uh
[02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:29.800]   Hardware that Comcast and others use comes from Canada. I can't remember the name of it sandvine sandvine. Thank you
[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:34.920]   Yeah, we used to have another one that was based in michigan, but I can't remember that one, but yeah sandvine
[02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:36.280]   divine
[02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:38.760]   Didn't think it bought let's see they did I think
[02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:42.520]   Traffic management solutions traffic
[02:21:42.520 --> 02:21:47.560]   control to sustain growth manage costs and preserved quality
[02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:51.560]   And get rid of those torrenting teenagers on your
[02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:54.840]   Losers off your network
[02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:58.440]   Huh they got bought by a canadian
[02:21:58.440 --> 02:22:04.200]   Networking company p&i canada aqui or something. It's a looks like a shelving
[02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:07.320]   uh fransisco partners
[02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:08.600]   ah
[02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:14.600]   I see it now so you can watch your the reporter at work. She's stitching it together
[02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:20.600]   Well, I'm just like so it's a it's a acquisition holding company. That's an affiliate of uh, francisco partners
[02:22:20.600 --> 02:22:22.680]   So it's a p.e deal
[02:22:22.680 --> 02:22:25.800]   I have to say having now seen the post have you seen it yet?
[02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:28.600]   No, no, don't give it away
[02:22:28.600 --> 02:22:33.320]   Oh, what happened don't tell me what happened. I won't it's a surprise you won't believe
[02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:35.880]   it is
[02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:39.720]   Better than I thought and if you're a journalist obviously you are
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:47.480]   You should you must see it because I don't believe it is steven spielberg's owed to journalism. It's fantastic
[02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:51.960]   And meryl is pretty good. Well, it's the only thing it's a little strange
[02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:58.600]   It's you know, it's all these stars in it. I mean, it's just like even the bit parts are stars. Yeah, yeah, uh
[02:22:58.600 --> 02:23:01.320]   early on
[02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:04.280]   Ben Bradley played by tom hanks. It's meaning was
[02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:11.320]   uh, catheter and gram played by meryl Streep they're having breakfast. It's one of the first scenes and you look at it and you can tell they're thinking
[02:23:11.320 --> 02:23:17.160]   That's meryl Streep. I'm Tom. I'm tom hanks. They'd never acted before apparently together
[02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:21.960]   You can tell well this must have been the first scene they did together because the vibe is totally like
[02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:24.440]   Nice
[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:26.440]   We're Oscar winners
[02:23:26.440 --> 02:23:28.520]   Yeah, and they're acting
[02:23:28.520 --> 02:23:34.760]   They're like they're like almost like trying to out-act each other. They're like he's doing some voice and she's doing something
[02:23:35.160 --> 02:23:37.960]   And it's and it was it was actually sweet
[02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:41.960]   It was cute and it it's at the early in the movie and you you let it go after that
[02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:44.280]   because I do find it kind of
[02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:49.000]   It bothers me a little bit that the New York Times was the one that actually published the
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.640]   No, they say that no, I know the movie
[02:23:51.640 --> 02:23:54.200]   you will actually see the
[02:23:54.200 --> 02:23:57.720]   The whole story can't please say that and then Bradley is furious
[02:23:57.720 --> 02:24:02.280]   He's and it was more interesting with Catherine Graham because she had you know
[02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:06.600]   She was a woman and she had just taken over this paper and they do all of the family's legacy
[02:24:06.600 --> 02:24:10.200]   Yeah, all of that's in there. I think a more interesting story all of that's in there
[02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:17.080]   Even the classic 1940s trope of the presses pushing the button the presses start rolling
[02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:19.320]   You watch the paper going
[02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:23.240]   They throw it on the truck the trucks go zooming out of the garage
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:27.720]   They throw it off the truck and the paper voice pick it up. That's all in there. You see the front page
[02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:32.360]   It's practically spin it at you. I mean, it's amazing. I have a I have a button
[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:37.800]   Of red and green button that I took from the presses at the globe and mail when I worked there
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:42.760]   Oh, we say they got rid of the they got rid of the old presses and they farmed it out to someone else
[02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:47.720]   And they took the presses out and you could keep bits of them if you want to so I have the stop the presses
[02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:51.960]   But there are loving shots the most beautiful shots ever of the lead
[02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:55.160]   The type of setters it's amazing
[02:24:55.480 --> 02:25:01.160]   They it is an old it is it an old to journalism. It is it is steven spielberg's like
[02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:05.800]   I'm telling you both of you if you are not crying in this movie
[02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:11.000]   You are dead inside someday. I want to get my own like hot type
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:16.280]   Yes, you're studying machine and the just print like a newspaper for kids, you know or something
[02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:19.320]   It must look so unachronistic to the younger generation, but
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:24.360]   Those of us who remember are going oh, yeah, like you can practically smell
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:30.680]   Yeah, the news print the newsprint and then and jeff javus was talking about this when the presses start
[02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:36.040]   Yeah, the coffee cup starts the whole building. Yeah, I remember that at the globe. It's awesome
[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:38.280]   So don't go tonight
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:43.320]   And your husband will love it and rule love it go tonight and see it okay
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:48.360]   Because it will it will go right it will be the best picture of the year. There's I mean there are great pictures
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:50.600]   You think yeah, it's a spiel
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:55.960]   You think so they're great. It's got a lot of competition. It's a tough year. It's a tough year
[02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:58.920]   But lady bird was pretty good lady birds great
[02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:02.040]   Three billboards was pretty good. This is not better than them
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:08.440]   But this is a movie whose time has come let's put it that way. Okay. It is to save. I think shape of water might get it
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:11.720]   Maybe have you seen it? No, there's good stuff. I know
[02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:14.600]   It's good. I have a lot of movies to see it's good
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:20.520]   I'm glad I saw the post and I think it'll win because it's a statement about the important states
[02:26:20.520 --> 02:26:23.080]   Any pets a portance of a free press
[02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:28.760]   In this country. It's what it's all about. She's crying already. She's already crying
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:34.760]   The water monster romance is not gonna win
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:37.480]   No, no free press good movie
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:40.200]   God bless the free press in this country
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:45.320]   This is the antidote to fake news. You will feel so go you walk out of the door saying yes
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:50.520]   Stacey has cut cut her mic off so we can't hear her stop it. Yeah
