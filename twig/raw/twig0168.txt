[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Great to see you too.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Happy Wednesday.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   San Diego.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Look, you know, you seem chipper. I guess Edda is sleeping through the night.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   My wife did the late night in the day. So I got a whole night's sleep. I feel great today. I feel like a new woman.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   You never appreciate sleep so much as when you have a newborn baby.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Every other day I get a good night's sleep. Good.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   That's awesome. I know that's feeling. But I'm doing great.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Yay. Also here, Jeff Jarvis. Jeff, like me, probably hasn't had a good night's sleep in years.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   No.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Kids grew up and then you just old.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   It's no longer, you can't play the kids anymore.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   You're going to the bathroom with the night and all that stuff.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Yeah, it's like they trained you to wake up. And then they grow up at sleep till like one in the afternoon.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And you're up at 6 a.m. going, "Where is your name, Amy?"
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   My wife still gets up earlier than I do, but I go to bed a lot later than working.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Last two nights, last two days I was at work from 7 a.m. to 11.30 p.m.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Oh man.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And you've got Sam and a Jeff.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Is that your professoring or is it something else that you're doing?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Just stuff adds up events.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I did a talk last night for a new company called Together, which enables authors to organize their own events, which is very cool.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So I was going to say, "No." It was a wonderful thing they did. So I was there.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And then the debate came on, right?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I rushed to get into my car, which I parked in New York so I could listen to the debate.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I realized listening wasn't good enough. So I pulled off on the term "pike" at a rest stop, which is a depressing thing to do in New Jersey.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And watched it on my Nexus 7 the whole time, sitting there in the parking lot, tweeting, like some kind of crazed fool.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And so I got home late. I'm still wired and I'm to bed late and up at about 5.30.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So yeah, there sounds like 10 you proposed on this show, the idea that authors could sort of organize their own book tours.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Jeff, so it's kind of like one of your ideas come to life.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Yeah, which is very cool. Yeah, when they get depressed, they say, "Well, we look at this blog post you wrote, and we say, "Well, this guy says it's a good idea."
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Yeah, it's a very cool guy who worked on the "Pryer Mars" expedition and wrote a book about it, or really wrote a book about it and was embedded in it.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And after his book tour and the mess that it is, he decided to start this company called "To Gather."
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   It's a cool name. And they have, I think, four or five employees now.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And they're enabling authors to either sell books or get gate fees or do it for free or go with companies to these events.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And we talked more about new other new ideas last night. It's very cool. It's very neat.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Yeah, to see something like that come alive.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Speaking of Mars, we have...
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   What a transition.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Coming up next show, "The Trangulation," we are going to talk to the lead scientist on the Curiosity mission.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Coolo, coolo.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Great interview. That's a great interview.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I can't wait.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   So exciting. Yeah, thank you to... I think it was Carsten Bondi who got that.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   So thank you, Carsten. Nice job.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Next week, you'll have Felix Baumgartner, probably.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   We're trying. We talked to... Actually, on Twitter, on Sunday, right after the jump, we talked to Scott Gillies, who was the production manager, the guy who got the video and all the stuff.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Because that was, to me, that was the most amazing...
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   You know, fallen out of a balloon. I mean, brave, but it's really...
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   The achievement was all the technology around it. It was pretty amazing.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Absolutely.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So, in fact, if you hadn't hear that interview, it's in the beginning of Twit from last Sunday.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Scott Gillies was... I can't remember what his exact title was, something like lead production manager or something like that.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   You just mentioned that event, my palms start pouring.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I know.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   When I confess, when I was up visiting Twit that now, amid this whole world,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   there was a barrier between me and getting to Twit, which is my fier... my worsened fear of bridges.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   So, you get like nervous when you're on a bridge. Are you afraid it's going to collapse?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Or have it over the edge or something? It's vertigo, right? And it's... And it's... We never liked them.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   I've gotten worse in the last couple of years. And so, and the anticipation of knowing that I had to go over the Golden Gate to get to Uleo.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   You matter so much.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Aww.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Wow.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   That's an interesting... It's a phobia, I guess.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Do you get dizzy, Jeff? Do you actually get dizzy or...
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Is the vertigo just the kind of the fear of the height?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   I have to breathe deep to not... My fear is that I'll pass out.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Right.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   I never pass... My life. But...
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Hmm.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Besides that, Doc...
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   First time, everything.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And of course, it's earthquake country. So, were you here in '89 when the bridge fell in?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   I shouldn't bring this up.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   X-Nay on the...
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   That's for my guy and say it then.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   [laughter]
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   What bridge? What earthquake?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I'm not going with that other...
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Uh...
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   There hasn't been a good news. There hasn't been an earthquake in New York City in about 150 years.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Well, that's the problem when you're from the East Coast and you come to the West Coast.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Like, one of my family's big arguments was like, "But there are earthquakes there."
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Like how, you know.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   [laughter]
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   So...
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   I don't have that...
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I don't know if there's a fairly hefty fault going right through Manhattan. I may be wrong.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   But...
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   But...
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Historically, Manhattan is not free of earthquakes.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   No, there hasn't been...
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   It's one of the most...
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   ...like said he experienced his first earthquake in Boston.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Yeah, this summer there was an earthquake in Boston. Is that weird?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   So...
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Just want you to know.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Well, it's this week in our neuroses.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Alright, let's talk about Google. We're going to start with our new feature, Gina Trapani with...
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   The Changelog.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   The Changelog.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   The Changelog.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   The Changelog.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Hey!
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   It really is overdoing it, I think.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Beautiful.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Man, that is such a cool intro. I love it.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   So, every... we decided... we started this last week and thanks to who did the intro.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   The intro... audio was made by Jesse Weisner.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Okay.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And then I made the video animation.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   You did that? Thank you.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Great.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Very cool.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   So, we decided that we don't... we talk about Google, but maybe we should just every week summarize all the new stuff because there's always something new from Google.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   There's always new product updates.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Some of the minor, but we like to run on the list.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   This week we've got a drag-and-drop up to upload folders in Google Chrome to Google Drive.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   So, you've had the ability to drag a file into Chrome in order to add it to your drive, but now you can drag and drop an entire folder.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   You just have to be using the latest version of Chrome to do that.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   And of course, you can use the Chrome desktop app as well.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Android Jelly Bean 4.1.2. It's the incremental upgrade.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   We talked about last week. It was rolling out over the air to the Nexus 7.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   This week it's rolling out to the Nexus S and the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   It's mostly performance updates to build improvements, bug fixes, but the one change you will notice is that the new version of the Chrome is running out.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And you will notice is that the home screen and the lock screen will rotate into landscape mode right now.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   It's just, "Ah, see, Jack has it. He's showing on screen there."
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Yeah, I got it on my Nexus 7 yesterday, I think.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   I haven't gotten on my Galaxy Nexus yet, but it should be coming out to the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   This is why you want a Nexus, folks.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I've been tuning the Nexus horn for a while now.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   You get all the new stuff sooner.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Google Street View increased its coverage by 250,000 miles and its biggest update yet.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   They also doubled their number of special collections.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   New Street View coverage in a bunch of different countries, Macau, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand, Taiwan, the US.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   If you go to maps.google.com/streetview, you can take a tour of their new stuff.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   They've got a cool little dynamic page there that Leo is showing us.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And finally, our friend Matt Cutts introduced a webmaster tool.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   This is more for web publishers than developers, but kind of interesting in the link economy to point out, it's called disavow links.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   If your site has been linked to you by sites of ill-repute or spammy links,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   and your site is suffering from search engine ranking, it's getting ranked lower because it's got these spammy links,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   and you haven't been able to get those links removed from those sites,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   you can actually go to this tool, say disavow these links, you can upload a text file of domains in your URLs
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   where these bad links are coming into your site and say, "Hey, we want nothing to do with them."
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   And there's a nice video from Soring our friend Matt to explain disavow links a little bit more.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   So, Gina, is there any kind of automated way to let you know who the bad linkers are so that you can kind of --
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   or is it a very manual process?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   So this haven't happened to me, but I think that as a webmaster, like you do, you will get a notification from Google.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Like if you've been devoted because you've got links from sites that have been --
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Who reads their email? Come on.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   I don't know if it's an email notification or if it's a Google Analytics notification or what,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   but I believe that webmasters -- this doesn't happen to me, but I believe that you are notified when you're suffering from
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   demotion because of sites of ill-repute.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Yeah, because all your users say, "I don't see you on the Google anymore."
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Right. Well, right.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Where did you go?
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   So you do get an idea.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   I think those sites do get pointed out to you if they're particularly bad.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   But I get the impression that this is a fairly manual process right now.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   I mean, you literally have to make a text file and upload it to this tool.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   So you have to care.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   I'm going to be paying attention in order to use this tool.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And we also have an alternate open from a guy named Alter.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   E-TIE Alter.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Should I play it?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Well, here, I have it here.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Okay, let's see it.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   I like that.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   That's a little more classy.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   I'm not saying...
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   The other one is a little...
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Well, I'll say that's the outro.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   You have an intro with an outro.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   You can easily do that.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   The first one is more like a TNT video, right?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Right.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And remember, this is the show that begins with...
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   It's a more classy kind of a show.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   It's a more classical kind of a show.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I don't know.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Let's check this one out again.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Let's see.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Now, of course, the problem with this one is if you're listening only on audio, all you hear is
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   "Boom, boom, boom, boom."
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   You don't know what's coming.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   The other one at least says...
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Do you want to hear it?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Google change log.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   It's a little shrecky.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   I like cheese.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   I particularly like this.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I...
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   People are listening.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Can't see, but there's a...
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   There's a change log.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   And one says that there's a bug found in Leo Salad.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   That's why I'm having soup today.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   I think from the audio audience, probably the trumpets is probably the better choice,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   because at least as Google change log.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And their...
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Our audience is mostly audio?
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Believe it or not, still.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   It's changing.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   It's very interesting to watch.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   It's like moving a...
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   It's like a locomotive slowly taking off in the station watching the video start to climb.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Prah, that's going to be really exciting.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   And some of the shows they have iPad today is mostly video I think.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   I can't remember, but the...
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   You know, the good news is that at least it's going that up, not...
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Go the right direction.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   But we do have to...
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   I have to constantly remember and it's not an easy thing, because I'm seeing it, that there's
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   people who...
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Most of our audience is just hearing it.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   So...
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   God bless you everyone.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   God bless everyone, I am.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Your cars.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Just to answer Jeff's question earlier about whether or not you know, the message from Google
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.600]   is, "If you've ever been caught up in LinkSpan, you'll see a message in Webmaster Tools about
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.000]   unnatural links pointing to your site."
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.720]   We send this message and we see evidence of paid links, link exchanges or other link schemes
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.360]   that violate our quality guidelines.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.560]   So you do get a notification in Webmaster Tools about the sites that are linking to that
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.400]   are considered spam.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:51.280]   Did you know that Google guards its top secret data center with stormtroopers?
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.280]   There's a little...
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.920]   Now we could talk about this, because Google has kind of thrown open the doors of beautiful
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.080]   pictures.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.400]   But there's also a street view now of...
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.880]   I don't use a Google product.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.400]   You're connecting to one of our data centers.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.400]   This is the Lenoir North Carolina data center.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   Let's take a look inside and see how they work.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.600]   It's a video, but you could do this by hand.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.600]   I don't know if you can find the NDA.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.800]   It's not that secret apparently.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:24.240]   Keeping the data center up and running 24 hours a day.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.560]   In the Wired article, it's great.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:33.880]   They talk about the first Google data center, which was in San Jose at the Exodus, was the
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:39.400]   Colo, and what a mess it was.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.960]   On the server floor.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.960]   This is not a mess.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.240]   This is a model of engineering.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.200]   These are the water pipes.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.760]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.200]   The cooling system, the water pipes are Google colors.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.360]   I don't know if it's in the video or not, but it's on the site.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.080]   I put the link up to the site as well.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.080]   You'll have access to your data whenever you need it.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:04.280]   Really anal geeks plus lots of money equals beautiful beautiful data.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.520]   But you want to data...
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.520]   Cooling is everything.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.160]   In fact, they talk about the vast amount of power used by data centers.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.320]   It was something on one and a half percent of all the electrical power in the US is used
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.320]   by data centers.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.320]   When the water breaks, you raise all of its content.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.120]   Look at the stack of hard drives.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.040]   For extra security, you destroy it.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.000]   They're destroying the hard drive with a giant drill press.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.880]   The machines in our data centers are always...
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.400]   Because they don't want anybody to know what you've been looking for.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.400]   Cooling towers like these.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.080]   They've been watered to cool them down and keep them running.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.200]   When the water heats up, we pump it back outside.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:39.960]   This town, before it became known as the data center capital of the US, was a...
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.400]   Or a Google data center...
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.840]   Famous for furniture making.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.000]   All that North Carolina furniture came from there.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.600]   So those biggest bases.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.920]   So, Urs Holz, who is the engineer who designed these data centers, was...
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.040]   Had never before designed a data center.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.160]   He was on leave as a computer science professor at UC Santa Barbara in 1999.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.160]   There you go.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.160]   Look at the wires.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.160]   This is the slideshow on the Google site.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.240]   There's all the hard drives.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.240]   When his new employers...
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.400]   I'm reading from the Stephen Levy article in Wired.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.560]   His new employers took him to the Exodus server facility in Santa Clara.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.240]   Exodus was a co-location site or co-low where multiple companies rent floor space.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.240]   Look at there.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.560]   There's the colorful cooling pipes.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.560]   Google colored.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.560]   I just...
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.560]   You know what?
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.560]   The first thing I think of is...
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.400]   Somebody had to paint all those pipes different colors.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.920]   I mean, it looks like a jungle gym.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.920]   It looks like a playground.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.920]   How's that bike there?
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.920]   It does.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.440]   Google's cage sat next to servers from eBay and other blue chip internet companies.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.920]   The search company's array was the most densely packed and chaotic.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.400]   Brynn and Paige were looking to upgrade the system, which often took a full three and
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:49.960]   a half seconds to deliver search results and tended to crash on Mondays.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.320]   I think Matt Cutts mentioned that once.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.160]   There was something that happened and they never figured it out, but Mondays it would
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.160]   just...
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.160]   Everything would crash.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.160]   Hmm.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.920]   Because of a spike in traffic?
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.920]   Is there traffic or because of something?
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.360]   It was probably a memory leak of some kind and then just...
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.960]   Well, Mondays is when you never put up a new version on Friday.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.040]   Maybe they were just popping up new versions on Mondays.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.840]   Spiders were extra busy.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.400]   Exodus was a huge mess.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.520]   That's later recalled.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.040]   And the cramped hodgepodge would soon be strained even more.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.360]   Really they were ready to launch AdWords.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.000]   I mean, just the growth...
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.800]   And I'm thinking about Facebook too, the growth of these...
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:38.480]   We forget, when you have 800 million or now a billion users hitting your servers, that's
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.320]   a lot of servers.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.680]   Not just a lot of bandwidth, it's a lot of hardware.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.800]   Yeah, it's mind boggling really.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:51.160]   Was Google the first to get to such scale with just doing pizza boxes?
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.440]   I think Google...
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.640]   I remember vividly when Google published the first pictures of its...
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.880]   Remember the modular thing they were building in containers?
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:06.000]   They didn't enclose the servers for cooling purposes.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.640]   They were just kind of sitting open.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.800]   I think it was Google that did that first.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.800]   Google...
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.960]   Well, their approach was to never spend a lot of money on high-end stuff.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.560]   Their approach was always to design for failure and use a lot of cheap equipment but have
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.680]   a ton of redundancy.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.080]   So if one went out, it didn't matter.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.320]   Google made advances in...
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:32.360]   This is actually a great article if you're kind of a data geek.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:39.840]   The article in Wired is great water cooling issues.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:46.600]   This Google's notorious for getting the lowest possible energy usage.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:53.760]   A perfectly effective, a perfectly efficient data center would get a score of one.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.480]   It's considered a two, meaning that half the power was wasted in heat and other stuff,
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.840]   would be a reasonable number.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.480]   Google gets about 1.2, very close to perfect efficiency.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.640]   It's kind of neat.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.680]   It's the first time we've ever been allowed to see inside a data center.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.920]   They treat these like their top secret.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.920]   I'm not sure why, really.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.320]   I don't know why either.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.560]   Are they terrorist targets?
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.480]   What would you learn by seeing that?
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.480]   Yeah, I know.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.240]   It doesn't show you how to get in.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:32.600]   Of course, the numbers are mind-boggling when you realize that Felix Baumgartner jump
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:39.400]   on Sunday was viewed by 8 million people simultaneously on YouTube.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:44.520]   Not only a new record for streaming video, but it broke the old record, just kind of like
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.840]   Baumgartner broke the old record by a factor of 16.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:49.840]   Indeed.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.440]   The previous record was half a million during the Olympics.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.760]   Now, let's not forget there were some complaints that one guess is that a lot of that was
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.360]   served or optimized through Akamai.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.360]   Right.
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.160]   It wasn't all Google, which was fine.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:07.360]   It's only a short wait all flowed closer to CDN.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:13.120]   The cable terms they had ends, the nodes, and to get it distributed out there is just
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.120]   a better architecture.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.160]   I mean, Google scale is part of their competitive advantage.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.160]   I mean, how many other companies could do it?
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.160]   Could do that.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.200]   Is Amazon as good at scale?
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.200]   No.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.200]   I guess it's different kind of scale.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.080]   I remember talking to an early Amazon engineer.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.080]   Where was that?
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.800]   Oh, it was at a food camp.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:38.640]   He was like employee three, and he talks about the day they moved the Amazon servers.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.040]   He threw it in the back of his car, drove across town.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:47.320]   And he said, as I was driving, I'm thinking, I have all of Amazon in my trunk.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.760]   I couldn't do that anymore.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:58.160]   Is scales better in a different way for optimize for what they do?
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.160]   Well, Amazon sells scale.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.000]   They sell Amazon at EC2.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Right.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.680]   But they do that, right?
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.480]   Because the holiday time, they have all the scale that they have to be ready for the one
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.360]   month or two months a year, and people are buying.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.360]   That's interesting.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.360]   That makes sense.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.160]   And then the rest of the time, it sort of--
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.000]   That's how CompuServe got started.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Really?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.560]   H&R Block used a lot of computing power during tax time, and it was unused the rest of the
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.560]   year.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.560]   So they said, well, we should do something with that.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.160]   We got these mainframes.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.760]   And they started CompuServe, one of the first online services.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.880]   What happened in April, though, when they did need that power?
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.520]   Or in Christmas to EC2?
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.080]   I guess at some point it becomes a business, and you don't--
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.080]   I don't know.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.680]   But that was a whole idea of the early days of computing, of time sharing, right?
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.000]   That no one user would need a mainframe.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Right.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Well, don't know why it's true.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.560]   It'll be back in the old days.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.840]   Now you need-- I got a mainframe in my phone.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.160]   And it's not enough sometimes.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:04.680]   When I ran sites for my last employer for advance, we had them in this horrid haunted
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.240]   building in Journal Square, Jersey City, which a recent employee called Uranal Square,
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.560]   appropriately.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.440]   And they were in a horrid bank basement, an old press room that nearly flooded all the
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.520]   time.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:20.680]   And one tech director I hired, who didn't last very long, we had a heat problem.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.560]   So he went off turning off all the heads of the servers.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.160]   And then he decided to turn off a couple servers.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.760]   So he turned off all the services.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.840]   This was my tech director.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.000]   It was a bad day.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Awful day.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.320]   So what would be cooler than Google's North Carolina data center?
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.320]   Their Finnish data center.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.320]   Ooh.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.320]   This thing is structured.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.600]   It's already there, the climate in that area, and then designed some--
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.600]   They're using seawater to really make cool--
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.600]   Cool.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   --those deficient cooling and--
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.320]   Oh, no, we can now blame Google for bubble warming on the sea.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.320]   Wiling the ocean.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   We can blame for everything else.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.960]   Why not that?
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.120]   It's their fault.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.400]   Blame Google.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.400]   Let's take a break.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.400]   We got some actually hard news.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.520]   I just-- I thought that'd be kind of fun to do some pretty pictures and so forth.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.600]   But first, let's talk about speaking of pretty pictures.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.040]   How about some music?
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.600]   How about Ford Sync?
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.160]   Ford.com/technology.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.480]   If you-- you know, they have an app, which I really love.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.840]   It's free app on the iOS.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.440]   I think they have it for Android, too, where you can try Ford Touch, the My Ford Touch,
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.200]   on your phone just to see the UI and play with it.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.480]   And that's one way to take a look at what Ford Sync can do.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.880]   Sync lets you control your media player with voice commands.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.560]   And it's so sweet.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.600]   In fact, I was curious.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.360]   I connected my iPhone 5 up.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.560]   I finally got an extra lightning cable and I connected my iPhone 5 up.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:50.760]   All Ford Sync vehicles have at least one, sometimes two USB ports, plugged in the USB
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.920]   port, plugged in the lightning cable into the USB port.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.560]   The iPhone 5, just like the iPhone 4, I could control it.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.560]   I could browse it.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:03.600]   I could use on the screen on my-- and I could call for anything by voice, which is amazing.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.920]   You can browse your music collection by-- and this is just not iPhone.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.800]   I mean, almost any phone, Android, iOS.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.960]   You could browse your collection by genre, artist, album, song title.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.960]   You can ask for a playlist.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.800]   I want to hear the rock and-- you know, album rock, all with voice commands.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.200]   It allows voice activated control of your media player to even play a list of music
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.880]   you're in the mood for.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.280]   If you like the song and you're listening to you, say, "Play music similar to this."
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.800]   And it will.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.440]   It's very smart.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:35.080]   You could voice control music no matter how it's stored on your smartphone via Bluetooth
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.120]   streaming on a USB drive.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:43.440]   If you have an MP3-- 3-player like an iPod, an iPad-- iPad's great example.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.360]   You could use Bluetooth or connect the USB cable.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.360]   And here's a nice feature.
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.880]   If you have Sync with the available Sync with My Ford Touch and HD radio technology, you
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.240]   can use iTunes tagging.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.240]   You like a song.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.240]   You're listening to it on the HD radio.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.480]   You like a song, you say, "Take that."
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.400]   And when you get back home, iTunes will let you buy it.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:08.200]   Best of all, Ford offers Sync on every 2012, 2013 Ford vehicle sold in the USA, including
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.800]   the 2012 Ford Focus.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.960]   Now that is awesome.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.960]   That is really awesome.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.960]   I've been asking people to tweet.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.880]   We've been getting a lot of people tweeting.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:22.840]   Somebody sent me an email yesterday saying, "Hey, who do I tell if I bought a Ford because
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.640]   I heard about it, I heard about Sync?"
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.080]   And I said, "Well, you can tell me, or you can tweet it."
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.400]   And I've been seeing lots of tweets from people who said, "Yes, I bought-- I just got
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.400]   my new edge.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.400]   I love my Ford Escape.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.040]   I just got-- I just got Sync."
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.360]   It's really cool.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.360]   Tweet it.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.360]   Let us know.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360]   You can also add @Ford in that way.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.280]   They'll know that you listen to the Twitter network.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.080]   And if you want to know more, Ford.com/technology.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:54.960]   If you want to see it all in action, or I get a better idea, go to your Ford dealer
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.680]   and say, "I want to test drive.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.880]   Not the car, the Ford Sync."
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.880]   They'll put you in a car, but bring your smartphone so you can test drive the sync as
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.080]   well.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.520]   Go further in a Ford Ford.com/technology.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.560]   So I don't know-- you're going to have to explain this to me.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:19.280]   Turns out, reading somebody's Gmail doesn't violate a federal statute.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.480]   South Carolina Supreme Court last week decided accessing someone's email without their permission
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:31.360]   is not a violation of the 1986 Stored Communications Act because the email is in a cloud which
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:38.200]   counts as electronic storage and is not specifically not protected by the act.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.160]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:46.280]   The Stored Communications Act apparently requires it to be on a hard drive.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.560]   This is the problem with making laws technology specific.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.560]   Right?
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.920]   It's just absurd.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.120]   But the same goes in the other way.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.960]   The fact that our email is not as protected as our physical mail is another substantiation
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:03.080]   of how wrong this is.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.680]   So this came up in a case.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.640]   It looks like it was a divorce case where a woman basically hacked or guessed her husband's
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.880]   security questions, like suspected him of cheating, guessed his Gmail or Yahoo mail,
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.960]   security questions, got into his Yahoo mail account, found messages between him and his
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:24.040]   lover and gave them to her divorce lawyer to use them as evidence.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:29.880]   And then he sued her back saying that that violated several laws, including the Stored
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.280]   Communications Act.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.560]   So this is pretty interesting.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.640]   I think this is an 80th Supreme Court, frankly.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.640]   Here's what-
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.120]   Yeah, I mean this is 1986, right?
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.880]   This act was written in a 1980-
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.800]   Yeah, but let me read you and you tell me.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.400]   The code defines electronic storage under the SCA as any temporary intermediate storage
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:54.960]   of a wire or electronic communication incidental to the electronic transmission thereof and
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.480]   be any storage of such communication by an electronic communication service for the purposes
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:04.000]   of backup protection of such communications.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.680]   The judges found that because he had no other copies of his email, they could not possibly
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.880]   have been a backup.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.880]   These guys are morons.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.560]   Can't you say it?
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:24.560]   We declined to hold the two judges wrote, justices Hearn and Kitridge, that retaining
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.120]   an open email constitutes storing it for backup protection under the act.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   I think this is not a new law we need.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.520]   We need new judges.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.720]   This guy never used mail in his life.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.720]   Yeah, obvious.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   Right.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.720]   So-
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.720]   So-
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.680]   You know, because same as saying that it was written at a time where it was never put on
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.680]   a floppy disk.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.680]   Right.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:51.040]   Like back in the day you would download your email from your server and it would be deleted
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.520]   to your server and it would now exist on your computer.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.320]   And that would mean that you had retrieved your email and now it was on your hard drive.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.640]   But that's just not the way that it works right now.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.960]   In the day of the trash 80, it was on a cassette drive.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.680]   It's on a- Look, it's on a hard drive somewhere.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.640]   What's the intent of the law?
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.480]   The intent of the law is it's stored somewhere.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.280]   Virtual-
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:19.720]   But the storage could be, you know, virtual, I mean, a solid state drive.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.640]   Okay, a solid state drive.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.640]   It could mean every-
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.640]   It's a storage.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.640]   It's electronic storage.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.640]   That's the absurdity.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.640]   Morons.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.440]   This is the problem.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.320]   Do not write laws to technology.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.920]   Let me just say there's going to be an election in three weeks.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.840]   If you do not vote, you do not deserve to be a geek.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.840]   Here, here.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.840]   Seriously.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:48.840]   So if this guy had downloaded a copy of this email to one of his devices, so if you connected
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.800]   to Yahoo mail through a client on any one of his devices, he would have a copy, a personal
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   copy, and this could be considered a backup because it was a different copy.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.800]   Right.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   Oh, man.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.800]   Wow.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.880]   Not far off, but Pirate Bay just announced that they're in the cloud.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.840]   Which is hilarious because what they want to see is the inability to go seize a server.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.840]   Right.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.840]   Where the server is, where's Waldo?
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.840]   Right.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:17.000]   Obviously, as we just learned moments ago, the servers are somewhere.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Yes.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Right.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   The servers are somewhere.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.560]   Just follow the yellow brick pipe.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.560]   But it's a relevant.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.560]   It's irrelevant.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.560]   Where are they?
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:30.400]   So just, I'm just pointing out, you're going to get to vote for your, your member of Congress.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.600]   You might get to vote for a senator.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.000]   You're certainly going to get to vote for a president.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.160]   All of those people have some influence on these courts.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:41.120]   These, these justices are appointed by the president and they are approved by Congress.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:49.440]   So get out there and vote and ask your candidates, Hey, what do you know about electronic storage?
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.840]   Define backup.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.920]   What is the cloud, Congressman?
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:53.920]   What?
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:59.680]   I wish last night in the debate, somebody stood up said, Mr. Mr. Obama, Mr. Romney,
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.280]   please define the cloud.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.680]   We needed somebody to do that in one of these debates just so that we know which one gets
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.680]   it.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.680]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.680]   I would love that.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.600]   Probably neither, but Romney will say, I think I bought bought it.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.720]   Romney's going to say, I'm a businessman.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.120]   I know what computers are.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.120]   Right.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.120]   That's his answer.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:24.400]   I'm a person of class and President Obama'll say, you know, I feel your pain.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.760]   Oh, I give up.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.360]   I know how tough it is.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.360]   Let me just tell you.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.360]   You always start to think.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.080]   I keep things in binders.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.480]   Binders of women.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.840]   Binders of clouds binders of clouds.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.840]   That's it.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.840]   That's it.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.840]   I keep.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.840]   Who needs a cloud?
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.840]   I've got binders.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:45.840]   Oh, dear.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:53.560]   But it was, it was a matter of minutes before women and binders was a tumbler feed.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.560]   It took no time.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.560]   Oh my God.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.560]   So great.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.880]   So what did Romney say?
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.600]   This was in the question about the equal pay for equal work.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.800]   He didn't have enough women.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.400]   He went and demanded someone bring him binders filled with women.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.400]   Right.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.400]   He went to women's group.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.440]   He had, he looked at his applicant pool for his administration and it was all, it was
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.440]   mostly men.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.800]   And he said, we need to have more qualified women applicants.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.360]   And he went to a group and they apparently handed him binders full of women's names who
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.360]   were qualified.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:29.400]   So literally before the debate was over binders full of women dot tumbler.com not only was
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:36.360]   started but was full of examples of binders of women.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.960]   It is the funniest, it was every internet meme.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.360]   Here's one Romney to bring them all.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.680]   And then the darkest binder them.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:49.920]   Here's a cat with binders of cats.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.200]   This is, this is what the internet's good at.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:58.000]   Alas, this doesn't help as much in cases like this, this Supreme, this Supreme Court in
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.240]   South Carolina, which apparently doesn't understand how storage works.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:06.920]   So, you know, if you go back to Ted Stevens, does the mockery of him and tubes?
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.080]   I hope it makes a difference.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.560]   I think it made a difference.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.400]   Somebody, other politicians at some point said, I can't be made fun of in quite that
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.400]   way.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.400]   What the F was this about?
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.400]   What is this tubes thing?
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.040]   Right.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.320]   This was a state Supreme Court, not the national.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.720]   It was a federal law, I think.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.120]   Yep, they were ruling on the federal law.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.960]   But of course it was a state case.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.960]   It could be appealed and not that I have any hope at all if it were appealed that the
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:36.520]   US Supreme Court would have any clue what's going on either.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.920]   The technology is moving too fast.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:41.480]   I mean, the whole point of government, government in the US anyway, is designed to be very,
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:47.760]   very, very slow because the founders believed that a slow government was an unempowered
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.200]   government was safer.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.200]   If this were a dictatorship.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.200]   What was the easy way around this?
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.000]   You write laws to principles, right?
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.440]   You, that law, that communication defined vastly as private communication is just like
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.320]   physical mail or email or whatever.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.480]   And it has principles around it.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.720]   So it was just a badly written law, badly interpreted by bad judge.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.720]   Yes, exactly.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.720]   It was too specific.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:16.400]   They didn't need, and maybe in 1986 they needed to explain what storage was.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.480]   I don't know.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.480]   But I think you're exactly right, right?
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.640]   To the principle.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:27.040]   And then the justice can look at modern technology and see what the intent was as opposed to
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.160]   saying it's Talmudic, right?
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.160]   Yep.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.440]   Google is creating now they got Nexus phones.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.440]   They got Nexus tablets.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.200]   How about a Nexus call center?
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.200]   This is interesting.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.880]   You think Google's going to get into the business, the customer service?
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:55.680]   So this is a job listing for help desk level one for a confidential client who recently
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:58.200]   unveiled a new Android tablet.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.080]   I think we all know who that is.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:05.680]   It says in the listing, the location is Mountain View.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.720]   $19 an hour.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.920]   That's pretty good.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:14.240]   Full time, six month contract option for extension and/or permanency mid September.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.240]   Phone and email support.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.840]   That's pretty expensive real estate.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.840]   Mountain View?
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.840]   That's where Google is.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.640]   I know why they put them in Mountain View.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.640]   I see.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.640]   They're around the world.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.640]   There's probably three people.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.640]   That's the problem.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.640]   That's a very good point.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.920]   Well, I think we mentioned on the show last week, you mentioned the famous story that Larry
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:38.040]   Page said when someone came to him and said we should answer this user's email and he
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.040]   said no.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   Right.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.040]   Don't get started.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.400]   But now that you start getting money from people, you have to have customer service.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.800]   You have two costs come.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.560]   This is the thing with the fight I have with paywalls in newspapers.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.560]   People say, oh, put up paywalls.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.080]   It will solve all our problems.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.400]   No, two costs come when you put up paywalls.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:57.280]   One is marketing and the other one is customer service.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.400]   And it's not cheap to get money out of you.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.400]   I got it.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.480]   Did I tell you about the Comcast, my Comcast story?
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.480]   No.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.880]   I tweeted some, you know, I was having some.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.880]   I'm still having.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.120]   You know, it's not even like Comcast is mean.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.760]   It's just that the whole system is broken.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.760]   And I was just complaining.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.920]   I was venting on Twitter, but they watch Twitter like a hawk.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.320]   Like if you want customer service, complain on Twitter.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.640]   Don't call a customer.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.240]   You can't even get a human.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:30.400]   But if you if you tweet it, so I've been getting calls and actually I'm starting ignoring them
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.160]   because the last one was Sunday morning at 8 a.m.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:37.960]   I was asleep from the Comcast executive.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:43.000]   Some they have some like the executive offices of Comcast.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.360]   And I think it is because it's someone with a Philly accent, but it didn't seem so much
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.360]   like so.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.600]   And so what you would expect is, oh, we're so sorry.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.560]   What can we do to make this right?
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.200]   We value you as a customer.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.760]   Let's what are your complaints?
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.760]   It was no.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.520]   It was like, hey, she literally said you're paying $39 a month.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.280]   You should be happy.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.160]   I think they now want you.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:06.000]   They're now calling you to get you to shut up.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.080]   Not to fix it because they can't.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.080]   It's broken.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.080]   They can't.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.880]   Well, we just this whole idea of score and your follower can't.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.880]   I'm sure she knew my class score.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.880]   Influential influential person.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:22.880]   What she didn't know is that what HDMI was, but she did know my cloud score.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:28.520]   I think this is the problem of, you know, Comcast was actually one of the first companies
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.520]   to really respond.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.520]   Comcast cares.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.520]   Frank Elyasan.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.120]   He was like, well, it's who did great job.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.920]   He's now left to go to a bank, a city bank.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:38.440]   Well, it's like the worst world, but Frank's a very nice guy.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.280]   He's written a book about all this.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.640]   And when he did it, it really was.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.920]   And I had some experience of this.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.920]   So sorry.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.920]   We're going to fix it.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.920]   We're going to make it right.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:51.040]   But he was a senior vice president of the company who would deal directly with customers.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.040]   Right.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:56.520]   And now when the bureaucracy opens, there's some kind of, you know, somebody, Leo's law
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:01.000]   created that the larger that bureaucracy gets, the meaner and more in transition and nasty
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:01.920]   it's going to get.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.720]   If you are a cable company, you must act like a cable company at the end of the day.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.040]   Well, I don't even know if they want to be mean.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.040]   I think what they want.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.840]   They just want me to stop tweeting.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:14.120]   And but by the way, I immediately tweeted that.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.320]   But that's what's changed.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.320]   That's a little shift.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.520]   Instead of saying, how can we make this right?
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.520]   We're sorry.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.760]   We want to give you a good customer service.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.480]   I think they realize we can't.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.640]   So it's like Google.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.640]   We can't.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.160]   So let's just get them to shut up.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.600]   What just, you know, and so she was saying things like, I said, well, you know, I ordered
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.840]   two HDMI boxes.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.320]   The guy came with one component box, no HDMI.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.720]   She said, Oh, well, no, we don't do HDMI boxes.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.720]   I said, what are you talking about?
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.600]   I've had HDMI from you guys for years.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.600]   I have.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.840]   What are you talking about?
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.000]   I think it was really to get them to shut up.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.960]   Get me to shut up.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.560]   But I think that that's probably what's going to happen.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.800]   What's going on now is they can't really.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.440]   I mean, it doesn't scale.
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.440]   You can't give you can't.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.400]   What are you going to watch Twitter and everybody who clank every look at Comcast on Twitter.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.400]   It's all complaints nonstop.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   They can't fix that.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.200]   Well, they could fix it.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:08.160]   If I do it, you know, but reinventing the business, I mean, the best way to get you to
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.400]   stop tweeting is to help you out to fix the problem.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.800]   She just got me to tweet more and mention a show.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.760]   You're a tweet war, exactly.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:17.760]   And you know what?
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.360]   Now I'm going to get more calls from that 800 number in Philadelphia, which I now have
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.200]   blocked on my phone.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.040]   Yes, I don't want to talk to them.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.640]   It's not getting better.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:28.640]   It's just right.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.120]   You know, that is the worst thing with an airline or phone or cable company says, let
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.120]   me explain.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.120]   Yes.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.720]   No, no, I don't want you to explain how you're screwing me.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.720]   I don't justify.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.720]   Don't rationalize.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.200]   I don't need that.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.600]   But this idea that Google is setting up a call center, I mean, one of the things that
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.360]   Google's really stunk at for the reasons we talked about last week is customer service.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.880]   I mean, it's really hard to get ahold of someone.
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.880]   I mean, just in the two years we've been doing this show, I've gotten a handful of emails
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:58.040]   personally from people who have had their AdSense account shutdown or they're locked
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:02.520]   out of their Gmail and they've posted in the forums and they looked at the .py help files
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.200]   and they can't, there's nothing they can do.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.960]   They can't get ahold of anywhere to Google and they, you know, come to, and I'm sure
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.600]   this is happening to you guys, they come in a me sort of begging like, do you know somebody
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.920]   theirs or any way that I can get my stuff?
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.440]   And it's this, it's a little frightening to think, you know, if you're not, if you don't
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.480]   have a big platform like we have the privilege of a big platform that you're using a free
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:25.080]   service and if something goes wrong that you don't have any recourse and there's no customer
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:29.320]   support that's reliable that you know that someone will get back to you.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:34.640]   So I often wondered if Google could literally charge for support, you know, it's like here's
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.560]   our free app, but you know, if you call us, you know, it's going to cost you 10 bucks
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.520]   and you can, you know, get, get a human.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:44.040]   I mean, in this case, of course, they're selling Nexus devices that are providing customer
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.080]   support for this device that they're selling.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:51.880]   So what's the support, you know, what's the support solution for free, for free web apps
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.880]   that are advertised as well?
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.960]   It has to be hard though.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:58.680]   If you have no tradition of customer support, no contrition of communication with customers
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.320]   to turn on a dime and say, okay, now we're going to support hardware.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.560]   Yeah, and support it's, it's tough.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.560]   Yeah, it's tough.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.560]   It's a horrible job.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.560]   It is.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.560]   It is.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:12.200]   Because I know that it's costly and people are exhausting.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.760]   People are mean and yeah.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:19.440]   They say mean things to you on the phone.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:23.320]   But speaking of speaking, Larry Page speaks.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:28.080]   Remember, he lost his voice in the summer.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.520]   Still don't know why.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:35.880]   But he was at Zeitgeist in Paradise Valley, Arizona.
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.640]   That sounds like that was an event, by the way.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.640]   Do you see?
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.320]   And by the way, I'm going to say it again.
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.600]   What do I have to do?
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:45.360]   I'm going to say, kiss ass book, be on a show all about Google.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.920]   What do we all have to do to get invited to Zeitgeist?
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:48.920]   Huh?
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.920]   Huh?
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   I mean, Scoble got invited.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.920]   Scoble got invited.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.000]   Why didn't you get invited?
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   I know.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.640]   Yeah, Trevor should be there.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.640]   He wrote the Google book.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.840]   Hey, I wrote a Google book.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:00.840]   I should be there.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.400]   Hey, yeah, we all do a show on Google.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.560]   But I don't want to go.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.560]   So that's okay.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.560]   You can invite them.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.560]   Do the show from there, Leo?
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.560]   Fight them.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.640]   I'll do a show from there, sure, whatever.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.360]   And Trey Radcliffe, did you see the pictures?
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.520]   Maybe that was just on path.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.080]   No, I think he published them.
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.080]   He went there.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:23.000]   He spoke and did an amazing Zeitgeist talk with gigabits of pictures around him.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.600]   Let me see if I can find the--
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.880]   I just thought he was going to do that.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.880]   I didn't see that when he pictures afterwards.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.880]   Am I on see that?
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:33.000]   I just never know if this is path only, or maybe where did I see it, or was it on--
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   No, here.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   It's on the Google Venice Plex.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.640]   It's on plus, no?
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.640]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.520]   Plus.google.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.480]   Let's search for Trey Radcliffe.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.480]   He gave a talk.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:54.280]   I'm pretty sure it was there at the Zeitgeist.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.440]   What is Zeitgeist?
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.720]   It's for their business partners, and they come in and wow them.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.000]   So it's their little private teddy thing.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.960]   But isn't it also the name of their search trends, their yearly search trends report?
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:13.280]   So this is Google with giving the Zeitgeist with the world to these powerful mockers.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.480]   So they had Sean Penn, their Halverian--
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:17.480]   Sean Penn.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.640]   Yeah, Sean Penn.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.280]   God knows why.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.280]   Okay.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.720]   He had a 16,000 pixel screen.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:29.200]   It is, in fact, on his plus page.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.520]   In fact, you can watch the entire video.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:35.760]   That's the Nexus 16,000, in other words.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:41.760]   This is a picture from Scobull of all-- so as Trey is talking about his photography,
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:45.680]   all his images are showing up on these screens all the way around the Zeitgeist.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.720]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.920]   With the brilliance of the photos in his HD photography, that must be--
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920]   Oh, must have been--
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.920]   Oh, wow.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:53.920]   Gorgeous.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:54.920]   Scobulls there?
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:57.920]   Scobulls there?
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.680]   But he's probably there because of Rackspace.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.680]   Well, I don't know.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.680]   Oh.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.680]   I don't know.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.640]   Anyway, those talks, I guess a number of those--
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:10.640]   Zeitgeist texts are online at Zeitgeistmines.com.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.560]   There's Trey, the wonderful Trey Radcliffe, giving his talk.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.560]   Wow.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.400]   I guess the pictures are moving behind him as he's talking.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.400]   Wow.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.400]   Cool.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.280]   No, you're not a customer.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:27.280]   You don't-- that's a sales event, in other words.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.120]   They have interesting people.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.360]   Larry Page spoke in a raspy voice.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:35.920]   He spent more than half an hour talking about things like--
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:36.920]   You owe him up.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:37.920]   I think-- listen to his voice.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.920]   Remember that?
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:39.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.920]   Hey.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.800]   He said, I want to tell you about Google.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.520]   It is-- I'm in the olive oil business.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:53.200]   We are not going--
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.520]   Stop me now.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:00.840]   He spent more than half an hour talking about antitrust.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.440]   The flap over maps.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.920]   The map flap.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.520]   By the way, trademark--
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.960]   Leo LePort.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.800]   2012.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:09.760]   The Apple map flap.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.320]   I think-- how do we miss that headline?
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.400]   Combining those two topics, by the way,
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:17.560]   I went in and I searched yesterday for an address in Dumbo
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.920]   and New York on just playing on Google.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.600]   And the first listing was MapQuest.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.760]   Wow.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.160]   And now, I just did another one before the show
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.160]   to see what happened.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.160]   It was the second listing.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.040]   But MapQuest is right up there.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:34.680]   And you wonder if that's not getting ready for the old antitrust
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.560]   call, which they're getting not only from the FTC now,
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.200]   but of course, always from the EU.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.880]   That's really-- and truthfully, the right result
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.040]   would be the Google map.
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:44.360]   I mean--
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:44.880]   Of course it--
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.560]   That's what you want.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.680]   You don't want MapQuest.
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:50.480]   And again, there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.840]   But you're right.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.120]   People will look at that and say, well, Google's giving
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.280]   their own services priority.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:58.080]   And that's why I've always thought Google--
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.360]   Search should be somehow separated out
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.960]   from their other businesses.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.200]   I don't know how you do that.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.000]   I was talking about-- to Jeff about this in the pre-show.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.840]   But if anyone watches The Good Wife,
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:08.880]   I would-- airs on Sunday.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.640]   It's a really good show.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.120]   But it's a legal drama.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:12.800]   It's all fiction.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:16.640]   But this week's past episode, which was called Two Girls One
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:20.480]   Code, which I will not comment on.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.480]   Wow.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.320]   That's a little nudge, nudge, wink, wink to the internet.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.480]   It was actually about a startup founder
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.200]   who had these two women who was demoted in search results.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.520]   And they were suing the search engine.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:32.560]   And so they covered search algorithms
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:35.400]   as protected speech versus trade secrets.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.880]   And it was actually a pretty tech-savvy show.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.120]   Sometimes I can tell if the show was making fun of techies.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:46.920]   Of course, they had the requisite chubby white guy blogger
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:51.760]   who wrote a review without checking any facts of the software.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.960]   So they kind of poke fun at the tech community.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.720]   But it's also pretty--
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.480]   I thought it was a fairly smart rendition
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.720]   for a Sunday night CBS prime time show.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.680]   People are more knowledgeable about technology.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:05.560]   That's why these judicial's really
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.920]   bugged me, because normal people understand
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.120]   that when you have mail in the cloud,
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.120]   it's stored in a hard drive.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.560]   They're not idiots.
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.040]   Right.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.800]   People understand technology much more than they ever did before.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:22.400]   So interestingly, Larry Page talked about that very thing.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.000]   Mr. Page also-- this is from an article
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:25.840]   in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:29.080]   I could not find a video of his talk, or I would run it.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.080]   Mr. Page also--
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.080]   Oh.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:36.240]   30% your 10% better, heavier batteries to work with.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.160]   And you know, car engines don't get better.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.840]   I tried to get out of the Google.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.680]   But they keep pulling me in.
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.080]   Chad, thanks for showing me up.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.800]   I said I couldn't find--
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.160]   So no, now we hear his voice.
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.000]   It's a little rat, but you know, it's fine.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.320]   He said, maybe you can find--
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.840]   maybe Mr. Smarty Pants.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.680]   You can find this portion of the talk.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.480]   Mr. Page also made several comments
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:03.240]   that reflected the arguments Google has used
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.400]   to counter claims by competitors that it has increasingly
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.880]   pointed web search engine users to Google's own services,
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:14.160]   Google Places, or Google+, rather than sites
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.960]   run by competitors like business listings at Yelp.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.160]   Page noted that when Google Maps was introduced
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.040]   and automatically began to show up as the top search result,
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.480]   people searched for information about places, quote,
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:28.320]   "We had the same kind of criticism," he said.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.800]   "People said there's map quest.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.200]   No one uses them anymore."
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.280]   Now I'm sounding like Christopher
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.600]   walking as the guy on the hook.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.400]   He says-- so he said exactly what we just said.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.640]   Nobody uses them anymore.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.920]   And yet, now they are showing up as results, huh?
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.240]   He said, when people search for Sony digital camera,
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.640]   they're not looking for links to other search engines
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.720]   that compete with Google.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.640]   I think you want product information.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.600]   You want to buy something.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.200]   So I do think they have a good argument
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.520]   whether they want to make that argument in court
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.320]   or in front of the Department of Justice,
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.960]   it might be another matter.
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.200]   He did not say whether Google would introduce a Google Maps
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.440]   app for the iPhone and iPad as everybody asks him, Schmidt,
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:09.440]   everybody.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:14.520]   We obviously-- he said, "We obviously
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:18.480]   love to serve users on different platforms with maps.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.160]   And we're excited that other people are starting to notice.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:25.920]   We've worked hard on maps for seven years."
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.320]   That's good.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:33.080]   So Sean Penn, your right Ken Chanel of American Express,
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:33.600]   was there.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:34.800]   It sounds like a good event.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.480]   I'd love to go.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.280]   Unfortunately, we've lost our in at Google, Karen Wickreese,
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.600]   now at Twitter.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.680]   But she's in in at Twitter, which is good.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.760]   Yeah, that's a good in.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.680]   That's a good in.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.680]   There were some leaked screenshots of the new Google Maps
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.880]   app for us.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.080]   Shall I show them?
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.040]   Yeah, let's look at them.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.040]   I mean, they're there.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:59.640]   This is from BenGuild.com.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.480]   They're pretty blurry.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:06.320]   He's a coder and a mobile designer.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.480]   They're really blurry.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.640]   They're really blurry.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.240]   But you can see that's an iPhone, right?
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.720]   You recognize that in the upper.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:12.240]   I don't know.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.240]   Yeah, that's clearly an iPhone.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.200]   There's LTE.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.680]   And then he says, "Get excited."
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.440]   That's all he says.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.440]   So that's surprising.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:19.960]   Whatever.
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.080]   You understand the load app.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.400]   And it will be optimized for the iPhone 5.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:28.120]   And hopefully Apple won't not approve it.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.160]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.200]   There's no way they're not approving that.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.640]   Yeah, after the last flap, what they didn't approve.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.520]   Which Google app was it?
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:35.920]   Yeah, they did.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.400]   It was Google Voice.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.240]   They got a letter from a senator.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.240]   Right.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.960]   You don't want to mess with them.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.200]   DuckGo.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.840]   How's your DuckDuckGo experiment?
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.840]   Go, go, go.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.840]   Good.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:50.840]   I'm still using it.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.840]   I don't really think about it.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.880]   I changed my search shortcut and I still use it.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:57.440]   There are times when I have to switch over to Google if it doesn't find something.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:00.080]   And I obviously use Google for news and images and maps.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.080]   But yeah, I'm still using DuckDuckGo.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.520]   I got a thing for the underdog.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:10.360]   And I actually think it's just interesting to see what another search engine can do.
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.240]   Well, they're talking about the filter bubble.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:16.440]   They did a study with some 131 volunteers and asked them to search for three terms.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.520]   Abortion, gun control, and Obama.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.880]   And then compare the results.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.640]   They made a video out of a talking event.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:24.640]   You like your history.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.640]   The video is pretty good.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.640]   Filter bubble.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:28.640]   So it's interesting.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.640]   I mean, that's an interesting way to compete, right?
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:32.200]   Yeah, I mean, right.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.760]   They're saying, hey, you know what?
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.560]   Google's not giving everybody the same results.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.200]   You're only seeing the stuff that you want to see.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.200]   Right.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.200]   Not the stuff they're actually looking for.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.120]   I know that Jeff doesn't like this filter bubble.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:43.760]   I knew you would have something to say.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:49.840]   Even when in the same country and when signed out of Google, you get different results.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.840]   When you use Google applications, they collect your personal information.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.840]   Oh, come on.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:54.840]   All right.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.840]   History.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:58.840]   It's a bad Google collecting your personal information.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:51:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.840]   It's called relevance.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:01.840]   I don't want.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:07.360]   Listen, I drive down the interstate and I see the same billboard everybody else sees.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.360]   That's not good.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.360]   I don't want that.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.600]   I don't want the same three channels that everybody else has on TV.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:17.560]   I love the idea that we now get things that are tailored to us and our needs.
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:19.280]   I'm not part of a mass.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.280]   I don't think it's a wonderful part of America to be treated as a mass.
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:23.840]   It's not the natural state of being.
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:31.520]   It's a temporary state of being that only existed from 1950 on, 1955 on till about 1996.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:36.080]   It lasted for 40 years during the age of television and mass media.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:41.560]   So I argue with the idea that getting the same thing everybody else gets is a good idea.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.560]   Good thing.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:47.000]   In the in the old days, the fuller brush salesman would come to your home, say is the lady of
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.480]   the house at home and a talk about your needs.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:52.480]   That's right.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:56.400]   Give you a brush to the general store over that good tracker barrel they knew that you
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.960]   initial report liked your salad without bugs.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.640]   Hey, they're tracking me again.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.640]   That does.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.640]   Go ahead, Jean.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:04.640]   Comies.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.640]   Go ahead.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:09.240]   I think it's important to question this, especially in this political season.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:12.440]   I mean, it was really interesting to me to see the people that I follow.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.680]   I think I like to think of myself as someone who makes an effort to follow people with
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:21.320]   different views, to see all of my people say the things that I thought about the debates
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.320]   this week.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:28.680]   So if the guy in San Francisco searches for Obama and gets the LA Times as a top result
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:33.680]   and the guy in Texas searches for Obama and gets Fox News as a top result, that seems
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.600]   that doesn't feel good to me.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:37.080]   I don't love that idea.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.560]   Because it's habit, Gina.
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:44.840]   It's the way what we were used to and what mass media my colleagues said was the right
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.600]   and proper way to do it.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.600]   Right.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:50.240]   Was to everyone should get this one thing.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.240]   Right.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.240]   I think what you have to do is break out of that and then you're right.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:54.240]   That it can be better bad.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.240]   Absolutely.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:58.680]   But I think that just because it's the way we used to do it doesn't make it right.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:02.040]   Jay Ross was at a really interesting meeting this morning at Digital First Media with
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:07.240]   Jay Rosen, who was her with Emily Beller on Board of Advisors.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.240]   What a team.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.240]   I like you.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:13.040]   We still want to do a media show with you and Emily and Jay too.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.040]   Wonderful.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.040]   Wonderful.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:18.960]   So anyway, the journalists ask about the old objectivity thing.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:25.120]   And Jay said that in the way only Jay can, that he has thousands of people on Twitter
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:27.800]   who are conservatives who don't like what he say, but they follow him.
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:28.800]   And I said, right.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.800]   Maybe you think about it.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:34.560]   If everybody was in an echo chamber, then no one would ever argue with me and plenty
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.560]   do.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:36.560]   Right.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:40.200]   So people do seek out other opinions and seek out other views.
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:44.600]   And you know, I think that there's a new app I was going to mention later, but I mentioned
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:50.640]   now called Circa that just started some Ben who of cheeseburger David Cone, who's a really,
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:54.880]   really bright young news guy and some other members of the team started this one.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:58.400]   And it's the beginning of it right now at CIR.ca.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.440]   But it will start to get you through assets and paths of news.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:06.320]   So just, just this level of alone, Gina, if you come into a story and you read it every
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:09.960]   day, the fifth day you come into the story, it's not going to give you the same background
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.640]   paragraphs because it knows you already know it.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:14.800]   So it's going to give you a more expert view.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:19.480]   So if you look at it that way, right, is that a, is that a filter bubble problem?
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.960]   Uh, no, it obviously reduces a redundancy in my life.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:23.960]   No, it's different.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:24.960]   Oh, yes, it is.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:25.960]   That's it.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:26.960]   That's it.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:27.960]   Right.
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.320]   And I think it's going to be an irrelevance in my life, right?
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:34.440]   And this has been put in just political terms of, oh, you're only going to see liberal
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:39.240]   things, Jeff, because you're a liberal, uh, you know, and, and, and, and Eli in his argument,
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:45.080]   and I think he made it on the show, uh, was that, uh, he blamed Facebook for not showing
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:47.560]   him conservatives, but of course the reason they didn't show him conservatives is because
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.680]   he never looked at the conservatives in his list.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.200]   So it was his fault.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.160]   He's the one who showed his way.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:57.400]   Should, should Facebook or Twitter or Google force you to see stuff?
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.400]   You don't want to see because it's good for you or, or, right.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.400]   That's the old editor's view of the world.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.400]   I'm sorry, Gina.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.720]   I'm now, you raise a simple objection.
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.120]   Now I'm, I'm, no, no, that's, that's okay.
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.360]   I go, go ahead.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:13.720]   I know I, I, I hear you saying, I hear you saying, I had people tell me that they, you
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.640]   know, unfollowed me on Twitter because they didn't agree with my political views, which
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:17.640]   I just think is dumb.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:21.040]   I mean, what, why, you know, I think it's important to listen to other people's eye relatives
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:23.680]   on Facebook who I couldn't disagree with more.
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:27.800]   And it's very tense around this time of year.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.520]   But I, but it's important to hear the other point of view.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:35.200]   And I agree that, you know, an app like circa, and I actually haven't tried it out yet, but
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.800]   I like the idea that it would know, I already know this.
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:38.800]   So it's good.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.840]   I'm going to show you information that you, you know, that you don't, that you haven't
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:42.840]   read already.
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:43.840]   That makes sense.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.120]   I don't think that collecting personal, you know, personalized search results is a bad
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:52.240]   idea, but I don't love the idea that people who don't understand how it works.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:56.560]   So I still that, that example in the Dr. Dov video of, you know, the Fox news versus the
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:00.200]   LA Times, depending on, you know, where you're located and what other things you've looked
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.200]   at.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.800]   It's still the thing about that, that, that, that I don't like.
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:04.800]   Right.
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:05.800]   Right.
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:06.800]   Right.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:07.800]   Stay right there for a second.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:08.800]   Right.
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:15.120]   So is that a problem of principle about personalized search results or is it a problem of execution
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.680]   about how it's done?
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.680]   I mean, yeah, that could be.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   Yes.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:23.920]   I mean, I think is that it's the responsibility of Google to give you everything at once.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:26.920]   I would disagree with that, but I think that I would say it a little bit differently and
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:32.560]   say that I would value a search engine that would expose me to, would be the opposite
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.680]   of what we're talking about that we expose me to some of the things that I'm not otherwise
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.680]   exposed to, not the mass of what everybody has.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:39.880]   That's not valuable to me.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:40.880]   Right.
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:44.480]   If it recognizes that, okay, Jarvis, you've seen this again and again and again and again,
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:48.120]   you've never looked at this story from the telegraphs view in London.
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:52.480]   And so we're going to pop that in for you so that we expose you to that and choose to.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:55.040]   So it's the opposite of giving you what you expect to give you sometimes what you don't
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.040]   expect.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.480]   I could go for that, but that's not that go.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.280]   That's not the idea of what Eli says.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.400]   We all have to have the same thing.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.400]   I don't want that.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.400]   Right.
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:04.400]   Right.
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.400]   Hmm.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:15.160]   But well, I'm not, but I also agree with you in the sense that I just don't think that
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:19.760]   it's Google's job to feed us our vegetables.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:23.000]   Ah, yeah.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.800]   So the issue of execution, you don't feel like it's their job to say, well, you know,
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.400]   we're going to throw in a couple of conservative.
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:33.240]   They should give you what you want anymore than you should go to Denny's order, the grand
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:35.880]   slam breakfast and they put a piece of broccoli on the plate.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:37.880]   That's not what you ordered.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:38.880]   Right.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.880]   Might be better for you.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:43.480]   Go go duck would do the opposite.
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:44.480]   It would be personalized.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:48.440]   It would listen to what you do, but it would choose instead just throw throw you sources
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:51.240]   you were not asking.
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:54.200]   That would be the opposite way to execute on duck.go.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:55.880]   But it's an interesting problem.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:57.280]   Maybe you could fuzz it, Gina.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.480]   You could do some fuzzy logic or no, I know.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:06.080]   Maybe you do a box on the right that says, by the way, you want the opposing viewpoint?
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.080]   Look at this.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.080]   Right.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.080]   Poison.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:12.120]   Well, you guys had Clay Johnson who wrote the information on triangulation and he talked
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:16.000]   about it when he worked on the Dean campaign, the Howard Dean campaign, they were just convinced
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.400]   that he was going to win.
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:18.720]   It was so clear and obvious to them.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:22.560]   They were going to win because they were all surrounded by people.
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:26.840]   I see that kind of, I think all the people who are voting on the team.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.680]   I live in Northern California.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:32.040]   I can't understand how Obama could possibly even not be.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.040]   It couldn't be close.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.040]   Exactly.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.440]   And I'm sure if I live somewhere else, that would be pretty obvious.
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:37.440]   Pretty obvious.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:45.480]   And that concerns me, is not having a realistic view, a broader perspective view on what's actually
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:46.480]   going on.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:47.480]   I agree with you.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.680]   I just, whose responsibility is that?
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:51.000]   On principle, but disagree, I think, on the execution.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.840]   I don't think the DuckDuckGo is a solution.
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:55.200]   It's like the argument about serendipity.
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:57.280]   There's two arguments about serendipity that I hear.
[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:59.760]   One is that editors give it to you because they're in control of that.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.760]   They know what you don't know and they'll give it to you.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.760]   I think that's wrong.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.600]   The other one was that serendipity is randomness.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:08.520]   And as I said on the show before, I think serendipity is unexpected relevance.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.120]   So somebody with similar interest to you found something interesting to them that you may
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.120]   not have found.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.120]   They find it for you.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:18.840]   That's an exposure to something and a system of humanity works okay with that.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.840]   Twitter works pretty well.
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:20.840]   It gives us serendipity.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.680]   I don't want irrelevant.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.360]   I don't want randomness.
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:27.720]   I don't want editors controlling what we all see and call it serendipity.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:32.760]   I want some soup saw of knowledge about me and what I know and don't know.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:36.840]   And I think that we can far, far better execute on that problem.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:42.760]   And then we would agree about the principle and maybe we could find a new ground of execution.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:48.200]   That's probably why of the two choices I proposed, which is a box of opposing viewpoints
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.400]   or just some random fuzzing.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:55.880]   Random fuzzing is better because the truth is it's an illusion that this opposing viewpoints
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.800]   is really giving you the other.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.800]   It's not a coin.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.840]   There's a huge spectrum of viewpoints.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.640]   Here's the danger.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.000]   It's the danger we see in media.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.720]   It is curated even if it pretends not to be.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.560]   If you look at global warming in media, you see too many stories that say, well, but other
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:18.640]   sides say when it's 99.99% of scientists to 0.1% of crackpots.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.360]   And by putting them both in the same story with the same length, it gives you a false
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.360]   equivalency.
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.080]   There's a danger in that too.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.080]   That's true.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:30.840]   Well, and let's say you searched for Obama and you got a box that said, what about Romney,
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:33.080]   but what about the libertarian candidate?
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.680]   What about Roseanne Barr who happens to be running in the state of California on the
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.240]   peace and freedom party?
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.480]   What I don't know if you've got Roseanne Barr on your ballot, but I was shocked.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.480]   Shocked.
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:45.640]   Roseanne imitation Leon.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:46.640]   I can't.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.440]   I'm grabbing my crotch right now, but you can't see it.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.440]   Gina has it on her ballot.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.440]   I don't know if you do, Jeff.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.440]   Look on your ballot.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.760]   No, I don't.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.240]   Roseanne Barr is running for president.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.240]   Wow.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.240]   She didn't like me.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.240]   Wow.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.520]   That's a good bumper sticker.
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.040]   Roseanne Barr is on my ballot.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:12.240]   I'm not a means, but that's the point is that you can't it's anything.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.960]   The notion of objectivity is artificial.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.600]   So serendipity is the right word.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.600]   Right.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.600]   So Google is trying to give you relevance.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.160]   A different than certain right there.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.640]   That's what their goal is.
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:24.640]   That's all they need to do.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.400]   That's their job, but that's what they say they want.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.400]   That's what you're getting there.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.920]   That's duck duck goes an alternative.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.720]   I would want for someone to play with something else, you know, push Google and show different
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.760]   kinds of quality in a different way.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:45.160]   I think there's definitely a lot of room I think here for for improvement and and I
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:48.640]   think this is fascinating really discussion of who decides who decides.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.640]   Who decides.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.640]   Yeah, you're you're vegetables.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:51.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.640]   Well, it's not editors, right?
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:00.360]   They're the broccoli chefs and they believe and I just heard this with a couple of editors
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.360]   just the other day.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.360]   We tell you what's important.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.040]   No, not so much.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.040]   I did it.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.680]   I did a panel Monday night at Museum of Modern Art.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.520]   How is this for classy?
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.520]   Swanky.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.000]   Yeah, really is.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.360]   I was boy was I out of my league.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:22.440]   Paula Antonelli who's one of the curators there and the head of R&D had a panel about
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.840]   curation.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:24.840]   I've talked about cure.
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.480]   I've over talked about curation and journalism.
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:30.480]   It's overused now, but she wanted and I wanted to do a panel with her a couple years ago.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.480]   I never got around to it.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.480]   My God, she did it.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:40.840]   She had the head curator of paintings and sculpture at MoMA with Maria Popova, a blogger
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.160]   who curates the web with Tor.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.160]   What's his name?
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:51.320]   He's a he's a big hip up music producer and me.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.080]   He posed your in the group.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.640]   The discussions you get to and things like that is well, if you have a curator, what
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.640]   is that curator doing?
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.000]   Is that curator giving you authority?
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.480]   Is that curator a gatekeeper?
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.320]   Is that curator opening things up or closing things down for you?
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:10.440]   That's the problem with editors thought that they could control you view of the world.
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:13.240]   I celebrate that being gone.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.560]   Now, just something just for you is too far the other way.
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:21.240]   There's some kind of middle ground and I think Google would argue they could do it algorithmically
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.240]   to some rule.
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:28.040]   Dr. Go says they get a right by getting rid of the algorithms.
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.080]   I completely agree with throwing out the curator or the editor, but the promise of the web and
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.240]   a page rank and of search results is that you're going to get the results which reflect
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.600]   what people are writing about and saying online.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:42.320]   The mass, the aggregate becomes the editor.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:47.160]   That idea I really like because no one is deciding for everybody, but everybody is deciding
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.160]   for everybody.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.000]   So, you're not going to get the filter bubble too, then conventional wisdom becomes the
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   truth.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   That's true.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.920]   Everything wasn't that what the web could do for a while and Google constantly tries to
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:02.760]   get to say, "Okay, that was fun, but we want to give you what's relevant to you.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.920]   We want to know where you are, so we give you relevant results."
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:09.520]   Circa says, "We want to know what you've already seen, so we'll give you relevant results."
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:12.600]   It's not a whole web picks it.
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:18.480]   Indeed, if the whole web, that's what, that's deals all the time is he's changing it to
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.720]   get rid of the draws.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.720]   So it's manipulating what's on.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:26.320]   What Google's really trying to do, I think, is to figure out what you want and give you
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.320]   that.
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:28.320]   True it, your intent.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:31.160]   They're an advertising company.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.160]   Right.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.560]   But that's also better search results.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.960]   If I search for pizza, I don't want to find pizza in Brooklyn or San Diego, I want to find
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.560]   pizza in Petaluma.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.800]   So what's wrong with it trying to do it?
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.720]   See, when we take politics out of it and we say something like pizza, then it makes
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:47.720]   sense.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.720]   Right, it makes a lot of sense.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.720]   Absolutely.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.720]   Right.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.560]   So I think it makes a lot more sense in some areas than others.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:56.760]   The politics though issue is, you know, it's-
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:00.200]   I just don't think it's up to goo- I think it's- if you say, "Well, Google's job is
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.120]   to do it what I'm looking for.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.000]   It is to do that in every realm."
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.440]   And it's not Google's job to say, "Oh, and by the way, you really ought to consider something
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.440]   else."
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:15.960]   And how would you feel if you- I mean, I think you- I think what we're saying as liberals
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:19.880]   is what we really ought to get those right-winners to see something besides Fox News.
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.360]   But how about the other shoe around the other foot?
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.360]   Right.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:27.600]   And every time you search for, you know, Obama, you got Fox News.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.000]   You wouldn't want that.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   Right.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   Right.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.760]   So I think it really- I think it's a- I think really all you can ask Google to do is intuit
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.680]   what you want and give it to you.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:41.720]   And yes, we should all eat our vegetables and we should read other sources.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:45.480]   And I agree with Jeff that we're- that- that the some parts of the web work that way anyway.
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:48.560]   I mean, you can't go on Twitter without seeing opposing viewpoints.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.960]   I don't care how much you cultivate your feeds.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.720]   That's true.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:56.080]   I was- I had such a great time watching the- the Twitter during the debate.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.080]   Man, it was that screwing by.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.080]   Yes.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.080]   Just flying by.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.080]   Just flying by.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.080]   It was great.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.080]   It was like a chat room on a big day.
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.080]   It was- Mm-hmm.
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.080]   A chat room on caffeine.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.080]   What were you writing?
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:13.440]   So, Genev, if you- if you, Genev, come in and you search for Java, you're not a- a barista
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:14.440]   so you don't want coffee.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.440]   And those are you.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.440]   Right.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.520]   But technology so you don't want Java for dummies, right?
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.400]   You want people to know to give you good sources.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:26.200]   However you define that, things that you're likely to click on.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.800]   That's a pretty straightforward rule set.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.800]   Absolutely.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:30.800]   Around.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.800]   When it works, well, it's great.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:36.040]   Well, when I called Comcast with my Google voice number, which has an area code in Baltimore,
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:44.520]   they gave me the Baltimore Comcast affiliate and I couldn't get any help.
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.240]   Because they knew I was in Baltimore even though I'm not.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.640]   So when it works, it's good.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.360]   When it doesn't work, it's not so good.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.360]   Right.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:55.880]   But I mean, if I were to search for Romney's record on equal pay for women, I would probably
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:00.240]   get the page on the RoccoBama.com that explains, you know, so-
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.240]   I'm so sorry.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:04.240]   I couldn't resist.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:07.240]   There's binders full of women.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:09.200]   There's binders full of women.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:12.560]   So thin in my maiden form binder.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.720]   I wasn't going to go there.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:21.040]   Why don't we don't have to get political?
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.160]   Well, everybody knows I'm a loser.
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:30.320]   One of them lefty liberal from Northern California types.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:34.120]   Google however, and this will drive other people crazy.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:39.200]   If you turn it on, you can search your Gmail across mail contacts, Google Drive documents
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:40.400]   and calendar appointments.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:43.640]   You mean Google can see all that stuff?
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.440]   Of course they can, you knit with.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.440]   Well, that's-
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.000]   This is the privacy policy consolidation, right?
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   Yeah, finally.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.640]   This is what we said, hey, you know, there's one singular privacy policy and it applies
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.160]   to all the different products and they can be integrated.
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:01.560]   This is Google just wanted to be the one search box to all your personal stuff and the web.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.560]   And you do have to opt in.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.960]   In fact, I don't know if this is your tip.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.960]   Gee, no, I'm sorry.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:06.960]   No, it's not my tip.
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:07.960]   I think it's an experiment.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:08.960]   I think you have to-
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.160]   You join the field trial, they say.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:11.160]   Or the field trial.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.160]   So it's Google.com/experimental/gmailfieldtrial.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:21.800]   27 nations sent a letter to Google demanding they change their privacy policy and separate,
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:26.960]   which would then not enable this functionality, which we want.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.960]   But-
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:29.960]   That's where the-
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.760]   From I won't say it.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.160]   The EU did win the peace prize.
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:39.760]   I don't understand how that can happen, but okay.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:47.200]   Yeah, they sent four months to amend your privacy policy or face disciplinary action
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.800]   at a national level.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:53.240]   To the woodshed with you, Google.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:56.040]   Sometimes I just despair.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.920]   Yes.
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:00.240]   Let's see.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.240]   What else?
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:06.040]   Jelly Bean is coming to the Samsung Galaxy S3 in the next few months.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.560]   Geez, I'm glad I got a Galaxy now.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.640]   Next few months.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:15.840]   Poland has it now.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:16.840]   And why it takes a long time to-
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:19.640]   Should we talk about violent acres?
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:23.520]   Have you talked to Deathlyo on your other shows or-
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.520]   You know what?
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.520]   We have not.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.120]   This is the first time we've brought it up.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:31.720]   I probably will bring it up on Twitch, but I've been saving it just for you.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.720]   Wow.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.040]   And the story is actually in process.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.360]   It's breaking because Reddit just defended him.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.360]   Yep.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.360]   Well, right.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.480]   They defended his right to- Free speech.
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.480]   Free speech.
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:46.560]   Actually, that was a leaked memo, so I don't know.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:51.560]   Well, it was a leaked discussion on a forum from the current head of Reddit.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.960]   But yeah, two points of principle coming out in their view.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.520]   I think there's a third.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.320]   The first is that he had a right to anonymity.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:02.320]   They don't like Doxy and they don't like outing anybody who is anonymous.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.320]   One.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:08.000]   Two, however, Reddit was wrong in their view to block links to Google.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.160]   Hey, you want free speech?
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.160]   You don't want- I mean, Gawker.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.800]   You don't want Gawker's free speech.
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.080]   I would say there's a third question going on here, which people are really talking about.
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:18.800]   Is that Reddit has to decide what its culture really is?
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.040]   Yes, there's free speech.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:24.680]   It has their anonymity, but a government should respect that.
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:28.120]   But a private entity can decide whether it has standards or not.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:31.240]   And its censorship for the New York Times not to put up pornography.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:34.120]   The New York Times is going to say, "We put up what we choose to put up in our space."
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.560]   And that's why I put up what I want to put up in my blog.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.440]   I don't put up everything.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.240]   No one should force me to put up everything.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:42.960]   And so I understand-
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.960]   Maybe I can give some background before we get to the-
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.200]   Yeah, should we describe what happened?
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.680]   So there's a guy, I'm not going to say his name.
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:54.160]   He was outed five days ago on Gawker.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:12:03.760]   He was a pretty virulent troll on Gawker who was both celebrated on Reddit by a lot of people.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:10.040]   Was given some power, it looks like, by Reddit.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:20.920]   But was creating sub-redits about sexy pictures of underage girls, creep shots, for instance.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:25.600]   There's women unaware that their photographs have been taken.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.720]   Some pretty creepy pornographic-
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:28.720]   Terrace stuff.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.320]   --picks of dead kids, for instance.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:34.880]   Yeah, pictures of dead teenage girls.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.720]   And so Gawker revealed who he was.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:42.960]   He lost his job as a result.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:47.000]   His wife said, "Oh, it's okay."
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   I don't-
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   That's not-
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.280]   He's got an interview on CNN, I think, tomorrow.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.920]   So the guy's a creep.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.080]   At least from what I read.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.560]   I mean, and again, that was Gawker, so who knows.
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.560]   But the guy's a creep.
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:09.600]   You don't hear it all, but by what he did on Reddit, it read out the creep meter.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.600]   I mean, it's pretty horrible.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:16.440]   But then there's more to it because it sounds like sometimes he was setting up these sub-redits
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:19.040]   to kind of move traffic.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:23.440]   He was being used by Reddit to kind of control the creep factor on Reddit.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:27.120]   Now, we've got to point out Reddit's own by Conde Nast.
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.480]   My old boss is at Full disclosure.
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.960]   I still work with him.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:35.000]   And I mean, this is a very prestigious mainstream media outfit here.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.240]   Now they've left Reddit pretty much alone.
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:41.640]   And Reddit just hosted an AMA with President Obama.
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:47.280]   I mean, Reddit has had some seriously mainstream events happen on it.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:52.040]   He, Alexis Sohanian, the co-founder of Reddit, is now running a bus tour across the middle
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:55.440]   of America to defend the internet and speech, all of which are wonderful things.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:58.000]   He's running for my old job, president of the internet.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.680]   Yeah, Reddit has done some amazing things.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.680]   I love Reddit.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.960]   I didn't really know much about this.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.960]   See me underbelly.
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.960]   It sounds worse than 4chan.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:08.960]   It's pretty awful.
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:16.120]   And Reddit's core value is free speech that people can say that protected speech that people
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.880]   can say, as long as it's not illegal.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:25.640]   So he would set up this subreddit jailbait, which was pictures of underage girls in revealing
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.880]   outfits, bikinis, or whatever.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.600]   These are pictures that he found on Facebook.
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.760]   But if there was actual child pornography, explicit child pornography, illegal child pornography,
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.680]   he would help moderators take that down.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.600]   So he had this kind of uneasy relationship with Reddit where he would just toe the line,
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.160]   just push the envelope as much as possible.
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:47.680]   Keep it legal, but just horrible, hateful content.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:51.080]   He told Gawker, I just like riling up people in my spare time.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.080]   He's a classic troll.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.080]   He's a classic troll.
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.080]   He's a definition of a troll.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.080]   A definition of a troll.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.080]   Yes.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:02.720]   And if you compare that once he was outed to his blog and his Twitter feed, it's the
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.720]   fraud of this.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:06.080]   Oh, I'm Mr. Nice Guy Nextdoor Neighbor and blah, blah, blah.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.920]   It was the anonymity that provided the cloak for his true trollishness to come out.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.680]   But what do you do about this?
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:18.040]   I mean, if he committed illegal acts, that's different, but it sounds like he skirted
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.040]   illegality.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.040]   Right.
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:23.040]   So I don't think the government should go after him, but I think Reddit has to decide
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:24.240]   whether it has standards.
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.240]   Yes.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:27.720]   Right now, the only standard is everything.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:28.720]   And that's a right to do.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:32.000]   They can do that, but then I will judge Reddit accordingly.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.440]   And I will say that it is a haven for trolls and scum buckets, right?
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.440]   Right.
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.440]   Right.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:39.440]   Go ahead.
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:44.720]   And so, and so justice, yes, he had a right to try to use his anonymity, but so did a
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:49.440]   reporter, even an overwritten over a little story, have the right to come along and say,
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:53.120]   well, I'm going to tell you who this schmuck is and let everyone decide what they think
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.120]   of him.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:59.320]   There's no, there's no, you know, the problem here is we, we have to protect speech.
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:03.400]   We have to protect anonymity as a protection of speech for people who are vulnerable, for
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.920]   whistleblowers, for people who live in oppressive regimes.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.480]   That's all important.
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.760]   But just because anonymity exists and free speech exists doesn't mean that you are freed
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:18.000]   from responsibility for our reaction to your speech.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.040]   So I can stand on the street corner and say homophobic or racist things, I'm allowed to
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:23.040]   do that in America.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.920]   God bless America, but you can walk by and you can call me a schmuck for doing so and
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.240]   well, you should.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.720]   That's what this is about to me.
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:33.680]   So he should be allowed to continue to do what he's doing.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:41.000]   No, I think that Reddit has to define its own standards of civility and it has.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.640]   And I don't very much like those standards of civility.
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:44.640]   And that's a problem.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.840]   So Reddit does wonderful things.
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.480]   It's a platform to do great things.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:50.240]   It doesn't want to be in the position of censoring.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:54.440]   So it makes the standard simply illegality.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:57.840]   So if you come along and that's Reddit's choice, that's Reddit's choice.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:02.280]   But so, so if they came on and they had, maybe they already do, I don't know, but a horribly
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:08.440]   homophobic, legal, but awful, homophobic, screaming, bad words about people, awful
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:15.800]   things, outing people who don't want to be outed, making fun of them.
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:19.720]   Sub Reddit, let's say if that exists, they can.
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.800]   But what do I think of Reddit as a result?
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:26.000]   I think that it's not terribly responsible.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.560]   And maybe it's the old fart in me coming out.
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.560]   June, what do you think?
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.520]   No, I completely agree.
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:34.640]   I mean, one of these sub-readits was pictures of men beating women, right?
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:41.720]   So you have to look at Reddit and say, Reddit's decided that it's more important for them
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:49.680]   to protect a 38-year-old man's anonymity rather than protect 16 to 19-year-old girls
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:54.080]   who posted a picture of themselves in a bikini on their Facebook page to put those photos
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:56.640]   in a totally hyper-sexualized context.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:02.040]   Sure, he has the right to do that and Reddit has the right to protect his right to do that.
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:07.360]   But that's a choice that Reddit made about the way that they're going to run their community.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.800]   Honestly, I have a totally different view now.
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.280]   I mean, is that a community that I wouldn't be a part of?
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.560]   Not really.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.240]   And that's a choice that they made.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.960]   This isn't a legal issue.
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:17.960]   It's not legal free speech.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.560]   Like, this is Reddit is creating this community.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:22.000]   They're creating this space and they're deciding what's important to them, what are their
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:30.760]   values and their values are free speech over this kind of just absolutely odious content.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:34.400]   That's their right to do that, but it's up to everyone else to decide whether or not
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.240]   what they think about that.
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:37.360]   And I mean, go for outing him.
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:41.560]   I mean, Reddit is, you know, Redditors are outraged that this guy got docked, you know,
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.520]   that he got outed and how dare galker.
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.560]   But galker, that was a journalistic...
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.560]   Yeah.
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:51.120]   You know, their rules don't extend to other communities on the internet.
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.440]   Galker can do whatever they want.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.440]   Reddit can do what they want.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.440]   Galker can do what they want.
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:55.440]   What they want.
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.120]   He didn't do much to protect his identity, by the way.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.120]   No, he did not.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:00.800]   There are pictures of him at Reddit meetups.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:05.360]   It wasn't that hard for someone to track him down, but it was such an enormous betrayal
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:09.280]   to the Reddit community because this is, you know, anonymity is so, you know, important
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.240]   there and that's a fine within the Reddit community.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.880]   But, you know, this is...
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:18.720]   So any forum and Reddit is basically a forum and I've run forums has a terms of services
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.500]   and has the right to post them and make their own decisions.
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:25.800]   On all the forums I've ever owned or run, we've banned certain kinds of behavior, including
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:29.080]   all of that and moderated it quite heavily.
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:30.080]   There's no...
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.080]   I mean...
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:32.080]   Yeah, I know...
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:37.200]   What has Reddit or Conde Nast responded to this in any way publicly?
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:43.160]   I suppose I should have disclosed my old boss, you know, emailed me about it like a year
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:47.040]   ago kind of asking my advice and I don't even know what I said back because it's a
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.040]   very tough thing.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:49.040]   I don't even freeze speech.
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.040]   I believe in anonymity.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.120]   I understand the openness of a platform.
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:56.520]   I get all that and I don't think that at the time I understood where the boundaries are.
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:57.800]   What this whole episode is done.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.640]   I mean, it's just like when...
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.640]   What's his name's...
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:06.720]   The device has all got hacked and we saw aha, somebody pushed it too far and we know
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.720]   where it goes and now we have a discussion about it.
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:12.920]   The discussion is valuable, too bad somebody got hurt in the process, but the discussion
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:13.920]   is good.
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:14.920]   I think it's where we are right now.
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.160]   I didn't know where my lines were now.
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:23.080]   I think my stance is what Gina just said is that, "Fine, they can do what they want.
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:24.080]   No one should stop them.
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.080]   The government should stop them.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.480]   No one else should stop them as long as it's legal.
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:27.480]   That's the whole point.
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:33.680]   Legal is legal is legal, but we will now judge Reddit and not just its platform, but also
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:39.280]   very importantly its members and its community on the base of the company they keep and what
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.760]   they do.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:41.760]   Right?
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:46.600]   If you're Reddit and the value you have is your platform and the openness which is absolutely
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:50.520]   true in which God bless, cutting ass, they have enabled.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:54.560]   It's a very unmedia thing to do what they did with Reddit, to allow it to be free, to
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:55.800]   allow it to be that.
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.640]   The problem I have here is not the platform.
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:59.720]   It's not the technology at all.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:01.320]   It's not the ownership at all.
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:04.640]   It's not the management except for what they did with Gawker links which I think is important
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.680]   and stupid and they even know that.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:13.360]   The judgment here is of the users atop the platform, the community that has taken over
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:17.120]   Reddit that has done wonderful things with it in some ways, but then tolerates and chooses
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:20.840]   not just to tolerate, but to protect this behavior.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:23.440]   Okay, go have your party somewhere else.
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:24.440]   Thanks.
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.000]   I'll have my beer over here.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   Yep.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000]   Absolutely.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.160]   It's all about community values.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.240]   So we should just stop using Reddit.
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:36.960]   Well, I mean, that would sound like a boycott and I'm not saying that.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.880]   If something neat comes up on Reddit, I will not listen to it.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.880]   Okay.
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.360]   But it's what I say on my comments.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.880]   Well, let me put it this way.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:48.120]   Many of our shows use subreddits.
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:52.720]   So is that in, are we now guilt by association?
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.520]   Oh, I don't.
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:57.360]   Yeah, it's hard to say, right?
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.560]   Because Reddit's a big community.
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.800]   There's lots of Redditors.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:03.800]   So it's tough.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:05.320]   I'm not a huge Redditor.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:09.920]   If I was, I would definitely question whether or not those values reflected my values, whether
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:14.560]   or not I felt comfortable being in a community where pictures of women being violently beaten,
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.080]   like where that's okay.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.880]   I wouldn't feel safe in a place like that.
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:20.600]   And I actually, I wouldn't want to do a full on boycott.
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.800]   I'm going to run into Reddit links.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:24.760]   Reddit has done some amazing things as we said earlier.
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.840]   But I don't know, Leo.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:28.760]   I don't know if you should move subreddits.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.200]   What shows do you use Reddit to?
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.000]   To use it as it heavily.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.080]   But many of the other shows do.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.360]   We were talking about using subreddit for twig.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:42.840]   I mean, we had, we've already grabbed all of the, of all of the subreddit locations.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.600]   So do you be well, I'm going to slow on that.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.440]   I can tell you that right now.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:52.680]   What would you, well, but that's, that's a very good, that's a very good case in point,
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:53.680]   right?
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:54.680]   We reckon we admire the technology.
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.280]   We admire the openness.
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.000]   We now see this, right?
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   I think there's two things here.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:06.360]   I think one is that if you were a Reddit user, you know, there's no law within Reddit that
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:10.920]   says that the troll protectors have to win the day, right?
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:15.480]   If it is truly a community, then members of the community can stand up and say, whoa,
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.720]   no, you're about that.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:22.880]   We're going to, we're going to change the culture of Reddit based on this, this, this
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.880]   case.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.200]   And we're going to learn from that.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.520]   It's not what happened, however, it was quite the opposite.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:32.560]   You know, a lot of the Reddit communities was upset that he was doxed.
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.560]   Right, precisely.
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:37.600]   And banned, you know, links to Gawker, et cetera.
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.200]   But is that a statement of what the community is?
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.200]   Not necessarily.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.120]   People can speak up.
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:49.200]   So there's, there's kind of a, um, no one can see in the other way that shuts down those
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:51.160]   voices who might say otherwise.
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.480]   So I'm not a Redditor.
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:56.320]   So I'm just going to stand back and say, uh, as I say to my people in the comments of my
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:59.960]   blog, if you're anonymous, I will pay less attention to what you say.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:00.960]   You're free to be anonymous.
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:01.960]   You can say it.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:05.120]   You might have a good reason to be anonymous, but just know I have the balls to say what
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:06.120]   I say under my name.
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:08.120]   If you don't, I'm going to judge you less.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:09.480]   I'm going to pay less attention to you.
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:12.120]   People don't like that, but I'm just telling you the way I judge it.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:18.120]   So now, so when, when Gawker published the headline that, see, I think Gawker kind of
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.120]   doesn't like Reddit.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:25.000]   When Gawker public, when President Obama did the AMA on Gawker, the Gawker headline was
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.920]   president answers questions on what was it racist teen photosite.
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.880]   Something like that.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.440]   Right.
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.320]   Which I thought was a kind of a joke.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.320]   Maybe not though.
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:44.280]   If Obama had known what was going on on, and, or his campaign probably had known what's
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:47.960]   going on in Reddit, it would have been very smart of them not to have anything to do with
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:48.960]   it.
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:52.320]   But someone in the chat room said, hey, Gina, you know, there are lots of pictures of horrible
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.960]   things all over the internet, but you don't not use the internet because of that.
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.560]   And I mean, Reddit is a huge community.
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:00.840]   And this is kind of the CD underbelly, the, the, the sub-readits, right?
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.880]   And do you just toss out an entire community or just write off the internet?
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:04.880]   Yeah, but you know what?
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:05.880]   It's, it's not the internet.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.480]   It's a specific site.
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:11.480]   It's a specific site that has community moderators that has leadership that had it
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:18.280]   lays out what its values are and what it can, can be done there and can't be done there.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.160]   So that's, that's why I'm judging a little more.
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:24.880]   In terms of whether or not to boycott or try to change from within, I mean, this is the
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:26.760]   question of every kind of change, right?
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:30.080]   You either, you either work from within and try to evolve or you toss the whole thing
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:33.000]   out and try to start, you know, start fresh and start anew.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.800]   I'm not an active Redditor, so it's hard for me to say I, I, you know, this is, Reddit
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.400]   has, is enabled some amazing things.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.240]   It's also enabled some really horrible things.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:44.800]   I mean, I'm sort of horrified, you know, I'm just super sensitive to this stuff now,
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:48.960]   especially because I have a three, three work week old baby girl, but it's like, I just
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:53.640]   can't, you know, I just have no tolerance for, for this, this kind of, you know, stuff.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.600]   The point you just made, I think, I think it's, I think it's a really interesting and
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:59.040]   right point.
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.240]   Isn't the difference between the internet argument and the Reddit argument is technology
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:03.240]   versus a community?
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:04.240]   Yes.
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:05.240]   Right.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.240]   We have any problem with technology, Reddit.
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:07.240]   We don't have problems with technology, the internet.
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:08.880]   We know that the internet does enable bad things.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:09.880]   That's not the issue here.
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:18.040]   The community came along and not just defended and protected this schmuck, but also then
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:22.400]   cut off the free speech of others and the right of their readers to learn both sides
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.000]   and to act on that.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.200]   And they acted dictatorial within that community.
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:27.360]   And that's, they can do that.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.360]   They can take it over.
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:29.680]   It's a kingdom.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:33.000]   But the problem we have there is not with the technology is saying that if that's the
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.600]   community you guys want to have, okay, you can have it, but not for me.
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:37.600]   Thanks.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:38.600]   And that would be a shame.
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.920]   And the community is also a reflection of its leadership.
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:45.680]   I mean, you know, there was, there was a private memo that was published that we have
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:46.680]   here in the rundown.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:52.000]   I mean, one of Reddit's kind of a good CEO, I think, says, yes, we hate this kind of
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.680]   content, but we protect this person's right to post it and also said, you know, we shouldn't
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:58.120]   ban links to Gawker.
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:00.120]   That seems, you know, that's a bad idea.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:04.240]   Although apparently moderators of different subwriters have, they can decide to ban Gawker
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:10.520]   links and the community leadership or the people who run Reddit company can't have any
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:11.520]   say about that.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.600]   And that's just the way they've decided to structure the community.
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.360]   But there is leadership in structuring the community and leading the community.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:21.120]   And the community, I think, is every community, I think, is a reflection of its founders and
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.440]   of its values and those evolve over time.
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:28.160]   But there are people at work, moderators, people in positions of power that help, you
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:33.600]   know, grow the kind of values that they want to see reflected in their community.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:38.120]   Is it like somebody asked a good question?
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:41.080]   Is the community of Reddit like the community of Facebook?
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:44.000]   Facebook, by the way, would never allow any of this.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000]   Oh, no.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.840]   I don't know.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:49.840]   It's Twitter.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.840]   Is it like Twitter?
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:55.440]   There's definitely reprehensible stuff on Twitter.
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.040]   Well, here's the argument.
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.720]   Facebook is not run by its community.
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.960]   Red book is read it is run by its community.
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:01.960]   Okay.
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:02.960]   Right.
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.560]   Again, what we're judging is the community.
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.000]   And again, I feel bad.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.640]   I don't like to throw the baby out on the bath water.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:08.640]   It does great things.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:11.360]   Most of it's wonderful.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:16.000]   But when we want to associate, right now is the question with...
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.320]   Well, I'm not going to, but we were not going to do sub-res.
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.320]   Well, we're going to bath.
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:23.320]   If the more it looks like 4chan, the less interested I am.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.640]   But we make that choice.
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:26.720]   Those choices we make all the time.
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:27.720]   And that's...
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.160]   I don't have any problem making those choices.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:32.680]   It's not even censorship or it's not even having an opinion.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:37.040]   It's just like, I'm not going to stay away from that because I don't want to get in that
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.600]   admired in that.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:43.640]   Don't me.
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:44.640]   And I do love stuff.
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:46.080]   There's plenty of good stuff on Reddit.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:49.560]   It's not a topic.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:53.600]   It's hard because as a Reddit user, and I do use Reddit a lot, there's definitely...
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:54.600]   That's OMG Chad.
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:55.600]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.760]   There's definitely a sense that...
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:58.760]   Well, this is them.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.480]   This is the other people on Reddit.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:01.480]   These are...
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:04.200]   This is a different subreddit that I've never been to, that I've never participated in.
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:05.200]   Neither.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.200]   I didn't...
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:10.880]   And, well, I mean, I did know that these things existed on Reddit.
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:15.360]   It feels very much like, oh, that one really loud, annoying kid is bringing down the whole
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.360]   class.
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:19.560]   Like, the whole class is getting punished because that one kid over there.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:25.640]   And the only reason that this gets bigger than just, oh, that those people over there
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:30.200]   being loud is because of the community running the olive Reddit.
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:33.840]   So now that loud, annoying kid is also the teacher of the class.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:34.840]   Oh boy.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.640]   And that's a problem.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.640]   Oh boy.
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:41.880]   And I'll tell you, once communities start going in one direction, it's very hard to
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:46.280]   ch- there's a lot of momentum behind it.
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:47.280]   Right.
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.280]   Well...
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:49.280]   Right.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:50.280]   This guy is not representative of Reddit.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.280]   Do you understand that?
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.280]   Or not representative of Reddit.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:54.520]   But should Reddit be protecting him?
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:55.520]   Or trying?
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:30:00.480]   Should we do the devil's advocate truly here for a minute and turn it around?
[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:06.440]   If we argue on the show against walled communities, if we complain about the control that Facebook
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:11.760]   or Twitter puts on what it does on behalf of its brand, if we want things to be open,
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:15.320]   then Reddit is a substantiation of openness.
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:20.400]   And if, if Reddit says there is no community control of the whole thing, there is no management
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:24.960]   control of the whole thing, then, yeah, the crap comes along, but that's the definition
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:25.960]   of openness.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:31.160]   Now, the problem is that Reddit proved itself hypocritical by banning the links to Gawker,
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:36.040]   because then it did do centralized top-down control and it chose to do it against reporting
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:39.560]   as opposed to against near-child pornography.
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:40.840]   That's where the real problem comes in here.
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:43.440]   I think before we all knew there was crap on Reddit.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:47.280]   Not as bad as this.
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:48.840]   Pardon me.
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:55.200]   But I think the problem was the hypocrisy of the Gawker ban in this.
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:59.480]   So Chad, to your point, it's a big platform.
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:00.480]   It's open.
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:01.480]   No one controls it.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:06.600]   Thus, everyone controls it and they all can do what they want in their own worlds.
[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:07.600]   And that's the secret of its growth.
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:10.120]   I think that'd be a different story.
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:14.120]   But what we saw here was an outright protection of the scum bucket.
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:15.120]   Absolutely.
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:20.080]   The Gawker ban was the biggest misstep they could have ever made.
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:24.480]   If they were trying to defend the community or trying to dispel part of the community.
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.160]   And merely saying, "Oh, yeah, we probably should have done that."
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.560]   I don't think- No.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.960]   But what should they do going forward?
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:31.960]   Should they defend free speech?
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:36.920]   Should they allow subreddits that are not illegal but distasteful?
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:40.720]   I would argue that you almost need a conventional- If this is a community site, you almost
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:42.840]   need a constitutional convention or Reddit.
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:45.080]   You almost need to say, "Folks, let's hash this out.
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:51.020]   Honestly, let's not make this as if it's a done law of our universe.
[01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:52.680]   What do we think, people?"
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:32:00.080]   And the problem is the loud voices that now say, "No, no, no, protect at all costs are
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:02.160]   hurting the chads of the world who say, "No, no, no, wait, wait.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:04.920]   There's something good going on here and you're rooting for us, all of us."
[01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:08.600]   I think that if you're truly a community, then act like a community and it's maybe not
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.560]   a democracy, but it's something close to it.
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:13.160]   What do you think?
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.840]   I agree, a constitution of Reddit.
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:20.240]   It seems like the only way to say, "Here are the lines that cannot be crossed."
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:21.880]   They have no terms of service.
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:28.360]   I believe they do, but it's just- They probably say you can't commit an illegal act.
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:35.160]   Could I post cracks on Reddit?
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:36.520]   Like software cracks?
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:39.360]   Software cracks.
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:40.360]   Could I do anything?
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:45.480]   I'm sure that there's a good torrent Reddit that shares that.
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:46.480]   What was there?
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:49.080]   There was a crack code that was put on somewhere.
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.080]   Was it Reddit or was it like- There's dig.
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:52.080]   There's dig.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:53.080]   Dig, dig, dig, dig.
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.080]   That's right.
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:58.360]   What did dig think of that at the time?
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:32:59.720]   They pulled it down initially.
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:01.560]   It was very controversial.
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:04.480]   And then everybody in the world started posting it and digging.
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:07.000]   They could no longer pull it down.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000]   So they gave up.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:14.080]   What they say here, maybe that's what it would say is, "Hey, you Neanderthals.
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:18.800]   Any effort to control this thing will fail, so go try."
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:23.600]   I guess what the issue really is is Reddit is a new kind of beast.
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:26.400]   It isn't a forum that somebody's running.
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:27.400]   It isn't the internet.
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:28.400]   It isn't Twitter.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:29.560]   It isn't Facebook.
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:31.600]   It's a new kind of beast.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.840]   We don't really know the rules for that yet.
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:35.440]   I feel like it's a platform.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:36.440]   And unfortunately the platform-
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:37.440]   You know what?
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.440]   It's not a platform.
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:39.440]   It's not a platform.
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.440]   It isn't a platform.
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.440]   There are people running that platform.
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:42.440]   Right.
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:44.200]   People own that platform.
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.720]   It isn't an open platform.
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:47.240]   I think that that's one thing.
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:48.240]   It's not.
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.240]   It's not used net.
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:51.320]   If some people are saying in the chair, it's used net.
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:53.000]   It's not used net.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.560]   It's owned by- It's a commercial entity owned by a company.
[01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:57.560]   So it's not used net.
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:58.560]   Right.
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:02.280]   And someone in the chair pointed out that Reddit, the organization did not ban gawk
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.280]   or links that moderators have read it.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:05.280]   Individual mods did.
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:07.280]   Right.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:08.280]   Well, no, no, no, no.
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:15.200]   I thought that the head of Reddit confessed that they briefly did it system-wide.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:19.280]   My problem is that that article in a gawk is referring to private discussions that are
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.280]   not public in Reddit.
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:23.280]   And I don't know if those are accurate or not.
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:24.280]   Okay.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:29.080]   Because we haven't heard a public statement from Alex, a lanyan or from Reddit or from
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.080]   Conde.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.080]   We don't know anything.
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.760]   There are private statements that have been published by gawk or we don't know if they're
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:36.760]   not.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:37.760]   I think Alex is on the board.
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:38.760]   I don't think Alex is a manager on any board.
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:39.760]   Okay.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:40.760]   Not management.
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:43.760]   So I don't think it's quite a platform, but I don't know.
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:45.560]   Maybe, you know, I'm not an expert on Reddit.
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:46.560]   So I don't-
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:49.760]   Well, you know, when that view then this goes back to our Twitter discussions, then are
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:55.800]   you saying it is impossible to have a privately run platform that anything privately owned
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:57.840]   is necessarily walled at some point?
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.520]   Well, you're responsible.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:04.160]   If you're kind of nest, frankly, you're responsible for every single thing that is on your servers
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:05.480]   as Reddit.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:09.000]   Now you can say, and I don't think it lets you off the hook to say, well, we let users
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.600]   create their own subreddits and moderate them.
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:14.560]   Fine, but it doesn't mean you're not responsible for it.
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.520]   Well, what if it's a federated architecture, right?
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:20.560]   When we talked about the Twitter alternative is on be or app.
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:23.360]   That's different because that is open.
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:26.880]   So if somebody takes over an app.net and does their own instance of it and puts up pure
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:27.880]   crud.
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:32.400]   App.net has no responsibility for it anymore than, you know, Evan put, Dromo does for anything
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:33.400]   on status.
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:34.400]   No, it works.
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:38.000]   But us becomes this great thing for, for horrid porn.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.200]   Is there not so is that?
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:40.600]   Well, maybe I don't understand.
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:41.960]   Chad, is that the case?
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:45.280]   No, but it feels like I may feel like that.
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:46.280]   I don't know.
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:50.880]   I know what I'm saying is simple users may feel that way because anyone can make our
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:51.880]   corner of the net.
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:56.520]   It has nothing to do with Condi Nast exactly run by somebody else and nothing to do with
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:57.520]   any.
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:58.520]   Exactly.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.320]   And so that's why you're seeing the community get outraged, you know, because they feel
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.320]   like this is that was their subreddit.
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.560]   No one else taken.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:08.800]   I would be after this discussion, I would completely agree that they're a mistake.
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:11.760]   This is not covered by safe harbor, by the way.
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:16.040]   Reddit is not read as a publisher, right?
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:20.840]   There's no, there's no question that Reddit is a publisher in this regard.
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:21.840]   Jeff.
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:22.840]   Is it?
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:26.480]   Well, that's, I mean, if there's safe harbor than there, then they would be right to say,
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:32.040]   hey, we don't, we're just like YouTube says, hey, you know, we'll honor DMCA takedown requests
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:34.280]   if there's something violating the law, want or that.
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:36.360]   But otherwise we're not responsible.
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:41.520]   It gets fuzzy when, when the moderators of Reddit who are at some of the highest levels
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:44.800]   start to moderate all of Reddit.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:45.800]   That's how it gets really fast.
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:51.240]   So there is that is that capability exists.
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:55.200]   And I'm unaware if they pulled that link system wide or just in the subreddits that
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.200]   were affected.
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:59.720]   I have not done my research on that.
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:08.240]   So is Reddit like WordPress.com or is, which in my, in my belief is not a publisher is,
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:13.640]   is like YouTube or is Reddit more like a forum where they're a publisher?
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:15.440]   Oh, well, let's put it all the way there.
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:19.280]   No, no, is Reddit like WordPress.org, which is truly a platform.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:25.360]   It isn't because no, no, because we know that because it's all of Reddit's content is hosted
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:26.600]   on Kani Nast servers.
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:32.080]   Right. So WordPress.com being similar in that sense would say, would that does have
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:33.080]   standards?
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.080]   Right?
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.080]   Yes.
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.120]   No, but absolutely you're not going to see child porn on WordPress.com.
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:41.960]   Well, child pornography is illegal.
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:45.120]   So, okay, you're not going to say, well, okay, that's a good question.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:48.200]   I mean, let's, a tumbler is an interesting example.
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:49.200]   Tumblers are common carry.
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:50.200]   There's lots of porn on tumbler.
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:54.440]   There's stuff as bad as anything on Reddit, but we don't, we don't blame tumbler for that
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:59.240]   because when you go to a tumbler that somebody's responsible for that, not tumbler, they're
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:04.460]   just providing a platform is Reddit like that stuff to blogger has has stuff to that that
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:05.840]   to someone is offensive.
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.080]   It's not offensive to me.
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:08.080]   Right.
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:12.120]   I don't know what their, what their line is, but there's naked people on blogger.
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:15.840]   So, so this is really a question is, is what is Reddit?
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:18.600]   And I think the part of the reason there's, oh, we've lost Jeff, we'll get him back.
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.720]   No, no, no, I'm just trying to get myself unpixilated.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.240]   Oh, okay.
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:29.400]   And so part of the problem is there are differing points of view about what slash R means and
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.480]   who's who's responsible.
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:36.800]   And see, I think of it as a forum, a massive forum, but it's a forum to me.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:39.360]   I would say that it's more of a blogger or a wordpress.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:41.800]   If it's a blogger or a wordpress, then that's different.
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:43.280]   I don't think you could have this.
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:45.960]   You wouldn't say I'm not going to use, I'm never going to use tumbler again because of
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.200]   the stuff that's on tumbler.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:51.240]   But unfortunately, what happened was it'd be, it'd be like saying blogger said, well,
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:56.240]   all links to this cross blog, across blogger have now been taking down.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:57.560]   That's really is where they blew it.
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:59.360]   No community of blogger.
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:02.520]   The blog, each blog is individual.
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.040]   Maybe that's the argument about a subreddit, right?
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:08.040]   But but there is no community of blogger that comes together and says and sets rules
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:09.360]   for all a blogger.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.360]   There's no such thing.
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:12.160]   Well, I'm going to table this discussion.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:15.440]   There's a personal publishing platform versus a social news site.
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:18.600]   I always imagine Reddit like big, a social news site, right?
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:19.600]   Right.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:20.600]   Like a meta filter.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.440]   Because you have one account on Reddit.
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.440]   And that's it.
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:26.840]   And you have the whole Reddit.
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:30.920]   Unless some, well, now, but people have to let you into these subreddits, right?
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:31.920]   Are they private?
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:32.920]   No, they tend to be open.
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:34.160]   You can go in.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.520]   So one account.
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:37.400]   So to me, that's a forum.
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:38.400]   That's not blogger.
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:39.400]   That's not WordPress.
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:40.400]   That's a forum.
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.200]   You get one account, a Reddit account.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:44.080]   You're on Connie NASA servers now.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:45.560]   There's a ton of content.
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:48.120]   I think people are fooled by the scope of it.
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:49.120]   It's so big.
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:50.120]   It looks like the internet.
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:51.120]   It looks like WordPress.com.
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:52.220]   But it isn't.
[01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:56.480]   It's one place, one forum with a lot of horrible stuff on it.
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:02.280]   And I can tell you, if I ran that forum, I would be responsible for it all.
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:07.720]   And as soon as they pull site wide, pull links to something, they demonstrate that fact.
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:09.680]   They say, oh, if they had not done that.
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:12.440]   Yeah, they kind of muddy the waters there.
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:13.440]   It did a lot, right?
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.240]   That's where that's where they're all coming down to me.
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:16.440]   And it shows the capability.
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:17.920]   If they'd not done, let's say they hadn't done that.
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:22.440]   Let's say all that happened was, Redditors like Crazy Yelled and Screamed and Protected
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:24.000]   and Cursed Galker.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.880]   But it wouldn't be the first and whatever.
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:28.680]   We'd have a very different discussion, wouldn't we?
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:29.760]   What would we say then?
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:31.640]   It is owned by Conde Nast.
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:32.640]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:34.680]   Somebody's saying they're sister companies.
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:35.680]   No, sorry.
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:36.680]   Wrong.
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:38.320]   They're giving a lot of autonomy.
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:39.320]   Conde Nast owns them.
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:41.640]   Can fire every single person there.
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:45.080]   Could shut it down tomorrow.
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:47.080]   That's not true.
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:53.160]   They have mods just as we have chatroom mods.
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.720]   But I don't think that lets them off the hook anymore than I'm off the hook for what
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:57.920]   happens in the chatroom.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:58.920]   You are legally--
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:01.600]   Absolutely on the hook for what happens in the chatroom.
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.840]   No, you're off the hook legally.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:04.840]   I am?
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:05.840]   Yeah, section 230.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:06.840]   Oh, thank God.
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:07.840]   Oh, thank God.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:08.840]   I don't like that chat.
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:10.680]   I was going to say really, Leon, that's not good.
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:11.680]   No, I think I am.
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:14.520]   Well, morally, if not legally on the hook, I'm morally.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:15.520]   No, no, no.
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:16.520]   You want section 230.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:19.040]   I'm not going to say it first of them because section 230 says, "You're only surviving
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.040]   part of the BCMA."
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.880]   No, I understand what you're saying.
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:27.080]   And it says that you are not responsible for content that is created on your site by
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.080]   someone else.
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:33.560]   And the reason that Congress, even silly Congress, did that was so that if that weren't the
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:37.760]   case, if you were responsible for everything, you would allow no conversation because your
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:40.280]   liability would be too high.
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:41.920]   This is what allows takedown notices.
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.920]   This allows free speech on the net.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:45.520]   So section 230 is very important.
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.440]   You are not responsible for your chat room.
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:50.040]   You choose to be and that's your right to do.
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:52.520]   So I correct, I do stand corrected.
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:59.040]   Reddit was spun off in effect from Conde Nast in 2011, at the end of 2011, and is now a
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:03.120]   part of advanced communications with zones, both Conde Nast and Reddit.
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:04.320]   So I stand corrected.
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:07.920]   So instead of using Conde Nast, I should use advanced publications.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:09.000]   Which is the parent company.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.720]   The parent company.
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:12.360]   So their sister company is your absolutely right.
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:18.600]   And full disclosure here is that I worked for that company for 12 years and still consult
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:20.680]   on some basis for one of its divisions.
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:26.760]   And I work for Gawker, obviously, for many years as well.
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:27.760]   And I know--
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:29.760]   I have nothing to do with any of them.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.200]   I never plan to.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:32.280]   I work for Leo.
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:35.600]   I don't-- and Chad is my minion.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:36.600]   But Chad's on Reddit.
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:37.800]   I don't know what the right answer is.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:39.800]   I'm not pretending to know what the right answer is.
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:40.800]   I'm sure right.
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:48.000]   All I think you've heard from Gina and me is that this caused us to judge the community
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000]   bias action.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000]   Yep.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000]   Exactly.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.640]   And that application that we can't figure out yet, we can't grok yet.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:43:00.920]   But there is-- it goes around, comes around.
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:02.360]   There is an implication to your actions.
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:03.720]   There's a responsibility to your actions.
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:08.080]   And the community has spoken by its actions in a way that does not speak well for them,
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:09.080]   I think.
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:10.920]   Yeah, I mean, to me, I don't use Reddit heavily.
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:14.520]   But Reddit's like, oh, it's that community that does those great AMAs.
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:16.760]   That's one of the things that I love about Reddit.
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:20.400]   Oh, also, it's the community that protected that creepy guy.
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:27.360]   I should also point out, as somebody just did on Twitter, if you go to gawker.com/upskirt,
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:29.560]   it's just as bad.
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:34.080]   So talk about pot calling the kettle black.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:36.720]   Well, this is the other question.
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:39.040]   God bless him, gawker is the troll as well.
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:40.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:41.840]   That's the funniest thing of all.
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:42.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:43.840]   Takes one or no one.
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:47.680]   And so I understand why people on Reddit would say, well, screw you.
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:49.560]   I mean, gawker, screw you.
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:50.760]   And you're out in this guy.
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:52.880]   And you're as bad as anything.
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.120]   And we have this great community.
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:55.480]   And it's of real value.
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:58.640]   And yes, there's a CD side.
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:03.280]   There's a difference between posting Lindsey Lohan nude professional photo shoots, which
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:04.720]   got posted in magazines.
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:05.720]   True.
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:09.160]   And it was a lot of people who were just took an Instagram shot of themselves at the beach
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:10.880]   to share with their friends.
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:12.320]   I mean, there is a difference.
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.320]   No, I agree.
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:18.440]   I mean, there's, you know, but I agree that gawker is professional troll.
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:19.440]   It's a tabloid.
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:20.960]   And this is, it does take one to know one.
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:23.240]   And of course, this was all about attention.
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:24.720]   And this is a huge story for them.
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:30.520]   Yeah, but to be honest, I mean, I think this was a legitimate story and a real and look
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:32.280]   at the discussion it raised.
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:35.760]   So I just don't know what the answer is.
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:38.320]   I mean, I think I read it probably.
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:40.160]   Well, you know what it shows?
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:43.040]   It shows how much good where the goodwill Reddit has.
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.920]   Otherwise it'd be like, well, God, get rid of that.
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:49.600]   I mean, there's a lot of goodwill for Reddit.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.960]   What about this is a solution for them?
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:55.160]   This is, I thought about this some long time ago.
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:57.000]   You say, okay, there's a Reddit brand.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.240]   There's Reddit stuff.
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:44:59.240]   It's pretty much open.
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:02.240]   If you're going to run something that we think is slimy, you know what?
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:03.560]   We will federate the software.
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:04.560]   You can run it.
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:06.760]   You can call it "Zedit."
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:11.120]   And we'll open source the platform because there's really no business model anyway.
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.560]   And yeah, you can use it and you can do it.
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.880]   And we don't control it then.
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:17.880]   We're not responsible for it then morally or legally or anything which way you want
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:18.880]   to do it.
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:19.880]   Okay.
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:22.280]   But we do have standards here at this community.
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:26.160]   And those standards are upheld by a community that has a voice in how that operates and
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:29.040]   isn't intimidated by a few members.
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:30.080]   And we'll figure out what those standards are.
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:35.560]   Now, that sounds like Pollyanna time and let's give you the Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:36.560]   But it could turn around too.
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:37.840]   Well, where is the line?
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:38.840]   What are the standards?
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:41.960]   Who's to say is a naked picture overboard or is a naked picture?
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:45.280]   Apparently, I didn't know this Reddit software is open source and you could run your own
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:46.280]   Reddit.
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:49.320]   You couldn't call it Reddit, obviously, but you could run your own.
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:51.840]   And to finally bring this all around it, I've been talking to people in the chat room
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:54.000]   who I also know use Reddit and have been following this story.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.440]   And they say the subreddit moderators were only banning the article on specific subreddits.
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:00.440]   So it was not site-wide.
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:01.440]   It wasn't site-wide.
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:06.400]   So if the subreddit moderator had a problem with this, they would ban it from their subreddit.
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.560]   And by the way, not an illegitimate problem.
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:10.560]   They were saying this is different.
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:14.560]   This guy is being outed and we protect anonymity.
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:17.000]   That's our kind of one of our core core values.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:21.480]   So they asked the admins to do it site-wide and they said no.
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:25.960]   But this article outed this guy and he did lose his job.
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:30.840]   So not that I wanted to defend the guy, but I'm just saying if your core value is freedom
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:35.720]   of speech and anonymity needs to be preserved, then that's what they were acting in according
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:38.720]   to the core values, even if they felt it was reprehensible.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.720]   It's very complicated.
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:41.720]   It is.
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:42.720]   It is.
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:44.360]   This is quite a story.
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:45.360]   Yeah.
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:46.360]   Wow.
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:47.920]   All right, we had a good conversation.
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:48.920]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:49.920]   We'll table it.
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:52.920]   We could talk some more about it next week.
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:58.880]   And there's been a great conversation in the chatroom.
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:00.880]   Our subreddit in the chatroom is going crazy.
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:04.960]   Yeah, the chatroom is going to be the sub chat.
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:05.960]   Let's take a break.
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:08.360]   Come back with our tip tool and number of the week.
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:14.120]   I am going to talk about this ginormous phone, but first to word from Squarespace.
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:17.640]   A great place to put your website, squarespace.com.
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:25.000]   If you're a photographer and artist, I know that there are sites dedicated to photography
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000]   sites.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.600]   This is so much better.
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:28.760]   This is so much better.
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:31.280]   This is what you want to take a look at.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:34.760]   Everything you need to make a site that's unique, that's yours, it's the hosting and
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:35.760]   the software.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:40.000]   They'll even do the domain name for you with a one year plan.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.440]   They'll hook it all up for you.
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:45.080]   And I'm telling you literally within minutes you will have a gorgeous site.
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:48.040]   In fact, you could do it right now for free, no credit card.
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:50.800]   You need to just go to squarespace.com.
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:51.800]   Click Get Started.
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:53.480]   You'll be using the new Squarespace 6th.
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:55.160]   Amazing responsive design.
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:57.960]   That means a site looks good on any size device.
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:47:59.120]   That's the modern way of doing things.
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:00.440]   Not a separate mobile site.
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:08.240]   No, your portfolio, your blog, your business looks great on any device with one site.
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:13.440]   Take a look at the amazing templates by some of the best creative designers in the world.
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:15.320]   And that's just your starting point.
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:19.240]   These are not cookie cutter sites because as soon as you start working with a template,
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:21.560]   you're making it all your own.
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:26.480]   Every site is unique, reflects your style, and you don't have to be a web guru to do
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:27.480]   it.
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:33.040]   Now, if you are an expert in HTML5 and CSS3 and JavaScript and JSON and things like that,
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:35.640]   you absolutely have access to all those tools.
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:39.800]   That's one of the things I love about Squarespace.
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:47.960]   SFTP Get actually supports Get so you can check in and check out your design updates.
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:50.480]   Look, I want you to try it free for two weeks.
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:52.240]   That's the first step.
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:53.600]   Just go to squarespace.com.
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.440]   Click Try It Free.
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:59.560]   Import all your data from your existing site, including comments, images, all the SEO is
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:00.560]   preserved.
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:05.000]   Then, if you decide you want to take a look at the pricing, two plans.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.720]   Standard plan is $8 a month when you buy an annual plan, $10 a month a month a month.
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:10.720]   That's right.
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:12.120]   You can go month to month on this.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:17.080]   $16 a month for the unlimited annual plan gets you unlimited pages, galleries, unlimited
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:20.120]   blogs, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage.
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:24.600]   If you're a photographer, $16 a month and you don't give up control to somebody else,
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:27.400]   you absolutely control it.
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:28.640]   It's so fantastic.
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:30.520]   Would you try it free?
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:31.520]   Squarespace.com.
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:34.840]   Then, if you decide to buy, all I ask is use our offer code.
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:42.200]   We get credit Twig and the number 10, T-W-I-G-1-0 squarespace.com.
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:45.720]   Great place for your next website.
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:48.200]   Time for our tool of the week, Gina Trappani.
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:52.640]   Tip of the week, two factor off for Google accounts.
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:56.200]   I know Leo and Leo, this is one of the few things that you and I have ever disagreed
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:57.200]   with.
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:58.200]   Well, I use it.
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:49:59.200]   I use it.
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:00.200]   I just suffer with it.
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:03.160]   You use it and you suffer with it because it's really a pain in the ass to use.
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:04.800]   You have to enter this verification code.
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:05.800]   Every 30 days.
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:10.120]   You have application-specific passwords and you've got to install the app and for someone
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:13.360]   who has multiple phones like you do, that's a total pain.
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:15.080]   It got a little bit easier.
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:17.920]   I just noticed this myself last week.
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:23.240]   I'm not sure how new it is, but Google has added this idea of trusted computers to two
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:24.240]   factor off.
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:28.360]   The next time that you verify you have to sign in with two factor off with your verification
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:32.240]   code, there's a little checkbox that says, "Trust this computer."
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:36.160]   If you check that box, that means you won't be prompted for your verification code every
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:38.160]   30 days anymore.
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:43.240]   Does that mean on all of the apps on that computer or device or just on the Google website?
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:46.000]   I believe it's just the Google website.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.960]   I thought they had that already.
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:48.960]   This is new.
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:52.200]   Yes, they used to have remember this machine for 30 days.
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:53.200]   I see.
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:54.200]   This is forever.
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:55.200]   I guess.
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:59.080]   This is, so basically you check, "Trust this computer," and you do that on cross your different
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:02.680]   devices, and if your phone gets stolen or if you're wiping your computer and selling
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:08.000]   it or whatever, you go into your Google account, you can manage that list of devices and computers.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.680]   You can revoke that trusted computer.
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:14.280]   It makes two factor off just a little bit easier to use because you just don't get prompted
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:15.280]   every time.
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:16.280]   Right.
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:19.960]   I love Matt Cutts' tip, which is once you get the barcode, because the way you get Google
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:24.760]   authenticator working on your phone is you scan the barcode, and that phone is now, can
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:28.800]   be used with authenticator and your Google account.
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:30.560]   I'm going to do this now that I got all the phones.
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:31.560]   I got my iPhone 5.
[01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:33.560]   I got my new Galaxy Note 2.
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:37.640]   I'm going to take, and I'm going to my iPad, I'm going to take pictures of that same barcode.
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:39.640]   You can take multiple devices.
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:41.440]   So I'm going to do it one more time.
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:42.440]   Oh.
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:44.720]   Matt told us that last time he was on.
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:45.720]   You were hearing me.
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:46.880]   I don't think that's right.
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:47.880]   She wasn't.
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:49.920]   So wait, you take a screenshot of the barcode and then you can--
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:50.920]   Well, you could do that.
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:55.200]   Or you could just wait there and get all your devices and keep taking, and making Google
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:57.000]   authenticator work on all the devices.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.720]   Oh, I got to do that.
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:51:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:01.880]   Because I want to authenticate her on more than one device.
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:02.880]   Yeah, me too.
[01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:03.880]   Me too.
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:04.880]   And that was one of my problems.
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:06.320]   I just having it text me codes every time.
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:07.320]   That was so annoying.
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:08.320]   Yeah, I'll do that.
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:09.320]   Great.
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:10.320]   Cool.
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:11.320]   If you print it, does it continue to work?
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:14.000]   So they're saying they printed it or save it as a screenshot.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.360]   If it continues to work, that's great.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:18.760]   I just thought maybe once you close that window, that didn't work anymore.
[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:19.760]   Mm.
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:20.760]   Okay.
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:23.400]   Good tip.
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:26.160]   I turned it on because, of course, I want to be safe.
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:30.280]   But your point about application-specific passwords being no better than just a regular
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:31.280]   or single password.
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:32.280]   Worse.
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:33.280]   It's just a little taken.
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:37.240]   Worse than mine, 16 lowercase letters or case insensitive letters, that's number.
[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:38.520]   Mine's much better.
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:40.520]   But that's fine.
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:41.920]   It's still good enough.
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:43.720]   It's good enough.
[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:46.040]   Jeff Jarvis has a number or two.
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.320]   Well, let's go with this one.
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:56.000]   Glassdoor did a study of the average base salary for software engineers.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000]   And not surprisingly, Google came out number one at $128,000.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.280]   Again, that's a base salary.
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:06.160]   Facebook near behind $5,000 less at $123,000.
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:08.360]   The national average is 92,000.
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:09.760]   I should give you a software.
[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:16.800]   And I guess cheaper Seattle at $103,000, Apple 114,000.
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:20.920]   And IBM is the bottom of the barrel at 89,000.
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:22.720]   That's because you have to use Coball.
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:24.960]   That's because you're old.
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:26.960]   Should get paid more if you have to use Coball.
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:29.000]   I need defensive IBM.
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000]   I've got this before.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:35.080]   I got a message this week from Jeff Schick, who is Howard Stern's tech advisor.
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:41.280]   And he has put in an IBM Lotus social network into Howard Stern's operation.
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:45.040]   So they're managing based on a social network now, which you could imagine using a lotus.
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:48.360]   Well, that'll be fun.
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:52.400]   What's that new one that we want to try that was a pick back break weekly pick yesterday
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.400]   by Renee Ritchie?
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:54.840]   I want to try that.
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:59.480]   It's, it's, oh, and I can't remember it anymore.
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:01.120]   Chad and I said, we should try this.
[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:06.760]   And then we forgot immediately forgot all about it.
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:09.200]   Chaterum will tell us before I can find it.
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:11.200]   I can't remember either.
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:15.640]   Sir, with the CH, I think it was made by that one guy who made that one guy that other
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:16.640]   thing.
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:19.720]   It did the thing and he was really famous board glass board.
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:20.720]   Okay.
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:22.840]   Is that right?
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:27.440]   It was made by the person who made campfire and no, no, no, no, no, no, it's made by some
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:28.440]   a.
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:34.000]   Anyway, glass board.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.280]   This would be better than Lotus notes for Howard.
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:38.600]   Oh, it is a glass board.
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:39.600]   Good.
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:40.600]   We were right.
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:42.600]   Or Chevrons.
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:44.600]   I want to try this.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:45.600]   Android iPhone and on the web.
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:46.600]   And it's like campfire.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:49.640]   So it's an eternal private social network.
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:50.640]   Yeah.
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:53.720]   Social network for your business or whatever.
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:54.720]   Free.
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:56.760]   Oh, maybe it's not free.
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:00.640]   It's free and premium, premium, but it's pretty good for free.
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:01.920]   We got to do I think this would be good.
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:02.920]   Now we have Rosie.
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:04.080]   We have our own wiki.
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:07.280]   They're a repository of something.
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:12.880]   Rosie stands for something of everything you ever wanted to know about Twitter.
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:14.920]   We're afraid to ask.
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:18.780]   My pick is my new phone, which I'm sure people are getting tired of hearing me sing
[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:19.940]   its praises.
[01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:26.640]   I finally broke down and I ordered the European unlocked version of the Galaxy Note 2.
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:29.800]   You remember, I love the Galaxy Note, but it replaced it with a Galaxy S3, which are
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:33.420]   replaced with the iPhone 5, which I've now replaced with the Galaxy Note 2.
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:37.960]   This was all planned obsolescence every two months, new phone needed or not.
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:40.240]   But I actually love the size of this.
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:42.960]   It's 5.5 inches.
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:45.500]   And I'm going to just show you a couple of things it does that you will not believe.
[01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:48.100]   For instance, it has windowing.
[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:53.040]   So when I press and hold the menu button, a little side menu pops up and I can, let's
[01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:59.960]   say, I could put maps in this one and I can put, let's see, Chrome up here.
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:01.280]   I don't know why you'd want to do that.
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:04.960]   But now I have a window with Chrome in the maps.
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:09.880]   Or I can put, you maybe want to use the S Note because this has a great little stylus
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:10.880]   here.
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:13.800]   So I can drag now the S Note.
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:20.860]   I've got a window on top of the window where I can drag the S Note into it like this.
[01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:22.380]   And then I have, let's close that.
[01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:23.380]   It's very confusing.
[01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:24.380]   Okay.
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:28.140]   S Note is cool because this is a pressure sensitive stylus.
[01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:30.060]   It does handwriting recognition.
[01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:31.980]   It does a pretty good job.
[01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:37.020]   Very fast, 1.6 GHz quad core processor and two gigs of RAM, which I'm not sure which
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:40.620]   makes it fast, but I bet the lots of RAM certainly doesn't hurt.
[01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:42.380]   Beautiful screen.
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:44.280]   It is not as high resolution as the original note.
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:48.360]   It's 1280 by 720 instead of 1280 by 800.
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:52.020]   So the pixels per inch is actually lower than the original Galaxy Note.
[01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:54.240]   But it is not a pentile screen.
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:56.720]   And so you might say it really is higher resolution.
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:01.960]   It's a gorgeous, bright, easy to use LCD screen.
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:03.960]   What more can I say about it?
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:10.600]   If you have fat fingers like I do, you need a big phone.
[01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:11.600]   And this is it.
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:13.420]   It looks like a pocket, check the old?
[01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:14.420]   Yeah.
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:15.420]   You want to see me put in a pocket?
[01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:18.380]   I got Captain Kangaroo pockets.
[01:57:18.380 --> 01:57:20.580]   It goes right in my breast pocket right here like that.
[01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:21.580]   Easy.
[01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:22.580]   It's plenty of room.
[01:57:22.580 --> 01:57:25.060]   In fact, it's no wider than the old Galaxy Note.
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:28.580]   Just a little bit taller because they go edge to edge more on the screen.
[01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:30.860]   I really like this.
[01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:34.500]   As an old person with fat fingers, it really solves my knees.
[01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:35.780]   It does not flicker in real life.
[01:57:35.780 --> 01:57:37.660]   That's just in the direction with our cameras.
[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:39.580]   I'm not sure why that's doing that.
[01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:41.220]   The windowing is crazy.
[01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:42.220]   Is that wild?
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:43.220]   Yeah.
[01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:46.480]   It's kind of the note tabs do that as well.
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:51.200]   It's something new that Samsung's doing with some of their newer things.
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:52.200]   What else do I want to go?
[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:56.060]   I saw the commercial or at some point, I was like, "Well, you can text while you're watching
[01:57:56.060 --> 01:57:57.060]   a video."
[01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:58.060]   That's kind of weird.
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:58:05.160]   Would I ever want to be texting while I was watching the video in the turnpike rest stop?
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:06.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:09.480]   I watched the debate on Windows and tweet in the other.
[01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:13.720]   I'll tell you, people laugh at a stylist, but the idea that if somebody gives you a phone
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:18.480]   number and instead of breaking out the keyboard, I could just write it.
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:20.160]   I can read my own handwriting.
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:24.840]   It does have, this is really weird, but it has actual text recognition.
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:26.160]   I can also do it.
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:27.280]   I don't know how good it is.
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:28.480]   I think it's pretty good.
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:36.840]   See, five, five, one, two, one, two.
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:39.360]   It's actually pretty good.
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:42.800]   Is there a place in the phone to keep the stylist or is it just to carry that side?
[01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:43.800]   Yeah.
[01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:44.800]   No.
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:46.400]   In fact, there's a nice little feature that if you leave the stylist behind, it beeps
[01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:47.400]   at you.
[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:48.400]   Really?
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:51.400]   But if you never use a stylist, you never even have to know it exists.
[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:55.720]   It fits very nicely, flushed into the case and is nice and firm in there.
[01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:56.720]   Very nice.
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:58.040]   The stylist is much improved, by the way.
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:00.120]   The ergonomics are much better than the Galaxy Note.
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:02.160]   One reason to upgrade the button's easier to push.
[01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:03.760]   It's got a soft plastic.
[01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:07.880]   S Pen now is really, I think, nice.
[01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:11.480]   Look, if you want a big phone, this is it.
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:13.080]   And I think it's a great phone.
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:17.600]   Running Jelly Bean, which is nice, so Google now, look how nice Google now looks on the
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:18.600]   big screen.
[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:19.600]   Oh, it's amazing.
[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:26.040]   What's amazing is that one of the first tablets to come out was Dell doing a five-inch.
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:27.840]   Yes, and it was terrible.
[01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:30.040]   It was, but they had the right idea.
[01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:32.160]   Because it was clunky and big, but it was the right size.
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:36.000]   I like this size a lot.
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:41.040]   So I have to say, this is my now, my daily driver.
[01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:42.320]   I gave up on the iPhone 5.
[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:43.560]   Too hard for me to type on.
[01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:44.800]   I've nicked the heck out of it.
[01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:48.400]   I'm on a way to get a case for it for one thing.
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:51.200]   It's nice, but it feels old fashioned.
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:53.080]   It's my parents' phone.
[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:55.120]   I'm loving my Android stuff.
[01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:56.120]   You're loving what?
[01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:57.120]   Android stuff.
[01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:00.560]   I tell you, with Jelly Bean, Android has really come up.
[02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:02.800]   Here's the other thing I went last week and I bought.
[02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:05.720]   Unfortunately, I had to return it because it was a broken and open box unit, but I
[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:07.320]   bought a Chromebook.
[02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:08.320]   Ah!
[02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:09.320]   Oh!
[02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:13.120]   And I'm going to go back and do it because I really want to see what life is like fully
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:14.800]   on Google Apps.
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:17.080]   And then B is for an educational purpose.
[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:19.480]   Would it really be usable to teach students?
[02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:20.480]   Hmm.
[02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:21.480]   Hmm.
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:22.480]   Cool.
[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:24.200]   I should let you know.
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:28.320]   I did order a Surface, Microsoft Surface tablet.
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:29.320]   I will have it.
[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:34.080]   I'm going to ask you about nine days, 26 that arrives, along with the keyboard.
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:37.640]   So I'll show you the following week on Twig.
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:38.640]   Does it really change?
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:41.880]   Have you played enough with the earlier versions of Windows 8 that are really changes?
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:44.000]   You don't have to go searching for things and doing all the wacky stuff.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000]   You have to do Windows?
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.000]   Oh, no, it's worse.
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.000]   No, no, no.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.800]   In fact, I think Windows users are going to be baffled.
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:49.800]   Oh, no.
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:50.800]   What if you're a back user?
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:52.120]   You haven't been on Windows in a year.
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:53.120]   Then it won't make any difference.
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:55.040]   It's just a different interface.
[02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:56.240]   It's very different, though.
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:00:57.240]   And there's a lot of...
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:02.400]   I think the problem, and I just saw a usability test with Nielsen Norman where they said the
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:07.040]   real problem is there's a lot of mysterious commands, hidden mouse movements and things
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:10.160]   that people just don't get.
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:13.040]   I think sophisticated users might like Windows 8.
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:17.680]   It's certainly grown on me, but I have a feeling it's going to be really problematic for a
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:18.680]   lot of people.
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:19.680]   There are also to a situation...
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:26.360]   Very interesting, which is that they are including news in Windows 8.
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:29.080]   And so they're licensing content from major media companies.
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:30.640]   They have editors, they're more people.
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:31.640]   Yeah.
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:33.720]   No, I think they're really...
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:35.200]   This is a tablet.
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:37.200]   Even Windows 8 is a tablet-y.
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:38.200]   Yeah.
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:43.800]   And I'm going to say I went to Best Buy and I played with a touchscreen laptop for Windows
[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:46.520]   8 and I do like a touchscreen laptop.
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:47.520]   You'll need it.
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:48.520]   You'll need it.
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:49.520]   You'll want it anyway.
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:51.200]   You won't need it, but you'll want it with Windows 8, I think.
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:52.560]   And that's why I got the RT tablet.
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:55.520]   I'm really curious as to how that works.
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:59.720]   There's very little RT software, so I don't know what that's going to be like.
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:04.640]   I hope it doesn't join the playbook and the Zoom and all those other bad tablets that
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:05.640]   I have.
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:06.960]   I do want to try that keyboard.
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:07.960]   Yeah.
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:08.960]   Well, come up here.
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:09.960]   Yeah, I'll come up.
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:10.960]   All right.
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:11.960]   Sounds good.
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:13.440]   Gina Trapani, you can find her.
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:14.440]   She's easy to find.
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:15.440]   Smartawear.com.
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:16.440]   I'm sorry.org.
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:17.440]   And thinkup.com.
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:18.440]   Thinkup.com.
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:25.480]   And of course, here every Wednesday afternoon, 1PM Pacific, 4PM Eastern time.
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:27.280]   Great show.
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:28.280]   As always.
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:29.520]   My favorite hour of the week.
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:31.480]   I really enjoy the conversations we have.
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:32.480]   I do too.
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:33.480]   Yeah.
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:35.040]   I learn a lot.
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:38.560]   Not only from you guys, but also from the chatroom screaming at us.
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:39.560]   Yes.
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:43.320]   This is easily the show where I learn the most.
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:46.760]   That's thanks to you, Gina, and to you, Jeff Jarvis, Professor of Journalism.
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:48.400]   That's a great show.
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:49.400]   I know.
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:50.600]   I work with smart people.
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:55.800]   And don't tell them I said that.
[02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:57.280]   But I do learn a lot from the show.
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:00.360]   Jeff Jarvis teaches journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:03.920]   He's also the author of What Would Google Do in his new book Private Parts?
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:05.720]   You can read his blog at Buzz Machine.
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:09.320]   In this week, I'm not pink, but I'm pixelated and I apologize.
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:10.960]   Oh, I don't mind the pixelation.
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:12.840]   You're taking it much more seriously than I am.
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:13.840]   I hate it.
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:15.760]   I like to see myself crisp.
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:21.120]   And we should also mention Gina has a show on 5x5 at 5x5.tv called.
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:22.120]   In beta.
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:23.120]   In beta.
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:24.120]   Yeah, with Kevin Purdy.
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:25.120]   We do it on Tuesdays.
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:26.120]   Yes.
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:27.120]   Yeah, check it out.
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:31.040]   And I want to talk to both of you about doing more shows on the Twit Network.
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:33.360]   We'll be in touch.
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:35.160]   Did you get your raise?
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:38.160]   Oh, did we?
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:40.000]   Oh, you'll see.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.000]   I shouldn't say anything.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.240]   I'm going to dance down my mailbox.
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:45.120]   It's not like jump up and down.
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:47.680]   It might have been a pleasant surprise.
[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:51.280]   It mayo, whatever you give us is a pleasant surprise.
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:52.280]   Absolutely.
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:54.400]   Well, the show's doing pretty well.
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:58.440]   So we just thought, you know, what we do, we just, every quarter or so, we adjust the
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:01.440]   host fees just because we want to reflect the revenue.
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:04.800]   Can I quit my day job, you know?
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:05.800]   No.
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:07.520]   I didn't mean to get your hopes up there.
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:10.840]   It's a Buck 50 and a Chipotle gift certificate.
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:13.000]   I can bootstrap my startup.
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000]   No.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.680]   I didn't say raise.
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:17.480]   I said raisins, raisins.
[02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:22.880]   I'm sending you all dried fruit and a free playbook.
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:25.160]   Thank you, Guyver and Kevin Dublin for those jokes.
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:27.960]   I have joke writers in the chat room.
[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:31.520]   If you want to join us, we'd love to see you at 1PM Pacific, 4PM Eastern Time.
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:38.000]   That's a 2000 UTC on twit.tv, but you can always get audio and video downloads after
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:43.760]   the fact our on-demand versions are always online at twit.tv and wherever at her podcasts
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:44.760]   are aggregated.
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:45.760]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:47.520]   I'll see you next week on Twig.
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:50.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:57.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:04:57.520 --> 02:04:59.780]   (buzzing)
