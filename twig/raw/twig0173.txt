[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.920]   Yeah it's just excellent. Excellent.

[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.240]   today Lamar. Thanks for coming. Thank you. It's been a while since I've been here so it's
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.840]   great to see you all. You're looking youthful. You've had a baby and it's crazy.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.560]   I know a lot of stuff. It's true. A lot of this happens the last time we talk.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.240]   Congratulations on that. Oh thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So I hear you had a you got to visit
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.240]   the Googleplex recently and you got to be in on a super secret meeting with all the like really
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.320]   higher up people in charge and we've got all kinds of like cool secrets to share with us about Google
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.040]   about the inner workings of Google. Yeah they make sure my blinds are closed so they don't try to
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.160]   shoot me. All right yeah so we're set. So last Wednesday I went to the Googleplex. Now what's
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.560]   funny about this is I'm you know I'm friends with a VidCon doctor who's you know the senior VP.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.760]   This is through Google+ and I've kind of established a friendship with them. So I sent him an email
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.800]   maybe about two weeks ago and I was like you know I know YouTube and Google+ are starting to do this
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.160]   merge. I said it's going to be some backlash. You need to you need to you know talk to some
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.360]   YouTube people about this and he wrote me back and was like what backlash YouTube partners are
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.200]   they love this idea they're all on board and I was like someone is protecting you from the new
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.040]   that truth doesn't this is not true. So I I sent him an elaborate email just broken down
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.160]   for him the issues and by six hours later he messaged me back and says we have to have a meeting
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.760]   either you come up here or we do a Google+ hangout. Now here's where the idiot in me
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.600]   didn't get it. I chose to drive six hours for a 30 minute meeting.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.640]   Resting was doing a Google+ hangout but I wanted to see theplex. I'm new here to California.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.600]   So it was-- - But Lamar did you go to the swag store?
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.480]   - I did not. It was very-- it was very-- I have very limited time and you know by the time I got
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.840]   there and at the meeting it was time to have that. - That's the reason you go ahead and go so you
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.560]   need to be wearing t-shirts today. It was great stuff. - I am going back sometime in January to get
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.600]   the real tour. I was guaranteed that. - I'm telling you go to the swag store they got great stuff.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.160]   They got it. They got an Android ski hat with all the ears out but it's wonderful. But anyway go ahead.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.920]   - Yes. So I met with my good friend. And I got to say he is so gracious. Like you know he's
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.800]   over so much stuff and to have me a user come by and talk to him was just
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   was just really wonderful. So I sat with him his chief of staff and a great guy from-- I believe his
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.720]   name is Shashir from YouTube. And we just wanted to hear my point of view on it. So I just kind of
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.560]   want to relay that to you all since you don't really get a lot of YouTube news here. Basically
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.960]   what YouTube is trying to do is merge-- as you all know they try to merge Google+ and all of their
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.360]   items together into one cohesive thing. The problem on YouTube is that as they're slowly starting to
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.320]   do it there are a lot of problems that creep up whereas a lot of people who subscribe to us don't
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:40.200]   get our videos. Things get broken. And we do make money off the videos as partners so that
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.560]   definitely impacts us. And it impacts Google because they don't get their percentage off of it. So
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.760]   I would think it would be in our interest to kind of fix those problems. And what I told
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.200]   Vic is I sat there. I sat down and said, "Do you want to hear the truth?" And he said, "Yeah,
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   be honest." I said, "The YouTube partners by and large hate Google+. I just--"
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.640]   Wow. In sugar coat it. No, I didn't because I get so much feedback from it. It's not that it's
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.640]   a bad service. It's kind of how it's rolled out. If you remember when it was rolled out,
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:16.200]   it took about six months to get the teenagers on board. And as we know on YouTube, the majority of
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.400]   the audience is 13 through 17. So imagine me all excited about Google+ as I was saying,
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.960]   "Hey, everybody come join Google+. It's going to be great." And they're like, "We can't join."
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.320]   And that kind of killed a lot of the buzz. They didn't really take that into consideration.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.640]   Taylor toured the geeks, but didn't tailor towards the long-term plan, which was the YouTube people.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:44.360]   So that created a sour note right at the beginning with it. And YouTube keeps pushing Google+.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.800]   And now I need to say, I enjoy the service. I use it. I'm a big fan of it. But most of the people
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.160]   who use YouTube, that's not where the audience is. Their audience is on Twitter,
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:59.480]   it's on Facebook, Tumblr, increasingly Instagram. And something to ask for a fifth network is a
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.040]   little bit too much for some of them. And you think about some of the bigger partners,
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.040]   whether it's I Justine, Phil DeFranco, or even to a lesser extent myself. We've been on a
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.160]   suggested user list. We've been blessed with that. I got 1.3 million people. Phil DeFranco has
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.760]   close to a million. I think I just think it's around there. The problem is we post to Google+
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:29.560]   and I know for myself after a day, I look at the analytics or two, 500 people out of 1.3 million
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.880]   people have bothered to see the video. Now, and I mentioned that to Vic, I said, "Something is wrong
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:40.440]   with this." I said, "Maybe I'm just horrible with videos, but I have to think that a percentage,
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.880]   some people would just click it just to see who this dude is." And I said, "People are
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.800]   signing up, but they're not staying around." I said, "So there's little incentive for a
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   YouTuber to push this if nobody's there. Think about I just think she puts a video up. Maybe 100
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.920]   people will plus want it. She has over 1 million subscribers on YouTube. There's a problem there
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.560]   that no one's really talking about.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:10.280]   So what do you just context here before you go on? What do you understand the
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:16.120]   integration is going to mean in terms of the YouTube experience versus the Google+ experience?
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.760]   Oh, I'm definitely going to get to that in just a second.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.480]   Okay, yeah. Absolutely. So when YouTube starts mentioning this merger, obviously,
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:29.400]   it's alarming. Anytime YouTube has done anything, we've been up in arms and gone crazy about it
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.160]   because we're losing subscribers, we're losing all kinds of things that are getting broken.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.120]   One thing that they've done is they, with the new
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:46.600]   Outline it or the new dashboard that it's coming out with, is that they're removing the ability to,
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:52.200]   for you, let's say, Jeff, you're a subscriber to me. You won't be able to see my videos right away,
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:57.640]   unless you explicitly click a small button that says uploads only. And their reasoning is,
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:04.360]   well, let's say Jeff is only subscribed to two people and he's already seen those two people's
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:11.480]   videos. We don't want something blank to be there. But the issue is, if I'm subscribing,
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.800]   which means I want to see it, I want to be able to see everything versus some random
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.360]   videos that I liked or some other people commented. So one of my suggestions,
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:26.120]   just put the recommended videos after it. So it's a continuous stream. It's little stuff like that
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.040]   that are problems for YouTube subscribers. Only 10 or 12% of our subscribers see our videos.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:41.080]   I have 130,000 subscribers. If I get 10 to 15,000 views, it's a good day. That's a big number.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.200]   And that's the big number. So to answer your question about the merger,
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.560]   after I said all this, Vic explained it like this. First of all, you can now,
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.920]   like I did, merge your Google+ with your YouTube so you can use your real name. I think that's great.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:01.480]   It saved me. Now I can use my real name to market. Or you can choose not to, but I do like that
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:08.120]   integration. One of the things that Vic and then they told me is that they want everything
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.840]   integrated. So here's an example, Gina. Let's say someone types in Gina Tripani,
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:20.200]   excuse me, Tripani on Google and Google search. Wouldn't it be great if on the right side it
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:27.240]   popped up? Gina is on YouTube. Subscribe now. Gina is on Google+. Follow or circle now.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:32.040]   The buttons are just right there for instant follows and subscribers. So that will actually
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.640]   build our numbers. That's something they're working on for the merger, which is good.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:42.360]   Another thing which some partners may or may not like is that they eventually want to merge
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:48.120]   circles and subscribers together. I was going to ask that. Yeah. It's a confusing,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.160]   I'll say for the mainstream person, it's kind of confusing to what does subscribe mean.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.360]   Does it mean you have to pay? Could we hear subscriptions from magazines? We know what that
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.560]   means. Well, here's the other thing, Lamar. One of the secrets of Google+ that's a secret,
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:09.320]   but one of the obvious things about Google+ is you have a million people following you,
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.200]   circling you. They don't see everything that you put in. The algorithm filters. The algorithm
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.640]   tries to give people what the algorithm thinks they're going to be interested in.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.800]   So there's no guarantee that when you say, hello world, the end of the rule is coming,
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.960]   but those people are going to see what you do. Whereas I think in YouTube, if I subscribed to you,
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.960]   I'm pretty much assured to get a renewed video because I chose to subscribe to you. It's a different
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.440]   verb, but it's also a different system. That's part of the problem is that we think that's how
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:43.080]   it should be, but I couldn't get a clear answer from the guy. Another coin. I said, do 100% of
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:48.840]   the people subscribe to me? Will they 100% get my video? Because if they do, then I understand
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.960]   in my fault that I need to change my content. I'm not appealing to them, but I am convinced that
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:12:00.200]   100% of people are not getting the videos. On Google+ I can guarantee you because otherwise,
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:06.680]   I send out some really wonky crap. At some point, somebody in Thailand would say, you're boring me.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:13.240]   Google+ is choosing not to send that. When I spoke to Google+ team about 30, 40 people,
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.440]   when I was last at Mountain View, I alluded to this and they kind of in that smug way,
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:25.080]   nodded. I was on to something there that I was right. It is algorithmic.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:30.440]   There ought to be a way that what you can do, of course, is that somebody can go in on you and
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:36.280]   push the bar over and say, I want to see everything Lamar has, but that requires a real effort.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.440]   To do that, you got to know what exists and you got to go do it.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.600]   This is interesting. This is why it didn't. This is kind of the same reason. I feel like
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:50.520]   newsfeed ranking is kind of the new SEO war. Wasn't this why Cuban said that he was upset about
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:56.440]   Facebook? He was leaving Facebook because people weren't seeing the team post and he didn't want
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.720]   to have to pay to have the post appear. Of course, they weren't before anyway because Facebook also
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.960]   operates algorithmically and what it feeds to you in a newsfeed. You're up to the right, Gina.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:11.000]   Whereas, but the other secret about this is Twitter. I don't even use my Twitter
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.240]   main feed anymore because it just got too big and I don't want to groom it. So I have a media
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:21.400]   wonk's feed and I have other lists that I have. So the truth is that we all think that there's some
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:27.240]   numbered audience of the stuff we put out there and it's not true. It's not true. With
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.840]   old days of blogs and web pages, you did get server stats to know who opened your page and
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:38.600]   who wasn't a robot doing that. You're asked to write, Gina, in all of the feed stuff,
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:44.920]   there's absolutely no guarantee. I suspect Lamar, tell me if I'm wrong here. I suspect that when
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:50.280]   when someone subscribed to you on YouTube and they looked at their subscriptions,
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:55.480]   they would see you at least. You were guaranteed that YouTube wasn't going to decide not to give me
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.760]   episode 267 of Lamar because I don't think you're going to like it, Jeff.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.040]   That's the problem. I can't get a concrete answer on that because on YouTube, on YouTube, it's on
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:14.840]   the old YouTube. On the old YouTube, the way it was, the way you're concerned about preserving,
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.960]   if I subscribed to you and I went to my subscriptions, I would see every episode. Is that not true? The
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.560]   old way. That is my understanding. Yes. That's how that's how it was. And it was, I mean, the sub boxes
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.520]   would be broken sometimes, but at least we knew the people who subscribed. It was less people at the
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.520]   same time. We have to understand that as well. It's more people.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:41.800]   Now, I think that on the, Gene is absolutely right. And so what happens is that these companies
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.560]   will come to you. Twitter is doing it in its own way saying, well, you know, not that many
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.720]   people really see it. We won't say that, but we can charge you to really make sure you're being seen.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:57.080]   Facebook is doing the exact same thing. Google hasn't done that yet. But from both the producers
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:02.040]   angle, but especially from the users angle, you know, I want to see everything you post. If the
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.280]   algorithm showed me everything you post and you think, well, I wrote this thing and maybe I didn't
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.040]   plus Jeff Jarvis in it, but you know, I thought he'd be interested in this and he's a silent one.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:15.960]   What a jerk. Right. That breaks the link that these social things are supposed to create, right?
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.440]   Yeah. I mean, the verbiage is interesting. You know, when you say subscribe, if I subscribe to a
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.440]   magazine like old school style, I don't expect that I'm only getting at the issues that the company
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.080]   is determined that I might like, you know, based on the information they have about me. I assume
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.680]   that I'm going to get every issue, just like if I subscribe to a feed in my news reader, which is
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:38.040]   also kind of old school now, right? I expect that I'm going to get every post and that and that feed.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:44.120]   So yeah, you are kind of taking the risk with, you know, with if they're going to merge subscriptions
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:50.360]   and circles as the content creator, you're really at a disadvantage. I mean, if you look at it,
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.040]   though, from Google's perspective, like they have to build this stuff. There's a very there's a small
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:58.920]   group of content creators and there's a vast community of consumers, right? So they have to
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.320]   optimize this for the consumers. So from their perspective, they only want to show the stuff that
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:08.600]   they think is interesting. So if Lamar does a video on Android and Google knows that I'm, you know,
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.080]   big Android fan and user, you know, that should pop up in my news feed. But if it's about something
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:18.040]   about dogs, you know, maybe maybe it won't be. I mean, that puts Lamar at a disadvantage, but it's
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.840]   supposed supposedly a better experience for me. I mean, just kind of trying to argue the other side.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.320]   Sorry, wouldn't there be a fairly simple fix, though, that that function that says you could move the
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:32.440]   bar over to the right and see everything somebody says, if you just kind of reminded me of that
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.360]   regularly, it would have two features. One is that I could say I want to see everything Lamar does.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:42.280]   I want to see everything that Gina and Leo do. But it also tells me, oh, gosh, I guess I'm not
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:47.160]   seeing everything from everybody else. And it would be a clearer experience, I think, at least.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.840]   So what do they say to you? Did they not that you and
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:17:00.200]   expathetic? Yeah, they completely acknowledged it. The YouTube engineer says, well, hey,
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.640]   you know, we realize that only a certain percentage get videos, but mostly he said most of your video
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:11.880]   views will come from search from related videos and, you know, and from sharing. And that's just
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:16.440]   kind of a that wasn't a concept. You know, I wasn't. No, it's not at all. Because you want to have a
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:21.960]   whole point of you existing as a career. And the point of YouTube backing you is they want you to
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:27.480]   be a brand. And it shouldn't come up through SEO through links through search. That should be
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.400]   ancillary to you. You should have a loyal following. And that's where your value is, right?
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:37.720]   Exactly. So what I told them is like, look, this is if you're going to do it like this,
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:42.440]   this is fine. But the mistake that you all are continually making, which is a Google mistake,
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:47.160]   is they throw something out there and then try to explain it later. And I got the, you know,
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:52.760]   the YouTube guy who's a great guy to acknowledge that and say he says I need to do a better job
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:58.360]   of letting my staff know so they can let you know. Because the YouTube staff, and I said, you
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.200]   know, just they don't do a good job when we have these partner meetings. It's the same
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.840]   mo, same old, you asked them a direct question. They can't answer it. Either they can't or they
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.680]   won't. I don't know what the issue is. But the thing is communication, if they told us,
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:17.000]   this is the 10 step plan to the merge with Google+, see what he told me is that we're only
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.200]   at 10%. And if we're only, and so there's going to be problems, why not tell everybody that?
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.360]   So we know that, hey, there's going to be some growing pains right now. We're not at 100% of
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.560]   this merger. You know, that'd be, you know, that'd be helpful. One more thing I suggested is that,
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.960]   look, it doesn't have to be me. It could be, I just think it could be filled with fragrance.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.480]   It could be those 100 original channels that are some of them are getting cut, but some of them
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:46.600]   are staying around. Somebody needs to be a champion for this Google+, and for YouTube. So get a liaison
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.040]   to say you're absolutely right. You're absolutely right. I've been arguing that
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:56.760]   somebody I who doesn't like me wrote a column in the New York Times last week arguing that we need
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:03.240]   auditing of algorithms. And I disagree with that. There's this kind of demonization of algorithms.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.040]   But what I have said for a long time when it came to disputes over AdSense or over Google
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:14.520]   downgrading a site because it was presumed to be spam, that there needs to be an appeals process,
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:19.320]   not just to Google, which in those cases has the power of God, but to some kind of jewelry of your
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:24.520]   peers, some kind of group. And Google just doesn't think, you know, humanly enough for that. But I
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.320]   absolutely agree. I think if they had kind of a users council, a producers council from YouTube
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:36.120]   to be able to, you know, it's not their company. That's not a boat. But it's just so you can hear
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.600]   and know what's going on. And also try to give some input like you, you went, you drove six hours
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:46.040]   just to give them free advice. Exactly. So, you know, I obviously, when I do it,
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:50.520]   what I beat a liaison, of course, I would, but hey, get get someone with a big audience, make
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:56.280]   those 100 original channels, force them to have to use Google plus. And I don't mean just putting
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:01.720]   their videos there. That's not using Google plus. That's that's throwing it at CEO, you know,
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:06.120]   using it, integrating with it, getting to like it. So they'll your brand community there, right,
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.360]   which is what they want. And they want, they want to know who likes you. And they want to know
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.520]   who likes you and like something else. And that's that's where the value to Google comes in and all
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.920]   this. Let me ask you to request Lamar on this whole kind of announcement that they were going to cut
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:22.920]   a bunch of channels and fund a bunch of news channels. Was that like trying to work in a newspaper
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.960]   these days where you wonder if you're going to be the one to get fired? How did that all work?
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:30.920]   Well, you know, it doesn't affect anyone like me because I was, you know, these were specific
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:35.160]   channels that were funded and given angel investing. Well, I'm probably using the wrong word, but
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.440]   they were given specific funding from you. And there, I mean, I saw off the beginning, I looked at
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:45.240]   the list and I just knew which ones are going to be cut because, you know, I'm getting more views
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:50.680]   and a lot of them and I'm not getting a penny from Google to do anything. So I knew they were
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.680]   going to be cut. There's going to be some more specific ones coming in, they're going to tailor.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.960]   One thing I mentioned, I was a little upset about is they didn't have a tech vertical at all.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.560]   You know, all of these channels, you know, they got a Shaq network, you got the Madonna,
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.480]   dance on it. I said, where's the tech people? But, you know, maybe they'll work in that on some
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.760]   point. But no, that's something I was worried about. They're trying to build these shows to
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:18.840]   be like TV. The reason why so many of them are failing and my humble opinion is for that reason.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.240]   YouTube audiences don't want TV when they go to YouTube. They want YouTube. They want personality.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:28.520]   It's one of the reasons I changed my content to be more personable because I was trying to be a
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:35.080]   show for so long and it shows just do not work on a whole on YouTube. There are a couple exceptions,
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:40.600]   but most of the time it just doesn't work. You absolutely need to be an ambassador for the
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:46.440]   content creators on YouTube. I mean, it's clear that Google needs community ambassadors,
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:53.000]   both producers and consumers, but Lamar, I nominate you because you know what they need to do.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.760]   So it's interesting. I didn't realize there are YouTube partners who have a relationship with
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:05.240]   Google that involves an advertising relationship. But then there's this second level where producers
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:10.280]   get funded, production gets funded. So Google doesn't give you money and says, make an episode.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:15.000]   You just make your episode, but then you have a deal with them and make revenue through advertising.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.960]   Is that correct? That's my deal. That's 99% of YouTube's deal. This thing would happen
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.560]   last year. I don't know if it's called the original channels or premium channels.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:31.560]   Yeah, each of them got anywhere up to a million dollars to make a production.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:37.400]   And then Google would keep all of the money that it would make off advertising. A lot of them just
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.520]   didn't, they didn't make the numbers. They weren't getting the views.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.680]   Oh, so that was kind of an advance. Google would keep all the money until you made back
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:50.280]   your advance and you'd make over that? Absolutely. And what was weird is that it should be in
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:55.640]   YouTube's interest or Google's interest to push those channels. But I can only tell you
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.040]   of a few of the names of the channels without looking at the list. A lot of them just weren't
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.800]   pushing. That's what a lot of complaints are privately coming from is that, hey, you want to
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   counseling us about how many times did you all promote us? Talk again for a second,
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:15.960]   Laura, about the secrets of success for YouTube channel, personality. But are there channels
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:23.400]   that have content? Are they purely entertainment? What are some of the things that make to your mind
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:30.040]   a business success on YouTube? I think personality is first and foremost. And that's where a lot of
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:36.200]   people failed. That's where I was failing for a while, because I didn't, it's about the audience.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.880]   And as much as I'm a control freak and like to control my stuff, I have to acknowledge that
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:45.000]   without the people watching the channel, it doesn't exist. So that's first and foremost.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.400]   And yeah, you got to have great content. I know that's cliche to say, have great content,
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:54.600]   but you really have to have something that appeals. If I have 13th or 17 year old to majority
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:01.240]   watching me, which they do, I have to appeal to that group. If it's a bunch of boys,
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.560]   I better not do too many videos on one direction.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:11.480]   I have girls, I better not make it too geeky and tech heavy. So you have to look at your,
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:17.480]   I look at my stats almost every week to try to tailor the videos to specifically match
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:24.920]   and a lot of it is just luck, Jeff. I'm honest, you can have, I mean, you can have everything down
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:30.040]   and you understand marketing 100% on YouTube, but a lot of it just comes down to luck. Who shares you
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.520]   and who provides? I thought you said looks, I honestly thought you said looks. And of course,
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:40.840]   that was, I know why you succeed them. You're the handsome guy on YouTube. I get it.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.440]   He is one handsome fellow. Yeah, have more numbers than that.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:53.480]   It sounds like you're saying, Lamar to have a successful YouTube channel, which I think is the
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.840]   I think is the golden rule for any kind of content online is knowing your audience,
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.360]   interacting with your audience, using analytics to figure out what your audience wants, giving
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:05.320]   them what they want, but also remaining true to yourself and doing the content that you're
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.840]   passionate about because if you're not passionate about it, that's gonna, that's gonna come across,
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.160]   right? But like striking that balance between your ideas and your inspiration, but also knowing
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.960]   your audience and serving them what they want or what you think that they want.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:23.480]   Connecting with them. What you and Jeff does, is it any different? It's the same principles for
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:29.720]   blogging or for this show. You know, you do things to connect to the audience and that's why it works
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:35.640]   for you all. Well, we also, we also sit in the panumbra of Leo Laport. Yeah. And you know,
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.000]   somebody at my school said, last week, when's Leo back? You know, he doesn't get any views
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.960]   without Leo there. I thought, well, thanks a lot. But it's true. You know,
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:53.000]   Leo's an magnet. And he really has the spirit. And last week, it's hard to get into it last week
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.240]   when I sat in in Gina's chair, you know, the second substitution, it's a different mindset,
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.840]   right? It's a different mindset of thinking, Oh my God, I keep this thing going and what's happening
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.360]   and, you know, it's sort of talked enough and all this kind of stuff. And to be friendly and
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:10.120]   inviting. And those are all the things that Leo keeps in his head that we don't have to.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.520]   Yeah. You know, we got to have opinions. We got to talk. We got to do this. We got to do that. But
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.560]   we really, you know, don't have to do that. Does YouTube ever try to give you advice about how to
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:25.960]   be better, succeed, more get more audience or anything like that? Yeah, yeah, they do. I've gotten
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.360]   personal calls from, you know, YouTube reps, or they, you know, when they have these partner
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:35.400]   meetings that are a lot general, they've also come up with a playbook, which gives first time
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:40.600]   people the basics and on how to do your titles, how to optimize for search. But I want to be honest,
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:46.360]   that playbook and all of those general things work for the very, very beginner after that,
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:53.560]   you have to play ball. And I am not saying you have to do anything unethical, whatever, but you
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:59.080]   have to play ball with everybody else. You try to be 100% up and up and do it exactly by the book.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:03.000]   It just will not work. They want it. They want everybody to do it like that. But it's not,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:10.360]   it's not, you know, the realistic thing on YouTube. You got to do what you got to do to make a living.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.840]   And I, for the longest time, I've been, you know, the super moral guy and having jumped in. So,
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:19.560]   it's frustrating to look at other people fly past me who aren't doing half of what I'm doing
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:24.840]   as far as quality, but, you know, they're doing science stuff. Yeah, you got, you got a hustle.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.640]   You got a hustle. I mean, I think when you're right online too, it's tough when you see other,
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:33.720]   other publications doing crazy slide shows and fly over. You know, the kind of page view trickery
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.400]   that people do and they get crazy page views, but they're doing it. But, you know, you got a hustle,
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.640]   like you said, sometimes, yeah, I mean, I imagine that Google's playbook for getting better at
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:46.840]   YouTube is using various tools, you know, to share and to, you know, promote. And I'm sure they
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.440]   offer analytics tools and that kind of thing. But yeah, it seems like that would be the, the,
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.480]   the basics, right? And then once you're in it, you got to, you got to do your thing.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:59.720]   Yeah. So yeah, and just, just to make sure Google and everybody is aware, I mean, I,
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.960]   I have no issues with Google+, I have no issues with, with YouTube other than
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:10.200]   better communication on what's, on what's going on. And, and I think that came across to Vic,
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.840]   he really appreciated it and, and she'll share and while I'll talk to the man, like, I love the
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:19.880]   services. I really do. That's how I'm, you know, primarily make a living. So I just, we just
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:25.720]   wanted to be better because like as I told them, guys, if you don't fix this, you lose money and,
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.480]   and I lose money. So don't you want to make them money and they should appreciate it. They
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.560]   should appreciate it greatly as I'm sure they do. And as you say, Vic's a very, a very gracious
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:38.760]   guy. And yeah, you, you went out of your way, six hours out of your way to give them attention.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.800]   All right. One last question. Did you at least get a free lunch out of this?
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:49.720]   Get a free lunch. I, now I got to say I did while I had Vic in their in office. I was like,
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.640]   you know, dude, I'm here six hours next to seven. You know, I'm just saying
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:29:02.280]   it didn't work. It didn't work. It didn't work. You know, I think there's a larger question here
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.880]   about the merge about merging YouTube and Google plus. And I think we talked about this a little
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.040]   bit when you're here last time, Lamar, is this idea that you have this really established community
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:17.080]   with, with, with rules and kind of social norms at YouTube that's very established community. And
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:22.040]   then you have this kind of new thing, Google plus, and you can kind of see, you can kind of imagine
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:26.920]   how these are going to merge, right? So thumbs up, become plus ones comments, become actual Google
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:33.480]   plus comments, you know, subscribe, become, you know, circle. And it all becomes kind of the same,
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:37.400]   the same thing. But you know, you, you always risk, I think when you have someone like you,
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:41.160]   Lamar, who's embedded in the community, who loves the platform and make a living off the platform and
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.400]   who engage in the platform, there's a difference between being the user and being a creator. I
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:50.360]   mean, that the folks at Google, they've always been very analytical and maybe a little divorced from
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:54.680]   kind of the human aspect of these tools. I mean, in their mind, merging the two makes a lot of sense
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:59.880]   and having this sort of, this consistent experience, I think is the word that they've used across all
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.280]   Google products that makes sense in the long term. But there's always that risk of that backlash,
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:08.840]   the established community, and the YouTube's been around, has it been 10 years? Oh, almost 10 years,
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.920]   right? It's just, it's just tough when you start changing the way that things work for the
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.680]   consumers and producers. And I just think in that process, it, you know, would behoove Google.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.200]   And I hope that they that someone there is listening and they take our advice to have sort of
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:24.520]   ambassadors and a liaison. And I'm glad that Vic called you up for a meeting. I'm glad you went
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:29.160]   up there. But that shouldn't have to happen after, you know, you wrote an essay to him in an email
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.840]   that there should be more open communication. So I hope to see that happen. And I'm interested
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:37.720]   to see what the next, what would you do? Do you have any idea what the next big change in YouTube,
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.680]   the, the, the classification of YouTube is going to be? Do you have any idea?
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:45.640]   I'm thinking they're really working on the real name thing. Like that's, that's the thing they're
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:53.080]   pushing even for channels to have a page on Google+, now already people are, you know,
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:58.120]   not liking that idea because to them is like they're forcing us to use this, this service that
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:03.800]   we don't want to use. But I think they, I think they want to establish like Facebook to have the
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:08.200]   real name so they can weed out, you know, just just like what happened with Facebook Connect
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:13.880]   hit tech crunch. And weed it out a whole bunch of garbage, immediately. And I think they want to
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.720]   do that for YouTube comments and things. I think that's the next step. And then that's a really
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:21.160]   important point you're right because the comments on YouTube are, are, are paying.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:26.680]   They're horrible. Right. So, classification there probably would really improve those, right? I mean,
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:32.680]   in theory, and a plus one button, I'm an advocate for the plus one button versus thumbs up and
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:37.960]   thumbs down. Not because I'm a weenie and can't handle thumbs down is that it doesn't, it doesn't
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:43.480]   really do any justice. I don't, I mean, there's a reason why Facebook hasn't had it or Google
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.760]   doesn't have it. You know, if you like the video, you plus one, if you don't, you leave, get out,
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:53.800]   go somewhere else. So, that's my reasoning as a, as a creator. So, I think the signals from
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.000]   plus one will definitely benefit us in search. So I'm looking forward to it.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.320]   Well, this has been a great, great report. I really appreciate this. And, and you're sticking
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:05.960]   around for the whole show. So we can talk about lots of things. Gina and I are kind of sharing
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:10.040]   Leo duties. She's opening the show and closing the show and I'll try to keep some things going
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:15.080]   and go to commercials and stuff. But before we do that, Gina, ready for the changelog?
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.200]   Let's do it.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:22.040]   Chad, Chad, the Google changelog.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.520]   I tried to talk slowly for the, for the, the sequel there. But, but, but.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:36.840]   A little bit of a pause. That's okay. A couple of new things in the Google verse this week,
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:41.160]   even though it's a short week here in the US, a Thanksgiving tomorrow. We got updated blogger
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:46.120]   mobile apps for Android and iOS. You haven't looked at blogger in a while. You can, you can
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:50.600]   now post about how annoying your, your uncle Bob is at Thanksgiving dinner right from your iPad
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:55.640]   or Android device. We get the apps are getting landscape support for composing posts, sharing
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:01.080]   to Google plus, unsurprisingly, international support for 30 plus languages and iPad support.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:05.880]   So you can find those in the play store and the iOS app store. Google Drive has a couple of
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:11.000]   newish little things, just little things. You can now search for files by the person who shared
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.680]   them with you. And you can also launch Google Earth map files, can't dot kml and KMS files
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:21.960]   right inside Google Drive and view them on the web. Google takeout, which is the data liberation
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.440]   fronts product, which helps you export your data from Google products, just got two new products
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:32.040]   added to it. Google latitude, you can now download a JSON file with your location data.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:36.520]   And in Google reader, you can always, you've always been able to export your data within reader,
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:41.800]   but you can now export XML file. I'm sorry, you've always been able to export your subscriptions
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:48.120]   from reader, but now you can export an XML file of your list of starred, shared, and following items
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:54.360]   to JSON files as well, to an XML or JSON file. Excuse me. This was a new feature in Google plus,
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.320]   which was kind of new to me. And I didn't actually see any articles written about it,
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:03.720]   but I just happened to notice it. If you go to a person's profile page in Google plus,
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.320]   at the bottom of the page, all the way at the bottom, there's a little button, there are a
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:12.440]   little area that says add private contact details about this person. So if I go to say
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:17.960]   Jeff's page, Google plus, I can say add private contact details. I can say, oh, Jeff's, you know,
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:22.280]   son's name is this, and we met at this conference and he co-hosts Twig with me. And those are just
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:27.400]   private contact details and those integrate back into Gmail as well. So I really love this,
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:31.400]   because I circle people a lot on Google plus, or I follow people on Twitter, and then later on,
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:36.360]   I forget, you know, where did I meet this person? Why did I follow them? So this is pretty cool. So
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:42.920]   this is a kind of a go ahead when you when you do add those. Is it labeled so that it's clear to
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.280]   you what's private, what's not? So you don't have kind of a Facebook confusion of, oh my god,
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.480]   I don't know what's public. Yeah, there's a line right above it that says these are these are
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.280]   only visible to you. Beautiful, smart. And it shows up in your Gmail contacts as well, those
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:59.320]   those details that you added. So I like that I now I want this in every social network I use.
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:06.040]   And finally, Google Earth and Google Maps got some new high resolution aerial and satellite imagery.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.440]   If you check out the Space Needle in Seattle, you can you can see it some of that and new 45
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:15.480]   degree angle imagery for cities around the world. US cities and 20 more international cities,
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:21.720]   Luxembourg and Romania. And you can check those out at Google Earth and Google Maps. That's all I
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.280]   got. It's a great change log. Excellent. Chad.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:34.600]   Google's also been pushing that shopping season as insane shopping season starts.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.920]   They have a lot of maps up now to malls and shopping areas and stuff on there.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:45.400]   I don't have a good segue. So speaking of shopping, you take your credit cards with you.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:51.640]   So that makes us think of one of our dearest sponsors. And here's our partner Leo.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.400]   Excuse me. Pardon me. Hello. Excuse me. Jeff, Gina, would you mind if I
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:03.560]   bopping here briefly to ask you, are you saving money? Gina, are you saving money for Eddas
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:09.720]   college education? Yes, I know. She's a newborn right now. But I got to tell you, take it from me.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:14.440]   I got a 20 year old, 19 year old. She's going to be in college before you know it.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.280]   And if you don't start saving now, you might be in trouble. So I got an idea for you.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:23.000]   If you got if you're saving for a rainy day, if you're saving for college or saving for health
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.360]   care, I know a lot of us just put a portion of what we earn right in the bank.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:31.080]   Maybe you try to save up for a nice forward, huh? Or a down payment on a house.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:37.160]   I hope, you know, we're all disciplined enough to do it. But can I make a recommendation?
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:43.960]   A great way to get more from your savings, the American Express personal savings high yield
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:48.120]   savings account. High yield means you're going to get more than your bank offers.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.520]   It's nice because it integrates perfectly well with your bank. You don't have to change
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:57.560]   financial institutions. It's an online savings account. So you can link it to your existing accounts,
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:04.280]   automatically transfer money as needed back and forth. You can keep track of your balance via a
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:11.880]   phone or the web 24/7. There's no minimums, no fees. You got like that. And you get that high
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:17.480]   yield and great phone support whenever you want to talk to someone. This is a great complement to
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.320]   your existing financial tools. And this is probably where you should be putting that money for ETA.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:27.640]   The American Express personal savings high yield savings account is an FDIC insured account offered
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:32.520]   by the American Express Bank FSB for your savings needs. Now, how do you find out more? It's simple.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:46.120]   Personalsavings.com/onlinesavings. Personalsavings, one word.com/onlinesavings. I'm typing it in. I just
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:50.920]   want to see if I got the right place. There you go. You're going to like this. You're going to
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:57.400]   really like this, especially the high yield. Give it a try today. Personalsavings.com/onlinesavings.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:03.640]   That's the high yield savings account from American Express Bank FSB member FDIC. We thank Amex.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:08.360]   I'm going to try to get Amex to be on this show for a long time because I'm a... What was it,
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:15.880]   Jeff? You said I'm a member since 1981. You said like 1974. Wow. And we thank them so much for their
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:23.880]   support. Back to you, Jeff and Gina. Isn't that great? The video keeps us in the conversation even
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:29.640]   when it's disembodied. Like, I really got a set up one of those accounts for my baby. I'm all stressed
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:38.120]   on my college now. I'm going to sleep for days. That's what I'm going to do. So I think Leo's landing
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:43.080]   momentarily. So maybe God knows, maybe he'll dash into the show if we go long enough. But I suspect
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:47.640]   he's just getting in now. So you'll see Leo next week, fear not. But for now, you've got to see
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:52.760]   him in commercials, which gives you more reason to watch the commercials. All right. So other news.
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:39:02.840]   I am jazzed about the word that Google and Dish Network are reportedly talking about
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:09.800]   Google starting a phone network with Dish. I saw Charlie Egan Ergun, the head of Dish at an
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:13.160]   off the record business conference last week where it's no big deal. He talks about it all the time.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:17.160]   He owns a bunch of bandwidth now. And he's been doing deals and this kind of stuff.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.040]   But he could start a phone network. And what a perfect partner.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:24.440]   Wouldn't you just jump onto the Google telco? What do you guys think?
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:29.640]   If they do it right. Yeah. And they have an opportunity to do it right.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:35.480]   They do. Word is that it would be a data only, right? With phone would just be the add on. Yeah,
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:40.520]   it's VoIP. That's Google voice. Isn't that the starting definition for us of doing it right
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:45.800]   is to recognize what really matters is data. After Sandy here, AT&T, you know, nicely enough
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:50.600]   said that they would forgive overages for minutes and texts for those of us in storm
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:55.160]   ravaged areas. But you know, the truth is we don't care about that. What we care about is data.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:02.840]   Absolutely. I have that Verizon plan that, you know, that the share everything, whatever it's
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:08.120]   called, where you know, the voice and texts and afterthought, you get it unlimited free.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:13.480]   And I love that because it's really putting emphasis on the data. That's what we're all using. So
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:18.120]   I will love phone over. I never want to have a landline again in my life. You know, so everything
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:23.800]   needs to go over data to me. Totally agree. And honestly, I, this is, I mean, this is the kind
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.240]   of the dream is getting the data plan with the extra minutes. I'd like to get unlimited data and
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:31.720]   then just pay for whatever minutes I use because I just use so few. And honestly, with Google voice,
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.800]   you don't even really need to pay for texts. I'm pretty much a full time Google voice user. And so
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:41.800]   you send text messages via just your data connection. So that would be nice to you. Although Google
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:46.040]   voice has its problems, doesn't support MMS. And so, you know, that, and for a while there,
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:51.480]   there were some delays here and there. But yeah, I would be really excited. Google could do this.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.080]   This is Google's best interest, right, is to focus on data, right? Because Google.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:59.000]   Right. So let's talk about two things. You know, first, you said if they do it right,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.920]   Gina define what right means. What would be the ideal Google telco?
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:11.080]   Well, thinking completely from my, the way that I consume services on my phone and what I'd want,
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:16.360]   I would want pure, I'd want pure data or unlimited data. I'd want to pay primarily for data, like I
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:21.160]   said, with, with minutes as an add on, with texts as sort of an optional thing. And I don't want to
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:25.800]   freak in contract. I don't want to be locked into a contract for a few years. I want it to be more
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.800]   like in Europe where I could just be like, hey, I could switch to this phone or that phone or I
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:34.200]   mean, this is this gets into a carrier, you know, issue. I mean, obviously, if I was with the Google
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:39.240]   carrier, you know, I wouldn't I want the new create a package that's so compelling that I don't want
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:44.920]   to have to go go anywhere else. I'd want it to be I prefer a GSM just because I travel internationally.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:50.120]   And yeah, I just want them to undo all the crappy things that every other carrier does to you.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:55.000]   And I'd want them to do it because I'd want them to I'd want them to want to compel me to connect to
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.800]   Google everywhere and anywhere that I am. Right. So now, so tomorrow about you, what makes the ideal
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:06.600]   Google telco? I think what Gina said is perfect. Like, I want unlimited data. I don't want to have
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:11.880]   to think about metering. It's one of the things I hated about voice and I'm glad that's unlimited,
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.880]   but I hardly call anybody. I don't have friends. People don't call me. So I just
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:22.280]   want to limit it. I'd pay a hundred bucks flat for it and then just don't meter me.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:28.120]   And then allow me to have access. So I use almost everything Google. I don't have
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:33.640]   Android, but I do have I use everything all the services that Google offers. So I just want easy
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:38.600]   access to that and no restrictions or anything of that. And once you go ahead, you know,
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:44.040]   multi device consideration, right? I want to look, I've got a Chromebook. I've got a Nexus 10
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.440]   Nexus 7 tablet and I've got my Android phone and how can I share those connections between them
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:53.640]   without hacks or without crazy apps or just, you know, I'll pay a little extra reason
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.000]   price, whatever. I just want you to know who I am, what all my devices are. I want all my devices
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.320]   to be online. I want this to be one reasonably price package that's data centric. And I don't
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:05.720]   want I don't want to feel like I'm getting screwed over for data I'm not using or minutes I'm not
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:10.360]   using or that I'm losing, you know, services that I didn't use. I just want to feel good at both
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:14.840]   the multi device issue is definitely one. That's absolutely right. Yeah. And you know, I think it's
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:18.840]   clever if they don't position it as a telephone company because telephone is the old way. No,
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:23.800]   no, no, this is a data company. This is this is Wi-Fi on steroids. This is this is just reuse.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.920]   And oh, yeah, by the way, you can make phone calls because who cares about that? Who does that
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:32.200]   anymore? Right. And so it becomes a data company. So two things then about the business environment.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.960]   And the first is to Google's interest. I've said on the show before that it was Google's
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:41.960]   services, not absolutely, but services that drove me to Google hardware. And I'm really fully
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:47.800]   there now. I'm going to talk about this on a later show, but I am living through Android and Chrome
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:55.320]   and it's working. And because I use Gmail, Maps, Calendar, all this stuff, and it drove me to the
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:01.640]   hardware. And now I don't look back at Apple at all. There are now probably SCUD missiles coming
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:07.960]   into my home for saying that. But so Google can drive us to using their services more. I've
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.800]   said on the show too, this is a signal generator. Google will learn more about all of us.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.560]   It's in their interest. Now, the interesting thing to me, though, is what does this do to
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:22.920]   Google's relationship? Just as the hardware that they're making with a round robin of hardware makers
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:28.520]   to try to also keep Android going in that ecosystem, what does this clearly do to their
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:33.720]   relationship with the telcos? Is it is it is it free it from that? Does it mean that Verizon might
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:39.000]   stop selling any Android phones? Can they not do that? Because Android is too big now. Google's
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:45.240]   cleverly gotten that big. What do you think the reaction will be of existing telcos to a Google
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:52.200]   tel? Oh, they're going to be terrified of this. They don't like the ideal of Google voice to begin
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:57.720]   with. And for them to now step into their territory is going to put some pressure on them. I mean,
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.840]   I can imagine Samsung at some point saying, you know, that OS we were thinking about making for
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:08.200]   our phones. Maybe we'll go ahead and make that to please the carriers and sidestep Android or
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:12.280]   do something like Amazon Day, which is steal it and make it your own. But
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:18.840]   it's going to be some trouble that Google is stepping into too many areas. One of our
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:24.360]   upcoming stories is about power. They're stepping into that. It's like, where
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.520]   witness it in? And I know a lot of people are worried about that.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:35.720]   All right. So by the way, I still have I received my Google Nexus 4 8 gig only. And I am such an
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:41.400]   erotic so be I've still not opened it. I'm still going around. I got a mini sim. I'm waiting. Do
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:46.120]   I want to do it? Should I send it back? Happy? I'm really happy with my Google Nexus. Is it
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:51.160]   a waste of money? Should I wait till later and get a 16 gig? I don't know what to do. You got
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:56.920]   the advice? Should I open it? Not? I don't know how you're not. I don't know how you have a brand
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:01.720]   new shiny Nexus 4 in your presence and you have not opened it. You have much better
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:07.240]   willpower than I'd ever have. Oh my god. Are you dying to just break it out and peel that?
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:11.640]   I love to peel the thing off the front of the touchscreen. It's like the best part. Do it. Just
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:16.120]   open it. All right. Maybe I'll get it in the break. I also fear though. I've got to switch
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:20.120]   Sims. I'm afraid that in that process, the last time I did this switching from my iPhone to the
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:26.680]   Google Nexus, they took away my unlimited data and then a really, really nice guy, Mr. Hugo,
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:32.920]   who works in an AT&T store in the Midwest, out of nowhere, saw me on Twitter and said,
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:36.600]   I can't stand it when we make that mistake. He said, I want to fix it for you. It worked
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:40.280]   tomorrow. I didn't even know that he went in on his vacation day to do this. God bless you,
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:49.400]   sir. It's really great of him. Companies should have a million Mr. Hugo's and then life is good
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:52.680]   because then they actually cared about the customers. Anyway, I'm just scared of going
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:56.600]   switching Sims. I'm going to mess it up and I'm neurotic his hack. Would you open it, Lamar?
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:03.000]   Yeah. It would have been open and the box demolished and everything. I would have been very excited
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:09.400]   just to play with it. It could have some LTE. I'll be a little upset about that, but I won't argue.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:14.200]   Okay with that though. All right. Some other Android stuff while we're on this,
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:19.640]   have any of you, either of you gotten an invite to ingress or you can't Lamar because you're not on
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:26.280]   Android? Gina, have you gotten an invite to ingress? I haven't and I don't know if I'm happy or
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:32.840]   sad about that because it looks really cool and interesting. I have this weariness. I think I
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:36.360]   have the same neurosis that you have about gadgets about games. I'm always worried about
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:41.000]   for the most describing we know about it. It's like losing my whole life. I'm so scared. So I
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.480]   have not gotten invited. Although it looks really, really cool. Have you gotten invited? Have you
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.400]   played? No, I just said it and I'm not a game guy at all, but it looks really cool. Do you want to
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:54.520]   describe what it looks like, Gina? It's so I don't know that I even really have a good
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:48:01.400]   what I from what I understand. It's sort of a real world, massively, more, more game,
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:05.800]   basically multiplayer, aren't online role playing game. Is that correct? So it runs on your phone
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:10.280]   and from what I understand, it gets you outdoors and you sort of explore your neighborhood and
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:15.480]   there's some, you know, elaborate plot about the rebellion and there's the emissions in quests.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:21.080]   That's all. That's all I really know. And it comes from the same company, the same now division of
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:25.160]   Google was going to be a company that created the the tourist app. What's it called? I always
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:32.200]   forget. It's a general strategy, apparently a larry to get you to look up. Look up to get
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:37.800]   out that and look up. That's all about the glass. Right? Yeah. So Lamar, you're going to say,
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:44.360]   there's a huge problem with this. You're asking geeks to go outside and I'm not sure.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.080]   I'm not sure how that's going to go over well for them. So,
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.000]   well, I'm worried about what's going to happen.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.760]   I read a blog post where someone said a big gamer said, you know, he got got an invite and wound up
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:00.920]   going on sort of an impromptu two mile walk around his neighborhood because he was so engrossed in
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:06.920]   play. So that's that sounds really that sounds good. I mean, you know, some block people, so
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:13.800]   especially Southern California is but but yeah, it sounds really fun. And I do, I do, I want and
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.480]   invite. So I maybe I'll start. I actually got an invite guys.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.720]   Yeah, I did.
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:25.880]   Playing? Yeah, I have now. I only got it here. Let me see if I can find a camera. There we go.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:31.080]   I'm far, far away, but I only got this invite this morning. So I'm still on the tutorial mission.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:36.920]   What I'm doing right now is I'm walking around the world finding XM, which is
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:45.800]   this sort of matter that I need to move forward in the game. And so, man, I wish I
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:51.720]   let me see what I can do here with with showing you guys what's going on. This is going to be
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:56.360]   because I saw a video of it. If you wanted to show that. Oh, yeah, you know what? That's
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:03.240]   yeah, here. Let me show first. This is this is what I'm. It's time to go. There you go. Good.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:10.600]   Right. So this is what I have right now. And it's basically just a map. And there are little
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:18.680]   XM orbs around. So you can see them further off here in the game.
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:26.600]   Sorry, this is very impromptu. So these little orbs are things that I need to
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:33.320]   grab in the world. So this this trek would would be, you know, what I would do to pick up these
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:39.640]   these XM orbs. And there's a few over here. Once I do that, I'm not sure what I'm going to really do
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:45.720]   with these orbs. But that is what I'm in the middle of doing right now.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:50.360]   So you need to go outside physically go outside and do it? Are you on the on the app? So you have
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:56.200]   to go out in Petterland and walk down the block? Yeah. Yeah. So it it it it harkens back to the
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:04.120]   navigation in Google Maps when you do walk navigation to get to a place. You have the normal
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:10.520]   arrow and sort of a bubble around you. So you I would be walking around Petaluma trying to get
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:15.480]   these these orbs. Lamar so right. You're gonna see you're gonna suddenly see guys you've never seen
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:21.320]   outside with skin paler than mine walking around trying to look at the world. There's the problem
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:27.000]   that I had with it just in this tutorial mission is to figure out where I'm going to pick these up.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.280]   I'm actually walking down looking at my phone on top of that. I didn't have my headphones in. So
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:37.000]   like I was walking and then it was like mission update you bra bra and it started talking and
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.480]   there's people around me and that felt really weird like that my phone was telling me that I
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:49.000]   just got in a mission. Right exactly. And then on top of that it looked like I couldn't turn off
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:55.080]   my phone screen put it in my pocket walk in a direction and pick up these orbs. What I really
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:59.400]   wish would happen is it would say wow you've moved. Here's your history. This is the history
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:05.240]   that we've we've captured of you. You went from your house to work then to a place to get some food
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:11.160]   and then back to work during that that thing you picked up this this many orbs that'd be great but
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:15.560]   it looks like right now that functionality isn't in it and it is the biggest battery drain.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:23.560]   Yeah well basically it's turned you into Pac-Man. Pretty much yeah yeah except except a very
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:28.760]   immobile Pac-Man that has to look at their phone to make sure that they're going towards the correct
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:35.720]   orbs to get. You don't look up. Yeah you look down at your phone the whole time. Now now this is just
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:44.600]   the tutorial mission. The video which if I was good I'd have up already. The video it looks like
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:51.160]   you will go to maybe like art structures or points of interest that might be pulled from the field
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:57.240]   trip app and then you you may have to do something there. You may have to look at it or you may have
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:03.720]   to say something that you've learned. Maybe there's a plaque that you have to read to input into
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:10.280]   into the app. It's it's it's it's still open. I haven't gotten that far so I don't know.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:17.880]   It was interesting. Google's really never been into games like this before. True. True. True. This is
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:26.280]   I mean this is the first game other than Google doodles that I can think of that Google ever made
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:35.640]   and on top of that it's a full it's a fully featured app with voice actors and and a complete user
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:45.800]   interface. It seemed yeah it really seems like this is this is a step beyond and and I'm I hear
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:54.200]   let me go ahead and play the video that I have. It it it is hard to tell where they're going to go
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:59.560]   with with this where what they're what their game plan is or maybe it's just to have fun and to
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:06.200]   push the boundaries of Android and what the mobile space can do. There was a beef in the chat room
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:15.240]   said that Google needs you to visit places they need more info on. That would be hilarious. Yeah
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:21.000]   go to go to a restaurant and then what you have to input is the opening and closing time of that
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:28.520]   restaurant and then you get XP. Or if you think about something more like Sandy you know like
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:32.360]   missions that help people you know like some so a situation like Sandy go to this place pick up
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:36.760]   these supplies drop them off at this place. That'd be cool. Real physical supplies that would be
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:44.040]   amazing. Amazing. Go to the homeless shelter. Give some some soup to the homeless folks and then head
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:48.920]   back home. Right. Thanksgiving morning. If you if you spend time at the soup kitchen you get XP.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:55.080]   Right. For example. Right. And so right now in the video it looks like you can put down nodes and
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:55:00.840]   and then increase your your your then these two people meet each other like they're playing the
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:09.800]   same game like that would ever happen. And and maybe you can increase your your reach amongst the
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:16.760]   city. It seems like if you were into it and and instead of a Facebook check-in whenever you landed
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:23.560]   at a bar you opened up ingress and and started playing and putting down nodes. It might be compelling.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:29.960]   I just this tutorial mission might kill it for me that the fact that I have to go on a big long
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:35.400]   walk to and keep my phone on the whole time and look down at it to make sure I'm collecting orbs
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:40.040]   that might just be the killer. I might not be able to get past that. So Gina are you tempted or not?
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:45.880]   I am kind of tempted. I this sounds like a perfect game to to come pre-installed on the Google glass
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:50.680]   right so you don't have to look down. And it kind of happens automatically. I mean the only other game
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:55.000]   I've ever played game quote unquote that I've ever played that's really gotten me outside is
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:00.120]   or doing different things outside is four square. We go to a lot a lot of new different places with
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:04.040]   four square. I've been thinking about like when you have I mean I think even cations are really
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:07.560]   powerful thing. And so when you think about something like this and you think about something like
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:12.840]   Google testing same day delivery from stores and you think about the way that Google you know like
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:16.760]   I said about Sandy like creating tools for people to help one another find one another in times of
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:21.400]   crisis. Like you really can see how you know imagine a time when you know I've got a few hours
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:26.040]   something like a task rabbit. I've got a few hours to kill and I like to make a little extra money
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:30.360]   and Google just being like here go do this pick this up drop this off at this person you know this
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:34.360]   person's house and then we'll just drop a 10 bucks into your Google wallet account. You know they've
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:40.040]   really kind of got all the different pieces to like program humans to do their bidding which is kind of
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:45.720]   kind of weird but kind of fun. Street view I actually looked up my for the thing you're going to
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:49.400]   mention at the end of the show that I won't mention yet but I looked up my school's address and and
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:54.840]   Street View had my school address wrong and yeah you get correct stuff. Yeah. Yeah you can correct
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:57:01.880]   stuff. You can get a game. Um console mostly you know but uh I don't think this would be cool
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:10.360]   until it gets on the iOS platform so uh I'm having fun. Well well well then we're gonna go right
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:19.560]   to the video of what we Android people think of you you you lemmeens you. You ready with that
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:27.240]   Chad? I am. Oh there's your problem it's an iPhone. How did you even get here using Apple Maps?
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:34.040]   Now I got a droid. Why is your screen so small? It doubles as a portable drive and I didn't even
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:40.760]   need to jailbreak it. Oh I love this widget. I can hold it anyway and I still get full reception.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:46.920]   Full reception. Full reception. I can play slot cars in my dungeon and still get full reception.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:57.080]   Deuce. Cheap. So cheap. Cheap. Best camera phone ever. Steve Jobs dead Apple is going downhill.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:02.440]   Apple's going downhill. How do you even see anything on that tiny little screen? It's so cute.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:09.240]   Let me root your phone. Look at me I'm Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs.
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:17.720]   Bloo. It's not copying if it's better. Bloo. I like the world. I see jobs. Bloo.
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:28.120]   I hate Apple. So durable. Customizable. I love this camera. What are your specs? I'm telling
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:35.480]   you it's all about widgets. Oh this is my favorite widget. Even the magazine is twice the price.
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:41.560]   What round are you running? Dude check out my wrong. No it's a standard micro USB cable. It's
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:49.720]   just a standard micro USB cable. Oh shame. It's not a standard micro USB cable. Yeah. Only you
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:57.880]   had NFC. I'm controlling the slot car with my phone. Just kidding. Series of bitch.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:09.240]   So that it was I'll clean up the title for our rating stuff. And I think it's all true.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:15.640]   Right Lamar? It's true. Your phone is just so small. It's not a sleek. It doesn't have new things.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:20.520]   It's it's it's the snobs phone. It's not the phone of the people like Android which is growing and
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:29.080]   growing. Hey, man. Who was the real snob in that video? Was it Apple guy? Apple guy didn't say
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:34.920]   one word because we don't care. Yeah. I'm actually upset because I was I wrote down in my outline to
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:42.360]   do a video like this. And now they've done it. So I have nothing to do. Oh you could you could do
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:50.920]   things blackberry guys say. Sorry. Hey, I thought you were gonna say things black guys say. I was
[00:59:50.920 --> 01:00:00.200]   like I can do that one. You know, I Marco Arment is his new magazine. He did a story in the latest
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:04.840]   issue called anti Apple anger. You know, why are Android fans so angry about Apple? And he was
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:09.320]   saying that like basically saying that in any article talking about how good an Apple product is
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:13.560]   that there are just legions of angry Android fans in the comments saying things like this guy was
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:18.680]   saying or whatever. And I don't know if I'm just hanging out in the wrong places or what but I just
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:23.800]   I don't I don't think it's that bad. Is it that is it this bad? I don't think so. Well, what
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.720]   happened? Why I see the opposite? You know, whatever I dare criticize Apple. Oh my God.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:33.480]   Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I get I see kind of see the same thing. And I don't know if that's because
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:38.280]   I'm just tuned into you know, you're kind of tuned into one side of the other. I mean, I find these
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:43.720]   things really funny. But the tribalism over like what hardware and operating system you use like
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:48.200]   it harkens back to the old, you know, I'm a Mac and a PC time. It just it's so it's so weird. It's
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:52.680]   just such a funny like tech cultural thing. And I think it's absolutely worth making fun of.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.680]   There are a couple lines in that video that were pretty funny. Like if only you had an NFC
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:05.160]   maker, USP. A standard USB cable a standard USB cable. So so to our now I'm gonna I'm gonna go
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:11.480]   break up on my my Nexus four speaking of which the Nexus four is still out of stock. The Nexus
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:17.160]   seven with with cellular went out of stock, but now is back. You can buy a Nexus seven of any
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:22.840]   size you can buy the Nexus 10, but you cannot have any hope of buying a Nexus four. I was trying to
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:28.680]   buy the Chromebook with the cellular Amazon just said to me it would be delivered only after Christmas,
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:33.560]   which means I'm not gonna bother now. But being that as it may. So there's been a Nexus four
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:38.120]   teardown. Do we care about teardowns or is that just too geeky? So geeky.
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:46.840]   And okay, fine. Skip. Skip. All right. We have anything else from the Android and hardware world.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:50.680]   Anything else you see? Gina, look at those stories. Anything else that you or on the Mar?
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:57.720]   I think we're good. Okay. So let's see. Should we go ahead and go to the other commercial with our
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:07.320]   partner Leo? Hey, baboo. It's a picnic basket. Hello Ranger Jeff and Gina Tarpani. How are you
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:16.840]   new mommy? I am here in spirit to tell you about Ford sink. You know, I love my Ford Mustang.
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:25.800]   It's a pony car. But and I and I hate to say this, but I think I'm trying to get in because I found
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:33.320]   the new love. I'm going to break up with the pony car. And because I want the new fusion,
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:39.560]   the energy, the 2013 is just coming out. Fusion. I am so excited.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:45.960]   Plug in hybrid, right? So I love that. But the thing that's really important to me
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:54.280]   is the fact that the fusion like all of Ford's vehicles for 2012, 2013 can have sink and my Ford
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:03:01.320]   touch. And that is huge because I'm telling you, I will not buy a car unless I can listen. I can
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:07.720]   talk to it. That's that's my new standard. I need to be I need to be able to talk to my car. If you
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:13.960]   go to Ford.com/technology, you can find out more about the amazing Ford sink voice command.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:19.080]   Keep your hands on the wheel, your eyes on the road. Looks not quite autonomous vehicles, but it
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:27.880]   feels like you're driving night rider. It really does because you are you it means so cool. You
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:33.640]   are totally controlling your music. You're calling. You're getting to read text to you. You can even
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.560]   use iTunes tagging to say, I like this song. Remind me when I get home to buy it.
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:46.200]   Ford sink with my Ford touch is standard on the following fusion models. Well, all of them.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:51.720]   That's nice. You get the hands free calling, the automatic phone book download from your
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:56.600]   Android or I guess if you had an iPhone, it would work there too uninterrupted connections.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:02.760]   Your call. This is actually I don't talk about this enough, but when you're on a call and you get
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.600]   in the car, it's automatically transfers to the speakerphone. That is I do that all the time.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:13.080]   I'm actually glad that works because I forget audio streaming is fantastic and super high quality
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.960]   audio streaming in some vehicles, you even get voice activated radio tuning. So you can pick a
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:23.720]   station by by voice. You can listen to entertainment on almost any device voice control music, no
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:31.800]   matter how it's stored on your smartphone, a USB drive, an MP3 player, just a big fan. And of
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:38.360]   course, the sync navigation is sweet. The term by turn directions, the 411 business search, the 911
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:43.560]   assist, great for safety. You got to find out more. Here's the deal. Visit your Ford dealer and say,
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:51.560]   I want to test drive sync or visit for .com slash technology and find out what sync can do for you.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:56.920]   I am dead serious. I will not buy a car that does not have Ford sync. I will not.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:02.760]   It is just awesome. If you've got sync with app link, you can actually voice control apps on your
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:07.960]   phone. That is sweet too. Thank you for your support of this week in Google.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:13.480]   We may not have self driving cars, but at least we have self listening music
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:19.000]   or something back to you, Jeff and Gina.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:25.640]   Hey, Leo, we cannot wait to see you again. All right. Well, it would not be an episode of Twig
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:30.040]   without a paranoid, wind gene moments for me worrying about the future of the internet and
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:34.920]   government threats to it. But I'm glad at least now I'm not alone because Google has stepped up.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:40.360]   Thank God at last. And ahead of the ITU summit coming up in December,
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:45.240]   they're warning of the dangers to an open internet. The ITU, as explained in one of the videos we
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:51.320]   have here on the rundown, is a very old government organization that was in charge of telephone
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:58.200]   numbers. And there are various efforts. There was a leaked report out of the Kremlin that Putin
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:05.000]   wants the UN and the ITU to take more direct control of the internet away from us to centralize it
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.640]   more to do all the things that are dangerous to the net. So Google put out a video of nice people
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.000]   just saying that a free net matters to us and a free net matters to us and a free net matters
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:20.360]   to us, which is fine. Little nambie pambie, but good as far as it goes. But they also put out a
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:25.560]   site where they want to have people sign up if nothing else is a matter of awareness and say,
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:31.320]   yeah, a free net matters to us. Now, there are some who say that this ITU thing is not really a
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:36.840]   threat. But as far as I'm concerned, every time a government steps up, France, Germany, Russia,
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:42.600]   China, Iran, the United States of America, the UK, Australia, Canada, they've all,
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:47.000]   all recently put in more efforts to try to find more control over the net because the net
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.600]   threatens them. And by God, people, it's time for us to stand up. Am I ready for a march here?
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:07:01.240]   I wonder if there's a goariness. I wonder if the government, there's always just going to be these
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:06.760]   potential, these looming policies that are going to hamstring the internet. I wonder if users are
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:11.720]   going to get tired of constantly having to, we had, we had SOPO, which was amazing, right? But it
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:16.200]   feels like every month is like, this is the new SOPA, right? There's another new thing. I actually
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:21.240]   thought that Google's video wasn't so great. I liked the video on what is the ITU.org.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:26.760]   Better video, isn't it? Better video explains better what the ITU is. This is a weird thing.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:30.360]   It's like, it's, so it's 11 days until this meeting where a bunch of government officials
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:35.080]   from different, from different countries all vote on, on policies and regulations that would
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:39.800]   for the internet, right? And one, each country gets one vote, right? And this was like a secret
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.680]   meeting. The details of this meeting and the details of the, of the policies that they're
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:46.920]   voting on were leaked, right? This isn't something that people aren't, you know,
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:50.840]   it's a little different than, than SOPA, right? And I guess it's not so different in that where
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:56.360]   we have to pressure our politicians to stand up for the internet. But it's, you know, it's one
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.640]   of those things where it's like, oh, again, you know, we're in the middle of the holidays, of course,
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:04.520]   which I guess they schedule these things so that, you know, they get less, less press. I mean,
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:08.200]   it worries me, but on the same time, at the same time, I'm like, you know what, people figure out
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:13.000]   workarounds for stupid policies. Yeah, which we, that's always what you do. That's always what
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.920]   you do. Ms. Hacker, you say, don't worry about it, Mr. Paranoid. We'll just find our way around it.
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:23.560]   And I pray for that. I wish for that. But I think if we don't deal with the worst case,
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:26.920]   and I always say, don't deal with the worst case, don't, don't, don't restrict the internet
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:30.920]   because privacy, bad things could happen, right? So maybe I'm doing the same thing here of just
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:34.360]   worrying about what the government could do to the internet, but it really could, you know,
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:38.920]   what happens to China and Iran? It really could. We should, we should worry about it, right?
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:42.440]   We should care. We should worry about it. And I don't mean to be a, for this to be a cop out,
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:45.880]   but you know, even when I went to China, it was like, oh, you can't get to Facebook from here.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:48.840]   I couldn't get to Twitter, but I figured out a way to tweet through, you know,
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:53.640]   a separate thing. It was a pain and it stunk. But even though you look at things like Weibo,
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:09:00.120]   right? Like that's their Chinese kind of Twitter stories get broken. I feel like with the forward
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:06.520]   marches toward openness and these are just kind of last ditch attempts by people in power to
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:11.880]   change that. I don't know. Maybe should I not have this totally, I tend toward optimism and you
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:15.560]   are you are you have as your glass right now have empty or have full?
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:21.240]   You know, I don't have an opinion on this only because I haven't done enough research.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:25.880]   I don't want to just blab out and just say anything, but I'll tell you what to think easily.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:33.080]   I have no problem doing that. Yeah, in general, I mean, the idea of anything free and open,
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:37.640]   it sounds great. I just, you know, before I jump in and say, yeah, let's do it. I want to read
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:41.240]   more on it, which I didn't get a chance to do. So I apologize. All right. No, that's that's
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:46.680]   absolutely fair. Chad, I think about a minute into the ITU video, it starts to kind of say a little
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:53.400]   about what is the ITU. Do you want to just show 30 seconds of it? Or did I pop this on you again?
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:59.720]   Telegraph old as in Morse code. When founded in 1865, it was called the International Telegraph
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:05.160]   Union, unlike the internet, the ITU was not built on open discussions among scientists and engineers.
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:10.920]   Instead, only governments have a vote at the ITU and these votes take place behind closed doors.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:15.640]   If governments succeed in giving the ITU more power to make decisions about the internet,
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:21.480]   we get an old school top down government-centric organization, replacing the open bottom up
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:27.000]   governance that made the internet so world-changing. And that's just the beginning of our problems.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:34.040]   The ITU is not transparent. The ITU's draft proposals aren't public and it's one country, one
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:38.760]   really nodal. It's governments. What the ITU is and where it goes. Let me bounce around a little bit.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:43.640]   I want to come back to Google and freedom in that. But related to this is there was another alarm
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.880]   that went off. Matt Cutts sent me to the ITU thing originally. And there was another alarm that
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:57.400]   went off this week when Senator Leahy reportedly backed a changes in a bill that was intended to
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:02.440]   give our email greater protection and then turned the bill into the exact opposite,
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:06.120]   where it was going to allow 22 government agencies, including the Justice Department,
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:14.040]   to have warrantless access to not only our email, but also our Google Docs,
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:19.080]   also our Facebook walls, also our Twitter direct messages, not only without warrant,
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:25.320]   but without notice that this was happening. And it was the quickest fuhrer I've ever seen.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:30.040]   There was a fuhrer within, I think, about 12 hours and suddenly Leahy was backing away from it
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:35.080]   like it had cuties, which was a good thing, which is a great thing. But it does show that we do have
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:41.160]   the power, I think, to stop these things sooner. And I think this guy saw images of SOPA in his head
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.720]   and wanted to go away from it. Did you guys have any sense of this going on? It was this over so fast.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:51.960]   That happened so fast that I missed it. And I'm glad that it happened because that is complete
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:57.240]   BS. Let's complete BS. And so I'm glad that we have SOPA so that politicians can back away very
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:02.600]   quickly from anything that causes an uproar or like that. I mean, that kind of thing is,
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:07.720]   especially in Google's interest to take care of, right? And anybody who provides cloud services
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:12.120]   has to fight that kind of thing. And I think it's absolutely right for users to be absolutely
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:16.760]   outraged. And I'm feeling regretful about what I said earlier. I'm not saying that people should
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:20.120]   be apathetic about these things. We do need to care about these things. I think you do have to know.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:23.880]   No, no, you're absolutely right. You know, if we cry wolf to do it. If we cry wolf to
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:31.560]   offer, if you put up the cat signal too often, then when the real threat is there, we won't
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:35.800]   relt troops. So you're absolutely right to worry about that. That's why I don't know when we should
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:41.800]   and should not. You know, this is this part. Schmidt, there's a video, I hope I'm not jumping
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:47.480]   around too much, but there's a video down about, yeah, Schmidt was doing a little bit of a talk
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.280]   about government regulation and a few different topics. But he said something interesting about
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:56.520]   Egypt, which was that, you know, when there was the demonstrations were happening in Egypt,
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:00.680]   people knew that they were happening, you know, just another demonstration, whatever.
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:06.120]   But it wasn't until the government shut off the internet that people were like, wait a second,
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:10.040]   something's going on. And they did not side with the government, you know, so that was
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:14.760]   as interesting point. He said they realized they had a choice. And a lot of them chose the revolution.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:21.400]   Yes, yes. And so and that revolution happened, right? So I mean, you know, it's not too late when
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:26.440]   it happens. But it really, it is one of those things. It's like if one of these crazy and sane
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:31.480]   laws passed in the United States that that censored sites, or I just feel like people go bananas and
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:35.640]   that was part of Smith's point to right Schmidt Schmidt said in this video, I think it was an
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:41.960]   interview for the Rand Corporation. And he said that Google's paying a lot of hope on the internet
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:46.840]   becoming so integral to people's lives that they will not tolerate that happening. Yes. And so you
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:51.800]   just recognize how Google more and more it's it's yet yes, it's interesting to align with the
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:56.280]   internet. And the business model is very simple. Google said it very, very simply. The more people
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:00.920]   use the internet, the more money Google makes. So it's in Google's interest to have her free and open
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:05.560]   and widely used internet and to be able to do that. And so they are fighting for a principle that
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:12.440]   matters to us as well. Now, granted, when I when I promoted this this effort for the against the
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:17.320]   ITU, a lot of people in comments and Twitter said, yeah, how about their deal with Verizon? And I
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:24.120]   agree. I can't stand what they do with Verizon neutralizing net neutrality in a way. But yeah,
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:29.000]   when Schmidt talks about this stuff, I think he's eloquent and hopeful and has a point.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.440]   He also said in the same video that that parents should have the internet talk before they have
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:40.360]   the sex talk with kids, which I think is a great way to look at it. But in line with this,
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:44.200]   there's a story that's related that Google is now and very quietly,
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:49.720]   though I didn't see a lot of coverage of this yet, but is pushing for a vast increase in the
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:55.320]   amount of Arabic content on the net, which I think is exactly the strategy that you just said, Gina,
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:00.840]   as the more people use it, feel that it's part vitally part of their lives and part of their
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.720]   society, the harder it's going to be for governments to turn it off.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:09.000]   Yes. Now, can we rewind a bit as a new parent that caught my eye the whole
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.800]   you have the internet talk with your kids before the sex talk? So you're much more experienced
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.920]   parent than I am, Jeff. And also I know you.
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:21.240]   Things I've done wrong, Gina. Well, I know you have very strong opinions about
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:26.360]   about publicness and privacy and the benefits of being public online. And my daughter is only
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:29.960]   two months old, but I'm already I'm thinking about how am I going to talk to her about
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:34.920]   when she gets online, how many I talked to her about the information that she shares.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:43.080]   And should I raise her being scared and being worried and having to use a pseudonym or fuzz
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:47.720]   her details or am I going to raise her with the idea that that privacy is safer?
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:52.680]   Right? I mean, in a way, I feel like I need to do that because when she's 13, when she's 12,
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:58.840]   13, 14, I don't want her publishing Instagram photos of her and her friends like in their
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:03.160]   bikinis at the beach, because like that freaks me out that there would be creepers,
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:09.160]   looking at my daughter, for example. But at the same time, I do want her to understand the
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.960]   benefits of publicness and the connections that you can make with people and the communities
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:17.640]   that you can tap into and the support and the resources that you can get. Like you've talked
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:21.800]   about so many times with your illness and even just, you know, takedowns, the companies like
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:27.640]   Dell and that kind of thing, right? But when she's a child, it does feel like a matter of safety.
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:33.320]   So how do I teach her to be safe, but not be, but also appreciate the benefits of publicness?
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.880]   I don't know. I mean, what are you talking about?
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:41.960]   I'm lucky because my son, Jake, Facebook was not available for high school students until he
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:47.880]   was in high school. He was the first class that had Google and had Facebook in high school.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.840]   Mark Zuckerberg was in the first class that at Google in high school, which is interesting.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:54.920]   Jake was the first class to have Facebook and they kind of set the rules and they knew what
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:58.920]   they were doing. And it was still a closed world, right? Adults couldn't get in then. It was just
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:04.520]   high schools. It was, it was, you know, younger people you couldn't quite get in yet. Any sensible,
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.840]   and I, you know, I think parents generally have to learn more than anything to trust their kids.
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:13.720]   My daughter doesn't really like doing it. Jake said you're going to have to in high school.
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:16.520]   She does, but she's not that much into it. So I don't really have this problem
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:22.360]   that I know of to deal with that. I think there's a surprise problem in Facebook,
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:27.960]   which is to be surprised to me, which is that it's not so much that what people reveal. It's
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:32.120]   that you end up comparing yourself to the idolized versions of other people's lives.
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:41.240]   And right. So you see, you see a version of the world, right, which can be good or bad. Then again,
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:49.160]   a colleague of mine said that his, what his daughter was, I think, in second grade or first grade,
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:56.920]   she was using the net. And a friend of hers said, "Search for boys kissing boys." Nothing wrong with
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:02.440]   that, but that wasn't all she got, obviously. Yeah. And we're really scared and came in.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.680]   Mommy, what the heck is his vision of the world? I haven't seen.
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:09.960]   Right. So yeah, it's difficult, but I think in the end, there's a
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:13.480]   a columnist, former columnist I used to work with at the Daily News named Lenore Schenazie,
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:17.960]   who talks about raising free range kids. And she's very controversial in New York because at
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:22.040]   an early age, she said him out in the subway. And she said, "They got all over these things
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:26.520]   on their own. They got to do this stuff." I'm tending to agree with that. I'm tending to think that
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:31.960]   they were raising children as veal. Yeah. And that's not my line at somebody else's.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:35.960]   But too protected. Now, I'm not suggesting that we throw them out there in the world,
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:40.760]   but I do think we have to arm them with the judgment and tools to be able to deal with things.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:46.680]   And we have to also arm them with the trust to have the judgment and be ready to talk about
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:49.800]   stuff up until the age when they stop talking to you, Gina, which happens.
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.760]   Right.
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.520]   What do you think? What's your advice to Gina?
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:56.840]   Yeah. This is interesting because I don't know if you all knew I used to be an elementary school
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:05.800]   teacher. So this was around the time where MySpace and Tag.com were coming up and the kids would,
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:09.160]   you know, it was news that they would post their inappropriate things there.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:13.240]   And one thing I never wanted to do, even though the school started to do it,
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:18.760]   you know, schools would block things. I really wanted the kids to get the education of why they
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:23.000]   shouldn't. What's the reason behind it? And I think that's the most important part is that you,
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.120]   they're going to do it. I mean, now I'm not in teaching now, but to try to block the internet
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:32.600]   on schools is crazy now because they'll just flip up their phone and be on LTE, do what they're
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:37.320]   going to do. So you can't stop it. The best you can do is educate them on it. So, you know,
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:43.400]   Regina, maybe, you know, as she gets older, coordinating with the school system. So there's a one, two
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:49.320]   punch on not saying, you know, don't use the internet. It's scary as creepers. So does,
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:54.280]   so does walking to the subway. So does walking to a store to get something. There's creepers everywhere,
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:58.680]   you know, that's, you know, you have to learn how to army stuff against that. But the most
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:05.080]   important part is the educational, why it's a bad idea to put certain content out online,
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:10.600]   the ramifications of it, even like Eric Schmidt said in the article, yeah, your criminal record
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:16.760]   gets wiped at 18, but, you know, in the US, but not, you know, your social life, that that's the
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:20.120]   imprint that stays forever. So you just have to be more careful about it.
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:25.080]   So number one, Gina, I think, as I think about it, I think the key word that I would think of,
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:32.680]   if I were you, is to teach her that she has control. Yeah. And that that's the essential idea. And
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:37.960]   and and Dana Boyd talks about this a lot that that young people do worry about their privacy and
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:45.800]   that they they have mechanisms to do it. She puts it, they control meaning over just mere communication.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:50.120]   And but here's the thing, if something goes viral, you don't really have control, you know, if you
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:54.760]   post the pictures from where it doesn't go away, you might not have, you know, if she posts something
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:21:00.520]   embarrassing, I worry about this as an adult. And heck, I had the same problem as what you were
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:04.120]   saying earlier, you know, seeing the idolized versions of other people's lives and becoming kind
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:09.240]   of a bit of a performer, like these platforms sort of encourage you to perform some, you know,
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:13.000]   idealized version of yourself to share with your friends. And I think those are all really
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.480]   interesting sort of sort of effects of these platforms. But but there isn't, I mean, this was
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:20.760]   Schmitt's point, right, that there isn't a delete button that once you share something online,
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:25.640]   I guess I'm saying the same thing, I'm agreeing, I'm agreeing that that there's a moment when she
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:32.440]   loses control. And that moment is when she exposes her her her her moment, her real identity,
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:40.200]   her whatever, and that she should feel jealous control of those parts of her life. And they are
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:43.400]   hers to control, they're not even yours to control, as some extent, because she can do what she's
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:48.840]   gonna do, right, that she's got to realize that value. The problem is, children are not taught to
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:58.680]   look forward. Right. So I'm all in favor of not allowing Facebook to 13 year olds, right? But
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:03.160]   that's but that's not the way the world works. Dana also found that the majority of 12 year olds
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:09.160]   are on Facebook and that 76% of their parents helped them do that. Pew just had a survey that I
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:13.560]   haven't read yet, but I just saw it come out yesterday about privacy and kids and parents are
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:19.080]   concerned. We know that. You know, but I think to your point Lamar, part of this becomes, and I'm
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:23.400]   being very idealistic here, but part of this becomes my belief that and I've said another show
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:28.760]   before where it's my theory of mutually assured humiliation, that at some point we become a more
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:32.920]   tolerant society when we realize that we all had embarrassing moments when we were young.
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:38.200]   So what? And if you're the person who rejects someone because they did something stupid 10
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:41.560]   years ago, then you're the bozo. Not the person who did the stupid thing.
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:50.200]   But are you so let's talk about Zuckerberg. Remember when Mark was 19 or 20 years old and he
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:54.840]   said that his users were idiots, Facebook users were idiots for sharing the information with him,
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:58.280]   right? And so now he's one of the richest people in the world and head of one of the most powerful
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:03.720]   internet companies in the world. Are you able to forget that he said that at that point? And I
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:07.480]   know he said, look, I was a kid. It was stupid. I shouldn't have said that. Yeah, because he learned
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:12.280]   still in my head though, that at some point during when he was making this thing,
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:16.600]   he said that to someone so carelessly like or I am, I forget what the quote I think he's just
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:22.200]   said. But I also think that if that had stayed the essence of the culture of Facebook and the essence
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:28.200]   of his worldview, he would have failed. But he only could succeed if he learned and grow
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:33.640]   and matured enough to see where the value really was and where trust really was.
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:38.920]   And I think that it speaks to because otherwise, then we're a million dupes,
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:44.120]   we're a billion idiots. And I don't believe that. And I really don't. I believe that we're a
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:48.520]   billion people who use his platform and that he recognizes the value of that and that he could
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:55.160]   learn the lesson. And I think, you know, if you look at any major executive and try to go back
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:01.080]   into their career when they were that age, there were dopes. Dopes. One, surely.
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:06.840]   Right, right. I'm suspicious of things that Facebook does, especially around privacy,
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.960]   and partially because that story is stuck in my head and partially because there was that
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:14.360]   major motion picture made about what he, you know, whatever, that was not representative of a
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:17.480]   reality, but that stuff gets kind of stuck in your consciousness. I mean, I think
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:23.800]   Facebook has made such a compelling product that a billion people use it. But I don't know that still,
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:28.280]   it's still kind of in my head. So it's so it's interesting. I mean, I, I want to be enlightened
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.360]   to the point where I can say, Hey, you know, God knows I have plenty of things that I had stupid
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:37.400]   things that I did when I was 20 years old that I'd be embarrassed to be, you know, public or,
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:41.400]   you know, that people I wouldn't want people to judge me out now. But I do want to get to that
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:44.760]   place where we just say, Hey, you know what, anything that happened before you were 20 or
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:52.840]   40 or 25, 40 or 30, let's get crazy. Doesn't count. Yeah, that line moves, doesn't it,
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:58.520]   then when you get up to where my age is, of course, it's, it's because I'm old and, and, and, and
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.200]   feeble that I do stupid things. So it's okay. You get, you get the excuse back.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:07.160]   Let's go on to a few other topics, because we got a whole bunch of legal stuff. I kind of want to,
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:10.280]   you know, go through with some, some dispatch so we can get on to the other things. But there's
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:16.360]   so much happening this week around, around both Google and around some, some legal and legislative
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:23.960]   matters. I got into a debate in the UK. I happened to tune into a hearing that was held by the
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:29.960]   Finance Committee of the Parliament in the UK led by a woman named Margaret Hodge, where she was
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:34.760]   just eviscerating Google and also Starbucks and Amazon arguing that they weren't paying their
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:40.760]   fair taxes and that they were using havens in Ireland and Bermuda and this was awful and so
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:45.080]   forth. And the Google guy, I think, kept saying as best he could, we're just doing what's legal.
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:50.440]   And she said it's legal, but it's immoral. And so I had Fitz on Twitter saying this is ridiculous.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:58.280]   You know, do you MPs voluntarily pay more taxes? What's Google to do is to, is to decide their
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:03.240]   own tax rate and what they think, what, what, what should be considered fair and then what do they
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:06.680]   do that in every country in the world? Every country wants a piece of their skin.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:11.960]   So the, the observer that is to say the Guardian and Sunday paper had to be doing a debate with her
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:17.720]   online. We'll put it up on the rundown. But it's, it's a fascinating, very emotional issue and
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:21.720]   especially in Europe where there are fights around taxes here in the US, we wish that Google would
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:27.960]   bring more of its revenue on shore. They're not paying taxes on some of the revenue overseas.
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:32.120]   They're saying, well, we're mainly an American company. It's why we don't pay a lot of it here.
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:37.080]   A lot of our real value is in America. Clearly every country, once they're piece of the pie,
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:42.440]   speaking of which France has just outright sent a bill to Google for $2 billion saying you just
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:45.800]   owe this because you owe it because you're not doing things the way you should. Even though the
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:50.120]   things that Google was doing, they have lots of lawyers are illegal. What do you guys think?
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:56.920]   First, I want to say about your article. I read it and I laughed because you and I are so like
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:07.080]   in that you smashed her. There was nothing she said after what you said made any sense after that
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:13.240]   because when we all do our taxes, what happens? We'll do whatever it takes to get a deduction
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:20.200]   or a tax breaker. And so that's all these companies are doing. They're within the law.
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:24.840]   When you mentioned about looking it up on the Bible, I was just done. I was like, okay,
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:30.680]   Jeff knows how to argue. See, it was our shit, the fish and the barrel.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:37.560]   I know, but you were right. It's what the country allows. If you want to change it,
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:41.000]   like you told her, we'll go and change the law. That's what you do. That's your job.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.840]   You don't like it. Otherwise, hush. I think that's what you were saying.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:50.200]   Yeah, I mean, it seemed I thought that the larger point is that this is sort of
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:57.320]   our reckoning, the global marketplace sort of reckoning with the future, how business runs now.
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:05.240]   It's tough. I agree, Jeff, that you won that debate. I could see how you were saying,
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:09.800]   why would a company voluntarily pay more taxes? And she was saying, I'm not asking you to
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:14.040]   volunteer. We're just asking you to pay local taxes. But of course, the laws exist,
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:20.040]   that everything that Google is doing is legal. So the issue is they have to change the laws.
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:26.040]   So that's not possible. But yeah, it's a really interesting debate. And it really is just about
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:31.000]   our legal infrastructure, international legal infrastructure, allowing for the kinds of businesses
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:36.680]   and the kind of global marketplace that we have now. And laws take longer to catch up to technology.
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:43.320]   Well, and also it's not just about that. And when I go to Europe, I see this, and this
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:46.760]   look at me in trouble with folks in our international audience. But I sense that there's kind of,
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:50.760]   in some circles, not all circles, but in some circles, there's two other forces.
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:54.360]   There's a bit of anti-Americanism going on, on another big American company.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:58.680]   And there's a little bit of anti-capitalism, but anti-big company, anti-corporate,
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:03.160]   think there. And so that if you're this big, successful company, you're such a target.
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:07.400]   Speaking of which, now there's been talk in both the EU and the US, and going after Google for
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:13.320]   antitrust. And so that was the report going into the rundown. And then this morning, there was a
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:21.000]   piece up on Bloomberg that said that the US government is now wavering on the idea of going
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.160]   after Google for antitrust. Not sure that they really found a consumer harm, not sure that they
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:30.360]   found anything wrong. And this is in the vertical search areas. This is in the idea that they benefit
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:37.880]   their own stuff. And so reportedly, the FTC really wanted to go after Google. John Lieberwitz was
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:45.400]   hankering for that. But says one report in Bloomberg, no, they're not doing anything illegal or anything
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:49.560]   wrong. And there's no consumer harm. We've had this discussion a little bit on the show before.
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:55.800]   Do you think that going after Google for antitrust is a worthy investigation or a witch hunt?
[01:29:55.800 --> 01:30:04.200]   I always tend to think that going after a big company and investigating what they're doing is
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:08.280]   that's not a battle that I'm usually willing to fight. Because Google's got plenty of money.
[01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:12.200]   They got plenty of power. They got plenty of lawyers. And they'll be able to work it out.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:17.240]   I think that it's important for us to question what big companies are doing, big powerful companies
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:23.400]   are doing. And I don't think it's a witch hunt. I think it's a healthy thing to question that.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:28.760]   Just from the standpoint of if you're going to go after anybody, I think it's the people with the
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:34.040]   armies of lawyers and tons of money that they're worth questioning. I know that people see them as
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:40.360]   a big target, but I think it's just kind of a healthy part of the system to the place of success.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:46.120]   I mean, is there a arc to the story that if ever you become successful, then you become suspect?
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:51.720]   Is that a necessary? You really think so? I do. I do. I do. I do.
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:56.120]   It happened with Microsoft and it's happening with Google. There's talks that wanted to break
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:31:00.840]   them up and said in a different section. So yeah, that's the price you paid. And it kind of sucks.
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:05.240]   You want to build a big business. You know, you know, you're going to get attacked as hard as this.
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:11.240]   And I don't know if I agree with that. Yeah, the problem is then then if you if you if you don't
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:18.840]   want to live with that kind of hassle in life, then it's moderation to an extreme, isn't it?
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:22.600]   It's just saying, okay, I don't want to grow that big. I don't want to go public. I don't want to
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:28.040]   grow that big. I want to stay small that you're limited to kind of growth you can have if you
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:34.840]   automatically become suspect. It's kind of the belief that well, Siva by nothing kind of says
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:38.040]   corporations must be evil. Is that what you're saying, Gina? Would you go that far?
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:45.080]   Corporations. No, I would say the corporations must be evil, but I think it's very easy for them
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:50.120]   to become evil. I think it's just important for I think in general, it's important for people
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:54.840]   to question both companies and people who are very wealthy and very powerful pretty much all
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:58.920]   not all the time. But whenever there's a question, the question should be asked.
[01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:05.240]   You know, Google, they're going to be okay. They're going to be able to fight their fight.
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:11.560]   I don't know. I'm not worried about them. I don't know. Maybe am I being too
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:17.400]   I think it's important to question those in power in general.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:21.480]   Yeah, I think that's true. And I certainly say it about government all the time.
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:25.240]   When I gave a talk about about public parts in Germany before I wrote the book,
[01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:30.280]   and I talked about the German paradox. Somebody said, well, about the American paradox that
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:35.560]   you Americans have good government more than we've had, but you distrust government more than we do.
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:39.000]   And maybe that's why we have better government and maybe the same can be argued about companies.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:45.160]   So note that Google, you know, by this one report, maybe on the on the on a road away from antitrust.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:51.640]   The other good news for Google this week is that Hamburg and Germany has decided not
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:57.720]   to prosecute based on the data collections on Street View saying there was no criminal intent.
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:04.520]   So no harm and no credible criminal intent. One more legal thing, and then we'll move on to back
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:09.480]   to geek geek world, but there's just so much legal stuff is a fascinating moment this week where the
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:18.760]   Republican Research Council, I think it's called released a very brief white paper on copyright
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:27.000]   that was just so unbelievably sensible and smart and said that, you know, copyright was not really
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.720]   there myths about copyright. It wasn't just intended to remunerate creators. It was intended to improve
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:40.600]   and increase creativity and innovation and that it's gone on too long and that we need these
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:44.680]   following reforms. And it was a great thing. And then you could know exactly what happened,
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:52.600]   which was that Hollywood got their claws into Republican lawmakers and the report was pulled
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:58.440]   offline. Though Lauren Weinstein, God bless him, managed to cash it before it got put there.
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:06.440]   And I thought it'd be a fascinating moment where the RSC said that we take pride in providing
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:10.520]   informative analyses, but this thing just kind of didn't go through proper channels. I don't
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:16.040]   believe that for a second. I think that it got out there and then Hollywood went berserk.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:19.240]   So I recommend reading reading Lauren's
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:25.320]   caching of the old document because I think it's it's from the Republicans and it's a good,
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:32.520]   you know, even so is my tone, my my presumption here. Even so, it's a I think a very sensible and
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:35.640]   very good view of copyright. Did either of you have a chance to look at that at the original?
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:41.720]   I didn't. I didn't. But so much for Eric Schmidt saying that we shouldn't be a society of
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:47.320]   information leakers. I mean, in some cases, it really it's a good thing. Yeah, exactly. All
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:52.600]   right. So that's enough, enough legal stuff and and and and and danger signs as we head toward
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:57.080]   home run home base, whatever, I keep on messing up. I'm not doing sports.
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:59.560]   Home stretch. Home stretch. That's what it's home.
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:04.280]   Why don't we trick the Leo head has took a couple of weeks ago and each of us round Robin pick
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:07.000]   out a story that we that I've missed here in the rundown.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:14.200]   Lamar, you want to start? Yeah, I thought the story about the YouTube app and the Nintendo
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:20.600]   Wii was pretty cool because it's the first time they're widely pushing out the web M video codec.
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:26.920]   So it's supposed to be cleaner, simple interface. It's funny that we the Wii is the only console
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:32.200]   that's out there that hasn't had you know, YouTube on there. So that is great to see. It looks good.
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:35.560]   I have not played with the Wii U. I may do that tonight at a friend's house to see how it is.
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:42.200]   You're on. It's right. That's your peeps. Yeah. Yeah. I guess what I was asking.
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:46.920]   What I would ask you is this. Do you if you have a console, do you watch
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:54.440]   YouTube on it? I have a very hard time watching YouTube on my 47 inch. I'd rather watch it on
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:59.960]   my phone or on the desktop. We got vice versa. I can't watch Hulu on my desktop. It irritates
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:06.280]   me. I feel like I have to later who actually has Google TV. I do. I do. I actually have Google TV.
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:10.920]   You know, I've started to use YouTube's watch later function. So as well, I'm working. I come
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:15.480]   across videos I want to see later. I hit watch later. And then when I'm feeding the baby on my
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:19.560]   Google TV, I just bring up the watch later list and it just cycles through it. So I yeah, I have
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:23.400]   been watching videos on my big screen just because the Google TV, the YouTube app on Google TV is
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:31.080]   actually pretty nice. Yeah. I can't watch videos like entertaining videos kind of at my desk while
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:35.080]   in the work mode because it just feels, you know, I feel kind of trapped like, oh, I'm, you know,
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:39.640]   I'm in this weird different mode. So I enjoy, I enjoy watching on the on the big screen.
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:44.040]   I really, but only because of Google TV. I don't, I've never used, I don't even know if there's an
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:51.160]   app for Xbox, which is the console I have. It's just like for Hulu. I can't, I can't stay
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:54.760]   and watch it on my desktop. I need to be laying down on my culture bed to and then
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:59.000]   relaxation. I still haven't parted from the TV yet. So maybe I need help. I don't know.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:08.520]   Gita, story, you want to pick out? Just sort of quick story. Apple's having a Black Friday sale.
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:13.800]   Have they ever done this before? I don't think so. I don't think so either. Apple never does this
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:18.200]   kind of thing. I mean, I didn't think that they ever had sales period, really. I thought the price
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:23.240]   was the price was the price. But yeah, if you go to apple.com, it says there's a one day shopping
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:28.920]   event. It looks like it's if you shop online or in a retail store and I've been kind of having this,
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:33.960]   not argument, but this little debate about Black Friday amongst my geek friends. In fact,
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:38.120]   Lamar tweeted in on it at some point where I was saying, you know, you know, at this time of year,
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:43.880]   every gadget tech blog does some sort of rant about how Black Friday is stupid and the deals
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:49.240]   aren't really good and all the people camping out outside the Best Buy or dumb and whatever.
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:55.960]   I find that kind of interesting. I think I said something like, it's easy to rant about Black Friday
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:01.960]   when you can afford to buy everything at full price. People like deals because they're strapped.
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:08.040]   And which conversation went from there. Everyone's got a different opinion about Black Friday,
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:13.640]   but it looks like you can get some deals on Apple stuff just by shopping online.
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:18.280]   So interesting. It felt like a departure from Apple's general retail strategy.
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:23.800]   By the way, if you go to Black Friday.com, you can see the Black Friday circulars for
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:28.920]   majors Best Buy Walmart, Sears, Dell, all those places right now and know what it is you're going
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:33.320]   to get in. Of course, a lot of that you can get online now. And some of the Curtis
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:36.760]   B in the chat room says Apple has had them for a couple of years now. It's interesting. I thought
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:41.320]   this this seemed new to me, but the savings aren't that great. You usually like a hundred bucks
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:48.840]   full laptop. I noticed that in Best Buy, you can get a Samsung 7-inch tablet, which is not
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:53.800]   unlike the Nexus 7 for $179, which is a pretty good price. Lamar, you're going to say sorry.
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:39:00.520]   It's fine. I wonder if people are thinking like me, like, if you just bought a new iPad or iPad Mini,
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:05.560]   would you really go through all the trouble to take it back? And then as soon as you give it a
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:09.320]   receipt and a refund, okay, I want to buy it back again at the discount. Because I really want to
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:14.440]   do that just to irritate them. I think most stores with a decent policy will let you bring in the
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:18.680]   receipt and get the lower price. I think Apple has done that when they have lower prices. I think,
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:22.840]   I think, I can be wrong. Don't check me on that. All right, I'll give you one story and then we'll do
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:28.520]   our closing bits. I found it interesting. Cory Booker, who's the mayor of Newark,
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:32.760]   and full disclosure, I'm an advisor to Waywire, which is the company he helped start.
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:39.480]   During Sandy, he was absolutely incredible on Twitter. My wife pushed me to make sure to subscribe to
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:43.560]   him. He's always pretty amazing on Twitter. But during Sandy, he was quite amazing where he gets
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:49.480]   out in Newark. He gets around the town. People would tweet him with problems. He would tell people
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:55.000]   where to drop off things. He's just really, really quite remarkable. Well, he got into a fight on
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:00.360]   Twitter about the cost of food and food stamps. This and that, he took a challenge where he's going
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:06.200]   to live on food stamps for a week with whoever was challenging him on Twitter. He figures it's
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:11.080]   about $4 a day in food cost. And this all happened on Twitter and he's going to do it on Twitter.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:18.440]   And it's really pretty amazing to watch a politician live that publicly among his constituents using
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:24.360]   these tools. And I just love it. He's going to be president. He's amazing. Yeah, he's trying to
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:27.880]   decide now whether to run for governor or senator from New Jersey. And we'll see what happens.
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:32.520]   Chris Christie did himself pretty well. And I'm a Democrat, but he did himself pretty well
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:37.640]   in the storm. And I think GOP has been making a fool himself criticizing him for talking to the
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:45.080]   president before the election. But Christie had to call Murdoch to kind of apologize for being
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:51.800]   nice to Clinton. I mean, to Obama. But yeah, Booker's got a future and he's building himself a good
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:58.280]   history. All right. So shall we move to Gina, your tip all the week? Yes, let's do it. This is a
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:01.720]   really cool little site. I don't think Google built this. I think this is a third party thing.
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:09.080]   It's qsview.com instant Google Street view. So it's just a black page with a with an input box.
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:14.520]   You type in an address, any address. And as you type, it sort of automatically teleports you to
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:20.440]   the Google Street view image of that place. This sounds really kind of simple and whatever.
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:25.080]   It's actually really fun and addictive. You just start typing an address. It zooms you right there.
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:29.320]   And kind of as you type, so you can kind of try and you kind of you go from one place to another
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:34.280]   as it kind of figures out what location you're putting in. That's cool about it. Because you see
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:40.360]   surprise, serendipitous places as you go. Yeah. Yeah. And for places where they have indoor
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:45.400]   street view imagery, air quotes, like the White House, like you just type in the White House,
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:49.960]   you just wind up like standing in the White House, the Red Room in the White House. It's kind of
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:57.160]   amazing. That works for the Museum of Modern Art. It works for the Saka Aquarium, like the Madrid Zoo.
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:01.080]   But places where it doesn't have indoor imagery, it just kind of takes you right down to that
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:04.440]   street. So I had so much fun with this just sort of visiting places in New York that I miss.
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:11.400]   And so it's qsview.com just. Is that the White House bookshelf there? Yeah, there was.
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:18.600]   I want to see my books on it. I set up a copy. Lamar, you have you want to join in here with a tip
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:25.320]   tool number thing, whatever? Yeah, I guess the thing that I would have is just, it's about YouTube
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:30.280]   since that's kind of what I do. There's millions of people on there to watch, obviously. And many of
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:36.280]   you all watch without being in your account, so you can like it, comment, whatever. And I guess for
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:41.400]   me as a producer or content creator, I would just ask that, hey, if you have some favorite people
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:48.520]   that you like on YouTube, subscribe to them and support. It's not so much of an ego boost for me.
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:54.520]   It's given you notification of when my stuff or anyone else puts out content that you enjoy. And
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:58.520]   then like on your Google TV or on these other boxes that you can go right into your subscriptions
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:04.120]   and watch those people versus. No, I like Gina. I like your method of the watch later. But this
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:08.600]   kind of, these side steps that were, you know, you can just get the people that you actually
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:13.160]   want to see. So subscribe to your favorite YouTube people and preferably me first.
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:20.440]   Hey, no to that. Give them our reason for Thanksgiving. All right. So my number of the week,
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:29.960]   speaking of Thanksgiving, Google put up a, think with Google put up a power point about data on
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:35.800]   people searching around Thanksgiving and food. It's actually surprisingly sexist, because all it
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:42.520]   talks about is moms as if dads and people who are neither don't cook really odd to come from Google.
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:46.680]   I thought no offense to you moms, but and not that I don't cook because believe me, I'd poison you.
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:51.480]   If I did, nonetheless, I thought that was up. But still, it said the 55% of shoppers who use the
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:56.040]   phone in the store look up coupons there, which I think is vital for where advertising goes.
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:01.720]   30% or 6% look up recipes and trending searches at Thanksgiving time. There are, by the way,
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:07.160]   there are 78 million recipe searches in the week before Thanksgiving. It is the huge spike in recipes.
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:12.040]   I was privileged to be around for the beginnings of Epicurious and Thanksgiving was the killer time
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:18.760]   for us. But trending searches last year around this time included turkey brine,
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:30.920]   turkey croquettes and puppy chow recipe. I can't. So that's it. I'm going to hand us back over to
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:37.720]   the warm and wonderful hands of our co-host, the hostess, Gina Trapani to wish us all a happy
[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:44.440]   Thanksgiving and move us out. Gina. Yeah, I think that's a wrap. This has been a really good show.
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:48.040]   Jeff, you did an amazing job of moving us along in the middle and in the middle. And
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:55.400]   Lamar, it was really great to have you back on the show. Everyone should go to youtube.com/lamarwilsen
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:45:01.720]   1M 2R right now and press the subscribe button. Everyone, everyone should do that right now.
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:06.840]   Thank you so much for being with us, Lamar. Is there anything else that you want to
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:11.160]   that you want to promote besides your YouTube channel or that's you. That's our connection to
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:15.720]   you. You know, I wouldn't say no to some extra Twitter followers. I'm on Twitter for you.
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:21.800]   It's Lamar Wilson as you see down there. Oh, and that's the video of me playing there. Okay,
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:27.480]   that's a thing. You know, you see YouTube adds actually 10 extra pounds to you. So that's,
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:34.360]   oh my, that's sexy. That's okay. So yeah, if you like to follow me and follow a sexy guy,
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:37.160]   you know, be sure to click. Which now you guys.
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:44.200]   Twitter.com/lamarwilsen is a one there's one good header photo going on there. I love it.
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:50.120]   And Jeff Jarvis, my, my, my trusted co-hosts really good to see you,
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:55.080]   author public parts. What would Google do? What are you up for? Thank up to this Thanksgiving,
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:57.000]   Jeff, you're not cooking, but you're.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:04.200]   Well, we don't like turkey. We're contrarian as a family. So my wonderful wife is doing roast
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:06.120]   roast chicken. What about you? What are you doing?
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:09.800]   Very nice. I'm cooking. I'm brining tonight. I'm cooking, although I don't know, serious eats,
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:14.200]   did this kind of showdown of the salting versus the brining. We got to figure out the salting versus
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:17.320]   the brining. And I'm going to the movies tonight because there are babysitters in town, which is
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:22.680]   going to be wonderful. So to everyone in the United States, have a very happy Thanksgiving,
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:30.040]   good turkey day. And we will be back next Wednesday at 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern with Leo.
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:45.960]   We'll be back in the studio. Thank goodness. And have a great Thanksgiving. Thanks, everyone.
