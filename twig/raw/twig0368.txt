[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.080]   Twift
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:53.640]   To live I like that as Jeff Jarvis professor journalism sitting University New York blogs at bug buzz machine commies on the Twitter at Jeff Jarvis
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.480]   You know I wasn't before I was pink now. I'm not pink, but I look like I'm out of focus. You look good
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.720]   Don't worry about it. It's doesn't matter like Bob Bob a walrus Bob a while
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.460]   Yes, I have a pretty filter. Thank you. Yes, and that is Stacy Higginbotham who needs no pretty
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:16.420]   He's a pre filter. She has a crystal clear picture from her home in Austin, Texas where she hosts
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.820]   Stacy on IOT comm she's at giga Stacy on Twitter and
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:29.100]   Never used Google plus Jeff we've now ceremoniously de-Google plus if I'd your lower third
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.220]   Place it with it was nice wall lasted. I enjoyed it. I am keeping my Google plus
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.820]   Mostly because there's nowhere else to go. I'm not gonna use Twitter
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.500]   I just loathe Twitter. Yeah, I'm taking I'm
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.980]   getting more and more like you and
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.740]   Facebook is not really I don't want to use Facebook as a
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.300]   Fan page I do have a fan page there, but I don't I feel funny
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.060]   There's nothing better and by the way
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.140]   Thank you Google Google plus is not dead today. We're announcing three new updates for Google plus
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.820]   So they're actually doing work on this this came out
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.820]   Is that the loneliest job this side of a may tag repairman? I you know what?
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.580]   There's some good people working there on Google plus there are tofels not working there though, right Stacy?
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.380]   No, not in Google plus. He's chrome at work Chrome at work. Okay
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.660]   So this is the announcement came out yesterday Danielle Buckley is still working on Google plus
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.460]   Last bringing the new Google plus to more people she says am I looking at the date, right? It is yesterday, right? Yeah
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.980]   Today's the 31st. Yep. Yeah, this was yeah. This is feels like a blast from the past, but no
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.300]   Last November we introduced a preview on web of a fully redesigned Google plus remember that yes
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.500]   To make it easier for people to discover and connect it really highlighted communities or collections I should say
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.060]   Since introducing the new version twice as many collections are followed per day and well of course
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.740]   It's the first thing you see when you sign in now and there are 1.6 million daily nude community joins
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.620]   Wow 1.6 million new daily i'm surprised there 1.6 million daily users, but there are
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.860]   At least
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.540]   So the new features you can now have richer conversations by adding links and photos to your comments. I like that
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.620]   That's one of the things I like about facebook, you know, you can put a picture in the comment
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.860]   Usually a gif showing your actual reaction
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.740]   to the post
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:40.180]   We're also offering community owners and moderators more control over who posts what with approving posts with approved posting who posts what?
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.420]   With approved posting finally we're launching a new notification center on the web where you can see and manage see
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.740]   This is one of the problems people have been complaining about Google plus the notifications. It's all just hey
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.740]   You got eight million spam posts, right?
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.780]   But but maybe not I do not want any more spaces notifications. Thank you
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:07.140]   These features will become will be available across the web androids in the coming weeks. So right now these are
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.180]   web only second
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.420]   If you haven't previewed the new google plus over the next few days, we're going to upgrade you anyway
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.660]   But you will be able to toggle back for the time being
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.980]   Finally businesses have told us they found google plus to be a valuable way to help employees. Oh an internet version
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.380]   share ideas and expertise
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.500]   So we're looking to make it more available in more organizations today. Jeff Jarvis
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.140]   Google apps users already using google plus will see a new experience
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.260]   It'll be become a core google for
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.260]   Not an apps user using google plus because I still have the damn old google account on google plus
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.100]   You have to rub it in and I'm finally thinking you know, I never did
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.420]   The conversions all my photos are on that account. I think it's finally time to just go ahead and move it over
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.860]   I like google plus I wanted to survive badly and I'm
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.820]   I'm encouraged by this attention
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:07.060]   It's like five people are there anymore, right the same guys well and you get a lot of spam and that's the real problem is the comment
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.020]   The comments have gone from being valuable
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.380]   Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Here's the new a new experience. I just clicked my google plus
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.860]   Amazing things are all around us
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.140]   But most people never find them because they're never here
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.740]   And welcome to the new google plus follow amazing things made by passionate people
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.020]   Holy cow another full screen takeover
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.380]   And then it takes you to the collections damn thing instead of the whole right which I don't really want
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.780]   But maybe that's just the first time
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.260]   Or maybe that's to get people that's I mean to get people excited about it
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.580]   Right and this is why by the way you're getting this
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.980]   on the you know this 1.6 million people joining communities every day because
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.500]   This is what you see so it's worked for me. I've joined a lot of communities, but um
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:00.420]   All right, I'm not going to join screw mugs drone community. However
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.180]   Uh, anyway, so there you go and then you can go back to your home
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.700]   So you still want to take your google plus link off
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.140]   Mind you I loved it for ages. I really did it was my favorite
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.020]   But I to be honest if anybody wanted to get me there, I can find me there
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.020]   I
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:21.460]   Don't know where else they're gonna find enough for all these I can't find Stacy there. What's the point?
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.540]   Oh Stacy doesn't use it does she?
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.780]   I mean no, I have an account. I think I have two because I had a
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.940]   I might have three
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:35.220]   Because I had google apps at giga ohm then we had I have my I use google apps for my business and
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.820]   My regular gmail. Yeah, this is why I never use google plus
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.300]   But uh
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.300]   Everybody has one right because as soon as you have a google account as you may like you have a google plus account
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.260]   So it's there, but yes, I'm never there every now and then Kevin actually gets a lot of usage from it
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.860]   He's got a really big community. So if you want to find Kevin TOEFL and talk to him
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:08:01.860]   That's where to find him. Well and in fact google for work is going to get some benefit out of this. So maybe that's I know maybe that's kevin's influence
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:06.980]   Maybe it was it was pre all of his google stuff. Is there any history
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:14.180]   Any evidence historical evidence that could point to the idea that you can revive a failing social network
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:19.540]   Like I don't think there's any time in the history of mankind or cut
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.540]   You could sell it to AOL. Oh, yeah, there you go
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:29.140]   You can make money off of it. Wouldn't that be amazing if google sold it? No, don't sell at google
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:34.340]   Uh, you I don't think you can revive a social network because it's the reverse network effect
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.580]   It's snowballs. Yep in the reverse direction just as it's snowballs in the forward direction
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.140]   I don't know you can bring back
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.220]   I'm just trying to think you could bring back shopping centers. You could bring back
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:52.900]   I mean social networks haven't been around long enough to really think about there to figure this out. So it's hard to say but
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.580]   I mean you can bring back failing brains
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.620]   Yeah, I guess so and google plus
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:05.140]   Was beloved and there are people like me who would come back if you could show me that
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.860]   There was something going on with it
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.940]   I
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.700]   as a type c
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:17.220]   Cable accessories reviews community collections. Yes. Yes. That's useful. Yeah
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.820]   Well, we've always said that google plus the best way to follow googlers
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.340]   But even googlers don't use it anymore
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.820]   Um
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.500]   I am going to make a pledge that this I am going to
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.900]   See I don't post on social media much anymore. Anyway, I post on instagram
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.820]   I post pictures once in a while
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.940]   You know post a sad posted a sad picture on my instagram and facebook yesterday
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.660]   the um
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.500]   The last picture of the brick house studios because as you know, we have to um
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.380]   Today's you know the rent runs out
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.980]   Yeah, what's kind of sad? I also you know like I wanted to
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.820]   Get that
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.340]   That round fixture there for the house, which one you can have anything you want
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:09.460]   That one right there last chance, you know, that's just a tub of tupperware tub. I don't know it is
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.940]   It's what it uses lips over and painted gold
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:18.260]   And uh these I know I don't hate to I think we should go get these. I don't know. I think you should yeah
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.740]   We have nowhere to put them. That's the problem
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:26.180]   You know storage no storage. I mean we were already kind of bursting at the seams in the new place
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.500]   Um, so
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:34.340]   We saved a lot. I mean if look at look at we saved the gear behind me. We saved and this table behind me in fact in this shot
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.060]   It's basically the same stuff you would have seen
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.260]   in the old days
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260]   You had to read I mean you rebought
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.140]   Cable lane and all that stuff. Yeah, well, you know, I should
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.060]   Alex gumple took a set of pictures on his facebook
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.900]   Feed
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:57.540]   I should show you how much I actually I went yesterday it appalled me how much we left because we spent
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:04.980]   I guess you can't reuse cabling. I don't know we spent so much money on killing and um
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.940]   Uh, it's all still there. We didn't take any of it away
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.420]   So all this but this is reminds me of this is like Chernobyl
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:21.060]   Yeah, this is like see all this cable the basement. Oh, man the cable is all still there. We didn't take any of it with us
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.100]   There's 30 000 worth of cable. Oh
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.380]   Just there
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.820]   Oh, those are good shows. Oh, shall yeah use those shells in your garage. Oh
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:37.300]   No, there's there's server racks. They don't really okay. Not those shelves. Those are those are chassis's but the other
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.020]   Right there these shelves
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.980]   That somebody likes to go to uh, why did we leave those containers to get those? Yeah, we'll go with those
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.580]   We today's the last day tomorrow is we you know, September 1st
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.740]   Um
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.260]   We'd have to a lot of stuff. These are nice racks, but we I guess we didn't need them
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:12:00.980]   This is so the bricks. Uh, we're almost done. This was the remaining these few you really are taking the bricks with you
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:06.980]   Yeah, see that wow see what the walls look like when you remove those because they were they were glued
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.020]   They were cemented to the dry wall. How much of that?
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.860]   I didn't do it. I think it was a pain
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.580]   Yeah, and then and then they've gone back to our contractors where they're going to
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.980]   Wash them in an acid bath or something to get all the uh dry wall
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.540]   How much is that gonna cost you?
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:30.580]   More probably more than we made on the bricks. Yeah, exactly. Oh, isn't that sad?
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.340]   That's what it looks like from the street where the lights are on and you look through the windows and
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.060]   You left a lamp
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.860]   Leo we left a lot of stuff. We don't have the room. We did take this sign. I thought
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.340]   Yeah, I'm sure we sure we took that sign. It's a nice sign. Yeah, we took the sign
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:54.100]   And are you in a standalone building or like an office building? We're in an office building. There's uh, it's a it's a one story office building
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.740]   It's an office park. So you have any branding outside? We will that sign will go up. It will be outside
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.740]   It's not up yet, but that but that sign will be outside
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.980]   Um actually you may not there may be um limits on what we can do actually
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.220]   I don't know if that sign will be outside if we can
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.660]   We may it may be too big and may may not be able to light it. I don't know
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.060]   Lisa's looking into that but we uh
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.780]   We will have signage obviously
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:20.420]   appropriate signage depending on the CC and ours. That's my old office there. See that empty spot
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.980]   And that's a lot of junk to a mood
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.980]   Yeah, thank you to god. What a great team they worked so hard
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.780]   Including john slania jamerby on the left
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.060]   Alex gumple birk mccwin who did a lot of the demo
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.780]   Terret tear down wait a minute
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:39.140]   This is this is going backwards. This is before we moved in
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.420]   Oh, holy cow
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.900]   This is them before they had got beat down
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.100]   By
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:53.060]   This is before we did the build out and this is after that's the after
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:57.140]   Anyway, I don't want it. I don't want it to well on it
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.500]   Uh
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.260]   We had to move
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.540]   We had to we didn't have a choice. I loved the rotating
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.900]   I know and we don't need to do that really this too
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.300]   I know but it was right sit in the corner and see everything karsten's not rotating anymore
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.300]   He's just over there in the back
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:19.380]   That's all right. This is more like a traditional tv studio if you come in here you go. Oh, yeah, I recognize the television studio
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.380]   Uh, so it's kind of like google plus
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:30.820]   It says if I went over there and tated the wall and said hey welcome back to the new brick house studios. No
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:36.020]   No, I am going to make an effort to use google plus. I yeah, I should too because there's no
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.620]   twig
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.620]   but but also what else
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.260]   What else is there? I'm not I think twitter
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.220]   Twitter's fine if you want to send
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.340]   brief
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.380]   Communications
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.540]   I know it feels more and more as I go back there that all the communications are very self-serving
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:00.900]   What do you think stacey you wanted you defend twitter, don't you? I do I like twitter
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.420]   I usually use it to link back to things i've created elsewhere. It's promotional
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:11.140]   But well, no, I mean I have really great conversations with people on twitter as well
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.060]   so I don't know I even use it to reach out to people and
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:20.420]   again, that's it. I think it's just the community you build up in
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.500]   The community I built up is for the most part. They know who I am
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:30.100]   I've met most of them or we argue about like cloud architectures, which it's really hard to get upset
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.100]   I have as much of an argument on twitter though. It's so disjointed and it is
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.580]   You know, and I also I miss loren wines time
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:41.860]   And he's and he is on google plus very he's the best he's the last man standing
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.860]   God bless you. He's boy. He's good
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:49.140]   So I do follow him and and thank goodness he's put so let me just look at my uh my twitter feed
[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.460]   jenna worth him
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.420]   Should I buy a mesh bomber? Yes or no don't even know what that is
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.140]   It's a jacket. She should not okay
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:00.900]   See maybe I just i'm not hip enough. Ellen's a generous
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.420]   I don't know who done it, but they already does it for fingerprints. I don't care don't want to see it
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.900]   Uh, here's a fake, you know
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.660]   Will macavoy account
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.740]   Renee richy. I've written over 30 000 words on ios 10 already
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.860]   None of this stuff is that useful to me. You know i'm saying
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:20.100]   Okay, well now i've got to go look at my twitter feed if you really think of it
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:24.580]   If you think of it, it's it's it's quips. It's bull mo
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.300]   It's promotional
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.900]   It's uh, I think it prom it pro it promotes
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:36.580]   Kind of a fragmented way of thinking. I want long form and I think google plus was good about long form
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.340]   It is but you know, you know, but i'll say this and twitter's been driving me nuts for a lot of reasons
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.300]   But last last night when trump announced he was going to mexico
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.420]   And I just said um
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.660]   I put a tweet up that said uh
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.620]   Okay, here's the deal
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.660]   We'll build the wall real quick. Uh, why you got it, but then you keep them
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:00.260]   I saw your tweet and but the great thing about that wasn't mean it was it spread in spanish like crazy
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.580]   Right that that can happen on twitter. Yeah, and so what?
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.220]   I know it makes me feel like i'm
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.180]   Yeah, jeff jeff feels good about that
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.180]   Or
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.980]   Uh, sassy just said that as if well and he doesn't have much reason to feel good. So give him that leo
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.980]   I mean come on leo. No, okay. So here's here's how I use twitter
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:27.060]   I follow an amazing array of people like I follow a bunch of like particle physicists
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:32.660]   I follow people who are in nasa. I follow people who follow fcc filings and argue about like radio stuff
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:38.100]   I follow a bunch of satellite nerds and like basically if you are smarter than me
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.740]   I probably follow you or if you're a journalist friend x-pipes why you don't follow me or jeff
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.540]   I follow jeff
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.940]   Whoa
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.940]   leo you say you're not on twitter
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.980]   I just now i'm really not on twitter
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.660]   Oh
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.220]   I might actually oh, I don't know. I don't care
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.540]   Oh
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.740]   Before she does anything look it up and see what she follows you follow who you are
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.460]   I follow you and you follow me see
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:13.780]   Anyway, so what if I tore down should I tear down all of my my feet and start over?
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.220]   Oh, no again
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:21.300]   Delete everyone and start over with only really awesome people like people who are just gonna you know what i'm gonna do is
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:28.660]   Is I think there's a way to follow just stacy's feed right just my feet. Um, yeah, it's called my login
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.820]   I follow I follow
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.820]   2,571 people that's too many
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.660]   Oh, I follow I think I follow like a thousand people
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:41.780]   I'm crazy. I know you only read is my media wonk's list
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:47.460]   Yeah, you can do that with lists. So I don't have to actually delete people I could create a list and just read the list
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.780]   That's what I don't I don't look at my whole feed at all. I haven't ages. That's maybe the way to do it
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.660]   I just feel like the conversation
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:59.540]   On google plus always was better. It was more long form
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:05.140]   True true. I love it that I can now put content into my comments
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:09.140]   I don't know I've oh, you know what i'm
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:16.900]   I I left i've left twitter more times than I can count. Yes, you have i've i've promoted jikou
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.580]   Pounce
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:23.300]   So many of these twitter clones. I said these are better jikou was better was threaded conversation
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:28.500]   None of them survived twitter will go forever twitter is like the cockroach that's gonna survive nuclear winner indeed
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:33.460]   Uh, it's gonna bring it's gonna simultaneously bring on nuclear winner and survive it
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:40.180]   Meanwhile kim kardashians making $187,000 for every picture she posts
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.500]   she's good for her
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.260]   I'm serious good for her. She has made
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.700]   crazy amounts of money by being famous and
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:55.780]   Mark like seeing the social media zeitgeist and being like, you know what i'm good at this. I can monetize it
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.620]   Twitter is the match game of our generation
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.660]   Howard's term was talking about that the other day that
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:07.460]   He always wondered about celebrities on match game because none of them were famous for any good reason
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.580]   So that's what twitter is like with kim kardashian. She's not famous for a good reason
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.340]   I okay, so here's here's where i'm gonna disagree with you
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.060]   Okay
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:22.900]   She is aspirational she's famous because she has made it her business to be seen
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.580]   And she does a really good job of quote-unquote being seen
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.060]   And a social media famous
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:34.660]   Right in an a social media era. That's what you know. All right. Okay. That's interesting. All right. All right. All right
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.980]   All right, let's play so so well on the match game days you had people or what was a peggy
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:44.180]   Carlisle was famous for nothing but peggy what was a car lyle and peggy cast
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.580]   Peggy cast right people who did?
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:53.060]   Absolutely the match game was to be here, but most of them was so so kitty Carlisle was who was she was somebody's wife, right?
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.620]   What was her claim to fate? What was the match game?
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:03.540]   I'm sorry you guys. I'm like wait a second. I don't know what you're talking about old or too old or too old
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.380]   Um
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:10.260]   There I guess here's the point even okay. John you remember you know who johnny karson is
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:15.460]   There were people who were famous just because they appeared on the tonight show
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.060]   And that was what they not its comics or anything. They just went on those guests
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.340]   However
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:26.100]   It was somewhat like in france or people for famous who are just appearing on shows they're called public intellectuals
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.260]   Yes, and you're a public intellectual jeff. I mean, that's kind of what you are
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.420]   so
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:39.540]   Uh, we don't do public intellectuals in the united states because we're anti-intellectual fundamentally ever since the days when adley stevenson was called an egghead
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.420]   uh, so
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.420]   Uh, we have other types right but i would go to stacy's point right?
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.500]   I
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.140]   Guess we always mocked peggy cast and such because all because the show made them famous
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:58.100]   They were famous because they were on the show and right and it was it was a cycle right but there was nothing
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:04.180]   They never did anything what stacy I think just said is that in a social media era they're different from a show or a network
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.780]   Knowing how to become famous is itself the reward
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.580]   Keep carlile was here. This is gonna really make
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:15.780]   This is gonna be a reference. Nobody except you and I will get it was married was married
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:19.220]   My buddy her claim to fame when she was married to moss heart us heart all right
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.500]   And then she became a kind of a spokesperson for the arts
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:28.180]   Yes, she did peggy cast was was she not an actress or comedian or something
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:37.060]   So I do think more about kim kardashian. I do think well no here. Yeah, she was a comedian
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.860]   I do think that what happens still to this day is people are I mean, um
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.540]   Uh, the nerd let's talk about the nerdest
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:52.340]   He's he you know, he's a comedian. He's a working comedian, but he's really better known for being upon you know a guy who's
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.860]   You see on tv and stuff. I mean what is uh
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:01.300]   What is what's his name's town now? I can't remember his name. He's such a non-entity, but he's everywhere
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.020]   He was even at the olympics
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:10.580]   He's such an entity. He can't remember his name ryan c crest. Yeah, he's he doesn't have it
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.260]   He's faceless
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.420]   But he's kind of benignly faceless. So he's just talk about famous
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:23.540]   He is he is not again. I think we're underestimating a couple things ryan c crest
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:31.620]   Works hard. I mean he he's I mean, I don't I don't I'm sure kim kardashian works hard. Yeah exactly these people. I mean
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.660]   There's nothing that says that to be famous
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:40.020]   Okay, but there at least trolls are tearing people down. I would I would argue
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.940]   Hard work alone is not
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:49.780]   But people give her crap because they don't necessarily value the things she's famous for
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:52.500]   It's a good point if she were a man. I don't think like
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:57.380]   I don't think she'd be like ryan c crest. Yeah, she were ryan c crest or uh, yeah, yeah
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:04.900]   I mean ryan c crest is a wonderful m c and host in by golly does and he was a dj still is a dj. I think yeah
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.780]   so I mean
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.060]   That's famous because her father was it was oj simpson's
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.660]   buddy and lawyer she's famous because she had a sex tape
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.620]   And she used to be paris hiltons assistant
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.860]   She was
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.860]   I know
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:29.380]   Kardashian, but she also I mean she's also famous now and she's gained so much credibility because she's parlayed those two things into
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:35.700]   This crazy empire that's connected with lots of young women who value her lifestyle
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:39.140]   She is like a martha steward. You know, what's more the steward good at?
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:48.900]   The cheese at the top tier, but in the second tier there are a dozen or a hundred youtube hosts like michael fan who are similarly
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.220]   successful and famous
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.580]   uh
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:58.740]   Because of the platform. It's the social platform. It does very well for some people. Anyway, this all started because the san francisco
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.100]   um
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.100]   talent agency captivate
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.420]   and by the way, it's captive with an eight the number eight at the end
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.500]   because
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.300]   internet
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:16.180]   Said that internet influencers with the following of three to seven million people could make 75 000 on average
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.820]   for a promotional post on instagram
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.900]   on youtube
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.340]   187 000 we're not talking about youtube ads
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:30.980]   We're talking about exactly the kind of thing pewdiepie got in trouble for basically native content
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:36.020]   Uh, so kim kardashian published a video clip on instagram
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.260]   hashtag ad because the ftc requires this
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:47.700]   Excited to be partnering with sugar bear hair to share their amazing hair vitamins with you these chewy
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:54.820]   gummy vitamins are delicious and a favorite part of my hair care routine and uh put a video clip up
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.580]   and
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:01.300]   Presumably made you know 75 000 or more for it just for that
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.740]   Someone with three to uh, let's see
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:11.700]   75 is the average instagram or snapchat if you've got enough followers 30 000 on twitter
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:16.420]   Which shows you that twitter followers are not perhaps as accurate a measure
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:23.460]   But if you have 50 to 500 000 followers on on youtube you can make 2500 dollars for a native content
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.260]   Or a thousand dollars for an instagram post
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:30.180]   Isn't that amazing and
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.020]   I don't I mean if you look at so
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:38.820]   My daughter is huge into youtube stuff and right now and she's she's only tens so she's not doing anything crazy
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:45.780]   Um, but like there is a blogger called stacy plays who has a dog that looks like our dog and
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:52.820]   Um, my daughter loves watching her minecraft videos and she wants a shirt just like stacy place
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:59.060]   She's been looking for a blue stripe shirt now forever because she loves this lady so much and I mean
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:07.060]   That kind of influences is so powerful and when you start applying it directly and stacy's not even selling things
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.980]   If you look at someone like a beauty blogger who's like, right?
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.540]   It's crazy and
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.900]   Yeah, I'd want a piece of that too, except I don't because ethics
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.260]   Um, it's interesting. Um
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:25.220]   It's interesting question because first of all, uh
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.340]   The you know a 10 year old
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.700]   Well a it's illegal to advertise to 10 year olds
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.780]   Well, she says in fairness stacy plays is not advertising
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:39.380]   She is she just happens to wear my daughter just loves her so much
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.380]   For all you know, she's she's paid to wear those blue stripe shirts
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:50.260]   Oh no, I don't believe it this woman rescues dogs and makes dog buying craft. But I apologize
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.340]   I don't I don't mean to slander her
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.940]   um
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.620]   But that is one of the issues and jeff
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.620]   And I've talked about this a lot of native content is that it's not always
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.260]   Obvious who's getting paid to do what?
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:06.100]   Can we talk about this last week that the numbers that I found I wrote a week ago
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:11.940]   That the renewal rate for native advertising is running according to one study 20 percent and another study 40 percent
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.700]   Oh, that's low
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:19.700]   Uh, and and you know the reasons for this become fairly obvious one is huge competition because anybody can make content
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.700]   It's not that special skill
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.380]   Uh and two
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:26.260]   I've always doubted what the ROI really is
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.220]   And native advertising
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.900]   I think that's more it because uh, anybody can make content, but not everybody can get out
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.860]   One at 1.3 million subscribers like stacy plays has
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:39.460]   Right, so the you could there are very clear metrics much clearer than in broadcasting almost
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.020]   Well, I'm not much clearer because broadcasting has ratings
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:46.820]   But there are clear metrics that would direct you where to invest your dollar if you're going
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.140]   But the problem is that cognitive advertising
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:55.940]   I mean kim kardeshin has really pretty hair. Well, well the kind you're talking about there is
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:02.500]   An ROI to sales. Yeah, the kind that you know the the the del executives essay in the new york times
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.340]   Well, and that's the issue is um
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:13.060]   And that's why the renewal rate seems low. I think that's low. I don't i'd have to compare it to renewal rates. Oh, that is
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.860]   Yeah
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:22.980]   So that means people are trying it and not getting the results they're hoping for or they're going to somebody else to make it
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.580]   Or if they're moving around
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:25.940]   The other the other
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.900]   Problem is that what's happening in a lot of media companies is that fine?
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.540]   I make the ad and I charge for that, but it's very expensive and hard to make
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:37.700]   And then uh, I have to buy media to drive traffic to the ad
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.260]   It's like the old scm
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:45.700]   Or I have to pay to place this stuff elsewhere because it's not getting viral. So I gotta put it there myself
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:50.420]   So here's the uh kim kardashian and by the way instagram now gives you
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:56.260]   Uh view information too clearly aimed at this exact kind of advertising 12.3 million views of this
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:01.620]   But instagram doesn't get any cut of her. That's what's weird. Yeah, it is and this is
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.380]   I want to understand how hair vitamins work
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.940]   Is it like prenatal vitamins because when you take those your hair gets super long and it's awesome
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:12.340]   Are you actually asking that question? Yeah, it stays here. You're scaring both of us here
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:16.500]   You're actually saying oh, I believe this ad. I don't
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:20.020]   I think we have to do program Stacy
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:23.140]   Okay, two true for the center pre-natal vitamin
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.780]   To a decardashian. I
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.020]   I
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:33.940]   Not not a fan because just if only because I cannot figure out the rules of contouring my face
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.900]   My god, that is so crazy. Uh, but
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.900]   I mean vitamin vitamin can make a difference in your hair. I'm sure they do
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.580]   Um, I don't think that's really the issue in this ad
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:52.500]   Is that is that not what i'm supposed to be paying attention?
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.660]   I don't think that's what you're supposed to be paying attention to and that's the other question is
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:00.660]   Uh, how much does sex play in all of this really? I mean
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.740]   Sex sells ads all the time. It's not just kim kardashian
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:09.940]   That's why she's so successful or one reason is because she's like hell. Yeah, i'm a hot lady
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:15.540]   And I can teach other people how to look hot. Right. I mean, she has I mean, let's not let's face it. She has great hair
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:20.260]   She does. She has a lot of hair. I don't know if we can ascribe it to chewable gummy vitamins
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:28.500]   Like don't know I imagine many many many stylists at work all the time
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.180]   But look at this
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:37.620]   1,750 comments many of them by the way, and this is a problem with the instagram spam as you can see
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:42.260]   Uh, in fact almost all of them yeah, they're worthless who's gonna read any of this
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.820]   Uh, but that's engagement
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.820]   Uh, no, it's not
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.140]   Hey
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:54.660]   Bank sleigh says if I have a uh bank debit card holder and i'm in the negative or overdraft
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.420]   I can get money just chew this call but it'll fix it for you
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.340]   She you know, I have to um I do have to admire her
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:08.500]   Because if we assume that this number is correct and she made somewhere north of $100,000 for this post
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:13.300]   She did not put a lot of work into that. That's a good pay to aim for
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.260]   That for a boomerang basically
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.140]   Okay, well, we don't know that she didn't
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.260]   We think she put a lot of work into that
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.820]   I'm just saying you got to do your hair. You got to do your makeup
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:28.740]   I bet Kim Kardashian spends two hours a day on her face in like
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.980]   Everything I bet she spends a lot of time doing this
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:41.060]   She does have a book called selfie. Yeah, she's taking she's taking a selfie
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:46.820]   That's kind of meta selfie a picture of you taking a selfie is kind of an interesting choice
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.540]   Have you seen her coffee table book
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.900]   It is funny pewdiepie has 47,000,000
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.220]   4,000
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:03.140]   Subs 13 billion views he also i'm sure gets a hundred thousand dollars when he says
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:11.140]   I like this game everybody should buy it and he in fact got dinged by the ftc for not being upfront enough about the fact that he was doing paid
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:17.860]   Content and he should as he should that's that's that's the other side of this article is
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.300]   Uh, you know because there's so much money here
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:26.420]   Uh people really got to be responsible. I think young people really I mean
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.700]   We obviously are a little bit skeptical
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.020]   um, but
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:39.220]   You look at a young person who's looking at these people and who maybe has grown up with these people and they're they feel like friends because they talk to you and they
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:43.220]   That is hard
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.580]   I don't know. Yeah
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:49.940]   No, it's just you know what what you're hearing stacy is uh an old media guy
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.940]   I
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.620]   Crumbling because I didn't think of this first
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:02.020]   I would it a way you did. I mean you bring gadgets are and things on the show and you talk to people about them
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.580]   You just have different standards leo ad is
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.700]   Actually, that's true
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:14.020]   We get we get we're well paid for our ads. So i'm not really complaining and more power tour
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.780]   I'm not in fact. I shouldn't complain at all. I think you're absolutely right stacy. No no
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.340]   Very good sense. I say it's very good. It's
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.300]   We're we're gonna do some contouring later on next show
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:27.540]   I actually know how to contour and I will show you how to contour holy cow
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:31.380]   I see I just have never wanted to spend the time watching a video on how to stick
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:36.500]   Different colors of I was taught how to be on my face because it's a television personality
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:42.420]   One must know how to narrow one's nose when cheek, you know highlight the cheekbones
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:49.700]   Conceal the bags when I'm when I come on we can we can have you contour my face and it'll be it'll be hilarious
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.940]   We'll be like to stay see you look different. I have

[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:05.140]   I did not want to know his head. I shaved his head. That's even worse
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:10.100]   Can't unsee in my brain. It is creepy. Isn't it? You're absolutely right. That's just creepy
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:16.740]   Okay, and here's some good news. Uh, we are planning another new year's eve party in the new
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:21.700]   Oh, no, really? I don't it won't be 24 hours because I can't I'm too old and no
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.900]   Yeah, but I think we'll do eight hours or something. We'll do something fun
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:29.140]   Oh, yeah, I was I was able to get the boss to to to approve
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.780]   The expenditure live on the air
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:36.420]   Yeah, what we did you weren't around but we did it two years in a row and jeff was here for one of them
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:43.700]   We did a 24 hour uh telethon on new years eve starting at three a.m. New years eve because that's the first new years eve
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.860]   Celebrated in whatever some mo are somewhere
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:53.860]   Uh, I think sandwich islands and then uh all the way to three a.m. New years day where the last new years eve celebration

[00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:01.140]   And we did a countdown every hour sometimes several times an hour depending on the time zones
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:06.580]   Popped champagne had a balloon drop and then we had acts and and we raised money the second one we raised
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.660]   What was it 80?
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:11.140]   80 000 90 000 dollars for uniceff. It was a lot of fun
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:17.220]   That's my miss stacie was uh leo getting a his head shaved and be a tattoo

[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:29.620]   And that's why and that's why jeff got his head shaved because because we my head my beard
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.020]   Oh, it was just your beard not your head. I was my head
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:37.620]   It was you was the head but jeff said if you know if we get to 50 000 or whatever was I will shave my beard and he and we did
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:41.780]   So it was a lot of fun. I'll you should come out new years eve. That was great. Um
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:45.860]   Maybe i'm not gonna do anything wacky like shave my head or
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:49.700]   In fact, I had to promise I would never do that again. Oh, you did. Oh
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.580]   Oh, yeah
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:54.580]   Lisa was not happy about either
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:37:00.020]   The tattoo was the worst of us she was very the best part of the best part was lisa
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:04.660]   Tried to act as leo's press agent stopping people taking pictures of his naked butt. Yeah

[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:26.820]   We raised a lot of money. I think we built a hospital in guatamala. I think there's something like that in south america
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.300]   I can't remember what it was but unicev said come down and see the hospital your money bill
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:34.180]   Wow. Yeah

[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:45.140]   Well, they they they did say that I think they've said that all along. We will not you know, you can't replace these
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.900]   Can't barely can repair it's a great machine. I mean, that's what I use
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.580]   um
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:55.300]   Constantly it's a great machine. I have my gen one in the office and my gen two here at home
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.260]   You're right. The hope is that this means they'll come up with another one
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.460]   And everybody's hanging great. Hope on the fact that they hired
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:04.180]   Uh a job for pixel
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:10.740]   So let's hope uh, yeah, I mean, I think if not I the age at least the expensive hp
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:15.140]   There's a good problem out there. That's that's the that's the
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.820]   The closest is that the one you like the best the hp crumbok
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:22.900]   No, it has all the all the specs you need except for touch screen. They come on the later. It's very expensive
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.540]   There's a
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:27.540]   About a thousand bucks. What?
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:31.460]   I think they look up the hp crumbock 13 got great reviews
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:35.940]   No, I can't be that much really I only see two if you get to high end
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:40.820]   You sure I only see two crumbooks. I see an 11 inch for hp crumbock 13
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.700]   Oh
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:48.740]   It's not there. I think you're I think you're fantasizing. No, I'm not I've got it on my screen
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:51.380]   Look at my screen
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.380]   I can't
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:58.740]   Oh, it just was announced. That's why oh, it was just no no lots of different one. No, this one's been out for a while
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:03.700]   All right, let me look at it should be that long, but it's been oh, oh it is pretty it's thrust aluminum
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:08.260]   Yeah, there was a price. It's too small a screen executive level style
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:12.340]   Um, it is it looks just like an makbokir
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.060]   quad hd plus panel 30
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:18.100]   99
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.620]   but
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:22.580]   Uh, the one they reviewed at four was one for 800
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:30.340]   Oh, and then there's a thousand dollar one. I think godly that is a lot of money. That is that's a fancy crumbock. Let me let me uh,
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:36.500]   Juice it up 1299 the highest level is 1299, which is the pixel was what 1300?
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:42.340]   You'd have to really go crazy though to get it to that price. Oh, it's my it's my primary machine. It's my only machine. Yeah
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:46.020]   Now that I can get it all the way up to 1600 bucks
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:50.020]   if I have a
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:52.820]   M7 i7 mobile
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:56.100]   Uh running at 3.1 gigahertz 16 gigs of ram
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:02.900]   You don't need I think four days. I really need that it should have a touch screen. This quad hd screen probably is very nice
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:08.900]   Wi-fi yeah, you can get it up. I've got it up to 2000 bucks. No do not buy a
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:13.300]   $1,000 Chromebook don't even I will say don't tell me also
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.260]   Get one for me for for Christmas. I'll be happy to
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:19.860]   I would get a bigger screen or is 13 the right size for you 13
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:23.540]   Here's tells a 13 inch Chromebook
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:32.660]   Similarly priced it's also aluminum unibody and all that this is must be aiming at the uh, the uh executive market executive
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.540]   The two things they don't have are one touch screen
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:40.020]   Right. This one doesn't either right. Yeah, two as you know, I always complain about no LTE
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.980]   Uh, yeah, that's weird. I would get a touch screen
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:45.700]   Absolutely get a touch screen
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:52.900]   Uh, just especially the android is going to be coming onto it right right absolutely need touch screen on on a Chromebook going forward
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:59.620]   But I it may be it may be that google says we don't need to do the pixel anymore because there are these really good
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.820]   I don't want to hear that
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:10.420]   You can get up to 15 inches. So these are makes a 15 inch Chromebook if you want big size and live love you to google
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:17.700]   You know, I really you know, here's what I want google to do really
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:22.420]   Uh is the part of the problem with the Chromebook is you can't really
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:27.140]   I would like to be able to install chrome os like i install an xt to pick the hardware i want
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:29.700]   And then put chrome os
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.940]   On it and make it into a Chromebook
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:37.460]   Yes, that's why why what what is the hardware spec that doesn't make that just obviously
[00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:44.180]   Open source projects for the chromium os just like chrome's analog in the open source world is chromium
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.540]   But it isn't it isn't really
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:53.780]   Designed to put on a machine. I think that may be because of the security
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.780]   code
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:44:01.140]   Remember you can't it's assigned os you cannot modify the os on a chrome book without
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:02.820]   uh
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.820]   Triggering a warning it won't even boot
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.700]   um, right you have to really you know
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.620]   So
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:14.980]   I've looked and there are some companies that say we can put chrome os but it's limited like I wanted there
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:19.220]   There there's companies that could put chrome os on max on mac laptops
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:22.260]   Um, but it's funny, but it's kind of limited
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:28.580]   The hardware it'll support and I even wonder how you know, you have to turn off the secure boot and stuff. So
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.580]   This never wears the company. I think yeah, never where
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:38.340]   Uh turns any it's never where w a re.com. They have something called crout cloud ready
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.700]   They've modified it in such a way that you can install it on a pc
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:45.940]   Uh, but it's hardware compatibility is a little
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:52.100]   Limited I I wasn't able to get it on but so I guess this is pretty close
[00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.740]   This is pretty close
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:45:01.940]   So you could I guess we could find you a nice a nice laptop and put uh chrome os on it or dual boot it
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:04.020]   I think that'd be a good way to do it. Mm-hmm
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.500]   Uh
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:11.860]   Hiroshi lokheimer is this is something for you. Uh stacey higginbotham. Oh, yes
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:17.540]   I'm excited about that piece of news and one other so so all the nest develop. What does this mean for nest?
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:22.180]   man, that is what you know kevin and I were talking about this this morning because
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:28.820]   It so the story is a little bit vague and I I trust these people because I used to work with them
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:31.380]   And they are just like totally awesome reporters
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:34.020]   So dan and lina discovered that
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:38.660]   Google is moving their software platform people for nest over to the google
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:43.700]   team and they're under Hiroshi lokheimer who's in charge of all of android so
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.900]   brings up a couple questions one
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:50.580]   does nest is it just going to be like selling hardware and
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:58.740]   Is it just the existing nest hardware because it sounds like the nest software people are going to go into google's kind of google home and some of the google
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:03.700]   Iot hardware and we should see actually some cool stuff coming out from them
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.940]   um and then
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:10.580]   The other question I have is man. What does this mean for alphabet in this whole sub city or
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.460]   effort exactly my thought if they could just poach
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:19.220]   The best talent from one of the alphabet companies and put it in another alphabet company
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:26.260]   That's not good. Well, maybe that they're saving it. So think about what we've heard. We've heard fiber having issues
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:31.300]   We've got they've fired half of the half of the state at google fiber
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:36.500]   They cut down to 500 employees and basically they're looking at wireless. They're abandoning it
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:40.500]   Yeah, so if you look at that you look at the costs that you know
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:46.980]   I'm trying to remember the revenue and then the costs was at 1.2 billion that other has cost them in the last year
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:51.780]   Was it the last quarter? I have to go look at the financials. Um, it's been a lot of money
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:55.620]   That's why that's the goo the moon shots the google accent stuff
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:47:00.740]   Well, so moon shot there was complaints about moon shot astroteler went on saying look it's really difficult
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:04.100]   So if you take all of these pieces together
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.740]   it feels very much like
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:12.500]   Ruth parrots efforts to like bring financial accountability to some of google's craziness
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:17.780]   It's possibly working, but not in a way that feels good to the traditional google
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:21.540]   ethos are the bean counters in charge
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:28.660]   So, um, there's a lot so you we've a lot of points here. Let's start there was a lot happening
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:30.740]   Let's start with nest itself
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:36.260]   um, so the nest platform team is now part of google
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:38.180]   and
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.540]   the senior vice president of android horoshi lokheimer
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:46.820]   Is now running it a combined group that will work on google home
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:53.220]   Uh google what are they that's the that's the echo. That's the echo, right? That's the echo, uh, and
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:58.980]   Maybe more, uh, you know google home stuff
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:03.300]   So I think that makes sense because when nest
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:11.300]   Back in 2014 when google bought nest the idea in the smart home was all about like these individual devices and making them smart and having them
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:14.660]   eventually work together independent kind of of people
[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:17.140]   and
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.820]   What's been the reality and that didn't that failed for a number of reasons
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:26.420]   The reality now that everyone's glomming on to is personal assistance and voice control for the home
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:32.100]   So if you think that way you're like, well screw this everything else is smart. That's not working out for us
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:38.020]   Let's pull everybody in we need to combine smart connected devices with the personal assistant
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:43.620]   Because if you don't have any connected devices you still want to have the value of a personal assistant
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:48.820]   And people will still buy into that product and then they'll gradually add connected devices
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:52.980]   That's my I agree. I think that's a it's a wedge into the
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.300]   Automated home
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:49:00.020]   Because it's so hard to do everybody you know you and I have both spent a lot of time banging our heads against
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:04.500]   These systems that don't talk to each other they they have security issues
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:08.580]   It just isn't easy to do it. You have to be a main main a big enthusiast to do it
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:15.620]   So you can just say insane here's a wedge. Yeah, but here's a wedge in fact, maybe that's why
[00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:22.900]   Sonos made that big enough, but we'll get to them though. I don't want I know I know I know I know but you see we're squirrel
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:28.820]   We're being bad. Let's get back to okay because we'll nest fiber. Okay, okay
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:33.860]   Uh, oh god, you know what I need. I need a stack. I'm gonna push that on the stack
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:36.020]   Uh
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:37.780]   But I need a I need a
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:40.020]   Lifo stack no a FIFO stack
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:43.060]   Because it's all out of order now. All right, so
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:50.020]   That's what's going on with nest the speculation is maybe is it over for nest or maybe I mean if you don't if you don't have your developers
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.020]   What do you got? What are they?
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:54.820]   3.2 billion. Yeah, yep
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:58.020]   And you got the developers you got the brand
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:01.860]   And I
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:07.460]   Google wanted to buy drop cam so much of the so there and that was a separate deal but
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:10.260]   So much of that hardware
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:17.140]   Makes sense still so google with drop cam for example got a lot of imagery that it can use to do
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.820]   Uh artificial intelligence and machine learning around computer vision
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.620]   So that's a good deal
[00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:27.220]   If it it could also divorce the hardware and ship that into the world
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:31.220]   But if you really buy into the the value of the internet of things being software
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.860]   then
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:40.340]   They basically spent 3.2 billion dollars and they just bought brought the people they spent that money on in house
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:44.180]   It was an acquire little did we know
[00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:47.380]   Yeah
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:49.300]   All right fiber
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:54.740]   We had a by the way a really good triangulation on monday with dane jasper who's the ceon founder of sonic net
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.940]   Which is one of the best independent internet service providers
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:02.180]   They are putting gigabit in a lot of places they put 10 gigabit into our studio
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:09.300]   Um, he was talking about google fiber and the fact that google's backed off it looks like a google fiber
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:11.860]   It's very expensive
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:15.780]   To put the the fiber in the ground you know 500 dollars a foot something like that
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.180]   It's hard to make enough money to make it worthwhile
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:21.460]   Google bought web pass that's one way to make more money because
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:26.580]   Web pass wires office buildings were i'm sorry not office buildings apartment buildings
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:32.580]   Which means it's a lot less expensive and you get a higher density of uh potential customers
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:34.820]   He said though, which I thought was interesting
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:43.140]   Because there's sonic is spending money to trench and put in fiber there's there they're fibering san francisco
[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:46.180]   And he said uh all we need to do
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:52.020]   We obviously need to do it in a fairly populous area, but let's say an example would be san francisco if we can get
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:57.540]   20 to 30 percent of the people were going by we're passing by with the fiber to sign up
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:01.700]   It's economically viable. It's a long-term bet takes you years to amortize
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:09.940]   But what his other bet is which I think is very interesting is it's more than internet tv and telephone that really the fiber is going to empower
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.660]   a huge
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:17.780]   Growth of new technologies all kinds of new technologies. We don't even know about and he's betting on that
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:19.620]   Such as
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:21.620]   Such as ar vr
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:28.020]   You're going to need the low latency of fiber. Yeah, you're going to need I think what's going to happen is we're once we have better connectivity
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.100]   Out to the very edge will have
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:37.380]   Much more peer-to-peer network architectures now. This is a grand technology shift. This is not going to happen tomorrow
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:38.900]   That's where you make money though
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:43.940]   And he's willing to make a long bet on this kind of grand technology shift iot is another one of course
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.780]   Yeah, that's
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:48.020]   Lower data rates, but yeah lots of it in
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:55.620]   Services in being and this so the question then becomes though what happens with net neutrality when you start thinking along these lines, right?
[00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:59.940]   uh, and I am a huge net neutrality band not because
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:06.260]   Only because we live in a duopoly kind of right now exactly and that's what we talked about
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:10.180]   Competition heals these problems
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:16.500]   Right because you are going to need specific you're going to need defined levels of service for different
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:23.860]   uh applications he says the way to do this if we were to go start from scratch and you know,
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:26.660]   immediately lots of barriers to this is to have
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:30.340]   Municipalities put in infrastructure put in fiber
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:35.540]   Just as they put in, you know, water and power and gas lines
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:39.700]   He says we've done this before with rural areas with rural electrification and telephones
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:45.380]   But but but to have federal and local government put in the infrastructure and then make it open
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.820]   And say anybody who wants to use this infrastructure
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:54.820]   Can and the hope is you'd have many many internet service providers many other providers
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:59.300]   Sitting on top of these does that happen anywhere in the United States? Oh, yes, it happens any
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:05.460]   Oh chat nougat and then amstradam actually channel is a bad example because they're a municipal monopoly
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:08.180]   Yes, that's true
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:10.180]   Amsterdam
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:14.500]   In the United States is there an evenness pality happening stock home as well. Sweden does it too
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:17.060]   BT BT in a sense is like that. Yeah
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:24.340]   Bt is a privately installed but open. I think there are yes small towns this whole concept of municipal internet
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:27.940]   The problem is of course this, you know municipal Wi-Fi got shot down
[00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:33.620]   And I mean this is but it does solve I think it's the only solution that I can get my
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:38.020]   Get behind because government involvement in the internet is fraught with peril
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:44.420]   That's the only way you can enforce net neutrality what would be ideal is a situation where you didn't have to worry about net neutrality because
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:50.100]   So many competitors, you know, you wouldn't have to worry about bandwidth caps you wouldn't have to worry about zero rating
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:54.900]   Um, you just any you need true competition the fact that we have a duopoly
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:55:02.100]   In in this country in almost every case monopoly in many situations is not good and that's really the problem
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.460]   Well, okay, so
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:13.060]   I was hoping google would do this. I was hoping it's in google's interest that we google was never going to open it up though
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:18.660]   So back all the way back when they announced Kansas city they said they were gonna open it up and people like dang got really excited
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:23.700]   I remember talking to him about this and then like probably eight months later. They were like, you know what?
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:28.260]   We're not gonna open it up. It costs them two months. It costs them two months
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:32.500]   I don't know if it costs them too much or they would just realize that
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:36.900]   This was a huge undertaking and they weren't gonna get there. I don't I don't know
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:43.540]   I think it comes down to google deciding is this a business we want to make money in or is this another one of those things we do
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:51.060]   That promote internet usage free and open internet usage because we make money on the internet in general and the more people use it the better
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:56.420]   We do and I think that they went at some point from oh, this is just good for us in general too
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:59.300]   We got to make this a business and this is the latest blow
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:03.460]   Uh, the the bean counters once again said it's not a business
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:08.660]   Fire half your staff and stop looking at trenching and start looking at wireless
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:15.860]   So an alternative point of view i'm not saying this is right, but google achieved a lot of their
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:20.100]   What they went after when they did fiber. So when they launched fiber
[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:25.460]   It was not like some utopia and vision of better internet everywhere
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:30.420]   It was a calculated shot across the bow of the right cable providers and so
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:34.100]   from just from them offering free
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:37.060]   50 megabit per second service
[00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:40.820]   Um in Kansas city to people maybe it was 50. I can't remember
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:43.060]   Um, they're lower tier
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:48.740]   Comcast boost their internet essentials program for poor people right so you saw that you saw
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:51.300]   Definitely a public benefit. Yeah
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:54.660]   Yeah, well, I mean, but you saw them push the providers
[00:56:55.300 --> 00:57:00.020]   To boost their speed so Comcast is now, you know gonna offer gigabit everywhere
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:06.100]   Which that was a that was really a doubt to see if that was gonna happen and how long it was going to take but they really only
[00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:12.020]   Cut prices to match google and markets where google's in competition with them
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:16.420]   Right the pricing is not going to be like they're still going to have some insane pricing
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:18.180]   But
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:20.740]   We're going to have the actual physical network still
[00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:28.020]   So right now you and I might have to pay a lot more like $150 for a gigabit whereas google's charging 70
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:30.260]   But some of us are going to pay
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:37.060]   And because of network effects we're going to drive new applications that we need those gigabit speeds and then other people will pay to upgrade
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:41.460]   Um
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:48.740]   By the way dane said that that's part of the problem is adoption rates in fact google's adoption rate in Kansas city was so low
[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:53.780]   They they had hoped to get five million subscribers in the first five years in six years
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:56.580]   Uh, they only got a couple a hundred thousand
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:58:01.060]   Uh, that's everything to the information which had a great scoop on this
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:07.860]   Um, and it's costing them a ton you mentioned that 1.6 billion dollars that google lost on other bets
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:10.340]   That was by the way in the first six months of this year
[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:16.900]   Okay, most of that was cap most of the capital costs were according to ruth pour at google fiber
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:22.260]   So it's um, it's an expensive proposition that's not turning around
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:24.980]   And even it was rooting for him. I know
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:28.580]   Well, because people oh, so here's what dane says
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:31.380]   Geeks want it
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:35.380]   Most people just go. I got what I got internet. I'm fine. I know, you know
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:40.180]   I know it's better and that's a marketing problem. It's a marketing problem
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:45.620]   It's not just a market. I mean that so people would have signed up in some cases for google fiber, but
[00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:50.900]   Your telco operator or your cable operator also was like
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:55.380]   We're gonna lock you in. We're gonna give you this great rate 12 month contract, right?
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:58.180]   Contracts are kind of a way to get about that. Yeah, but also
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:05.380]   I mean, I'm the champion for like futuristic causes that are gonna fail in the first time and then come back around in five years
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:08.340]   And gigabit is definitely one of those things. We need it
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:12.500]   Yeah, we do but you're right most of us are like, I mean
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:18.500]   Most of us don't have wifi internet that can go up to a gig. I mean, I talk to people who are like, man
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:26.100]   My cable provider promises me 300 megabits, but I'm only getting 50. I'm like, my god. What what wifi are you on? They're like, you know
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.900]   Be
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:29.780]   Yeah
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:35.300]   According and this is a great article by kevin mcloaffland and the information which is a subscription only it's paywalled
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:41.460]   But I subscribe to jessica lessons great stuff the takeaway alphabet's decision is shift its google fiber rollout
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:44.420]   to one based on wireless reflects a compromise
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:48.820]   Among senior executives at the company the founders
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:52.580]   This apparently came from Larry page. He'd grown unhappy about the cost
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:55.380]   fiber chief craig barret
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:59.140]   Contemplated leaving because the alphabet restructuring
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:02.500]   Uh, he felt really hurt
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:08.900]   Barrett was told to bring the current cost of google fiber to customers homes to one-tenth
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.620]   its current level
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:18.180]   One-tenth it would take him at the rate they're going the six cities there in 40 years to make back
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:22.180]   The cost of putting the fiber in 40 years
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:31.220]   Yeah, but depends on how you handle the debt on that stuff. I mean, right cable cable companies are never profitable or cashflow
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:36.820]   I think if there weren't wireless options, this might be a different story
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:41.620]   But be I think it's also that larry said well look why are we digging trenches?
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:44.260]   Wireless technology is really coming along
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:49.860]   Uh, just as we used to say when you take when you build a house put in cable put in ethernet
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:54.820]   Now we just say that was waste right because it turns out wireless everybody wants wifi
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:01:00.100]   So maybe that you should still hardwire your tv. I agree. I hardwire everything I can
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:03.140]   Uh, it is a lot better
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:04.420]   but
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:10.740]   Maybe that's what's going on. Maybe they'll be the same. Well, okay, but wifi is going to be good enough and boy a lot less expensive
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:18.020]   And the next generation so what's happening with the the spectrum above 24 gigahertz that google's playing with for some other
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:23.620]   Some drone stuff and some other the loon is that loon is that facebook's I always get those two cookies. No the google's browser
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.540]   So
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:32.100]   That's cheap. It comes in these massive hunks massive megahertz chunks so you can send a lot of data over it
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:37.060]   So it it makes sense. I mean this is it does relatively new technology
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.340]   Why would you ignore it google would never ignore new technology just because
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:41.380]   I was cool
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:44.740]   You want to get geeky listen to the triangulation with dang because it really got geeky
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:50.340]   One of the things he talked about is some of these some of these new technologies are at 60 60 gigahertz 60
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:53.540]   And the problem with that is uh at that
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:58.980]   Uh at that frequency the oxygen in the air yes kills you
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:04.260]   Rain bushes just air just there. Yes. So
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:10.180]   So there's all sorts of but I you know and he we talked about 5g as you've talked about
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:14.340]   On this show and how it's a marketing basket of a lot of different technologies and
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:19.060]   Um, I I but I do think that progress is being made in those areas
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:23.700]   I I but I agree with you sure would be better to have glass if we could get it
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:26.420]   Well, we'll get it out there because to deliver
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.780]   to take advantage of those
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:34.820]   Upper giga upper upper megahertz and gigahertz spectrum
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:38.180]   um, they they're actually you have to do fiber to
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.260]   like
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.700]   Access points is basically what there are some if you're a cellular network
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.700]   It's like a femtosel or pico cell
[01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:47.220]   Um or a daz
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:51.300]   Those are all you have to have fiber capacity for backhaul because you
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:56.500]   Eventually everything has to come back to the internet and eventually it's got to go over a pipe
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:00.580]   So we're gonna see it get deeper and deeper into the to the edge
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:03.380]   But just not all the way yet because that's too expensive
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:07.940]   You know, I feel bad for is people who lived in places like portland, Oregon
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:11.860]   Who were told they were gonna get good with fiber. Oh
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:19.700]   And then hello they pulled the rug out from under him. I'm in austin. I don't have google fiber yet. I never will you never will
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:26.820]   And you know verizon did the same thing fios is not rolling out new homes. I mean, um, oh, I know it's okay
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:31.460]   And I'm telling you this gigabit wireless
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:35.060]   Fingers crossed. Yeah, it's gonna be good. Yeah
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:41.780]   You know why I'm uh, I'm reluctant to jump up and down is because I've been burned before ymax promised
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:44.660]   Much the same thing we that was gonna be the new
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:53.540]   Hotness it was gonna replace wires and it turned out to be a horrible flop and um, so I just I just always skeptical about
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:58.180]   I don't know what she's saying lately, but I know as of you know roughly a year ago
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:02.740]   Susan Crawford was dismissing the idea that wireless was the salvation that right, you know
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:11.300]   We have to fight for the for the wired limes. Susan. So susan is dismissing wireless because of you still have to have fiber capacity
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:16.020]   Back, it's like what I was saying about that's right and ymax their problem was
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:20.980]   There was a couple problems, but the big problem was the economics were never gonna work out with the tower sighting
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.860]   Yeah, no, I understand. I'm just saying that it's not unusual when new technologies come along to that they're
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:30.420]   touted as a savior the messiah and then turns out yeah
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:33.540]   Just another john the Baptist
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:36.020]   Uh
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:41.780]   I don't know. I don't know if that's an apt analogy or not to be honest. Uh, I have to check my bible
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:48.580]   Uh, let's see anything else to say did we pop the whole stack on that because that really trick. Oh no sonos
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:54.100]   Oh, I was like are we on the goo stack or we moving to sonos sonos
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:05:01.380]   So exciting. I've been waiting. I've been waiting me too except we're gonna wait some more because it's not till 2017
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:05.380]   Oh, yes. I thought you meant on the show. I was like I can't talk about it yet leo
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:09.140]   No, you can talk about it, but uh, but it just don't get your hopes up too high yet
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:16.820]   Sonos is going to work better with spotify. Although it's been my experience. It works pretty well with spotify now when i'm listening to spotify on sonos
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:24.180]   I can't already go to my sonos. Am I my spotify app and control it? So I thought it might look like this
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:26.820]   Let's hold on
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:30.260]   Because I if I play something on spotify
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.260]   Um
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:40.420]   I'm just gonna play random hand off so you can be listening in your car and then say hey play it on my sonos now. I'm home
[01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:42.900]   That'll be nice
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:45.940]   Right here. Um, let me let me make my
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:49.460]   Okay, I'm I'm sucking terribly at this y'all
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:53.140]   Oh my
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.940]   Fails fail. That's the problem with demos
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:04.340]   Okay, by the way, I did say 2017, but I guess if you're a beta spotify beta tester, which I was I mean a sonos beta tester, which I was
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.780]   Um
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:12.260]   You might get that sooner. I'm not sure it's gonna happen in october. Okay. So if you let's find them. Oh, here's my camera
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:19.140]   So can y'all oh no, you can see my yeah, see how yeah, so you're gonna see your sonos. You see your sonos
[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:22.580]   Yeah, right. So that's I mean, I think that's actually really handy
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:29.300]   I'm gonna stop playing and I currently get get it the other way and I guess everybody using sonos does that if I'm using if I'm listening
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:33.140]   Spotify and sonos sonos just recently added the cake by the way, we should say sonos
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:36.820]   Is a it is an is a speaker system?
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:43.060]   Wireless powered speaker system that's designed to bring music and audio to your whole home
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:46.980]   they sell a variety of different speakers subwoofers and
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:54.020]   Soundbars as well as the one of three and the five which are very expensive the whole idea of these is
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:56.740]   That you can put them in every room
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:07:01.220]   They connect wirelessly to each other and then to your internet and it brings audio
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:05.940]   Synchronized audio to every room in your house or any individual room or separate audio in each room
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:09.780]   And people who spend a lot of money on sonos as I did and apparently Stacy did
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:12.260]   Are deeply in love with it and
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:17.540]   Want it to become the next Amazon echo frankly we want to talk to our sonos
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:22.580]   Right and have it be the voice of our home because a lot of us have it in each individual room
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:25.300]   Yeah, if there's one thing wrong with the echo it doesn't have a great speaker
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.340]   Well that and you can't multi cast it and
[01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:32.660]   Yeah, we'll put it. Is there any reason that Amazon doesn't
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:35.380]   API that
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.380]   They did they have there are a
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:40.580]   It's out there you can do Alexa. There's a
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:44.100]   There's a little web test for it. Yeah, but
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:50.100]   You can put it on a raspberry pie. They've open sourced. Okay, you could totally do it
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:53.140]   And I presume that they're I mean echoes
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:59.060]   I mean Amazon's probably working with so no son this I would oh it yeah, this is a strategic deal now
[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:00.660]   What would be super?
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.380]   So the Spotify stuff comes in
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:06.900]   October with official launched in 2017
[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:09.700]   Oh, I thought the the Spotify was in
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:13.220]   Official kind of wired the public
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:20.020]   Terrible article. Yeah, the public beta update to the Spotify app comes in October not to the sonos
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:23.300]   But to the spotify app with the official launch in 2017
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:32.020]   And then the echo update will come as a free echo device update in 2017 that'll allow you to control your
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:38.020]   Sonos via the echo echo dot or amazon tap you'll have voice commands to tell echo
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:43.460]   What's jask echo what's playing to navigate tracks to pause and play they don't I note say
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:47.700]   To get it to start playing. I'm hoping that that will be also there
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:52.340]   And we have mentioned before the play five speaker the newest play five speaker has a microphone in it
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:57.460]   But sonos said no that microphone's not good enough. It's not as echo is an amazing microphone array
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:05.380]   The one in the play five speaker is just for the configuration tool that lets you set up your speakers to match your room
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:09.220]   Which if you have a knife on you should do yeah, the true play is really cool
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:15.460]   Um, and it means because often in a lot of cases certainly mind the sonos speakers are on the floor
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:18.820]   Sometimes on their and shelf they're all over the place so you do want to tune them if you can
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:25.860]   I don't know though. Did they say you you I'm sure watch this more carefully. I've only seen the wired article
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:30.100]   Did they say that I would be able to say hey echo
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:33.140]   play
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:35.140]   Elvis Presley on my sonos
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:41.060]   I believe so. Okay. Yes. Okay. I believe that's part of the plan and
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:45.780]   Yes, because that's what I want. That's what I want
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:49.380]   Yes, that's I mean, that's what everybody wants. I want to be able to say
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:52.340]   You know play connio west
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:58.660]   Amazing on my kitchen and it will happen. I like elvis you like connio. It's pretty much the same thing
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:01.620]   very close
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:06.020]   Connio is the elvis of our our generation
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:08.100]   No
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:09.780]   I think so
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:14.020]   He's the late elvis at this point the late he's late. He's fat elvis. Yeah fat elvis
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:19.460]   I was like late elvis. Is that dead? I mean, yeah, no, that's the late late
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:23.460]   Um, so good. I'm excited. I I mean, I hope that that's the case
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:28.180]   I am kind of upset that it's taking this long though. I'll be honest
[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:31.940]   I'm like really guys. Yeah, but it sounds like they're going to make a whole new set of commands
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:38.580]   Which is good and hopefully if they actually open that up it creates a lexicon for you to play other things
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:41.540]   as well because
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:46.500]   Right now they've got the api for like lights and that sort of thing. So here's the video. This is uh
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.300]   Oh, very dane wilburding
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:53.140]   I have a joyful life and we think it's about
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:11:00.020]   The notion that there is a flow of feel-good moments and sonos exists to enhance each one of those moments
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:06.260]   And we want listeners to feel good. We want to bring okay get to the point just to cut to the music
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:09.300]   Okay, and we think the playing music ought to be super easy
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:14.180]   Yes, it shouldn't necessarily involve your phone or your laptop and that's what's so great about voice control
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:18.740]   Ah when you can use your voice to bring joy to those moments to play music
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:21.780]   Then you can do it without breaking the flow of every day
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:27.540]   So she's talking to her episode and sonos share one very simple thing. We're deeply like George of amazon
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:34.580]   We created echo and elixir and when we did it we created this extraordinarily magical experience of far-field voice
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:40.500]   We committed to adding voice to sonos in a way that is meaningful to people at home
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.860]   It's really about innovating for everyday life
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:46.580]   Okay, let's build a house for the dining space
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:52.420]   Alexa play any music here are your recently added songs
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:55.620]   And they're coming through the sonos
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.820]   And it's coming through the sound bar
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:04.100]   I like this. This is what you want
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:08.980]   So what's interesting is if you do those commands today the
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:11.860]   Alexa will play the music the echo play the music
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:17.220]   It's looked like they didn't even have to say anything about sonos. You're just you're just using a
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:19.940]   Dot
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:21.700]   to play to sonos
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:25.380]   Now I can do that. I guess I'm asking why do you even need the amazon hardware?
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:32.020]   Because you need the very sophisticated array microphones built into that. Okay. Yes. Yes
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:36.420]   But some there's no reason sonos couldn't build that microphone in and then just use the api
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:40.260]   Oh, that's an interesting question
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:44.500]   Problem is there people like stacey and me who spent thousands of dollars on our systems
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:49.460]   Yeah, we're gonna run out so they have to make it backwards compatible enough for us. This is perfect, right?
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:54.180]   Uh because you know we also happen to have a few echoes lying around
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:13:02.180]   The dot see I use the dot right now with a bluetooth a very nice pair of bluetooth speakers and that works great
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:04.980]   You pair to the dot
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:08.180]   Into the sonos play five that I had right and that works
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:12.660]   So you could do that so it's just a little step more to controlling the whole system
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:18.420]   I wonder if it will have access to all of the because the other thing the sonos does really well is integrate with
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:22.340]   You know apple you can't you do apple music on an echo
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:26.500]   It integrates with apple music it integrates with all of the you know pandora
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:30.660]   Well, I guess panor and spotify you could do with the echo, but you'll be able to I hope
[01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:36.340]   Do all the other services that that ek uh sonos has done a very good job of lining up?
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:41.780]   I don't know about that that feels like a bigger strategic alliance than I would think
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:44.500]   Maybe not I mean because why would you?
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:47.220]   well
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:51.540]   They have in because sonos works very closely with apple for things like the
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:55.140]   bringing apple into the sonos app for example
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.860]   and I can't see
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:04.660]   Amazon being able to circumvent those kind of deals just by being like amazon just makes it deal to control the sonos
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:07.940]   And then the sonos does what it does
[01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:11.140]   Yeah, but you have to choose on your sonos
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:18.820]   The way most of the sonos controls in the homework right now, they only control like your sonos playlist for example
[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:21.380]   so
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:23.460]   It's unclear to me is
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.460]   if I could play
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.460]   spotify like
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:32.100]   So physically controlling the sonos and telling it to do something is different than saying
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:37.780]   Sonos go out through the web and find this particular music service that I've linked you to okay
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.020]   All right
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:44.660]   I'm optimistic that I can control spotify and pandora because I can already do those through both
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.980]   But I don't know if I could do it through
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:53.380]   Oh, it'd be nice to do apple music and title and dzer and all the other services sonos has every I mean they have all you know
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:57.780]   Just amazing variety of services you can use
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:03.140]   I mean their goal was to be at internet connected speak for instance a lot of people listen to our shows
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:04.900]   uh
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.900]   via the echo
[01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:10.900]   Saying using tune in it'd be really nice if we could have that then go
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:16.900]   I bet you could do that you think it'll go anything we could do in the echo we could do on the sonos you're saying not the other way
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.660]   it's right
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:19.860]   Okay
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:21.860]   We'll see hey, it's better than nothing
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:25.860]   I I love it that you could say now play that in the living room that is cool
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:32.820]   And sonos also so I'm just gonna say this because I'm a huge fan of sonos so just deal with it
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:34.260]   um
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:38.340]   They also did a bunch of deals with a bunch of connected home companies like crestron lutron
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:39.540]   uh
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:46.420]   Control four all those fancy ones that just and there's gonna be like new controllers for sonos and I I wanted to show you
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:54.100]   Because I love the lutron stuff and they're gonna have a lutron controller for sonos and it's gonna look
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:58.580]   Okay, this is actually a light switch. I can't tell if y'all can see it see that yeah
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:03.460]   Um, so take the light switch thing away from it and in the middle
[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:06.980]   This will be like a little audio remote for your sonos and I think that's kind of fun
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:12.020]   Because you could have it by your bed and like just be like stop pause whatever
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:18.420]   And those will be like 50 bucks as opposed to originally sonos had like 350 dollar controllers
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:22.580]   What's great is this is all competition driven especially because google announced its home
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:29.940]   Uh, it's it's all about like okay quickly. Let's get this deal with sonos gone before google's home does
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:36.020]   Now the on hump router can control your your hue lights. I'm glad they finally gave the on hub something to do
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:41.380]   First step into the autumn home automation. We thought it was all about the first place
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:47.140]   Um
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:49.140]   I thought you'd enjoy uh the
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:52.500]   the uh news jeff that uh the uh
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:55.620]   Our favorite magarete vista yer
[01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:57.940]   Uh
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:02.180]   European commissioner has decided that ireland undercharged apple
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:06.740]   And uh, oh by the way apple us 13 billion euros
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:08.580]   Yeah
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:15.300]   Well, i've argued all along in these tax fights that they're having is it's up to the governments to set to to negotiate and figure it out
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:20.260]   Oh my and leaving the companies in the middle is unfair to the company and you know, whatever
[01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:26.340]   One company owes another company she owes there shouldn't be anything special just because you're a technology company or an american company
[01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:29.460]   Uh, if somebody gives you a great deal
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:34.180]   And you take your business there as a result and you don't like that then negotiate with that government
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:39.060]   But there shouldn't be a retro. I mean if if the uh, eu wants to find ireland
[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:40.580]   Fine
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:46.740]   But to go back and say oh by the way apple your deal with ireland is null and void because we say so and you owe us 14
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:48.820]   That's the eu for you
[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:52.500]   By the way, let's get her pronunciation right here. This is how you pronounce it
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:57.140]   According to a Danish person. Oh, it's not playing
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:00.820]   What
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:03.380]   I'm sorry. Did you say that again?
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:11.060]   Margaret vista yer? No, that's wrong. How come how come she says
[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:17.140]   Macarete vista. Oh, there we go. I can't read a vista. Good. I can't read a vista. They can
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:21.860]   Be sense. Yeah, okay. That's better. Macarete vista. I can't read a vista
[01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:26.180]   I can't read a vista. Um, she's really become the face
[01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:32.020]   Of the anti trust of the anti trust stuff the eu and I got a good email from
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:38.260]   One of our viewers, uh, george wood who lives in who's in our weejin despite his strange name
[01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:44.420]   Uh, and he said you got it all wrong. Let me see if I can launch this. Oh, I gotta log in
[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:46.420]   I never get those emails never
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:50.340]   You know get every nobody complains. No, no, they never disagreed
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:57.300]   Send me some of your tweets to say you're you're right jeff you're completely right
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:02.020]   In fact jeff takes those fights to the street because and and and and to facebook
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:09.140]   Because I see a lot of facebook posts from jeff. I don't see the original. I see i see jeff going
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:12.180]   suck it
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:15.380]   No, no, no
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:17.540]   Actually, what you do is you gently mock
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:25.780]   The doubters. Well, if no, no what I mock what I have to admit when when they really when my critics can't spell. I love that
[01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:35.780]   Bad grammar can't I can't spell jeff. Uh, I went in through like a five round with this guy who made a different grammatical error every single time
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:41.540]   And it was obnoxious of me, but I enjoyed it. So let's see apples tax bill
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:45.460]   Uh, let's see if I can find this
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:52.420]   I was a bit disappointed in your initial response on mac break quickly to the uus enforcement of his tax laws
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:56.660]   I grew up in the u.s. Love my off on an iPad, but i'm also a citizen of sweeten
[01:19:56.660 --> 01:20:00.340]   I'm sorry not norway and I don't think you always understand how the eu works
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:07.300]   I hear a lot of disparagement of the eu on twig and I would certainly agree the right to be forgotten is just about the most idiotic idea
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:09.380]   Okay, so it wins me over there. All right
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.460]   um
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:13.460]   but as far as this
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.460]   the tax thing
[01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:18.980]   The concern is about member state corporate tax rate dumping
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:24.500]   If ireland can drop its tax rate that everyone else will do the same ultimately and everyone will end up the same
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:31.300]   But at a much lower level in our welfare systems, which require higher taxation than the u.s. Will be underfunded now
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:38.820]   Presumably how do i take him this long to get this well and but also ireland made that decision because they made a calculus
[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:44.500]   I think that we're going to get employees employees and taxes
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:47.300]   Pay billions in taxes
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:53.700]   That we wouldn't get otherwise that would go somewhere else so we're giving them a cut it happens here it happens in petaluma
[01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:57.140]   What you want to move your business to petaluma will give you a tax break
[01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:03.220]   So I was going to say though it feels kind of like stadium financing back in the day for here, which is
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:06.580]   That's a proven that's a proven
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:12.500]   Uh, boondock boondock. Yeah, I guess it is because you don't make the money back. That's the problem
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:13.380]   Right
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:18.180]   And that that's kind of I mean, I know that ireland what were they like the green tiger was that what they were?
[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:25.140]   Was the irish miracle they turned themselves around. Yeah, yeah, they got them because they they also they were low cost
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:27.460]   spoke english with a lilteed wonderful accent
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:30.260]   And had a good tax structure they got
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:35.860]   Employment and that's the way tax structure works. That's your tool to do that now if you join the eu
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:41.060]   Then there ought to be one clear law for anybody in the eu and you can figure it out
[01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:43.940]   But it come out to I agree to come back after the fact
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:45.620]   um
[01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:49.380]   And and and go after an s and so far one company now if you're no
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:54.260]   Apparently not offices there. This is not the first company that they've gone after on this
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:56.420]   so uh
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:58.420]   I the other companies have also been
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:01.380]   Uh dang starbucks was the first
[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:10.020]   Amazon and google are probably next in line. So this is and and he's george says this comes out of
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:14.820]   A major scandal about luxenberg actively helping companies
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:18.420]   From from other eu countries get out of paying their taxes
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:25.060]   And this was especially embarrassing because the ec president was john clawed junker who had been prime minister of luxenberg
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:27.140]   Who was very controversial in many times
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:29.780]   So there's a sensitivity to this
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:34.180]   My view here is very simple
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:37.620]   It is the government's job to set tax rates
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:40.580]   It is government's job to negotiate among countries
[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:46.100]   And it is company's job to reduce their costs for their shareholders
[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:47.780]   um
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:49.140]   And so
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:54.260]   Yeah, they find tricks to get money. I also wish that these companies didn't leave their money offshore that it came to the u.
[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:58.260]   S that they can pay their taxes here as a american legal but it's a lot of a lot of money on
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:03.380]   Wrong it feels wrong. Well, but but that's not it's not up to the company to decide what's right wrong
[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:06.100]   That's what laws are that's right. The governments have to do that
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:12.500]   Uh george concludes with and I and I have now come around to his post point of view fireland was wrong giving apple a lower tax rate
[01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:17.060]   Rather than retroactively taxing apple. I think the eu should find ireland
[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:19.540]   For not following eu regulations
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:23.940]   And going forward apple should be forced to follow the same tax rate as everyone else
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:28.020]   Yeah, and apple might well decide that doesn't make any sense anymore to be in ireland
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:31.140]   And that's something for ireland to then fight about with the eu
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:37.700]   Well, and that's why you give them the breaks to get them into ireland in the first exactly or bahamas or delaware or
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:42.500]   Double better believe the bahamas that give them a tax break lots of people. I was a bahamas is haven
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:46.820]   canary islands, right? I was gonna isn't uh jersey
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:52.980]   There's some tax havens right off the coast of ritin and not just chariot hamilton everything's legal in jersey
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:54.900]   Yeah, the other jersey. Oh
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:24:00.740]   The isle of jersey isle of jersey where all the cool data centers are and by the way excellent fudge
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:03.220]   Really?
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:03.780]   Mm-hmm
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:07.300]   We have jersey we in jersey. We have a uh because they have excellent cows
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:10.420]   jersey is a dairy very well known for its dairy
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.820]   we have a um
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:16.420]   A fan who's handled in the chat room is jersey fudge
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:19.700]   And uh, he brings us
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:21.700]   He brings us fudge from
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:26.820]   jersey in the channel islands. Does jersey do chocolate too?
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:33.540]   I don't know if you have great cows like switzerland you have great chocolate well
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:39.620]   Do you have to have great chocolate here's that's true. There's more to chocolate than just the cows
[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:42.500]   There's the cocoa beans. Mm-hmm
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:45.620]   Well, there's fudge has cocoa in it too, right?
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:48.500]   Some of it does. Yeah
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:52.980]   I will I'm now craving some real jersey fudge to be honest with you
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:58.420]   I'm keeping cheese. I would I would fill for some peanut butter fudge peanut butter fudge
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:02.900]   No, there's a there's a problem. There aren't enough peanut butter cookies in the world
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:06.980]   because I think they crumble too easily uh
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:12.980]   And so in the jars you rarely rarely see peanut butter cookies. They write that's my great week this
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:18.100]   You have to make your hard to find they're rare you need to get mrs. Jarvis to make some for you because
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:20.980]   Mr. Jarvis before doing my secular mike
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:23.220]   I like it's not hard. It isn't
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:23.940]   Oh
[01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:26.740]   I'm a connected device that could help you stay so you don't know me
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:32.980]   Jeff my first cooking disaster was with peanut butter cookies really and I overcame that really
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:34.580]   Yes, tell us. It's
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:39.460]   It I instead of doing like a teaspoon full of baking soda. I read a
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:43.780]   I think there's a quarter quarter teaspoon or something. I read a quarter cup
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:51.220]   So I dumped it in oh and I'm like going and cooking and then I ate the batter and I was like
[01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:53.700]   This does not taste right
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:26:00.020]   But I baked it anyway, and let me tell you a lot of baking soda those cookies they get big
[01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:03.140]   It was it was it was not a good thing
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:07.140]   So i got a very similar story. I was trying to
[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:11.460]   Appeal to the heart of a young woman through her stomach
[01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:14.660]   And my mother used to make pumpkin chiffon pie
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:17.620]   So I figured I would make pumpkin chiffon pie and I get the recipe from her
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:23.220]   And it says you know one and one quarter sea period can pumpkin and I thought well
[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:26.500]   That's how inaccurate is that one one of the quarter cans of pumpkin
[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:30.340]   Who says the cans are all the same size by I said all right no your mother knows
[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:34.260]   I put it a can I put it in a quarter can and then of course in that moment I said
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:36.900]   duh
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.900]   Cups cups cup can
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:40.340]   Yeah
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:43.620]   Pumpkin so then I had to go through all kinds of mathematical calculations
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:48.900]   This is before google folks to figure out how much luckily the pumpkin of course congealed as a lump
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:51.940]   So I could calculate how much I had to measure to take out
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:57.220]   Okay, well jeff I have the best product that'll be my thing next week. It's a cooking thing
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:27:02.340]   It's a cooking thing. Okay. Why does jeff watch this? It's not hard you get some butter
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:05.780]   You get some sugar some packed brown sugar
[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:10.740]   And of course peanut butter and I'm using the cream style you can use chunky if you want
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:11.220]   How easy is it?
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:13.140]   By the way, you don't want any fancy peanut butter here
[01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:18.180]   I don't want to give the brand of the one I'm using but it's really fast to find in the supermarket in fact
[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:19.700]   If I get jeffy
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:25.540]   I know that wasn't really a pun anyway, you see how easy that is and then you mush it up
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:29.940]   And then you and then you bake it and you and you know there's one trick
[01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:34.020]   You use a fork on the top. Oh chill it right?
[01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:38.180]   You bake it. Yes, and then you use a fork on the top to mush it
[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:42.820]   And then you know that's how you know it's a peanut butter cookie
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:48.180]   And to do the old you know why you can't find them because they're everybody ate them
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:52.740]   Yeah, they're delicious. They're the best. They're the best not a fan
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:56.740]   But if you're not now if you want to make some molasses cookies, I'll eat those
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:01.780]   Oh, those are delicious too. I love cookies. I do too. What's your favorite kinds, Dizzy?
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:05.780]   Oh chocolate chip cookies
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:11.060]   Oh, I like regular oatmeal with raisins raisins and walnuts. I just trust raisins
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:13.540]   I like walnuts. I know people don't like raisins and walnuts
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:19.540]   But I like raisins and walnuts in my my wife acts as if raisins are our conspiracy from some evil force
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:23.540]   They are right. They're dried grapes. They're delicious
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:28.900]   They're fine on their own, but in a baked good. They're like biting in the head of a cockroach or something disgusting
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:33.380]   They're great. They added chewy texture to a crunchy chewy. Oh my
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:35.620]   God
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:39.060]   No, a cookie. Well that raises is like a kiss without a mustache
[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:43.060]   I'm okay with that too
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:46.180]   Like oh, I see your problem Leo
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:52.100]   We're gonna do a new show this week in cookies
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:29:02.740]   All right, uh, what else you want to talk about you want to talk about facebook and what's app what's app pledged promised swore
[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:07.460]   When facebook bought him before facebook bought him even yankum the founder of what's app
[01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:12.180]   We don't know anything about you. We don't want to know anything about you your privacy is safe with us now
[01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.180]   Well, maybe not so much
[01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:17.540]   It was a dumb promise to make yeah, it was although
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:23.540]   I'll bring it back to the nest thing for a minute because nest was separate from google in part because people were worried about the data privacy
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:26.260]   And they promised the same thing good boy. It's a good boy
[01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:28.820]   Those guys come over what's gonna happen
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:37.060]   But on this one did you also see it fusion cashmere hill hill wrote a really interesting story about a psychiatrist
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:43.220]   Who's the story whose friends were or whose patients were being submitted as her friends
[01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:45.620]   Yeah, that was so weird
[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:47.220]   Yeah
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:52.500]   And they were they were one of the thesis was it was either location based or it was based on phone numbers
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:56.740]   And if it's based on phone numbers all those what's app numbers could be really
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:04.660]   Scary actually it was the thing that was really scary wasn't so much that facebook was suggesting
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:09.380]   That her patients friend her or that she friend her patients, but that they
[01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:14.580]   other and of course one of the really kind of fundamental tenets of
[01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:19.940]   Uh psychiatry is psychotherapy is that you know, they're some most
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:26.660]   Therapist's office they have separate entrances and exits so that patients don't see one another so you have an anonymity
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:30.820]   So this is terrible. I mean, I wonder if that could be a hip of violation
[01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:34.820]   That would be an interesting way to like enforce privacy around stuff like that
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:40.660]   She says I haven't this is catch me. I'll learn from I haven't shared my email
[01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:43.620]   Or phone contacts with facebook
[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:47.060]   So it wasn't any matching somehow
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:51.940]   Could be I mean they all live near each other but
[01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:56.980]   Probably they all end up at the same place once a week
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:31:01.860]   Most of her patients are senior citizens are people with serious health or developmental issues
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:05.060]   But she has one outlier a 30 something snowboarder
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:10.580]   Usually facebook would recommend he friend people his own age who snowboard and jump out of planes
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:14.820]   But lisa told me he'd started seeing older infirm people
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:19.540]   Such as a 70-year-old gentleman with a walker and someone with cerebral palsy in his
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:24.260]   Friends suggestions he laughed and said I don't know any of these people showed up on my list
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:26.980]   I'm guessing he's they see you
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:32.100]   He showed me the list of friend recommendations and yes, I recognize some of my patients
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:37.540]   She sat there awkwardly and silently to let him know that his suspicion was correct
[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:41.860]   Would violate her duty to protect her patients privacy
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:48.020]   So
[01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:51.380]   Yeah, and if it's if it's location, I think there's a story
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:54.900]   Related to that about is a small town she lives in a small town
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:58.420]   But I think it's more than a story. Go ahead
[01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:05.940]   No, no, no, I was just thinking if it's location based I think there have been complaints in the past about people like at AA meetings getting
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:11.620]   Friend requests from other people who were at the meetings because they attend them, you know once a week together
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:20.660]   She says and I have patients with HIV people have attempted suicide women and coercive and violent relationships. This is absolutely horrific
[01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:22.980]   Um
[01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:27.060]   She these people are being outed and it's more than just being outed one of her patients said yeah
[01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:32.420]   I was suggested somebody I know he's with your patient because I see him in the elevator, but that's all she knew
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:34.660]   She didn't have his name and phone number now. She does
[01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:43.620]   She had not friended as appropriately she's a therapist she had not friended any of her patients on Facebook's
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:47.300]   She haven't even hadn't even looked up their profiles
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:52.260]   She doesn't have a guest Wi-Fi network at the office. They're not all using the same network
[01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:54.580]   Um
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:59.380]   It could be because facebook is using location information from the smartphone
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:05.300]   In fact the therapist to be right the therapist thinks this because they all were at the
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:08.180]   Using their facebook on their phone at her office
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:11.220]   And then so was she or maybe
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:18.580]   She does facebook just has to have your phone number because then it can use that to find out where you like facebook says it only
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:23.300]   Briefly used location for friend recommendations in a test and it was just at the city level
[01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:29.540]   I mean there's so many issues with doing this kind of granular location as a suggestion. So facebook saying they didn't do this
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:31.540]   How else could they not yep?
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:33.940]   How else could they yep?
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:35.460]   They didn't tell her
[01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:38.500]   Well part of the problem is because the therapist can't put
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:41.380]   her patients in touch with
[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:43.540]   Uh
[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:49.140]   A cashmere right she says I try to help lisa figure out what could be causing this and reached out to facebook about the case
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:54.500]   Unfortunately due to health privacy reasons lisa was not able to put me in touch with her patients directly
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:58.020]   If was the patient's permission you could
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:02.100]   Yeah, she could she could ask for we do mom if that's report
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:05.940]   I don't know I that I wouldn't do it if our therapist would you mind if this reporter talks to you?
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:08.580]   I wouldn't do that
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:12.900]   Yeah, I just thought that was super
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:14.900]   We're anonymity. Yeah
[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:21.060]   Well, it means this is me here's change too. Here's right. So here's what cashmere thinks and I think she might be right
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:27.940]   Uh, she says this is my guess all the patients probably have the therapist number in their phones
[01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:32.420]   So an algorithm analyzing this network of phone contacts
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:37.140]   Might reasonably assume all these people are connected a phone by phone number
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:41.380]   So you know if 10 people have the same phone number, maybe those 10 people know each other
[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:43.380]   We should see if they want to be friends
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:48.100]   So if you're facebook let's say that's true just for the second one say it's true and usually it works dandy
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:52.980]   What kind of rule set do you come up with inside facebook to prevent this kind of thing from happening?
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:35:00.900]   I don't think it would work dandy. I mean like if i'm in austin i've got my hdb pharmacy number programmed into my phone and probably
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:06.580]   600 other people who live in my neighborhood have the same thing rule number one is no businesses
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:08.660]   No business phones
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:10.660]   Okay, right eliminate that
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:13.380]   Click because for that very reason and for this reason
[01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:19.620]   Uh, if it's a if it's a business phone number then it that should not show any one of you have your shrinks cell phone number
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:22.340]   So phone number because that a doctor. I mean
[01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:28.980]   So therapists watch or my what about your sources like all my sources have my phone number, right?
[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:32.820]   And that's a bad one. That's how you start it. That's howdy known
[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:36.900]   That would be terrible
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:45.300]   How do you see stacey? Well, I leaked her some information about google. Oh, I think there's an information about intel. Oh, isn't that sweet
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:48.340]   Small world small world
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:50.340]   Go away kedink
[01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:55.460]   I don't I don't run facebook on my phone. So I don't have the app on my phone and I don't go to it on my phone, but
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:36:01.700]   Here's you are so anti-social stacey no google plus no facebook jeez
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:04.500]   Well
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:08.580]   Uh, twitter is safe like I said you're so anti-social
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:17.860]   Twitter is safe lisa's medical lisa's the therapist pseudonym for the therapist lisa's medical community has started recommending that patience concerned about privacy
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:26.100]   Not log into facebook or other social media accounts at medical offices or even leave their phones in their cars during appointments
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:28.980]   What in other words don't bring the phone into the waiting room
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:33.380]   But well that's that'd be a whole thing. That's likely good advice. Are they guessing
[01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:36.980]   We don't know that and the reason this is really germane
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:44.740]   And I think the reason cashmere hill did the story is because what's app is tied to you by your phone number
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:49.060]   So if what's app starts telling facebook your phone number even if you've hidden it
[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:51.460]   from facebook
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:53.460]   Oh now we got problems
[01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:57.460]   Good. Oh cashmere hills does such
[01:36:57.460 --> 01:37:00.580]   She's been I don't
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:04.580]   I hate it when people say on twitter why don't usually agree with jervis, but he's right this case
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:10.580]   Uh, you know, you gotta always really cashmere, but but uh, she's really good. We'll get her on the show if you want
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:14.580]   Yeah, she she yeah, you ought to yeah, because she's she does good work in privacy. Yeah
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:16.980]   She does and she's big on the iot
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:19.540]   So
[01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:23.380]   On to it. I thought she'd been on twig, but maybe she's only been on the big show. I think just to it
[01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:25.380]   Yeah, the big show the grown up here
[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:30.500]   Do you feel bad when he says that Jeff? I feel a little bit. I do I do I do I feel like I feel like i'm just
[01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:32.580]   Gonna get the jello for dessert
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:34.660]   Yeah, i'm like we're at the kids table over here. I
[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:39.380]   We get the surely temples here a little line at the kids table. Would you like me too? I can
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:43.060]   Yes, do please. Yes, raise it up a little bit and you could be at the grown-up stable
[01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:47.140]   But yourself look like you can feel like a kid at the kids table. This is our new
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:52.100]   Levitating table. How much did this cost me? Oh, god. You don't even want enough
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:58.580]   Look at that. The question is why would we ever want it this high standing desk?
[01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:01.220]   Yeah, I could do the stand-up
[01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:04.260]   I mean
[01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:06.980]   If your show is a little bit shorter, I do it standing up
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:10.660]   Yeah, we'll make it shorter so you can stand up
[01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:14.980]   There out there. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. It is a really really really long show and I
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:17.540]   For one one of my colleagues who's a great guy
[01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:20.340]   When it got into the standing desk
[01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:25.620]   Fad right then he obviously didn't like it. So he sits typing like this like he's on a parley
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:27.860]   you really like this
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:33.060]   Chopper, that's not a parley. That's a chopper. Thank you. Thank you chopper. Yes. I think you're so
[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:36.420]   Cool and macho Stacy. I didn't know that
[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:39.380]   Like the desk but stuck
[01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:45.140]   I have to finish I have to finish a show like this
[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:50.820]   That is awesome. I hope yourness wasn't that
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:56.660]   Now this is a good desk. Yeah, we actually have uh, we did a deal with um
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:00.020]   Up it was it who did we do the deal with?
[01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:02.820]   very desk
[01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:04.820]   For all of our
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:06.660]   Yeah, I saw you
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:08.660]   Yeah, it's really nice. Yeah, it's really nice
[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:11.460]   People do like standing what they like is the option
[01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:18.580]   To yeah, no, I love it. I mean I use this for I'm not doing it right now because in my mics probably a little too low
[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:21.700]   But I've got like mic level then I've got standing level
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:27.460]   And then I've got slumping well notice the engineers really thought about that and my mic is independent of the desk
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:30.100]   So
[01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:31.700]   Stand yeah
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:34.740]   So I can raise the desk or lower the desk, but my mic
[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:37.140]   Stays the same
[01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:43.700]   Why that would be a useful thing. I have no idea. So does this is the mic there are like between your legs? Oh, I know I see I see now
[01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:46.260]   All right, um
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:52.100]   Mark Zuckerberg is about to unveil his robot butler. Are we excited named? Hi
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:55.140]   Jarvis. Yay
[01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:59.780]   That's the one time he liked to comment on mine. I said I said that I could just move in
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:02.340]   What he said he was gonna make it. He liked that
[01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:06.020]   He said I'm gonna build an artificial intelligence system to operate and control my home
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:08.020]   And he says I'm making progress
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:10.020]   He did a q&a in italy
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:14.660]   So the best part is is he said that does wife can't control the temperature because I don't really recognize his voice
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:18.180]   I feel like I'm kind of a jerk engineer
[01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:24.340]   No, no, it's like although she may not want to like my husband whenever I show him new stuff
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:30.020]   He's like, yeah, I don't care. So maybe maybe Priscilla is smart and it's just like yeah, I'm not gonna get into that
[01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:31.380]   It's a mess
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:36.660]   It the gate to his house opens as he approaches because of facial recognition technology. Whoa
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:39.620]   Yes, wow
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:42.340]   And apparently it can make him toast
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:45.940]   It makes him toast
[01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:48.340]   Does he have one of those connected toasters? Apparently
[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:51.060]   Or is it just like
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:53.300]   So there's actually a connected toaster
[01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:56.820]   I and I tweeted it at one point in time, but it makes
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:41:01.620]   You can actually send people messages to the toaster and it toasts the message on the bread
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:03.620]   Oh, I saw that. Yeah
[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:05.540]   Um, but this one, you know
[01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:10.660]   Everyone's like it's a connected toaster a connected coffee maker without realizing that you still have to fill the thing and make it
[01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:11.540]   You know
[01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:15.700]   It's only cool if it makes you toast and like gets the bread out and drops the bread in the toast and
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:18.900]   That's my opinion. Yeah
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:23.300]   Google's lost it out and a drone brings it to you Google's launching a ride share service
[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:25.860]   Great Wall Street Journal
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:30.900]   Uh, Google's already got a carpooling program in san francisco now it's offering rides
[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:33.540]   Um
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:35.780]   Because this I know when they added this to ways
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:41.540]   Uh, you could do you could do this in ways. Is this the same thing or is this different?
[01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:46.580]   Oh, it's the same thing. Okay. They piloted it with uh with employees
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:51.380]   So if someone was just driving by you they could pick you up
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:57.780]   It's gonna in san francisco will open to all area ways users this fall. Have we has anybody used that here yet?
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:00.180]   um
[01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:01.700]   so, uh
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:05.540]   The idea I guess is you could say I need a ride too and uh
[01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:08.740]   Ways would say well, they're here. Somebody's going by you and
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:13.860]   And you're charging and I I I guess
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:18.260]   I don't know if you could call us moving into uber's turf
[01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:21.780]   But david drumman is now off the board of uber
[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:25.860]   I mean, this is just this is just carpooling
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:28.820]   No carpool
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:33.780]   No, they say they're gonna make fares low enough to discourage drivers from operating as taxi drivers
[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:40.020]   Quays current program charges riders up to 54 cents a mile
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:44.260]   And google does not take a fee. So yeah, that's for gas
[01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:51.220]   That's just gas. Well, that's the federal reimbursement rate for that's close to the federal reimbursement rate for that's gas using your car
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:56.100]   Yeah, it's not the google says we don't want to make it enough that you would say i'm gonna make a living doing this
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:43:02.260]   Just pay gas pay for gas. There is no way. I would let a random rando person into my car
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:04.900]   That's hitchhiking
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:09.940]   That's exactly what this is. Yeah, it's hitchhiking with a smartphone. It's uh, yeah
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:14.340]   No
[01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:18.340]   No, i'm just looking through here. I don't think there's anything else I want to talk about
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:23.540]   We I think we should take a break because i'm really can't wait to hear what stacey has
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:26.180]   She's brought us toys
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:30.820]   Stacey higgin botham show and tell coming up in just a second
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:34.100]   First i'm gonna get on my on my on my carpet square can't wait
[01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:38.100]   Chris grass applesauce
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:43.460]   Have a carpet square jamming show my diamond swear
[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:48.980]   I do have this though. This is the auto manic. This is the new automatic pro very exciting
[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:55.220]   We talked about the automatic before it said device that plugs into your obd 2 port. What's that you say?
[01:43:55.220 --> 01:44:03.540]   Well, every car built since 1996 has a diagnostic port. That's what obd stands for on board diagnostics right below the um
[01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:07.140]   Uh steering wheel on most cars on your driver's side
[01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:12.980]   You probably looked at it and said oh, that's just the technician at the dealership plugs into that. No, you can too. It's completely legal
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:19.780]   It's it's great. You could all sorts of information from the car and the automatic shares that information via bluetooth to your phone
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:27.140]   So you pair your phone you get the automatic app and now when a check engine light comes on you can check the app and it'll tell you what's wrong
[01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:29.940]   And even shows you nearby repair facilities
[01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:34.100]   So when stacey got her fender better this morning the automatic could have said
[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:38.660]   I know where you could get that fixed actually if you get in an accident
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:44.580]   You're gonna want this new automatic pro because this is this is the same automatic with an additional feature
[01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:47.860]   They've built in 3g connectivity
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:53.140]   And I mean this is something jeff's chrome book doesn't even have and here's the best part
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:55.860]   It's free
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:58.660]   Five for five years. No subscription fees
[01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:06.580]   Five years free connectivity over 3g. So what does that mean? Well, you're car can tell you where it is at all times
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:12.820]   Not just when you're in the car with the app but at all times got a teenager driving your car. You'll know exactly where they are
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:15.940]   The car also can help you in a crash
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:21.540]   The automatic pro detects severe accidents and trained responders can call for help even if you can't
[01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:26.900]   This is really sweet all the features of the existing automatic
[01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:33.540]   But now with 3g oh so much more you can even link it to your nest thermostat or your echo
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:36.900]   You can actually ask your echo where did I park my car
[01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:40.340]   It will you can do that it will tell you
[01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:43.700]   Oh man, I love this
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:46.180]   I I all my cars have automatics
[01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:50.260]   On the obd 2 port yours should too and right now we're going to make this
[01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:55.380]   Particularly appealing because the automatic pro which really is nice. They didn't really up the price at much
[01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:57.460]   It's only $129.95
[01:45:57.460 --> 01:46:02.660]   But you could take 20 bucks off right now when you use the offer code twit
[01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:07.220]   20 bucks off but do use the offer code to check out twit
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:13.300]   And uh then you're going to get a great deal on this and every car should have one if you've got teenagers
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:16.340]   So many valuable ways you can use the automatic
[01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:22.820]   When Stacy when your daughter gets a little older she's gonna be driving. It's only she's not gonna be driving because
[01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:27.780]   Automatic cars will be there or automatic in six years. You think in six years
[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:31.140]   It'll be 2021 by then. Yeah, I mean
[01:46:31.940 --> 01:46:37.380]   She's not gonna drive till she's 21. That's another matter. Yes. No, no, no. She won't be 16 for six more years
[01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:42.980]   I mean, that's 20 years. Oh, I see 2021. You think we'll have when she gonna go on her first date
[01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:49.300]   I guess kids today don't date anyway. So it's okay. They don't they just hang out. They don't hook up stop that pair
[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:51.300]   Is that thought they hang up
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:54.180]   Hang out hang out
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:47:01.380]   No, 2021 so we have the self-driving cars really really that's that's what word and google and intel and bmw
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:07.300]   And Tesla I never really thought about that. It's possible your daughter will never need to drive
[01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:09.300]   Yes
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:13.380]   How cool would that be? She doesn't want to she'll never learn. Oh, it's so much safer
[01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:18.340]   I mean, i'll teach her because you have to know these things, but do you?
[01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:22.260]   I think it's good to know
[01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:26.340]   I did I learned to six. I I know how to change at tire like my dad was like
[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:31.220]   I can actually I can change my spark plugs not in the Tesla. I can't do that, but
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:35.780]   I gave my daughter a book on how to change a tire does that count?
[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:41.940]   Uh-huh. My dad wouldn't let me drive until I proved it to him. Oh, that's awesome. That is so great
[01:47:41.940 --> 01:47:47.940]   Oh, yeah, tell it tell it tell it tell a 16 year old that when it's like 100 degrees outside of there like you're like
[01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:55.460]   Stacey here's your jack. Here's your tire iron. Here's your lug nut get out there and change those rotate
[01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:58.100]   Forget change rotate those tires
[01:47:58.100 --> 01:48:05.380]   I want the front to the left right to the front back to the front back to the left right you do that now and you can drive
[01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:09.940]   Did your dad talk like that? No, I was like wow
[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:15.860]   My dad has turned into the biggest I don't even know what that is rancher
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:20.580]   I think I had a chore in there. Yeah
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:25.380]   You got a job you gotta take the top before you drive
[01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:32.180]   What we have here is a failure to communicate. Did you ever want to be an actor?
[01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:34.980]   Yes, my whole life. So sad
[01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:42.580]   Did you ever act sad? I did actually did some some some plays in san francisco. I acted a couple of conferences go
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:46.500]   Yeah, oh, I didn't know the hotel war. Oh, that's all there is to tell
[01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:51.380]   I ended up doing radio because I thought well, I don't think I want to audition
[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:53.540]   and
[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:58.020]   And then and then I just you know what this is acting still I still know it is
[01:48:58.020 --> 01:49:00.740]   Yeah, just no script no script. I get to write my own script
[01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:05.540]   But I you know I you know I actually I could tell you guys this because you're friends
[01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:09.060]   Uh, I already told Lisa this I sit when I retire
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:11.140]   I'm going to hollywood or new york
[01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:15.300]   I haven't decided which and i'm gonna start auditioning for character parts as an older
[01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:18.660]   Act yeah, because it's an older guy because it's easier right won't be so competitive
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:22.180]   And I'm expect to get you know leading roles. I'll get bit parts
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:27.460]   But I'd be fun. I get to be in a i'd love to be a broadway player a movie wouldn't that be fun?
[01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:31.940]   Yeah, I was gonna say I'll look for you at a bit part and like nci s or exactly
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:37.860]   Exactly. I many friends the dead body many friends who have done those kinds of things. Yeah
[01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:42.020]   Yeah, that's that's what I didn't want. That's why I did for I didn't want to do that
[01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:45.140]   I didn't want to work my way up into that. That sounded horrible
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:48.740]   But if anybody needs a good old boy
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:53.540]   Bit tall I could do that. I knew that right
[01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:59.540]   Yeah, dashing and you got something to share with us. Oh my god
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:03.140]   I am sorry
[01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:07.620]   All right, so this is efo week
[01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:10.740]   And why aren't you in rolyn?
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:13.860]   Why am I not because I I decided to spend a week with you guys no
[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:16.260]   I've been traveling so much. I wanted to stay home because
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:20.420]   I'm a home buddy and my house might fall apart while i'm gone. Who knows?
[01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:26.580]   Um, okay, so efa is now like I feel like efa is about to be like the mobile world congress
[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:28.260]   um
[01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:30.660]   Mobile world congress used to be like this huge mobile show
[01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:36.740]   And then the internet guys kind of came in efa used to be this huge home appliance show and now the internet guys are kind of coming in
[01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:38.980]   efos is a radio show
[01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:40.500]   telefuncan
[01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:42.660]   efa was originally a show for
[01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:45.220]   radios
[01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:49.860]   Like like cathode ray tubes and stuff yeah, it was started in the 20s in berlin
[01:50:49.860 --> 01:50:51.460]   it's a very old show
[01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:56.660]   And it was uh for radio sets, you know listening to the radio before television
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:50:59.700]   I can't even imagine I know
[01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:05.540]   Yeah, as my daughter says about radio wait, you mean you have to listen to something when it's on
[01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:12.900]   So a bunch of people have been making really cool news so for the next couple of weeks
[01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:17.780]   I'm going to bring you lots of cool devices. You're gonna love it. This this week's device is
[01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:23.860]   Phillips hue who makes the light bulbs their connected light bulbs they've announced some new light bulbs
[01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:28.980]   So you can now buy a normal a 19, which is your normal night light bulb
[01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:34.260]   You can buy that in a tunable white in a color and you can now buy
[01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:38.660]   a br 30, which is the down light the can light in a
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:44.340]   color which was always the case and in tunable white for 40 dollars and i've been waiting for those for a month
[01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:50.580]   But they also introduced this it's a motion sensor and it also has an ambient light sensor in it
[01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:55.700]   So I have now here they come. I have this way to control my Phillips hue lights
[01:51:55.700 --> 01:52:03.380]   I have this way which is a little button tracker or a button switch that is by my couch and then I also have
[01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:07.220]   A little light switch
[01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:10.900]   And it comes out can you use them all at the same time?
[01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:17.300]   Well, I have to pick one but if I turn it on with this I can turn it off with this
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:19.540]   So
[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:24.740]   The reason there are so many is because when you start getting into the crazy world of connected lights
[01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:30.820]   You're suddenly faced with like holy cow if I turn my lights off at the switch and i've got connected bulbs
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:32.580]   They no longer work
[01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:36.580]   So you have to have a lot of different ways to control them that makes sense for you
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:42.100]   So this is the wall switch you can screw this in on your wall and it's nice or you can use just the remote
[01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:43.460]   um
[01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:47.140]   And the motion sensor is cool for rooms like i'm going to probably
[01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:53.940]   Put this in my closet or my little bathroom that has a hue light in it and you can set rules
[01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:59.780]   So if I go into my bathroom during the day the motion sensor picks it up and is like bright light
[01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:05.220]   But at night after i've gone to bed it'll be like that's smart. That's so smart
[01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:08.260]   so
[01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:10.260]   You can do it with the phillips hue
[01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:16.980]   Or you can do it with another product from a company called stack lighting which has all of those sensors integrated into a light bulb
[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:22.820]   So oh see okay, so I have a lot of phillips hues and I have the base station. I have it ever hooked them up again
[01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:25.860]   Should I replace this with stack lighting would it be better?
[01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:32.980]   So this is this is the case both hue and stack require a hub. So I didn't want to do two
[01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:35.940]   Huda two hubs. That's just right. I mean
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:41.460]   Eight but still that's crazy for normal. Yeah, so if you're already a hu fan
[01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:44.340]   I would do this
[01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:46.340]   Okay
[01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:50.180]   But you have to be careful in any room that you put the motion sensor in
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:54.260]   You either have to have a connected light switch or you cannot touch the light switch again
[01:53:55.140 --> 01:54:00.740]   And yeah, that means you have to train your family unless you do this and this
[01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:04.660]   I thought three ways were hard
[01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:09.220]   This is why the internet of things is so fun
[01:54:09.220 --> 01:54:12.100]   Don't touch that switch
[01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:15.380]   So so yeah
[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:20.660]   But if you have the on hub because on hub just did the deal with phillips and I don't have an on hub
[01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:22.740]   So I haven't played with that
[01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:25.780]   But now you don't actually have to have
[01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:31.860]   Oh, you don't have to have the hue router. No, the on hub replaces the the base station
[01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:35.860]   I bet in someone with an on hub. Let me know I should get one
[01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:39.300]   It's well kevin has one. I'll I'll make him go look at it
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:40.820]   um
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:42.820]   because it's zigby
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:50.900]   Light link profile. So if you've got anything using zigby light link theoretically you should be able to control it from the on hub
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:57.620]   But I don't know if that's the case without testing it because sometimes they're not all copacetic, but
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:02.260]   Did that make sense or was I just speaking in weird was I speaking in tongues again
[01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:07.220]   It's right on the edge of what I can understand
[01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:09.620]   Sorry
[01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:12.180]   Every every third or fourth word makes sense
[01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:19.940]   I'm sorry you guys there was something about zigby and on hub and it sounds like baby words. Baby. It's it's so
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:26.100]   It means the z the on hub routers speaks the same radio protocol
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:30.740]   That the hue router speaks or the the hue hubs we thought it had zigby
[01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:36.980]   That was that 802 dot 1114 802 of something. Yes, but zigby is weird because
[01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:43.620]   A zigby radio does not necessarily it's not like a wifi radio because zigby runs software on top of it for like
[01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:49.540]   Lights and security and sensors and god only knows what so zigby is no guarantee that something will work together
[01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:56.900]   I have a vision that your your husband and your daughter have a room a safe room in your house that mom can't touch
[01:55:56.900 --> 01:56:01.300]   Not a lot of everything here works. Okay. The actual physical switches
[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:03.220]   dials
[01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:05.700]   Mom can't ruin this room
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:13.140]   Well, so if you do no, well, do you do this stuff throughout the house? Yes. Wow
[01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:18.900]   It's my my husband is really patient patient and long suffering, but
[01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:25.460]   Yeah, it's fun. He actually likes like the motion sensor in the bathroom. Dude. That's awesome. He's like, yeah
[01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:28.660]   I do like that, but you know, I've had that for years. I mean, that's
[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:32.420]   That's a motion sensor. That's called a motion sensor. It's not that
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:37.300]   You didn't like because I had been playing with it before he really likes the different
[01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:42.260]   I like it that it knows what time it is and doesn't blind you in the middle of the night. I like that. Yes
[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:45.700]   We had a hotel room. Where are we staying?
[01:56:46.340 --> 01:56:51.060]   Oh in San Diego at the Coronado and we had a hotel room with a motion sensor
[01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:54.980]   bathroom light and it would just randomly turn on the middle of the night big bright light
[01:56:54.980 --> 01:56:57.540]   It was like this is not a good solution
[01:56:57.540 --> 01:57:03.620]   Yeah, but if it were like a kind of a muted be a little light blue is not a good choice
[01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:08.900]   Should make it sunset red red is a good choice for a nice you up red would be good. Yeah
[01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:11.860]   So those are those are my things
[01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:13.540]   I like it
[01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:17.620]   So if in you can see them and this guy makes a really satisfying click ready
[01:57:17.620 --> 01:57:23.780]   Oh, yeah, I love that. Oh and it's pisio. It powers itself. Okay, that's it
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:28.980]   Oh, so you don't have to have batteries or plug it in it just generates its own electricity every time
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:34.180]   This one generates its own electricity didn't didn't phillips do something like that for the hue didn't they have a
[01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:38.980]   That's what this is. This is a tattoo. I basically showed you all three ways now that I got to yeah
[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:41.380]   I have a phillips tap to yeah. Yeah, yeah, I have that
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:45.780]   Yeah, I have it. You know what? This is how valuable all of that is
[01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:49.540]   I've had it in the new house for three years without screwing them in
[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:51.940]   It's like man. I'm
[01:57:51.940 --> 01:57:56.020]   I love my hues. I used to have a light in here that would flash when my garage door opens
[01:57:56.020 --> 01:58:01.780]   So I knew when my husband was coming home. Oh, that's cool. Okay. You just you got to get creative and I think that's
[01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:08.500]   That people you got to have to be kind of insane. I guess well you also have to have a garage door opener that is
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:12.020]   Internet of things enabled and you have to have it
[01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:16.420]   You must have a very elaborate if this than that recipe file
[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:24.100]   Well, I have a lot but I also have done robots and stuff through other hubs and I mean in part not all of this stays up
[01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:25.620]   like
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:29.860]   Things move around and recipes fail and go away. Yeah. Yeah
[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:33.620]   Okay, I like that idea of a light flickering
[01:58:33.620 --> 01:58:36.500]   when the garage door opens
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:43.380]   Yeah, and I I had I had if someone if a certain person texted me my lights would flash different colors
[01:58:43.380 --> 01:58:48.020]   So the chat room said I'm not an early adopter. I'm an early buyer
[01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:56.180]   Actually pretty true. I buy this stuff. I try it and then I go here. Okay
[01:58:56.180 --> 01:59:01.860]   I'm gonna okay. I make a pledge to you tonight. I will put the hue light bulbs in my office light bulbs
[01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:07.540]   And okay, they're great there. Yeah, you can use it for damn. Are they colored? Yeah?
[01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:10.820]   Oh, yeah, I have the right. Oh, yeah, I don't have the new hues. I have the old hues the original large
[01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:12.820]   Oh, you know what how here a question
[01:59:12.820 --> 01:59:19.060]   If I got the hues, I know this is all about me. You can't program them to to do lighting in your office
[01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:24.580]   Yeah, well, what would it make it different with the way how awful I look on this camera? Yeah, you could take you could tell them
[01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:31.540]   Well color to make it. Oh, so I could do the daylight thing with them. Yeah, you could do the daylight thing
[01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:35.620]   Hmm the cute the cool thing about the the hues is you can
[01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:42.020]   Take a picture you like and say I like this picture makes me feel it's a Hawaiian sunset
[01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:48.820]   I love it take the beach color this ocean color and the sunset color and have different lights be different colors
[01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:50.820]   You can actually that's going too far now
[01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:59.140]   I want to like it goes with my chai mood. I have to I should start by thinking of what
[01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:06.820]   features I'd like so if you have an echo, I'm surprised you're not using them because like I know I say you know
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:09.700]   Echo turn off downstairs
[02:00:09.700 --> 02:00:14.660]   When we're in bed and all the lights downstairs go off and it's I'm kind of old fashioned
[02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:21.540]   I actually uh when I when we go to bed I go around the whole house and lock all the doors check all the lights turn everything out
[02:00:21.540 --> 02:00:26.420]   And go to the old patty and rounded us. I do you can imagine that with my pipe
[02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:29.460]   All right, good night. And I shake good night to all the playmates
[02:00:29.460 --> 02:00:33.860]   Renai just sweetheart
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:38.260]   So so you're dreaming before you go downstairs that turn off lights
[02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:46.020]   You're just getting your steps in the whole house because like sometimes and you know, I'll open the garage door and I'll see there's a garage door open
[02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:53.060]   And I didn't I didn't so I gotta make sure those are all closed and your phone doesn't ping you if your garage door has been open more than 15 minutes
[02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:55.620]   Why not?
[02:00:55.620 --> 02:01:00.020]   But that means I have to put a new garage door opener in I don't that's what I don't
[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:01.940]   That's easy
[02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:07.700]   The garage door thing was one of the easiest things to install because I just stuck a sensor on the door like with double-sided tape
[02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:13.060]   Oh, okay, every DIY is best friend. Yeah, and then I this is how lazy I am
[02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:18.900]   I didn't even screw it into right. It's a little Wi-Fi router. I didn't even screw it in above my garage door
[02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:23.300]   I took zip ties and I just dangled it off of it. Wow. Um, yeah
[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:26.340]   That's you know what I want. I want to I want to quit back to memory
[02:01:26.340 --> 02:01:32.660]   Stacy comes to leo's. I know are you good. Can you wear your tool belt when you come leo's house? Do you have a tool belt?
[02:01:32.660 --> 02:01:36.660]   I bet you do I have a toolbox. No, you don't have a belt though the
[02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:41.860]   I know it's a Christmas
[02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:45.620]   There you go. Stacey toolbox tool bouts toolbelts for everybody
[02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:48.820]   Jeff Jarvis your number of the week
[02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:56.660]   I'm gonna go back up to something we didn't talk about is facebook reportedly fired 18 editorial contractors. We have trouble being
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:01:59.540]   Yeah
[02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:06.260]   Trending and you know a I never really used trending at all and and now I agree with the critics trending really sucks
[02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:11.860]   Well, it's just like twitter trending now, right? Exactly. It's worthless. I think just get rid of trending
[02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:16.100]   I don't get the benefit of it and there's been ridiculous stories in there. There was a um
[02:02:17.700 --> 02:02:20.260]   What's her name the fox anchor the woman?
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:23.780]   Andre. Oh, oh, Megan Kelly
[02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:26.900]   Megan Kelly. There was a false Megan Kelly story that began was trending
[02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:31.780]   But it was false there was something disgusting having to do with chicken McNuggets that I don't want to know about yeah
[02:02:31.780 --> 02:02:34.420]   um
[02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:39.540]   Was a chicken sandwich? Yeah, I don't know how you can masturbate to chicken nuggets
[02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:51.540]   Okay, I'm now going to facebook. Oh karsten does that have to come out? I'm sorry. You could say that word. Oh, you can say that word
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:56.660]   Uh, see all I see in my trending topics are best-gen shrine stagger
[02:02:56.660 --> 02:03:02.900]   I have to pull it because it's gonna give away free things. Why is my trending so boring?
[02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:07.780]   Wait, maybe let me think you're lucky stars top trends politics
[02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:13.460]   Science and technology. Oh, well at least they have topics sports
[02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:16.900]   And entertainment that's kind of nice
[02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:22.180]   Wise Orlando bloom don't you wonder though when you see that? Uh-oh wise Orlando bloom
[02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:26.900]   Oh, because I have a new topic and you do because of his nude photos
[02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:33.860]   You know, I was wonder under politics Benghazi attack. Oh, thank you very much. I don't get enough of that
[02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:36.020]   Twitter
[02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:38.900]   I got Gucci for 2.0 every it was yeah, I got that
[02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:41.780]   California state legislature
[02:03:42.340 --> 02:03:43.620]   Was
[02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:46.820]   Holy no, I got things. Also Colin Kaepernick
[02:03:46.820 --> 02:03:51.300]   You know that the great about the Colin Kaepernick story covers all of the trending
[02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:57.620]   It's entertainment. It's politics. Yeah, it's sports. It's not science and technology. It's the only one that doesn't show up in
[02:03:57.620 --> 02:04:00.420]   Huh
[02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:05.300]   Yeah, I never paid any attention to that but there that whole sidebar on facebook. I usually ignore anyway
[02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:07.700]   There's nothing good there now at at vidcon
[02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:11.140]   Um fidget camo said that they were going to put a box
[02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:15.380]   Uh, I think of that basically that's based promoting live video
[02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:18.660]   Which I would like that that'd be a case where I can't be my stream
[02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:24.180]   She what's going on on facebook now live video is a perfect what's going on. Yeah, I was like that. Yeah trending
[02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:35.060]   So although I will say trending is how I knew last week it was national waffle day, but that was on twitter
[02:04:35.060 --> 02:04:37.380]   Oh man, this is a show a great deal
[02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:40.020]   Yeah, see so
[02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:45.940]   All right, I know I should have prepared something I didn't I didn't prepare anything to talk about today
[02:04:45.940 --> 02:04:51.540]   No showing tall from leo. I'm looking for something you're going to get an incomplete for this
[02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:53.540]   We already did the nexus seven right?
[02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:58.340]   Come back. Did I do the nexus seven? I already did that the note seven. I mean not the nexus seven. No, you do
[02:04:58.340 --> 02:05:01.620]   Yeah, you did the no seven. What are you saying karsten? What should I do?
[02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:06.580]   I already did oh my desk. That's the uh, that's the trending topic
[02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:11.380]   You know, I'm gonna wire this up. So whenever people mention twit the desk goes up
[02:05:11.380 --> 02:05:16.180]   And whenever twit is not mentioned the desk goes down
[02:05:16.180 --> 02:05:24.020]   That'll be awesome. Oh, oh, oh, okay. Ready? Here we go. You put an accelerometer on your desk
[02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:25.060]   Yeah
[02:05:25.060 --> 02:05:31.060]   Okay, or even a motion sensor. Yeah, and it can track how often you stand right or move it
[02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:34.820]   And use that as a proxy for like if you tell it you want to stand two hours a day
[02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:41.140]   Then that's good lights can flash when it's time for your hula. It's a flash and the desk could even go up automatically
[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:46.260]   I'd have to stand yeah, don't be lazy. Can it can it go automatically? Is it internet connected to go on?
[02:05:46.260 --> 02:05:52.820]   That's the question. Can't we just internetify everything? I mean, but not everything has internet capabilities. Would it be nice if
[02:05:52.820 --> 02:05:54.580]   I mean
[02:05:54.580 --> 02:06:01.540]   Does anybody make something work? Yes. Oh, there's two companies that make that they're very very expensive. Are they?
[02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:05.140]   Yes, um, I'm trying to go. Oh, hello dog
[02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:09.780]   So I I have a new thought for a segment on this show
[02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:13.860]   Stacy Higginbotham's recipe of the week
[02:06:13.860 --> 02:06:20.100]   And because you do so many interesting things and really I do need ideas
[02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:26.660]   I thought you don't mean cookies. Well, but that's the beauty of it. Sometimes it could be waffles
[02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:30.020]   Sometimes it sometimes it could if it's this if this or that
[02:06:31.380 --> 02:06:38.180]   Yeah, someone sent me a picture of the mac and cheese waffles. They made the kids eating really yeah, it was on twitter
[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:43.700]   See I get I get good tweets. So Stacy, would you do that? Yeah, I know I get nothing
[02:06:43.700 --> 02:06:49.540]   I'm gonna start you know what I'm gonna do. I think there's a way for me to to delete all my followers and just follow Stacy's
[02:06:49.540 --> 02:06:56.180]   Follows, I think there's a way to like be I'm pretty sure there's a way to see what what Stacy's world looks like
[02:06:56.180 --> 02:07:00.900]   That's what I'm gonna do. Oh, I think there's an app for that. I couldn't look at that
[02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:03.220]   There's a way I say I seem to remember there's something like that
[02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:09.060]   So yes, so Stacy let's have a recipe every week and if this then that recipe every week
[02:07:09.060 --> 02:07:12.740]   I will try it. What about string of fire another another surface?
[02:07:12.740 --> 02:07:19.540]   Or a zappier or yeah, I don't mind but I think that's kind of fun you because you're inspiring me to do like oh, I could do that
[02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:21.540]   I guess that'd be kind of interesting
[02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:24.100]   Okay, I'm not gonna do it every week though. No whatever you feel like it
[02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:28.340]   That's a lot of practice in playing around with stuff that may or may not work and it means demos
[02:07:28.420 --> 02:07:30.660]   And we're gonna sponsor it by Dewalt tools
[02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:33.940]   And oh, there you actually have to put on a tool belt and then
[02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:39.780]   Say it's I don't know the now we're now we're once again wandering into the realms of my fantasies
[02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:42.660]   Um, let's stop. Let's stop
[02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:46.180]   Let's stop
[02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:50.420]   Hey, thank you everybody. This is always fun. I love doing this show. I look forward to it all week long
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:57.060]   Uh really really great to have you Stacy Higginbotham. She does her own podcast with kevin toffle
[02:07:57.780 --> 02:08:00.500]   Uh on you do what you recorded on Wednesday mornings, right?
[02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:04.980]   Oh Kevin and I do Wednesday morning and it releases tomorrow morning and they'll come out tomorrow
[02:08:04.980 --> 02:08:12.340]   The internet of things podcast if you're searching for it, uh or you could find out more at your website stacy on iot.com
[02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:15.460]   And you're going to do a newsletter
[02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:18.580]   I do a newsletter. I do a newsletter. Okay, okay. And you can sign up
[02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:25.060]   I was robbed. Are you subscribed too? I remember when you subscribe the show. You just probably get 500,000. I just don't read my email
[02:08:25.940 --> 02:08:32.180]   Yeah, he just doesn't read it. I'm sure I get it, but I just email is such a hardship that I just I'm too tired
[02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:34.820]   Yeah, I agree too tired to read my email
[02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:37.540]   It's kind of the story of my life
[02:08:37.540 --> 02:08:42.820]   And uh, and of course that's jeff jarvis. He's at buzz machine.com. That's his blog
[02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:46.020]   He's written many great books including what would google do public parts
[02:08:46.020 --> 02:08:53.380]   Gutenberg the geek and I dedicated a whole section of my bookshelf and in the new office to your books. Oh, yeah, it's nice
[02:08:54.580 --> 02:09:00.740]   Uh, we appreciate uh having both of you here each and every week appreciate being here next week
[02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:04.020]   We might be running a little late because next week will be right after the apple event
[02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:06.020]   But I think we'll we'll try to be on time
[02:09:06.020 --> 02:09:11.300]   The apple event depends how long the apple event goes. It starts at 10 a.m. We'll broadcast that live
[02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:14.420]   Wednesday next Wednesday september 7th and then
[02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:22.660]   Uh, the hope is we can do mac break weekly and then this we can google right after that maybe a little bit later. We'll see no windows
[02:09:23.860 --> 02:09:28.420]   We flip flop windows weekly over to the tuesday slot so we could do mac break weekly on the wednesday
[02:09:28.420 --> 02:09:30.500]   Oh, that makes sense. Yes
[02:09:30.500 --> 02:09:34.900]   Because what a really good show about this before the apple and that's what we have ready to say
[02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:40.820]   And paul likes it because uh, he says then we can do windows weekly without talking about a new iphone
[02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:44.340]   So we'll do kudies
[02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:45.300]   Ew
[02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:50.260]   So win win all around i kudies you'll find this show at twit.tv/twig
[02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:58.340]   Uh, but also on like stacy's fine show you'll find it wherever you subscribe to podcasts and that way you can make sure you get every single
[02:09:58.340 --> 02:10:00.580]   episode
[02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:07.460]   I'm gonna have to make a new picture. I was just thinking that yeah, that's right. Yeah, we're not done with this set yet. So um
[02:10:07.460 --> 02:10:12.100]   I'll have to uh, not what are you gonna do? Oh, we got lots more to do
[02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:15.300]   Oh lots more. Well, well for instance the gear is not lit
[02:10:15.300 --> 02:10:18.660]   So we have to put the brick we have bricks to put up behind the gear
[02:10:19.140 --> 02:10:23.540]   And then we can light the front of the gear right now. It just bounces off the back wall. It's so bright. We can't use it
[02:10:23.540 --> 02:10:25.540]   So
[02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:31.700]   We could set up a thing so when people tweet something the gear could light different colors
[02:10:31.700 --> 02:10:36.740]   Okay, it's using twitter. Yeah, I hate it. I know I can do that. No, I could do that
[02:10:36.740 --> 02:10:42.340]   We actually we made and we have probably still a uh, an uncedator that would have tweets
[02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:46.180]   Going across so you don't ask that that's risky
[02:10:47.540 --> 02:10:53.860]   Realized that is not gonna work very well as no, no, I mean if you took my notifications are fine
[02:10:53.860 --> 02:10:58.660]   People are very nice until you put them on the show on an uncedator then they wouldn't be nice anymore
[02:10:58.660 --> 02:11:06.820]   That may be true. Don't don't tempt fate or my friend. I'm not tempting. I mean like yeah, no. Yeah, just yeah
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:08.500]   Yeah
[02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:12.340]   We can have it rotate and the more tweets we get the faster it goes. How about that?
[02:11:12.340 --> 02:11:16.500]   I'm telling you the table should just rise. I think that would really just be awesome
[02:11:17.300 --> 02:11:20.020]   That's how oh, you know, that's how we get you off leo time
[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:25.460]   Your shows will only go for as long as you can stay above the uh, computer street
[02:11:25.460 --> 02:11:31.940]   And then when they can't see you anymore like oh time's up got to go. I tried to make this a short show. I really did
[02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:38.580]   Oh, sorry. Thank you stacy. It's so great to see you. Thank you, dr. Jarvis. So great to see you
[02:11:38.580 --> 02:11:41.780]   Uh, thank you all for being here. We'll see you next time
