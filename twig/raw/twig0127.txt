[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.040]   This week in Google, our special year-end episode.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.040]   And yes, I know I'm not sitting at the Twig table today.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.320]   I'm actually in my studio.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.480]   And that's because it's just the three of us.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.200]   Two of us.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.560]   We are batching it today.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.120]   We're batching it.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.320]   I feel like you're--
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.760]   Yeah, you're--
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.920]   Intersanct him.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.800]   You're dead, yes.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.680]   Let me get my pipe out.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.320]   So--
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.820]   There you go.
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.520]   Back on the ball.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.020]   There you go.
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.440]   And I'm back on the ball.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.880]   Yeah, this is kind of like we used to do Twig.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.080]   Gene is not--
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.480]   Was located in Old Twig yesterday.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.120]   And I forgot about the claustrophobia of the--
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.720]   This is your spacious life now.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.840]   Right.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.920]   Somebody tweeted--
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.080]   You ruined the cozy atmosphere of all of the Twig shows
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.280]   by moving to this--
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.880]   what do you call it?
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.000]   Cold giant studio.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And I don't feel that way.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.320]   But--
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.280]   I don't know.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.840]   I don't know.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.840]   I think it's nice to have a little room to stretch out.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.000]   And I'll tell you who really thinks
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.520]   that it's our employees who were.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.280]   We have 19 employees full-time staff here in the building.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.240]   And they used to all sit around in the big table.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.360]   Even they were trippin' over each other.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.240]   It wasn't good.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.320]   They would have killed each other.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.720]   It's like that experiment with rats on the island.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.280]   They would have just started killing each other.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.000]   So it wasn't really an option, to be honest.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.040]   We had to.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.680]   But we kept this room.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.320]   We duplicated the old studio.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.840]   So it feels a little bit like we're in the old studio.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.360]   Steve.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.800]   Steve.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.200]   Jeff is on the big screen.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.760]   So Gene has--
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.920]   I have nothing to say about science fiction.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.960]   Good.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.480]   I think we've done that.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.320]   Oh, you guys did it.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.920]   So you sure?
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.640]   Gene Trapani, who is normally, of course,
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.520]   the third spoke of the hub.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.520]   No, the third leg of the tripod.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.800]   The tallest flagpole on the moon.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.920]   She's frankly the reason we do this show.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.160]   On a plane, probably home from--
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.320]   From away home from New York.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.080]   From New York, because she was with her family in Brooklyn.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.200]   I was with my family in Massachusetts.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.120]   Did you have a nice holiday?
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.560]   Yes, I did.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.400]   My parents are in from Florida, which is where parents go.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   Yes.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.600]   And so we've had a good time.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.480]   Good.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.240]   Good.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.040]   And Jake's home from college.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.520]   Yep.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.880]   Yep.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.160]   Everybody's hanging out.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.120]   Everybody's here just hanging out.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.280]   I like Christmas.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.400]   I know it's one of those holidays that really
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.360]   can make people crazy.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.320]   But I actually like the chance to kind of hunker down,
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.320]   think about the year gone by, and prepare for a new year.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.160]   And that's exactly what we're going to do on this episode
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.520]   is take a look back at the year 2011 at Google.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.400]   It was an amazing year for Google.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.960]   In fact, Jeff, of course, I should mention,
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.240]   is the professor of journalism at the City University
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.760]   of New York.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.880]   He's a well-known blogger at Buzzmachine.com, brilliant blogger
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.400]   there, and author of a number of books.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.360]   His most recent is called Public Parts, which
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.400]   is about living in public.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.480]   But he also wrote a book called What Would Google Do,
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.400]   which was almost a thought experiment using Google
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.480]   management practices in the outside.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.120]   Now, would you rewrite that book, given what has happened?
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.920]   The biggest change of Google this year was new CEO.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.160]   No, I wrote a new afterward for the paperback edition,
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.360]   which is out now.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.920]   And looked back and was grateful that probably my rules were
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.080]   all such BS that they stood up, such vague generalities
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.360]   that it worked.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.160]   But they kind of stood in.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.160]   Well, I'm proud to say I have the autographed hardcover.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.120]   Good.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.960]   And the thing about it is that--
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.640]   well, I luckily did predict in there
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.520]   that the wars they were going to have going forward
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.200]   were a mobile, local, and social.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.200]   And that's been the case.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.160]   And that's where their focus has shifted.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.480]   Very astute.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.160]   I think it's a year when we saw Google truly shift
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.520]   from being a search company as a product
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.240]   to becoming mobile, local, and social, thanks to Android
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.080]   and thanks to Google+ now.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.720]   Eric Schmidt said that he was adult supervision.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.320]   He was brought in by Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.240]   Brann, who met at Stanford and created Google at Stanford
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.720]   and then formed a company, Google, which is now,
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.920]   is it 13 years old?
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.880]   I think that's right.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.280]   We should know.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.760]   We should know.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.600]   Well, I remember they celebrated--
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.720]   I want to say 13-- in there anyway.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.640]   And at some point, not too long after, maybe 10 years ago,
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.800]   they said we need to--
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.320]   as often happens with startups, we need a professional CEO.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.760]   Or their board said it.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.440]   Yeah, maybe not Larry and Sergey.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.120]   Maybe their board.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.040]   Although, I think that they made a very good--
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.960]   Thanks, John, for it.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.680]   They really did.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.800]   Often founders will, as I have done here,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.840]   will step aside for somebody who actually knows
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.000]   how to run a company, provide the vision thing,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.960]   and so forth.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.560]   Eric Schmidt came from Novel, was an absolutely accomplished CEO.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.880]   But also, I think--
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.640]   and this was, I'm sure, important to Larry and Sergey,
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.560]   an engineer, and really understood technology.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.720]   And I think he was a good CEO for 10 years.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.560]   But what's interesting is that Larry Page clearly
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.760]   was studying and learning in that time.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.360]   And I think what happened is that he came--
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.400]   it got to a point where he said, I'm ready now.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.280]   Eric, why don't you become chairman of the board?
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.480]   And Eric's still involved with it.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.040]   At Leweb, he was very much a spokesperson for Google.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.800]   Yeah, but I think that the question
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.480]   is it wasn't just Larry learning.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.040]   It was also Eric teaching.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.640]   Right.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.400]   This was part of the plan.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.880]   Yeah, and I'd love to see--
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.320]   I hope at some point they tell that story.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.920]   But knowing that that was going to happen,
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.640]   knowing that you were going to have a succession
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.440]   of very good companies should, getting a founder with the vision
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.600]   in the right position and the company in the right position
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.560]   so that it can go forward.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.640]   That's really the brilliant thing that they did.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.320]   And you've got to give Eric a lot of points.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.400]   And you've got to give, I think for that matter,
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.680]   both Larry and Sergey points for pulling back enough to learn.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.000]   And by all accounts, it worked.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.560]   But what's fascinating now is we start to see--
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.360]   it's like when you get an Android version without the Motorola
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.600]   or the Sprint stuff added.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.080]   Now we're getting Google as a pure Android,
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.400]   in the sense we're seeing Larry's strategy come to life.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.160]   And while it was unclear when Larry kind of re-orged the company
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.560]   and took over in April, it was unclear what that would pretend.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.000]   I think that now, eight months later, I think we all can agree,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.400]   he's done a masterful job.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.320]   He has reshaped the company.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.160]   You know, when you thought it was the opposite,
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.880]   a founder or a creative founder like that
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.800]   would have wanted to have 100 pet projects going in.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.280]   Exactly the opposite.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.880]   And maybe that was the real brilliance in the end of the 20% rule,
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.840]   was that it allowed all these flowers to bloom,
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.800]   so they could figure out which were flowers, which were weeds,
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.880]   and start to really focus on what Google is
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.920]   and what it has to be.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.200]   They had their time in kindergarten.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.960]   I think he may have been inspired by the only other example
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.880]   of this that I know of, of a founder coming back
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.360]   and running the company, which was Steve Jobs.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.520]   Steve Jobs, when he was forced out by the board of Apple,
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.120]   was not ready to run Apple.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.240]   He wasn't put aside.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.800]   In fact, although I have to say John Scully
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.360]   late in a recent interview said,
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.160]   I wish we had kept Steve, but just put him,
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.960]   done what happened at Google, I gather, which was keep him,
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.440]   but not let him run the company.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.200]   Because he was too immature to run the company.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.280]   He did come back and ran the company well.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.600]   And according to Isaacson in his book about Jobs, Larry Page,
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.800]   despite the hatred that Jobs had for Google,
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.680]   Larry Page did count him as a mentor.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.120]   And one of the things Steve Jobs said is,
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.600]   say no to a thousand things.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.240]   Focus.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.720]   And I would say that that is,
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.240]   I don't know if that's where Larry got it,
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.280]   but that's what Larry's doing.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.120]   He cut so much this year.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.000]   - Yeah, and I think that it also comes
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.440]   to understanding that your structure,
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.880]   and this is true of any company.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.200]   Your structure as a company can't hold up
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.360]   with all that stuff going on.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.240]   We complained on this show over the last two years,
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.960]   probably a year before this,
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.320]   one of our big complaints was that there was
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.640]   a Chrome OS going and there was an Android OS going,
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.560]   and right hand wasn't talking to the left hand,
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.520]   but there didn't seem to be a clear strategy.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.440]   And one way you do that is by getting tough.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.960]   And Larry, he's gotten tough.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.280]   And he's restructured around that.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.920]   And he has brilliant people with his top layer.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.000]   I mean, the one we deal with,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.760]   because of Google+ and all that is big control to her,
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.280]   but he's quite amazing.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.800]   And other folks like that,
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.120]   he reorganized to get the right structure
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.240]   into what they want to accomplish.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.440]   He knows what they need to accomplish.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.000]   So we'll see where this goes in two, three years.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.920]   Things could go south,
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.920]   but I think it's very impressive
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.880]   running start off the lunch path,
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.240]   mixing in my metaphors terribly.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.240]   (laughing)
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.080]   In a way that--
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.920]   - That's where I started.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.240]   - We'll move up the science actually.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.520]   - I started with a tripod thing,
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.680]   and it was down in the house.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.880]   (laughing)
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.640]   Actually, I think it's interesting,
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.520]   'cause there's all those trickle along.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.960]   And one of the things that,
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.560]   one of the strengths that Silicon Valley
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.200]   and San Francisco have is that
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.560]   everybody influences each other.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.440]   Their jobs may be influenced Larry Page.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.800]   But then I think Larry Page's reorganization of Google
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.240]   has influenced Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.240]   who did something very similar
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.520]   just a couple of weeks ago.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.400]   He put five people in charge,
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.760]   created a kind of a committee of five
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.800]   to run the company in the critical areas,
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.080]   very much like Larry did.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.640]   So the timeline for Larry is he took over
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.000]   in the beginning of April.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.040]   That's when Eric Schmidt stood down.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.040]   He returned as chief executive.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.800]   I'm reading the article here from the LA Times.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.480]   He returned as chief executive of Google Monday.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.200]   By Thursday, three days later,
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.680]   he re-orged the entire management team.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.880]   Jonathan Rosenberg resigned.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.860]   And Page created this kind of key executive team.
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:21.200]   So Andy Rubin became senior vice president of mobile.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.120]   He's the guy at Android.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.640]   Vic Gundotra, you mentioned,
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.400]   is now senior vice president of social.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.400]   Sundar Pichai became the third in that group
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.320]   as a senior vice president of Chrome.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.680]   Salar Kamangar became senior vice president
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.080]   of YouTube and video.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.560]   And Alan Eustis, senior vice president of search,
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.960]   Susan Wojcicki,
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.760]   which is, I don't know how you pronounce it,
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.680]   Wojcis Wojciski, senior vice president of AD.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.160]   So what happened was essentially,
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.840]   Larry not only elevated these people,
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.400]   but defined six key areas,
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.400]   mobile, social, Chrome, YouTube and video,
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.880]   search and ads.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.600]   - Right.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.320]   And that is exactly what the company is, isn't it?
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.160]   - Yeah, if you think about it,
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.800]   although it's almost now trivial to say,
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.280]   it's an advertising company first and foremost.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.120]   Is that, would you agree with it?
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.960]   That's what people say.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.480]   - Oh, absolutely, 100%.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.320]   100%.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.560]   But that's like saying the New York Times
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.680]   is an advertising company.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.360]   NBC is an advertising company.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.200]   - True, good point.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.320]   - Now, then we get into the argument,
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.480]   is Google a media company?
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.320]   And Siva and some others are,
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.400]   I know I think it's,
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:40.240]   oh, it's Bob Garfield on the media who argues that,
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.760]   it's a media company.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.320]   David Carr argues it's a media company,
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.960]   I think most prominently.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.160]   I'm not so sure I agree with that,
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.880]   because I think the media presumes a notion of creating
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.840]   and owning content.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.120]   - Google has not made some moves in that direction,
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.720]   though they bought next new networks
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.640]   and have funded a hundred million,
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.960]   we'll talk about a little bit more about that,
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.200]   but have funded a hundred million dollars
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.360]   with a new production for YouTube.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.640]   - But even there, they're trying to get others to succeed.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.680]   So it's the old model where Procter and Gamble
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.680]   funded soap operas at Northern Exposure
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.200]   to have a place to advertise to, to change the media.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.240]   I think that's where they still are,
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.160]   it still need to be.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.000]   - Right.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.760]   Yeah, good point.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.560]   I think that when Larry and others say,
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.000]   Google's business is making the web better,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.520]   because when you use the web, we make money.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.120]   That's really a statement of what their business model is.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.960]   - Yes, yes.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.240]   - We make money in ads, they leave that part out,
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.640]   but that's how they make the money.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.600]   - And I think with Android.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.680]   - Yes, yes.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.480]   And both Android and Google+,
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.800]   are, I argue, are about, I've said this before
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.640]   in the show in the last year,
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.520]   but hey, it's a review show, so I can repeat myself.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.400]   It's about signal generation.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.040]   It's about knowing more about us.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.080]   - I agree.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.840]   - When you get around wherever privacy issues there are,
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.880]   so that you can target services, content,
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.720]   and advertising to each of us.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.720]   - The way I imagine it happening in the boardroom
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.960]   or at the execcom meeting is, oh crap.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.680]   Our business, our core business research,
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.280]   is shifting that social signals are now really important.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.480]   Who has all those social signals?
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.480]   Oh crap, Facebook does.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.800]   Who did Facebook do a deal with?
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.200]   Bing, oh crap.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.400]   So what do we need to do?
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.920]   We need to get that kind of social data into our search.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.760]   How do we do that?
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.040]   We create a social network.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.680]   Does that sound sensible?
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.680]   - Yeah, but I think it's even more than that.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.480]   I think they've actually followed Mark Zuckerberg's
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.400]   argument, which is they didn't create a social network,
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.440]   but they've made their business social.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.640]   And that's what Mark has been arguing.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.480]   - Interesting, interesting.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.360]   - Every business will become social, right?
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.000]   And so with Mark's case at the last F8,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.560]   he takes it through, so in Facebook's world,
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.160]   first games became social,
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.080]   now music becomes social, news becomes social.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.160]   If you look at Amazon, retail becomes more and more social.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.440]   So at Google, they're trying to make,
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.440]   don't have to be called search,
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.600]   call it finding information, social,
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.720]   creating information, social.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.280]   Those things, I think, matter a lot.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.840]   And so it's not so much that,
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.800]   I think we've said this, and Gina said this too.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.920]   It's not so much that Google created a social network.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.360]   It's that it really believes that social becomes part
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.560]   of everything it does.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.600]   And the irony here is that that follows the suggestion
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.000]   of none other than Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.760]   - Well, and huge growth on Google,
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.360]   although people dispute these numbers,
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.000]   all the numbers come from Google.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.240]   No, actually that's not true.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.760]   Numbers come from also outside people.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.160]   Google's not been very forthright,
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.280]   but very big growth growth on Google+, continuous growth.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.000]   And it doesn't feel that way when you use Google+,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.160]   but lots of people using it.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.640]   I think because it's so omnipresent
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.520]   in anything you do at Google now,
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.080]   with the Google bar and everything,
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.080]   that people just join or they create a profile
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.960]   just because it's part of having a Google account.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.760]   Doesn't mean they use it or even read it.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.840]   - Yeah, and I've seen reports that Google will get
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.120]   to 400 million profiles on Google+,
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.680]   so I've seen some arguments this week about,
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.960]   well, that's just a prediction.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.520]   I think within the year, somebody argued argument
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.400]   is that it's now 65 million,
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.240]   but there's arguments against that,
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.120]   that includes Gmail.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.120]   And so who knows what it really amounts to,
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.160]   but I don't think it's hard to imagine
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.800]   Google's a worldwide company getting up to that much.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.240]   And again, we don't even have to have a profile there
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.760]   for Google to know things about what we do.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.120]   - Right. - Right.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.440]   - Through search, through Chrome, through Android.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.000]   - But it's so much better if they can add your age,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.600]   your income, who your friends are.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.960]   A social graph is not merely what you do,
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.640]   but it's who you know.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.920]   - Exactly, and then also Leo,
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.920]   I think at some point gives us potentially,
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.000]   if they do it right, more control then,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.800]   over what they know about us,
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.040]   which is better for them in terms of privacy concerns,
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.240]   and also better for them
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.280]   in terms of getting more accurate information.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.680]   And so, I tell news companies these days
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.480]   that they should stop the notion of,
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.640]   and you've said this too,
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.480]   when you talked about,
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.600]   I suppose that I have half-written and never put up,
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.480]   but when you said you don't want Twitter
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.480]   to become too big, that that would be a real mistake.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.960]   I think that's something that news companies don't realize,
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.840]   media companies don't realize
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.600]   because they always sold bulk and mass.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.960]   - So, Leo, for numbers.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.480]   - Right, and so my argument to media companies,
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.280]   news companies lately,
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.760]   has been stop counting page views,
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.560]   start counting relationships,
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.480]   and start, stop saying that all relationships are equal,
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.080]   start understanding that some relationships
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.280]   are more valuable than others.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.360]   I wrote a post a week ago,
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.520]   arguing that, and this wouldn't work,
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.000]   but as a thought exercise,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.360]   if you took the New York Times paywall
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.240]   and turned it on its head,
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.760]   and let's imagine that you said to somebody,
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.960]   hey, you gotta pay a 20 buck deposit
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.280]   to get into the Times.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.080]   But then, every time you add value to the Times,
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:45.960]   you're gonna get a credit.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.960]   Every time you look at an ad,
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.800]   every click on an ad,
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.040]   every time you add a comment, people like,
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.280]   every time you help report.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.880]   I mean, you can imagine all kinds of things.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.720]   - We need to measure that.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.360]   - They need to measure that because that's the value.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.480]   - And then also reward that.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.960]   So, the irony of the paywall is
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.800]   we're punishing our most valuable readers,
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.360]   and we're letting our least valuable readers
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.600]   get a free ride.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.400]   It's Bass Hackwords, as my West Virginia father would say,
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.920]   and he's in town, so I think this way now.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.640]   - I love that model.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.040]   That's a, I wish somebody would do that.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.480]   That's a great model.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.640]   - So, you know, probably wouldn't work
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.880]   because you still have the problems of abundance,
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.880]   and so on and so forth.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.160]   But what it says is it makes us look
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.440]   at the value of each reader,
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.000]   and reward that value, and recognize that value.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.320]   And so, I think that Google and Facebook
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.440]   are clearly in that mindset,
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.200]   and media companies are not.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.000]   And the more they have a relationship with you,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.760]   and that's what Google+ means,
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.280]   that they have a relationship with you,
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.560]   that you have your profile there,
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.600]   that not only that they know who you are,
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.560]   that you have some control and mastery over your domain.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.720]   The more they think that way,
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.920]   I think the better off the internet will be.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.480]   But it'll still make some people feel creepy.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.640]   - We're taking the year in review for Google,
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.920]   and this week in Google, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.920]   and Leo Laporte, and I know Gina is sitting on that airplane
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.440]   somewhere over the United States, ganashing her teeth,
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.360]   saying, "I wanna be there, I wanna talk."
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.520]   So next week, we'll have, we'll get her opinions
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.600]   on all of this too.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.200]   We're gonna take a little break and come back with more.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.600]   There was so much to talk about,
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.720]   Google's acquisition of Motorola.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.000]   Andy Rubin tweeted this week, that in December,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.600]   what does he say, 23rd and 24th,
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:31.600]   there were 7.5 million Android activations in two days.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:37.360]   This was the year of Android as well, no question about it.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.120]   Google killed a whole bunch of stuff,
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.640]   we'll talk about it.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.480]   - We should do in memoriam, you know,
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.840]   maybe we should produce this.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.320]   You know how they do at the Oscars ceremony,
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.160]   all the people who died this year.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.480]   We could have like a tear.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.400]   We could have Mariah Carey come on and sing, you know,
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.200]   a sad song and do a slow montage
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.600]   of all the Google things that died this year.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.440]   Maybe we'll do that.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.840]   - I'll get the editors to work.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.280]   - Who on the staff can sing?
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.080]   Elaine, you sing?
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.760]   And what would we sing?
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.400]   We'll think of that and we'll come back with more
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.760]   just a bit before we do though.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.960]   I do want to say hello to our friends
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.840]   at the Ford Motor Company.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.280]   They've been a big supporter of this show.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.240]   We are so grateful to them
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:23.080]   for keeping a float with their advertising dollars.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.520]   And you know, I drive a Mustang
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.840]   and I am very, very happy.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.360]   Actually, we've been talking about getting another Ford
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.880]   in the family, I love that Ford Flex.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.600]   Great family vehicle.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.200]   And I can't wait to get the 2012 electric focus.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.240]   But the thing that for me is absolutely must have
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.280]   in every vehicle now,
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.320]   gotta have sync.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.600]   And the new Ford's, and this is one of the reasons
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.720]   I can't wait to get a new one,
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.320]   have this new AppLink feature.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.360]   Let's take a look at Ford Sync with AppLink.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.600]   A little something we recorded a couple of weeks ago
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.000]   when we had a chance to test out the new 2012 Ford Fiesta.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.800]   Hey, Leo LePorte, Brick Twid House.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.400]   And once again, I want to show you the cool stuff
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.080]   Ford is doing in their new vehicles.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.840]   This is the 2012 Ford Fiesta.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.360]   Very affordable car with great features,
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.480]   including the Ford Sync.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.000]   I want to show you how Sync now can use mobile apps
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.440]   on your phone like Pandora, Stitcher to listen to iPods,
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.720]   Pandora to listen to music, OpenBeak to listen to tweets.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.160]   And they just added Slack or radio too.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.400]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.680]   First, let's get in the car.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.160]   Almost everything you do with this Ford Sync,
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.880]   you do with your voice.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.440]   And I kind of like that.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.120]   So here's the Ford Sync button here on the turn signal.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.120]   Let's turn the car on and I'll show you how it works.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.240]   Let's have Pandora running.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.680]   I'm going to connect this to the USB connector.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.840]   Notice the USB connector right here.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.600]   I'm using the standard iPhone cable.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.080]   That's great because it's also charging the phone
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:49.960]   while I'm listening to it.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.560]   I can just keep it here, make phone calls.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.440]   And I do it all with my hands on the wheel,
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.840]   my eyes on the road, just press this button.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.960]   - Mobile apps, please say a command.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:00.800]   - Pandora.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.480]   So now my Pandora is connected.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.200]   And I can listen to a station.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.760]   Let's say I'll play a station Lady Gaga.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.600]   How about that?
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.720]   (bell chimes)
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.560]   - Pandora, please say a command.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.100]   - PlayStation Lady Gaga.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:24.680]   So now I'm listening to Lady Gaga.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.360]   This is great because it means I,
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.000]   as I'm driving along,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.600]   I can listen to songs that I love from artists that I love.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.160]   I can even create new stations.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.640]   If I don't like a song that's playing,
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.640]   I can thumbs down it.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.720]   If I like it, I can thumbs up.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.720]   In fact, let's do a thumbs up right now.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.200]   (bell chimes)
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.440]   - Pandora, please say a command.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.320]   - Thumbs up.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.440]   Thumbed up.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.160]   (laughs)
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.360]   How about skip?
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.520]   - Pandora, please say a command.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.360]   - Skip.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.060]   (bell chimes)
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.800]   - All right, now we're rockin'.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.560]   (bell chimes)
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:09.480]   This is all streaming in via 3G.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.000]   So I can be just driving down the road,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.280]   listening to great radio.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.240]   If I want more information about a song
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.040]   or I wanna buy a song, I can tell it.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.720]   I can create new stations.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.720]   So the beauty of this is I don't have to
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   take my eyes off the road.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.120]   I know it's on the display there,
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:24.960]   but I don't have to.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.480]   I can just drive along and I can say,
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.400]   "Well, what was that song?"
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.920]   And it will tell me.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.920]   I just love that.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.520]   So you can see how easy it is.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.640]   You can listen to podcasts using Stitcher.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.200]   You can listen to music using Pandora.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.960]   You can even have your tweets read to you with OpenB.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.480]   That's the sync with the new app link.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.880]   More and more apps all the time,
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.560]   which means more capabilities from Ford Sync.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.280]   And you don't have to do anything.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.560]   As long as you got the apps on your phone,
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.880]   that's all you need.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.760]   Pretty cool.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.000]   Drive one today at a Ford dealer near you.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   - I have and will.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Take a look.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.280]   Ford.com/technology for more information.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.520]   We are going back in time with Jeff Jarvis,
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.000]   taking a look at the year 2011 in history,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.160]   well, in Google terms.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.960]   And one of the things we cannot go without mentioning,
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.720]   Jeff, is Eric Schmidt and his Malaprops.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.640]   It was, you know, some people might have said,
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.000]   "That's why Eric's no longer a CEO."
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.880]   And of course it's not.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.120]   I think that transition was long planned.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.400]   And I think in some ways,
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.960]   at least speaking as a tech journalist,
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.560]   I love Eric Schmidt.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.360]   He gives us something to talk about.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:38.000]   - When I talked to him for public parts,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.080]   you know, we went over,
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.160]   I think it was the episode of him talking about
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.520]   young people should be able to race their identity at 21.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.960]   And I had always said in blogs,
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.600]   and here on this show, it was a joke.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.960]   And he flustered, says, "It was a joke.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.840]   "It is a joke.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.600]   "It always will be a joke."
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.440]   (laughing)
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.080]   - And another problem here is that,
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.800]   you know, somebody who's smart really
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.000]   make themselves stupid,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   just 'cause they're talking public,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.240]   should they make themselves less funny or ironic
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.240]   because some people don't get irony.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.480]   Well, yeah, I guess in some companies you should,
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.040]   but Eric Schmidt's a really smart guy.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.760]   And he says what he thinks,
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.120]   he doesn't always say it in a well packaged way.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:19.960]   And that's the other reason,
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.560]   you know, one of the things that I like about Zuckerberg.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.400]   - Yeah.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.600]   - Early on when he was on panels and such,
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.920]   he would literally say what he thought in five words,
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.480]   period stop, you know, big stare.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.320]   - Right.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.160]   - That's what geeks are like,
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.440]   get used to it people.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.360]   They're blunt, they say what they think.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.720]   - I like engineers, I hate interviewing CEOs,
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.400]   I hate interviewing marketing people,
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.840]   I love interviewing engineers 'cause you know,
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.840]   an engineer, it's either true or it's not,
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.000]   it's black and white. - Yes.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.320]   - And they say the truth.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.480]   - Yes. - And that's it.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.600]   But of course, every CEO has gotten very good
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.720]   at spinning these days.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.800]   Not Eric Schmidt, never really, (laughing)
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.440]   never learned that skill, or maybe unlearned it.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.480]   I wouldn't be surprised if he decided
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.800]   to become less polished in some ways.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.400]   The most recent proclamation from Chairman Schmidt
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.960]   was at Lil Webb, where he unaccountably,
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.000]   and Google's spin machine went right into action saying,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:06.840]   no, no, you didn't mean that.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.040]   But he unaccountably he said,
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.880]   and maybe he knew something,
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.400]   that next year half of all televisions
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.960]   would have Google TV built in.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.520]   - What? (laughing)
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.640]   And maybe he knew something,
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.240]   'cause of course Google acquired Motorola,
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.000]   Motorola makes set top boxes.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.360]   Maybe those new set top boxes will all have Google TV.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:31.040]   - Well, look at the news about Verizon Fios.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.480]   Now seeing through the side door
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.880]   that they're gonna come up with a,
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.000]   and Motorola may well make it,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.760]   a single media server in the home,
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.480]   and everything else gets served off the net.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.000]   - That's the future, isn't it?
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   - That is, they throw it along,
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.840]   should have been in the future.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.840]   And a lot of that stuff, by the way,
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.380]   that's in the home, should still be on the cloud,
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.840]   but that's plain here.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.920]   Get there, you get rid of the set top box.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.040]   What it means is that every TV is on the net,
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.400]   and once every TV becomes net connected,
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.520]   it's connected to Google.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.840]   Whether it's Google TV or not,
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.560]   I think was a wrong way to stay it.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:09.080]   But is every, in an amount of time,
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.040]   will every new TV in America be able to use Google?
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.480]   Yeah, I'd go for that prediction.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.880]   - Yeah, you want a browser in your TV now.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.680]   I think that that's kind of, it's a weird experience,
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.360]   and you do have the issue of how do we type,
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.680]   how do we control it, how do you move a mouse?
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.040]   - Oh, that's where a voice comes in.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:30.520]   - Right, right, that's maybe what the Apple TV will lick.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.760]   I have to say that I bought a Logitech Google TV
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.680]   when they first came out more than a year ago, $300.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.400]   They're now $99, and Logitech announced this year,
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.840]   the new CEO of Logitech said it was $100 million mistake,
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.040]   they'll never make that mistake again,
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.320]   it was always a beta product, never a final.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.120]   I having now updated, and this has happened
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.240]   since the last time I was on Twig,
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.000]   but I got the update.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.960]   I like Google TV, I actually plugged it back in, yeah.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.680]   And that's what I use all the time now.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.680]   - Is it hard to configure now the way it was before?
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.880]   - You don't know, 'cause you-
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.920]   - Well, one of the things we talked about this year was,
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.120]   or maybe it was last year, is plugging it in,
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.680]   and the first thing you have to do is update,
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.080]   and update, and update, and update.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.120]   But it's actually a pretty straightforward box,
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.400]   it's different from the Roku,
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.920]   so the way the Roku works is one more input to your TV.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.400]   So if you have four HDMI inputs on your TV,
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.240]   and you have a remote control that can choose between them,
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.040]   one of them might be Roku, one of them might be Apple TV,
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.840]   one of them might be your DVR/settopbox/cable,
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.720]   or satellite box, and then you switch from the other.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.120]   Google TV doesn't work that way,
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.760]   and I think in some ways this is smart,
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.160]   and it presages how Google TV will work
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.160]   once it's built into television sets and set top boxes.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.920]   It's a pass-through device.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:47.280]   So you take the cable, the HDMI cable that's coming out
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.200]   of your set top box, plug it into the Google TV,
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.760]   and then the Google TV goes into your television.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.760]   So in effect, when you're watching your cable,
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.400]   or your satellite television, at all times,
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.680]   your Google TV is available by pressing a button
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.400]   on that full-size computer-style keyboard,
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.480]   and suddenly Google TV pops up as an overlay
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.040]   on top of the satellite TV.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:10.880]   >> Got it.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.720]   >> And so that's an interesting different way
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.600]   of thinking about it, and I think in the long run,
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.320]   that's the right way to think about it,
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.560]   which is we don't want to switch and say,
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.840]   "Well, now I'm going to watch my Roku,
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.160]   now I'm going to watch my Apple TV,
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.640]   now I'm going to watch my boxy box,
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.600]   now I'm going to watch my..."
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.800]   We want to watch the TV
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.480]   and have all the features built into it.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.600]   So in effect, the Logitech box,
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.400]   and I think this is true of the Sony box,
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.080]   and certainly it's true of the Blu-ray,
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.720]   become an overlay.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.560]   Now in the case of the Blu-ray,
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.640]   it's an overlay on the Blu-ray,
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.200]   not onto the satellite or the cable box.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.600]   I like that, so if I want to have my browser come up,
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.480]   I can continue to watch Oprah,
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.680]   and I guess you don't watch that anymore,
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.720]   I continue to watch Dr. Phil,
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.680]   and you can watch Oprah on her cable's channel.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.320]   >> And you double the audience, so it becomes...
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.520]   >> Yeah, two people, and now we're all watching.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.640]   And then, so I can tweet, and still be hearing Oprah
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.040]   and kind of see her behind it,
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.160]   I can search for TV shows,
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.720]   it's a global search mechanism,
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.280]   which is kind of neat when you do a search,
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.960]   it says, "Well, I'll find it in all the different ways
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.600]   you could possibly get this."
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.080]   That's, I think, what people want.
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.080]   >> And that's the key, I think,
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:18.120]   is that if you get to this single server model,
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.960]   then what you're saying is, find me what I want,
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.840]   wherever the heck it is.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.280]   If it's on my hard drive find,
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.360]   if it's in the cloud find, if it's my cloud find,
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.600]   if it's in the internet find, just get it to me.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.480]   >> And that's what then...
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.760]   >> That's how it should be.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.320]   >> Yeah, yeah, it kills that.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.640]   It becomes, and this is what happened in music,
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:40.600]   is we went from a music store selling albums,
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:45.400]   full CDs, to an online service selling songs,
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.600]   Allah carte, and that's what television is gonna be.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.400]   You don't care what network or channel even
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.360]   two and a half men is on, you just wanna watch the show.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.200]   >> Yes.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.400]   >> Let's type in two and a half men.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.040]   There, and it'll say, well, you can watch previous episodes
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.520]   on iTunes, you can get it on Hulu,
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.840]   whatever the choices are.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.800]   >> And everybody hates that,
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.240]   Google loves it, the artists love it.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.280]   >> ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, hate it!
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.360]   >> MSOs hate it.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.720]   >> And cable companies hate it!
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:17.280]   And so they in fact, the networks block Google TV,
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.960]   that's the biggest, single biggest problem right now,
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.120]   is that they're all blocking it.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.960]   So you aren't living...
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.240]   >> So when you explain that to me, Leo,
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.760]   how that works now after the update?
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.960]   >> So you say, I wanna find two and a half men,
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.480]   and it says it's on ABC's website,
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.440]   you go to ABC's website, and ABC's website says,
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.280]   or whatever, I don't know what network it's on,
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.120]   'cause I don't watch it.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.280]   >> Right.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.640]   >> It says CBS. >> CBS.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.640]   >> CBS.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.160]   Really, I see, I didn't even know that.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.000]   So, 'cause I don't watch that show.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.720]   But if you did, it would then go to the CBS website,
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.600]   and CBS would say, oh, I see you're here in a Google TV,
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.040]   forget about it, buddy.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.040]   Which I have never understood,
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.560]   I'm sure you understand this better,
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.960]   it seems to me, if they're letting you watch it
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.120]   in a browser on your computer,
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.400]   why wouldn't they let you watch it
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.240]   in a browser on your television set?
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.080]   Isn't that the same thing?
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.800]   >> It's still this, oh, you're absolutely right,
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.680]   of course it is.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.080]   And they'll get to it at some point,
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.240]   this idea of one device being different
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.840]   from another becomes absurd.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.160]   And so, I think, you know,
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.240]   this is the advantage of the journalist's followup question,
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.080]   if there are a hot on it.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.320]   It would have been nice,
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.920]   it would be really nice to engage Eric
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.320]   in that prediction, and say, well,
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.320]   how? >> Tell us more
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.080]   about what do you think the future of TV looks like?
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.440]   >> What's the mechanism? >> Love.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.160]   >> Yeah, I would have loved to have that interview too.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.400]   You know, maybe we tried to, by the way.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.360]   And Eric Schmitt's people blew us off,
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.760]   like just the great thing,
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.200]   and this is again, and I commend them for this.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.160]   Some of the people that we tried to get
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.800]   on our La Web broadcasts,
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.920]   their marketing PR people were, you know,
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.040]   cautious and mealy-mouthed,
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.240]   they said, well, we'll try,
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.600]   the person never showed, right?
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.560]   Well, you will do our best,
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.640]   the person never showed.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.960]   Eric's people just said no.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.560]   (laughs)
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.400]   They didn't make up a story like Eric
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.880]   flying out right away or anything, they said no.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.720]   And I like, you know what, I appreciate that.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.640]   Let's be honest. >> Yeah.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.120]   >> No, he's not gonna do it.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:15.120]   So we did try to get Eric on our interview at La Web,
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.040]   and I promise you, and I hope you will,
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.240]   I know you will also,
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.480]   if either of us ever get to sit down one-on-one
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.760]   with Eric again, we'll ask him that.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.040]   Well, tell us how that works.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:26.880]   >> I'll do that.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.640]   >> You know who did get to sit down one-on-one
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.800]   with Eric Schmitt is the folks at the D9,
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.080]   Walt Mossberg and Cara Swisher.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.480]   It was at D9 that Eric said,
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.520]   some of the most amazing things this year,
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.960]   and was so honest and outspoken,
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.240]   and I just love that, again,
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.760]   that makes him a unique person among CEOs.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.760]   For instance, this is thanks to Danny Sullivan
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.800]   who was live blogging at the time.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:59.440]   He said that Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.400]   are the gang of four major companies
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.760]   that have huge platforms dominate the space
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.400]   and are difficult to challenge.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.960]   Amazon rules in shopping, Apple in beautiful products,
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.240]   Google rules in information, Facebook and friends
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.320]   and identity, he left out, as you might have thought,
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.760]   when you listen to this, Microsoft, he says,
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.560]   Microsoft is very strong in the enterprise space,
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.160]   and their products will be a flywheel
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.040]   that will power Microsoft for decades.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.160]   A flywheel, of course, is something that's stored energy
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.360]   and releases it but does not get any new energy.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:34.640]   And I think that's fairly accurate.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.920]   - And there's no Twitter on this list.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.680]   - There's no Twitter on this list?
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.480]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm saying that's not one of the four--
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.840]   - No, it isn't.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.720]   - Horseman of the apocalypse here.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:47.840]   And I think that's a telling omission.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.360]   This year, Google allowed their deal with Twitter to lapse.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.560]   We don't know-- - Still don't know
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.680]   what happened there, which side dropped that.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.520]   My impression when I talked to people at Google
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.960]   was that they could have been just frustrated.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.440]   They didn't have it.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.920]   My impression almost wasn't, it was Twitter.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.760]   Did it?
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.380]   Twitter's being oddly control-free-f
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.600]   - Well, I think Twitter is in a difficult situation right now
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.720]   because one of the reasons they did that web redesign
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.440]   a couple of weeks ago is the problem with Twitter
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.000]   is it's becoming infrastructure.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.240]   It's becoming a utility.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.560]   It's becoming a pipeline of signals and information
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.640]   that others capitalize on, which means Twitter can't.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.680]   So for instance, most of my Twitter these days
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:34.680]   comes through Flipboard, both on the iPhone and the iPad.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.920]   Now those are all tweets, but I don't ever see the tweets.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.440]   I just see the content that they point to,
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.600]   which means I also don't see any revenue.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.400]   I don't send any revenue to Twitter's way.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.240]   Maybe Flipboard does, I don't know.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.760]   But I think that-- - Yeah, it goes back
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.280]   to the old saw about distribution and controlling distribution.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:56.200]   I saw some talk online this week about whether or not
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.280]   authors should try to cut Amazon out
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.880]   and somebody in a bookseller said, okay,
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.080]   I understand why you're saying that,
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.680]   but you're cutting your own nose off to fight your face.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.520]   - Right.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.000]   - You know, Amazon controls more and more and more
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.440]   and more tightly with the Kindle and the Fire distribution.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.240]   And Twitter doesn't control distribution.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.440]   - Nope.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.880]   - They control nothing.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   - No.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.960]   - They merely have a pipe.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.160]   Well, what they do try to control,
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.480]   and I think this is what happened with Google,
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.840]   is they try to control what they call the fire hose,
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.240]   which is the outpouring of tweets.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.360]   They do sell this to a couple of people.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.600]   That was obviously what Google had
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.680]   in order to index all of the content on Twitter,
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.600]   you need the fire hose.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.120]   And Twitter controls that tightly and unfortunately,
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.080]   I don't think that's enough leverage for them
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:40.920]   in the long run.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.760]   And that's one of the reasons,
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.560]   it's the other reason perhaps Google+ exists.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.800]   I always thought Google+ was more a Twitter killer
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.560]   than a Facebook killer. - Mm-hmm, I agree.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.560]   - He also talked about Apple.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:54.040]   Now, Google was big in the news thanks to Walter Isaacson's
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.680]   book in which Steve Jobs admitted that all he wanted
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:01.680]   in life, probably after life, is to kill Android.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.880]   He hated Google, he was furious.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:08.880]   We found out that that meeting that Steve and Eric Schmidt had
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:15.640]   in Palo Alto at a coffee shop was all about Eric saying,
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.400]   "Please Steve, what can we do?
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.680]   How much can we give you to get you off our backs?"
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:25.400]   And Jobs said, "It's not about money for me."
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.480]   They stole the iPhone and I want to kill them.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.080]   I'm going nuclear, what do you say,
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.800]   thermonuclear war on this?
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:37.280]   At the deconference some months before,
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:44.000]   Apple, Google said that they had a quote,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.200]   "Very, very good search partnership
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.760]   and map relationship with Apple.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.480]   Both deals have been renewed."
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.600]   I have to think looking at the way Apple has changed things
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.960]   on their phone, the most recent iPhone,
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.360]   in the addition of Siri,
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.840]   that Google's relationship with Apple is not long
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.240]   for this world.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.400]   - Which, if you'd said that to me,
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.960]   and I think you did say that six months ago,
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:08.800]   eight months ago, I would have said,
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.960]   "No, how can they do that?"
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.440]   But I think you're right now, Leo.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.800]   - I think that this is part,
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.640]   but it's part of the scorched earth philosophy.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.680]   It's not really strategically needed or necessary.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.120]   So people understand Google makes money
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:26.280]   from all platforms, including the iPhone, by search, right?
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.360]   When you, in Safari, type something
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.440]   in the default search bar, it goes to Google.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.600]   And they make ad money out of that.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.960]   But that could change.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.920]   Siri does, and I think increasingly
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.080]   will do searches for people,
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.120]   and Siri doesn't necessarily use Google.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.640]   It only uses it for web searches,
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.960]   and that, who knows how long that will last?
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.440]   - Well, and at some point, even if Siri does use Google,
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.800]   you won't know it, because Siri is gonna come back,
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.040]   I believe, soon, with a voice answered to a voice question.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.960]   - So you won't know or care, and that's the point.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:02.760]   - No, and that'll bring a whole new raft
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.080]   of copyright questions, right?
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.440]   Because you can't copyright facts.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.280]   - Oh boy.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.320]   - You can only copyright treatment.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.480]   So if Siri goes in and does a search for Google--
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.320]   - Oh boy.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.680]   - And look at some of the things that Google's doing itself,
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.560]   things like flight searches.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.240]   And you ask Siri, "Find me the next flight
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.000]   to San Francisco from Newark."
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.400]   Siri could go to Google, "Come back with the fact
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:30.400]   of United Flight 123, and never tell you
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.920]   the provenance of that fact,
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.960]   and wouldn't need to undercurrent copyright."
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.280]   - Wow, I didn't know that.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.600]   That's very interesting.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.200]   - Because you can copyright the treatment of facts,
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.280]   not the facts themselves.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.680]   - Facts is fair.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.520]   - Yeah, otherwise it's like,
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.360]   well, which is part of the problem with patenting genomes
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.200]   and such, right?
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:51.120]   But so to me, when Siri shifts to voice answers,
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:56.400]   that kills huge swabs of web media content.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.240]   And I find that really interesting.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.680]   Now of course, Google's doing its own voice thing.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.520]   - Right.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.400]   - And Siri right now is not giving you back voice replies,
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.040]   it's giving you back text replies, right?
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.200]   - Right.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.280]   Well, it gives you voice replies,
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.560]   but not for a web search, not for a fact search.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.400]   - Right.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.600]   - And it does pull up Wolfram Alpha
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.760]   on a lot of factual stuff.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.560]   They obviously have a deal with Wolfram Alpha.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.400]   - But it gives you a web page.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.400]   - It gives you a page.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.160]   And it says Wolfram Alpha, yeah.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.000]   - Right, right.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.560]   So that's there, but at some point,
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.720]   if all you want is the fact,
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.040]   and again, Google's doing this themselves.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.000]   Google's pissed off the entire travel industry
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.120]   by returning flight results now.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.360]   - Well, let's talk about that.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.440]   That's another big story this year, IATA.
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.440]   Is that IATA?
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.400]   No, IT, what is it named ITA?
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.240]   It bought.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.080]   - ITA, I think that's it.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.080]   - Yeah, I think I have a chat room,
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.600]   you'll follow us on the ITA.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.400]   - Which, so ITA was a company that aggregated
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.080]   flight information and was used by Expedia
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:00.000]   and Travelocity and Travel Agents and airlines themselves.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.600]   So when you did a search,
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.600]   they would get the information from the ITA
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.400]   and then put it on their page and allow you to buy tickets.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.480]   Google acquired the company and finally,
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.280]   the FTC approved the acquisition late this year.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.920]   And of course, immediately, Google started
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:20.720]   when you if you searched for New York City to Los Angeles,
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.760]   NYC to LA on Google,
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.120]   the first result would be a list of flights.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.440]   With links, and this isn't what's most interesting to me,
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.240]   back to the airlines.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:38.000]   So this is good for the airlines
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.840]   because it reintermediates them.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.800]   Bad for Expedia and Travelocity.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.160]   So here is an example, I did the search NYC on video,
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.360]   if you're watching our video, NYC to LA.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.200]   Flights from New York City to Los Angeles
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.920]   is the top result under the ads,
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.880]   which is the ads are for JetBlue and CheapFlights.com.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.720]   But those are ads.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:04.400]   The first actual search result is a very nicely formatted box,
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.680]   which is interactive, I can change dates.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.560]   And then I get the flights and the prices.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.600]   But if you click a link, you say, oh, you know,
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.880]   and by the way, highlighted the lowest price in bold,
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.120]   so it's quickest to I.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.360]   If you click that link, it pulls you to
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.720]   a fuller page on Google.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:27.400]   Then if you click the price,
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.960]   what happens?
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.720]   It gives me more information,
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.320]   gives me a return flight.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.680]   Maybe I don't get a booking.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.520]   Oh, there it is.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.720]   There in the red book button pulls up.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:43.040]   So in effect, I do all the stuff I would have done in orbits,
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.880]   or Expedia, or Travelocity,
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.920]   or with a travel agent on the phone on Google.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.880]   And then I get the book button.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.880]   By the way, the book button,
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.840]   if you just click it goes right to United site,
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.080]   if you click the drop down arrow, it gives you an ad.
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.680]   So if you were another airline or you were Expedia,
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.640]   you could click the ad,
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.600]   but people have to click the drop down button.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.280]   I think it's travel agencies and,
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:11.760]   actually, you know what?
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.000]   Maybe I have to get the drop down.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.440]   It looks like that's how I do it.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.280]   Interesting.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.640]   - For now. - For now.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.400]   So I'm sure there's gonna be some heat
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.680]   from lots of people over this.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.560]   - But you know, it's really interesting to raise this,
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.120]   'cause more I think about it right now,
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.560]   the more Siri, and I've said this before,
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.840]   but it just really hits me again and again,
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.160]   how it potentially dissident mediates much of search.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.040]   - Yes, it's, you hit, but you brought it up,
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.840]   you said the same thing Google's doing with airlines,
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.240]   Siri will do with the entire internet.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.680]   - Right, and with news, facts,
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.840]   and I think, oh, the commerce, right?
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:47.360]   So Siri, or its competitors, its cousins,
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.480]   become the agents we've long talked about.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:55.400]   So you say, Siri, buy me the cheapest copy of,
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.760]   oh, I don't know, public parts that you can find,
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.400]   and it knows who you are, where you are,
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.600]   where you want it, how you want it,
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.160]   and it just goes and gets it,
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.920]   and just as you don't care about the source,
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.960]   and the source of information,
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.760]   you don't care about what store they get it from.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.600]   - Right.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.440]   - As long as you get it.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.280]   - Right.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.680]   - You know, you don't care about what airline,
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.680]   I do care about what airline do,
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:14.840]   you can see it there, but at some point,
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.840]   you don't care which cab company gets you there,
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.120]   or certain other things.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.440]   - Isn't that what the internet,
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.240]   the promise of the internet was all along,
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.440]   which was friction-free commerce.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.280]   - Yes.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:27.720]   - So it destroys brand, or, yeah,
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.080]   I guess it destroys brand loyalty.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.080]   - It does.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.600]   - Well, it already destroyed it, Google,
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.120]   I mean, I learned this long since,
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.120]   when I ran a bunch of local online sites,
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.720]   I went to a focus group years and years ago now,
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:42.120]   more than I'll admit, in Cleveland, lucky me.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.280]   And no, it's actually--
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.440]   - I like Cleveland.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.000]   - Cleveland's very nice, I got you, you know,
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.040]   Cleveland, you gotta have a joke
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.560]   after we're in Cleveland, this is for quiet.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.080]   - Cleveland's like Pittsburgh.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.440]   - It's comeback, baby, but--
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.280]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.920]   I'll stop there.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:55.760]   (laughing)
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.840]   So people said, you know, we asked people
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.920]   whether they had seen some news,
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.400]   and they said, yeah, and we're just seeing it,
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.480]   they said, you know, we knew it was only our story,
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.880]   we're the only ones who had it,
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.720]   but they didn't know it was our brand.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:12.240]   Google has long been brand killer in media.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.440]   Now the net, you're rightly,
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:17.080]   it becomes a brand killer in other fields as well.
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.960]   - Which was always the promise of the internet,
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.160]   and gets us back to an argument we had on Twitter
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.320]   a few weeks ago about SOPA,
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.760]   but I will make it a larger argument,
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.840]   which is that what falls to the internet
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.960]   is old business models, old ways of doing things,
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.920]   those people are fighting like hell
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.160]   to keep the internet from doing that.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.840]   It's gonna happen anyway,
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.440]   and so I think we can see this transition happening.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.720]   There will be a lot of disruption and battles and occupy,
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.860]   and lots of things going on as a result of this,
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.440]   but this is a very much the way everything,
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.800]   we're headed in a clear direction,
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.240]   and I would say ride the horse in the direction it's going
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.240]   because-- - Yeah, I agree.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.840]   I mean, it was one thing that wasn't on a run-up,
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.400]   which was right, the occupy is a big event
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:59.440]   in the cloud today, and a big structural change
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.200]   in how society operates,
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.760]   and I say things like that that are that broad,
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.880]   and that huge people get mad at me,
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:08.720]   but I think we can look back at this year
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.760]   of cloud culture of-- - I like that.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.640]   - Going too far, which is what I do,
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.720]   but isn't occupied Wall Street,
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.320]   isn't to an extent the Arab Spring,
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.440]   the ability of people to connect and find out,
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.960]   as one analysis says,
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:26.320]   I can't remember who it was, so I won't get it wrong,
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.320]   but people, the main thing that the internet
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.080]   connectivity did was tell people that they weren't alone,
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.920]   that they never knew how many other people thought
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.560]   the same way they did, and once they could find that out,
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:38.760]   that gave them critical mass,
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.120]   and that is culture in the cloud,
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:45.040]   and this is the year of the cloud starting to have
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.880]   an architectural impact on other parts of society, I think.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.840]   - Huge, huge, I couldn't agree with you more,
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.360]   and yet we both do the same thing,
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.240]   which is take a bunch of facts and generalize
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.960]   to the point of absurdity, and then say,
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:59.480]   here's what's happening.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:00.560]   - Go.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.720]   - That's our job!
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:06.520]   - Eric Schmidt, when he was talking at,
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:10.680]   was speaking testifying in front of Congress in September,
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.880]   said that here are the principles that guide Google,
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.600]   and this was, I think, it's not new,
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.600]   but I think a very clear statement
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.920]   of what Google is all about.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.800]   One, first, always put customers first,
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.960]   certainly every company should say that.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:33.120]   Do you feel Google does that?
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:37.760]   - Generally, yes, I think Google generally tries to.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.440]   When they fail, it's that they forget that we're human,
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.280]   and it's not.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:46.960]   And so, I saw a post up the other day about a parent
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:51.280]   who was angry because Google killed the child's email address
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:55.280]   because of COPA, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act,
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.920]   and there was nowhere to get to Google to say,
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.480]   no, but I'm the parent and I want this.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.320]   What are you doing?
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.320]   And Google would say, I suspect,
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.720]   the media couldn't even get to Google on the point
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.200]   to say, well, we're following the law.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.760]   That's an example where Google is not human enough.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.600]   - It's a robot.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.240]   It's a Python script, as it is.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.920]   - That makes a lie of that, to the extent that
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:18.480]   if you go back to the Blessed Clue Train moment of silence,
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:23.120]   that markets or conversations, conversations are held by people,
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:25.920]   and too often, Google's not a person.
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.200]   That's the issue with it, but beyond that, I think,
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.800]   the culture, yes, when they test themselves,
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.600]   when they say, did we do right or did we do wrong,
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:37.880]   that's the standard that they hold up, and they've failed at it.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.200]   They've failed at it before, they'll fail at it again.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.640]   - It's difficult to do it.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.720]   - It's difficult to do it, the scale that Google's working,
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.000]   that's the problem.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.040]   How do you have a human conversation with a billion people?
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.400]   It's not easy.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.200]   And boy, I'd like to watch Google solve this
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.400]   because we all have this issue.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.360]   As anybody who's a business in the internet world
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.600]   has this issue, it's one of the reasons
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.920]   I do want to keep the audience small
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.000]   because it's already unmanageable
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.600]   in terms of one-on-one conversation.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.920]   Another, this similar thing happened with MG Seagler this week.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.920]   He set his Google+ and hence Google profile picture
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.720]   as he has for a long time on Twitter
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.680]   to a picture of him flipping the bird.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.560]   Elle Middlefinger.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:21.720]   - It's just a finger ball.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:22.760]   - It's just a finger.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:23.600]   What does it mean?
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.440]   Nothing.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.000]   It's a finger.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.480]   It's not a, it's a representation of genitalia
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.480]   but it is not genitalia.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:35.320]   Any more than my saying, the word genitalia is genitalia.
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.960]   Google not only didn't allow him to do it,
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.000]   they deleted the picture entirely.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.600]   And again, I think that's, this is where Google
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:49.320]   has a little bit of a tinier but also, I can't blame Google.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:52.360]   It's the same problem they had with the real names policy.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.040]   Their hearts in the right place,
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.960]   the devil is in the details.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.240]   Implementation is impossible.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.440]   - It's not just the detail though, Leo,
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.280]   isn't it also in the Uber principle here?
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.800]   That if Google, when people say,
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.760]   "Oh Google, there's ugly stuff on the internet
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:05.760]   and you point to it."
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.760]   Google says, "We're not in the position of editing
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.840]   the whole world and censoring or controlling the internet."
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:12.600]   So we're going to go ahead and point to it all.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:14.640]   If MG wants to come along and put his picture in there
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.600]   and nobody follows him, wouldn't that be the same?
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.920]   Google now puts itself in the position of violating
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:22.040]   that core principle on search sign.
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:22.880]   - I like it.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:25.080]   - To say we're going to edit the views
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.640]   that people have of each other in this.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.880]   - And this is where the upset is
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.280]   because Google has stayed out of it on search
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.760]   and now that they're doing social,
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.120]   they suddenly inserted themselves.
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.720]   - So they've got to pull back and have a principle.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.520]   And you know, it's true of everything we're going through
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.480]   now with internet governance and trying to figure out
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.320]   where we go.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.000]   If you do one thing, then you've got to be consistent
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.920]   in the long run of where that goes.
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.320]   And I dealt with this a lot in privacy this year,
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.440]   but it's true in areas like this too.
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:53.800]   It's true about freedom of speech
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:56.200]   within the realm of Google.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:00.800]   - Principle number two, focus on loyalty, not lock-in.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.520]   That's kind of to the same point.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:07.880]   We don't trap our users like maybe Apple does.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.280]   If you don't like the answer the Google search provides you,
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:12.320]   you can switch to another search engine with one click.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.440]   And if you want to leave other Google services,
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.440]   we make it easy to do that too.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:20.480]   Thanks to Brad Fitzpatrick and the data liberation organization,
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.640]   data liberation front.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.160]   You can even take your data with you without any hassle.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.360]   We want consumers to stay with us because we're innovating
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.160]   and making our products better, not because they're locked in.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.040]   I do like that philosophy.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:32.880]   - I like that.
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:33.720]   I think it's generally true.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.560]   The issue where people get wrong when they talk about Google
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:39.040]   and Monopoly and Google being too big and all that
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.160]   and Google's answer always is that there's an alternative
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.240]   for every service they offer.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.680]   And that's absolutely true.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.440]   The exception is where they're core businesses,
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.040]   which is advertising.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:52.680]   And if Google treats an advertiser harshly,
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.840]   the advertiser does not have anywhere else to go
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.960]   when it comes to search advertising.
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.120]   You're not gonna get the same performance.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.280]   - Very good point.
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:01.480]   - And that's where people are locked.
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:04.320]   There are true customers are locked in
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.400]   because like any company, you do want to lock in your customers.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.960]   Let's be honest.
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.720]   Now, if you treat them badly, you know, at some point,
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.720]   you look at what happened with eBay versus Amazon.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.120]   When Amazon cable, you know, they raised,
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:17.080]   eBay raised the rates, Amazon cable offered
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.400]   a couple of servers, people left.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.840]   So the question is, could anyone ever create
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:24.400]   alternative advertising services that could start to
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:28.000]   beat down Google if Google has seemed to be too controlling?
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.200]   I don't know the answer to that at all,
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.800]   but that's where their vulnerability lies
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.320]   in that principle, I think.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:37.240]   - Third, and this might be a subject for a real debate.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.160]   Be open, not closed.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.160]   Open technology includes both open source,
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.040]   meaning release and actively support code
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.040]   that helps grow the internet.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.400]   And open standards, meaning we here to accept it.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.320]   I think that's true.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:53.320]   I think actually Google does absolutely live that faith,
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.520]   even with Android, although many would say,
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.240]   no, Android's not open.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.560]   - Well, the argument always is that they don't reveal
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.120]   the algorithm, and of course,
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.120]   you and I know the answer to that.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.400]   When I interviewed Eric Schmidt, he said,
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:07.160]   and I'll be curious to see what the world thinks of this,
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:10.720]   he said that Google is as open as it can be.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.960]   - That's fair.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.560]   I think it's fairly fair, I do.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.880]   I think that they were closed the past
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.800]   when they didn't reveal things like advertising splits.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.880]   They finally turned around and did that.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:24.800]   I'm sure we could find areas where they should be more open.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:28.160]   Let's ask Siva, and I'm sure we can find out,
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:33.160]   but I think that, again, as an overall guiding principle,
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.680]   they get near it on the freeway.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:38.880]   And they did release a source code for ice cream sandwich.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.400]   At the same time as they released ice cream sandwich.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.920]   Fourth, be transparent.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.960]   This is more of the be open.
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:52.400]   And they do leave out that key element that you brought up,
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.080]   which is the secret formula for Coca-Cola.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:57.120]   It's that one ingredient that makes PageRank work.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:58.320]   - But logically, they can't do it.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.320]   - It's not competitive.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:02.360]   It's you're learning the Nigerian princes, no.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.200]   - Right.
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.520]   - Oh, that's a good point, okay.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:07.360]   Very good point.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:09.520]   It's not that somebody would then take the formula
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.280]   and make another Google.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.760]   It's that if you tell people how PageRank works,
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.240]   they will game it.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:18.280]   - Yes, because PageRank is always gonna change.
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:19.400]   PageRank is, you know,
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:22.040]   PageRank is Matt Cutz's brain, to some extent, right?
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:22.880]   - Right.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:26.480]   - And it's not a set solid thing.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.200]   It's an expertise.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.320]   It's a way of doing business, it's other things.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:33.000]   But if you let people in on the details of that,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.280]   of how it operates, then you open up the spam
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.560]   and it becomes useless.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:39.600]   You know, on Google+, this week, last week, I think,
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:43.120]   was Google started taking spam comments
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:46.400]   and graying them out so that you could come along
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.440]   if it was under your post and kill them off.
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:52.000]   But they let the world know, yeah, we know this is spam.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.640]   I almost wish they'd go ahead and just kill them off.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.800]   But they have these ways constantly
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.200]   of trying to stay the one step ahead.
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:03.080]   And you can't do that if you release all the details.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:07.440]   - And, oh, I closed the article.
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:08.600]   That was probably a mistake.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.440]   'Cause I have one more thing.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.600]   - Mm, mmm.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:13.960]   - Sleepy, dopey, grumpy.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.520]   - Yeah, I forgot the last one.
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.160]   - It's always the last one.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:20.720]   Finally, the only constant is change.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:22.680]   - Amen.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.040]   - Wait, no, that's a--
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:24.880]   - What do you say?
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:26.040]   - That's a truism, what do you say to that?
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:27.120]   - Yeah.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.960]   And I think Google, it's funny,
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:34.720]   Google is now an ancient company in internet years.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:38.440]   And I think one of the challenges Larry has going forward
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.200]   is a similar challenge they had at Microsoft,
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:43.240]   which is how do you keep innovative and entrepreneurial
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.840]   in a company of 20,000 employees?
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:50.440]   On the one hand, I think Larry,
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.960]   Microsoft has had the problem.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.560]   They did something similar to Google,
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:55.800]   which is you create small companies
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.520]   within the big company where people can act
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:01.080]   entrepreneurially and somewhat autonomously.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.880]   And certainly Google has organized that way,
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.120]   correct me if I'm wrong, because you know more than I do.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.640]   But I believe that's the Google intent.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:08.760]   The problem with that is,
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:11.440]   and Google's experienced this as has Microsoft,
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.240]   these autonomous companies can fight with each other,
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.600]   they can step on each other.
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:17.760]   There was that day this year
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:22.120]   that Google released three or four products on the same day,
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:25.000]   which a company acting as an individual
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.440]   would not have done, would have parsed them out.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:31.680]   And Microsoft's case, the inter-nysine rivalries
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:34.680]   between divisions have actually, I think,
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.560]   severely hurt Microsoft to the point
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:40.040]   where it's actually a wounded beast.
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.840]   Google's managed to avoid that,
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.240]   and I'm not sure how they do that so far.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.120]   But I think that they really do try to keep
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:49.080]   that entrepreneurial spirit alive in a big company,
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:54.240]   an old company, and that's the challenge facing Larry Page.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.440]   Very difficult to do.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:57:00.760]   I think that covers Larry's tenure
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.520]   and the reorganization that we could go through
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:04.720]   the list of things they killed,
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:08.080]   wave finally gone.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.400]   - Yeah, let me ask you one question.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.840]   Is there anything on that list that you regret?
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.040]   - That they killed?
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.280]   - Yeah.
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:15.200]   - No.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.400]   In fact, I'm having a hard time remembering the list.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.400]   At the time-- - I'm--
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:19.880]   - Pardon me?
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:21.000]   - Wave included.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.120]   - No, wave was a flop.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.080]   With all due respect to Gina, who really loved it,
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.560]   put her heart and soul into a book on it,
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:28.720]   it was clearly a flop.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:32.880]   And I think some of the technologies will survive.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.160]   They've lost the Rasmussen,
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:36.040]   the guys who did maps and then wave.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:40.080]   But Facebook's victory.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:44.960]   But I'm looking, anybody there in the chatroom,
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:48.320]   anything that Google killed that you--
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:49.160]   They did--
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:52.120]   Now Google Labs, okay, that's an interesting choice.
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:55.760]   - I think that the invention that happened
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:56.840]   at Google Labs will continue.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.200]   I don't think that's really what they killed.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.360]   - Yeah, I think that those centralized lab
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:01.240]   also becomes limiting.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.000]   Now, when I worked at Time Inc,
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.880]   they had magazine development.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.280]   And that was the department that was allowed
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:07.480]   to invent magazines.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.080]   So I came along with it at a time of a weekly
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.240]   and they said, no, no, no, no, no, we invent magazines,
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:13.240]   you can't start that.
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:15.480]   And after it was killed,
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.680]   and it had to be weekly started.
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.520]   - Right.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:18.560]   - Because you could still sprout up
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.280]   from anywhere in the company.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.320]   And so I think that, you know,
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:22.560]   when they said they were killing Google Labs,
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:23.960]   I got upset and I thought, oh, you know,
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:26.200]   there goes some of my rules about innovation.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:29.440]   But I think it actually is smarter in hindsight
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.960]   that they're allowing that innovation
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:33.480]   to occur within the divisions.
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:34.320]   - Right.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:36.680]   Somebody in the chatroom said,
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.680]   I miss Google boutiques.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:40.160]   boutiques.com,
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:41.920]   which they're now sending to catalogs and offers.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:43.360]   I think that was a sensible thing.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:44.920]   Speaking of which, I always thought boutiques
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.320]   was probably a Marissa Meyer.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.960]   - It just feels like a dozen of them.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.400]   - Yeah, she loves fashion.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.760]   Marissa spoke again at Lueb,
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.440]   but she's no longer, you know, for a while,
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.280]   I think she was seen as the front person
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.680]   in some ways for Google.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.080]   She isn't clearly not.
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.600]   She's not in that group of six that I mentioned.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.400]   - She never was a senior VP.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.760]   - But she was in the group that runs Google, right,
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.080]   for a while.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:09.520]   - But she still wasn't a senior VP.
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:10.600]   - That's true.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.080]   - And so I think that Marissa was,
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:14.680]   how do you say it in sports?
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:15.560]   Punching a barberweight?
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:16.400]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:17.240]   (laughing)
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:18.400]   - I'm both ranked.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.880]   - I kind of agree with you.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.960]   - Right, and I don't mean that in any way
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:23.000]   about Marissa herself.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.480]   I mean that about her position in the company
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:27.680]   that she was put out there because she was good at it.
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:29.120]   - You could say the same about Matt Cutts.
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:30.400]   His position isn't that high,
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.680]   but he's often chosen as a spokesperson
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.200]   because he's so good at it.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.200]   - And liked and smart.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.040]   - Right.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.920]   - And they can trust him to do it.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.760]   So I think Marissa was out there for that reason,
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.000]   but now Larry's, wait,
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:43.840]   but the irony here though,
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:46.560]   is still as we still don't hear from Larry.
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:48.680]   - Right, and I wonder if that will change.
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:50.560]   He's very shy, I think.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.560]   - Yeah, he has a million followers on Google+ now,
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:53.640]   supposedly.
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.720]   And he didn't say anything.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:56.800]   (laughing)
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:57.640]   - For a while.
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:58.640]   - And that's the pity 'cause we won in here for a while.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.280]   - Yeah, well for a while he was posting his pictures,
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:02.860]   we're all going up there after the fact.
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:07.160]   She is still local.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.760]   She's still in charge of local.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.160]   And local is still very important.
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.000]   We can't ignore it.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.600]   - Local is usually local is maps, places.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:16.280]   Yes, hugely important.
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.000]   - And I go back to the argument about the Senate
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.920]   having gone after the wrong Google,
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.280]   they're going after search when search is yesterday's war,
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.520]   that the future war is mobile, social, local.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.200]   And Marissa is on the forefront
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.040]   of one of those future priorities.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:33.140]   And local equals mobile, in many, many ways.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:36.440]   - We're gonna take a break.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.920]   Jeff Jarvis is here, the author of two great books.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.440]   I'm looking for my copy of Public Parts.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.560]   I think somebody borrowed it.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.400]   - It's okay.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.080]   - I can always hold mine up.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.640]   - Must read. - No problem at all.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.480]   - Must read.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.680]   - Yeah, have that new Kindle, that new iPad.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.520]   Well, there you go.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.360]   - There you go.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.160]   And of course, what would Google do,
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.480]   which I do have a copy of.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:58.920]   And his blog is Buzzmachine.com.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.360]   Gina Trapani has the week off she's coming home
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.960]   from her holidays and couldn't join us today,
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.560]   but she will be back next week, of course.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:09.880]   And I do want to mention that we are in the running
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:14.880]   for the best of 2011, the best tech web tech show
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.080]   that people should go to tv.com to vote.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.000]   Now the URL is long and I should have made a shortened URL
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.760]   for it, but if you Google tv.com best of 2011 web series
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.160]   tech show or something of the sort,
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.240]   you'll see, I don't know how we got in this esteem
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:36.040]   to a gust group, the candidates in this poll
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.400]   are circuits with David Pogue,
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.200]   CNET Buzz Report with Molly Wood,
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.000]   Techzilla with Patrick Norton and Veronica Belmont,
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.800]   Walt Mossberg's personal technology,
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.720]   and us.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:48.120]   - Yeah, I don't know how I got there either.
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.760]   - That's nice, that's a good, that's a heck of a group.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.800]   So I'm just gonna cast my vote for us
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.760]   and I invite you to do, well, vote your conscience.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.720]   We are winning by the way.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:59.880]   - Really?
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:00.800]   - Yeah.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.320]   - So far.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.520]   - Power of Leo, Power of Twit,
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.640]   Twit Army, March on.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.400]   - So if you like to win, if you like to be a winner,
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:14.400]   if you like to be watching a winner, please go to tv.com.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:16.520]   - And vote.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.360]   I don't normally, you know, I don't normally lobby
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.560]   for those kinds of things.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.400]   - Yeah.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.680]   - Why not?
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.520]   - Yeah, what the heck?
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.360]   - It's fun to win.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.520]   You know what, we are entering, this is wild.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.800]   I got an email from the Peabody Awards.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.280]   - Yay, long about time the industry recognizes this.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.280]   - And they have added a category for internet broadcasters.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.160]   Peabody Awards are among the most prestigious awards
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.440]   for broadcast.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.080]   - The Pulitzer of Broadcast, really?
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:48.240]   - And they specifically mentioned Tom Merr and Tech News today,
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.800]   but we are gonna enter Tech News today,
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.640]   Twig and Twit in the Peabody Awards.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.640]   And boy, I sure would love,
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.000]   now that one you don't get to vote for kids.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.840]   They've got professionals voting on that one.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:04.800]   But I sure would like to say the Peabody Award winning
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.680]   this week in global.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:08.660]   Now that's an award I'd like to win.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:12.160]   I can always, I can win any internet vote award.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.960]   All I have to do is lobby, but
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.560]   that's the one I'd like to win.
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:20.600]   This show brought to you by our friends at Netflix.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.840]   I don't have to say much about this.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.280]   I know you all know about Netflix
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:26.040]   and I invite you, look at I have a Netflix coaster.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.480]   (laughs)
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.760]   I invite you to go to Netflix.com/Twit
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.200]   and try it free for 30 days.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.440]   This is actually something I'd like to mention
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.480]   for those of you visiting family and friends.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.040]   I know everybody who watches this show
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.520]   probably already gets Netflix streaming.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.680]   It is, after all, 30% of all web traffic now.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.800]   More than 30%.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:51.160]   But maybe mom and dad, uncle Bob, sister, Sally,
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.800]   cousin Joey, maybe they don't know about it
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.760]   because they're not geeks like us.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.000]   Tell them about it, turn them on to it.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.960]   Netflix.com/Twit
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.960]   they can watch on their iPhone, iPad, Android, phone,
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:06.360]   television, Blu-ray, Xbox, gone and on,
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.760]   play at PS3.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.840]   And it's just thousands of great movies
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.960]   for just $8 a month.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.260]   What's wrong with that?
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:14.440]   Netflix.com/Twit
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.020]   give it a try if you're not a member
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.940]   and if you are tell your family, tell them.
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:23.300]   And we do not have an offer code in the UK yet,
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.460]   but they are launching in the UK.
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:26.900]   Thank you Sparky and when they do
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.700]   I'll make sure we get an offer code for you.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:32.140]   That's exciting, that's really exciting.
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:35.540]   Somebody says, as Bill in Michigan, I love Bill,
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:38.620]   he says, "As prestigious I know as the Peabody Awards are,
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.500]   "I can't help but think of Sherman
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.580]   "and the Wayback Machine when I hear Peabody,
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:43.860]   "Mr. Peabody."
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:48.020]   He was the dog with the word glasses.
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:51.420]   Thank you PC Guy, he has given us a short URL
[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.580]   for the tv.com voting page.
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:58.580]   It's a bitlyurlbit.ly/tvcom/twit
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:01.260]   TV-C-O-M-T-W-I-T.
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:04.460]   Who owns tv.com?
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:07.500]   - The chat room is trying to raise it by 5%.
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.380]   - I bet we could.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:09.740]   Chat room alone probably could,
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:10.980]   it just shows you, give us some idea
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:13.500]   of how many people have voted so far.
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.780]   I've just seen it on them, I thought tv.com was owned by AOL.
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:17.740]   I can't remember now.
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:21.380]   Maybe it is seen it, which would be funny
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:22.220]   'cause there's a seen it.
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:24.100]   - Oh, there's a number two, yes.
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:29.780]   - Google bought Motorola this year
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:32.660]   and that has been approved or not.
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:33.500]   Has that been approved?
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:34.340]   I think it was.
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:36.980]   - Not yet, I don't believe it's the most time to go.
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.660]   - That's an interesting story because of course,
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:41.820]   Motorola is one of the big Android handset manufacturers.
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:44.180]   There was some concern by the other handset manufacturers
[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:46.740]   that Motorola would have some advantage
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:48.780]   in the Android marketplace
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.820]   and Google confirmed their fears by saying,
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:53.140]   yeah, I think we'll make some phones.
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:54.940]   So the current Google phone,
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:57.220]   which is made by Samsung, the Galaxy Nexus,
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:00.900]   might be the last not made by Motorola Mobility.
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:04.060]   But what Google really got with Motorola Mobility
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:07.740]   was its patent treasure trove.
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:09.940]   They paid $4 billion,
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:13.980]   I'm sorry, they were trying to pay $4 billion
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:15.700]   for Nortell's 6,000 patents,
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:18.820]   which ended up writing to Microsoft and Apple.
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:21.740]   You need to have those patents to fight in the patent wars.
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:25.420]   They paid 12 and a half billion for Motorola Mobility,
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:26.620]   but they got, I don't know what,
[01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:29.260]   something like 20,000 patents.
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.780]   - And given our earlier conversation, Leo, about TV.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:33.340]   - Yeah, they got set to a box.
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:34.660]   - I think the set to a box thing,
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:37.420]   I underestimated the importance of that strategically.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:41.460]   It's a huge TV play because along with Cisco,
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:44.420]   Motorola makes almost, I would say,
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:46.620]   more than half of all set top boxes.
[01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:50.260]   So it's a big, big, big, big business
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.220]   and a good way to get into the home.
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:54.300]   Something Microsoft always wanted to do,
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:55.660]   never could make the deal.
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:58.500]   - Sure, I remember I was at cable labs
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:01.180]   when I was perfectly involved with the cable company years ago
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:04.460]   and Microsoft was constantly trying to get into the boxes
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:06.900]   of the industry and not succeeding.
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.460]   - So here's the list of, thanks to Eileen Rivera,
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.860]   our crack producer who's so good,
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:16.060]   of Google businesses that got the axe this year,
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:16.900]   Ardvark.
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:21.180]   What even, why can't I remember Ardvark?
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:22.660]   I'm saying, you will not miss these.
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:24.940]   We should have had a montage with a sad song,
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.260]   but just imagine if you will, a sad song
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:32.580]   and these logos that you never saw anyway
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:33.980]   floating across the screen.
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.740]   (beeping)
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:40.740]   - Google security, fast flip, Google desktop,
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:45.380]   Google pack, Google image labeler,
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:50.380]   Google notebook, side wiki,
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:52.620]   Google health, I might miss that one.
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:56.020]   Google power meter and all the Google green initiatives,
[01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:58.420]   I think, and Photovine.
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.460]   There you go.
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.540]   - Well, time, that was that one.
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:04.420]   (laughing)
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:05.420]   - Wow, that was beautiful.
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.900]   That was a moving moment in television history.
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.100]   And Google Labs, of course.
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:11.580]   - That'll get us a Peabody band.
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:12.620]   (laughing)
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:14.900]   Put that in the Peabody reel.
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:15.740]   - Smoke it.
[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:19.060]   - That's web TV, right there, kids.
[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:19.900]   - Web gold.
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:22.780]   - Yeah, they also retired app inventor,
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:26.140]   which was an easy to use way to make Android apps,
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:28.300]   but apparently nobody used.
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:29.860]   They did open source the code.
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:31.880]   We love that.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:35.340]   They also killed Nol,
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:38.780]   which was their Wikipedia, I guess,
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:40.780]   or Mahalo or something.
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:41.620]   - Right.
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:43.420]   - And Wave, we mentioned that already.
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:47.260]   I don't think any of those will be missed,
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.940]   and I think the focus is welcome.
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:50.860]   I think this is Larry's right.
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:51.700]   Let's focus.
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:52.940]   - Yep, yep.
[01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:55.500]   - Do what we do best.
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:58.580]   - Android, maybe the biggest Google story of the year,
[01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.660]   absolutely just came on strong in 2011,
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:06.660]   became a really successful competitor to Apple's iPhone,
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:10.620]   and depending on who statistics you believe,
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:13.780]   Android is beating iPhone in almost every respect,
[01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:16.940]   number of devices, installed base,
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:19.220]   number of activations a day,
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:23.940]   even in arguably the most important space, number of apps.
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:28.140]   I guess once you get past a few hundred thousand,
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.620]   it doesn't really matter.
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:33.980]   There are only a handful of Apple's iPhone apps
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:36.340]   that I don't have on my Android phone,
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:38.680]   Instagram being the one that leaps to mind.
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:43.620]   I bought the Galaxy Nexus, I bought the GSM version,
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.020]   not the Verizon version,
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:50.060]   and was, I haven't yet reviewed it on this show,
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.060]   and Gina, I'm sure, has already talked about it,
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:52.900]   I know she likes it.
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:54.740]   - You just talked about it when you got it,
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:57.060]   and then Eileen excoriated you last week.
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.140]   - Did she?
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:09:58.980]   - Yes.
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:00.700]   - She and her, Gina?
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:01.700]   - Both, both did.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.540]   - But both said how much they loved it.
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:04.700]   - Yes, and how wrong you were.
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.060]   (laughing)
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:06.900]   - Good!
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.300]   - I'm happy they are with you,
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:11.300]   and disappointed they are in you, Leo, as a result.
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:12.140]   - I guess with,
[01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:15.020]   no, I guess what I would say is this,
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.660]   like all the other Google phones is for developers,
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:18.740]   not for real people.
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:22.020]   That this, and this is the problem I see,
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.180]   I know Eileen's running in, she doesn't have a book.
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:25.020]   - That's why I love you,
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.220]   'cause you only get more trouble, he does.
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:28.060]   - She doesn't have a mic.
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:29.220]   - I think people don't understand that
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:33.060]   the Google reference phones are not necessarily
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:35.540]   the popular phone.
[01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.380]   These are for developers who want to
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.860]   play in Google experience, developer menu.
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.740]   - Are you saying that the manufacturers
[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:42.740]   and the phone companies improve them
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.700]   with their stuff they have with them?
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.220]   - Well, I think you could make the case
[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:48.540]   for maybe HTC Sense.
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:52.340]   I like Samsung TouchWiz, I know some people don't,
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:54.180]   but you're right, if you don't want any
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:57.700]   craft from the manufacturer,
[01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:59.340]   you still get carrier craft, by the way,
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:00.220]   on the Verizon version,
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:03.020]   but this unlock GSM version has zero craft,
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.300]   nothing from manufacturers, nothing from carrier,
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:08.100]   'cause there is no carrier, it's a carrier-free phone.
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:11.180]   I, here's my, here are my issues.
[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:14.900]   One on the phone, and it's just a personal issue,
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:16.540]   it's a pen tile display.
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:20.380]   I see significant color noise on any solid color,
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:23.020]   particularly white, it's disrupting,
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:26.380]   I don't think it's fair to call it a 1280 by 720 display
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.340]   because of the way they use sub-pixel rendering.
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:30.700]   It's a technical argument, it's an argument
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:33.140]   many people won't see, before you buy this phone,
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:35.260]   look at a white screen, best way to do it,
[01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:36.780]   probably is open the messaging app,
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:39.460]   if there are no messages, you'll see a big white screen,
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:42.100]   and if you don't see pixelation and color noise
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:45.580]   in that display, then go ahead, by all means, buy it,
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:48.300]   'cause it is a high-res display,
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:51.100]   and I just don't think it's as good
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:53.620]   as many of the other choices out there.
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:55.580]   - Doing my aging eyes, what bothered me
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:57.500]   was when you said that the type just gets small.
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:00.980]   - Well, and that can be fixed by a proper application
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:04.820]   development, but it is, whenever you go to higher resolution,
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:08.660]   people need to understand, higher resolution means smaller.
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:11.100]   I'm not a fan of the pen tile display.
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:14.580]   You can buy, and I have ordered from Samsung
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:17.100]   a bigger battery, a much bigger battery,
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.780]   which I think they decline to put in here,
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:21.300]   'cause it does have, makes the profile,
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:23.460]   which is very thin right now, thicker,
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:24.620]   but I think with the bigger battery,
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:26.300]   battery life won't be a problem.
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.460]   And the other issue I had, and this really is the,
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:31.460]   for this show, the big, you know, debate is,
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.900]   I think ice cream sandwich is mistaken.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:35.900]   I think Google's making a big mistake on this.
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:38.580]   What they, in one respect, in one respect only,
[01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:40.580]   I like the new camera app, it's great.
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:43.820]   I like the new calendar and context apps, they're great.
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:44.700]   I'm not talking about the apps,
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:46.740]   I'm talking about the operating system itself,
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.900]   the decision to go with soft buttons,
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:51.620]   to move the search button to the top of the screen
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:54.420]   where it takes up real estate and cannot be removed.
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:58.820]   And the fact that these buttons
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:01.860]   take up, not only take up screen real estate,
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:05.060]   so the so-called big display really isn't any bigger
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:07.100]   than any other phone, because you've got
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:08.460]   these inches lost here.
[01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:11.940]   I think this is the soft button, things a huge mistake.
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:15.660]   So maybe ice cream sandwich will be great on older
[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:17.540]   Android phones, which will have physical buttons
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.540]   and will work with ice cream sandwich.
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:21.340]   I think the losing the search button
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:24.660]   and the menu button at the bottom is crazy, crazy.
[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:27.820]   This is a tablet operating system badly ported
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.660]   to a smaller form factor.
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:31.380]   That's, of course, just my opinion.
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:34.500]   But I think it's something people should consider
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.540]   before they run out and say, oh, this great phone,
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:39.420]   which is $300 I want it, I want it.
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:42.140]   I think Google might have made a mistake on Honeycomb.
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:46.180]   But Google's never been the king of UI design.
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:47.300]   - No, no.
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:49.060]   - And I think it's showing, frankly.
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:50.020]   I think they should try.
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:52.500]   I know there's a limited number of great UI designers
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:53.420]   in the world.
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:56.260]   Maybe they all work for Apple and Facebook, I don't know.
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:58.660]   But I think Google needs to find one quick.
[01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:02.700]   - So Leo, if Android, as you said,
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:03.860]   came on really strong this year
[01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:06.660]   and really got Google into mobile and local
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:09.460]   and devices and all of that, right?
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:12.020]   And then along comes Google Plus later in this year
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:14.180]   where they are trying to get into social.
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:17.180]   I hate predictions, but where do you think Google might
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:19.300]   or should go next strategically?
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.020]   If they're gonna do a limited number of things,
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:23.340]   what's the next big thing in that list?
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:25.340]   - I think one thing that they need to acknowledge
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:28.940]   about Android is that it is succeeding
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:31.660]   as I think the low end smartphone.
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:35.900]   It's penetrating the low end of the market more
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:37.460]   than it is, I think the high end of the market.
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:39.580]   I think Apple's iPhone continues to own that.
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:42.900]   Google probably doesn't care, they just want traffic
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:43.740]   and they're gonna get it.
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.980]   They're gonna get a billion users any day now.
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:50.380]   Android, and especially in markets
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:52.100]   where smartphones are too expensive,
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:53.940]   Android is gonna be a great choice.
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:57.580]   You might be surprised by, analysts have already said this
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:58.940]   and I pooped for a long time,
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:01.380]   but I wouldn't be surprised to see Windows phone
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:04.620]   take some market share once it comes out on Nokia.
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:06.940]   I think Nokia is gonna make a strong run for it.
[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:09.820]   Although, if I were Blackberry at this point,
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:12.700]   I'd sure look at Android or Windows phone.
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.540]   I'd sure get out of that business.
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:15.740]   What should Google focus on?
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:17.220]   I don't know, that's a good question.
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:19.540]   You sure if you go back to the Four Horsemen?
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:23.980]   - Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon.
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:25.660]   - Amazon, retail?
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.340]   - No, I think that would be a mistake.
[01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:31.780]   I think in some respects, Google might be making a mistake
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:34.900]   focusing so much on content.
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:36.980]   I think YouTube is, in some ways,
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:41.180]   this is gonna be controversial, a liability for Google.
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:43.740]   Because YouTube, unfortunately,
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:46.460]   because they're trying to make these content deals,
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:51.460]   to me represents the pro-sopa forces.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:52.300]   It represents the--
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:53.220]   - It puts them in channel conflict.
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:54.540]   - It puts them in channel conflict.
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:58.300]   I think that this is actually not a good thing for Google.
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:01.060]   So if I were gonna focus, this is very controversial.
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:02.740]   I would dump YouTube.
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:07.740]   - Wow, whoa, whoa, what would they lose if they gave it up?
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:09.780]   - Well, as somebody pointed out in the chat room,
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:13.180]   they're certainly getting a lot of those Google+ signups
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:15.660]   from YouTube because you have to create a Google account
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:17.420]   to have a YouTube account now.
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:21.500]   I'm sure they're giving up revenue,
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.260]   but it's a crappy kind of revenue.
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:25.540]   In order for Google to succeed with YouTube,
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:29.540]   they have to put in very annoying ads
[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:33.500]   on top of the video, pre-roll, we'll come soon.
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.620]   - Right, so you go back to Louis CK.
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:40.260]   The fact that there are Louis CKs out there that exist,
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:41.860]   he's almost sufficient for Google.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:44.980]   Just the fact that there are newspapers and book publishers
[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:48.060]   and bloggers and all that is good for Google.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:49.860]   As long as there's content out there and growing,
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:50.900]   that's what they really need.
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:52.220]   Is that the argument?
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:53.500]   - Yes.
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.020]   Let somebody else do YouTube.
[01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:55.980]   You don't need it, Google.
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:57.740]   And it's gonna put you in channel conflict.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:00.980]   It's already putting you in, I'm sorry to say,
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:02.780]   but putting you in the devil's corner
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:04.180]   when it comes to content.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:06.660]   And--
[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:08.660]   - They're not getting revenue from it that's significant.
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:09.500]   - Well, I don't know.
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.340]   That's one thing I don't know.
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:11.980]   - You're not getting profit from it.
[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:13.780]   - Yeah, it's gotta be hugely expensive.
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:18.620]   They didn't spend that much for it.
[01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:20.420]   It looked like a lot at the time,
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:23.020]   but now with Motorola 12 and 1/2 billion,
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:26.180]   YouTube was just a few billion dollars.
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:28.500]   I personally would spin it off, sell it,
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:29.900]   spinning it off is probably the best thing.
[01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:31.540]   In fact, I'll make a prediction.
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:32.780]   I would not be at all surprised
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:35.740]   and I think they will spin off YouTube this year.
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:36.580]   - Well, that's interesting too,
[01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:38.500]   is that also, yeah, that does a few things, right?
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.500]   That puts it at arm's length.
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.260]   They can still own a big piece of it.
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.540]   And it starts to deal with the anti-trust stuff,
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:45.740]   which I don't think should come up
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:46.980]   but is going to come up inevitably
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:48.900]   'cause Google is too big.
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:50.580]   - Yeah.
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:51.980]   - Make Google smaller.
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:54.940]   - I mean, the whole thing was about focus, right?
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:57.180]   - So if you want to focus,
[01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:00.500]   what is, I think, a big part of Google right now
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:04.620]   that is drawing focus in the wrong direction it's YouTube?
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.340]   - All right, so play it one step further.
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:09.460]   If Google didn't fully own YouTube,
[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:12.860]   does that help their cause with the networks in Google TV?
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:14.300]   - Or not.
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:15.180]   - Well, isn't that interesting
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:17.460]   'cause it sure hasn't helped them now.
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.620]   - But they don't have it.
[01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:19.780]   If they're not seen as competitors.
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:21.900]   - They can't get any worse.
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:24.780]   - Google is merely a discovery mechanism for video.
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:25.820]   - Don't you like it better?
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:28.260]   - Or so foolish not to be discovered by that matter.
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:29.820]   - Don't you like it better?
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:31.740]   I already think that somewhat,
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:33.300]   Google, YouTube is being treated
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:35.900]   as an arms length partner already.
[01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:37.580]   I think that the people who work at YouTube
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:41.580]   do not consider themselves Googlers into some degree.
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.700]   - And offices are crappy.
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:47.260]   - Yeah, I think this is gonna happen.
[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:48.700]   - No, it's really, I've never heard of it before.
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:49.780]   That's very interesting, though.
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:50.900]   - And it should happen.
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:53.140]   So that's my thought.
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:54.020]   How about you?
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:55.500]   What would you do?
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.180]   What would Jarvis do?
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:59.580]   - I think, I'm gonna go back to retail.
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:00.940]   'Cause I think there's an opportunity
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:02.220]   not to become a retail company,
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:05.540]   but to start to disintermediate retail like mad.
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.620]   That in an era of price transparency,
[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:09.540]   in an era that we said earlier of Siri
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:12.860]   or Google equivalent being able to just buy you something.
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:15.900]   When I talked with Philip Kaplan,
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:18.860]   Pud who was then working closely with...
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:22.940]   - Ah, what's the name of his company?
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:26.020]   - The one where you could put up what you bought.
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.860]   - Yeah, I know, 'cause I was a big...
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:28.700]   - Blippi.
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.980]   - Blippi, fan of that.
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:34.140]   - No, part of his strategic view was that at some point,
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:36.300]   everybody says where they buy stuff.
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:38.300]   Blippi then knows where the cheapest one is.
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:40.540]   And it disintermediates all of shopping
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:41.940]   because you go in and say, "Hi Blippi,
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:43.180]   I'd like an agency to buy a keep."
[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:45.420]   Blippi says, "I know where to get to 150 cents."
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:47.020]   Okay, I don't care, just get it to me.
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:48.140]   - Right.
[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:50.460]   - And so good Google do that?
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:52.780]   - Better than Blippi, yeah.
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:54.340]   - The problem with Blippi is you had to give them
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:56.540]   your credentials and then your purchasers are exposed.
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:58.700]   It just really felt to people like,
[01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:00.740]   I'm giving away to you.
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:02.540]   - And give a content issue and more about reviews
[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:04.380]   and all that, but I think Google can get more on that.
[01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:06.740]   - So Facebook can do that and probably will.
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:08.700]   I suspect Google will as well in response.
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:13.180]   - So could Google network every retailer
[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:15.180]   other than Amazon in the country
[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:18.420]   and let them compete for purchases
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:20.340]   that Google brings to them?
[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:22.580]   - So this is, to go back to that argument I made
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:24.460]   about the Ola Cart music thing.
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:26.940]   The way Steve Jobs was able to convince the music labels
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:28.420]   to do something that they thought was in there,
[01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:29.300]   not in their interest.
[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:31.780]   They made a lot of money selling aggregated albums
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:33.500]   because there was only one good cut on there
[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:36.300]   and they were able to sell all these other bad cuts.
[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:38.180]   - That was good while it lasted.
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:42.220]   Steve Jobs argument, you know, there were a number of reasons
[01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:43.460]   he was able to do this.
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:45.780]   One is 'cause they thought Apple what big deal.
[01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:48.300]   It's never gonna be a big player.
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:49.420]   We'd have to worry about them.
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:52.980]   So part of it was stealth, he sandbagged him.
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.700]   But I think he also was able to make the argument,
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:57.220]   look, you're gonna get killed by piracy.
[01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:59.900]   You've gotta come up with a solution.
[01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.580]   People able to click 99 cents.
[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:04.700]   It's an easier one click deal.
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:06.580]   I think Google needs a similar argument
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:07.740]   to get this to happen.
[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:09.300]   Same thing with television networks.
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:10.460]   They need a similar argument.
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:11.940]   They need to be able to go to the networks,
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:15.140]   they need to be able to go to retailer channels and say,
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:16.860]   and I don't know what this argument is,
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:19.220]   but it's gonna happen anyway.
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:21.220]   The internet's gonna get you.
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:24.860]   You might as well ride the horse in the direction it's going
[01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:27.380]   and we will give you a way to do that
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:30.340]   so that you have a business model going forward.
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:35.340]   That's to me where Google ultimately can own the world.
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:39.460]   - Google becomes the true biggest platform company
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:40.300]   there is. - Absolutely.
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:41.300]   - And that's what it really is.
[01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:42.140]   - Absolute, - Plaidful,
[01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:42.980]   - to advertise this platform. - Plaidful,
[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:43.820]   - Plaidful, - for knowledge.
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:44.660]   - Absolute. - Plaidful,
[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:48.180]   - for, - for geography,
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:49.700]   - location, all kinds of things.
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:52.060]   - There it is. We figured it out.
[01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:54.460]   - There we go. - Jeff Jarvis,
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:55.860]   you see, when we get together,
[01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:57.020]   when the great minds get together,
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:57.860]   we've solved this.
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:21:59.620]   I hope Eric, Larry, Sergey,
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:00.860]   I hope you're listening.
[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:01.940]   (laughing)
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:02.780]   We'll take the start.
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:04.460]   And by the end of next year, we'll be saying,
[01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:06.460]   see, we'll be playing that clip
[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:07.980]   and saying, see, Google figured out.
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:09.620]   We told him what to do.
[01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:10.780]   Jeff Jarvis is the author of
[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:12.140]   What Would Google Do and his new book
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:15.100]   Just Out in Paperback, Public Parts, right?
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:16.380]   No, no.
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:17.900]   What would Google do is in paper?
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:19.820]   This isn't, this isn't paperback.
[01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:20.980]   Public Parts is still in hard cover,
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:22.940]   but of course I'm kindling.
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:24.700]   And Audible, right?
[01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:25.540]   - Audible too.
[01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.860]   Audible, I think, has a deal today on what we will do.
[01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:29.700]   And by the way, I put up links of my blog
[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:32.580]   to where to buy the books for kindle and all that
[01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:33.740]   on Christmas day.
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.620]   And some people thought that was rather crass of me,
[01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:37.980]   but have my book. - Not at all.
[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:42.100]   This, now just understand that when an author
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:45.700]   publishes a book, the publisher gives him
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:47.820]   a tiny little royalty.
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:50.180]   You know, something like 10% of half the cover price
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:51.620]   is fairly typical.
[01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:54.100]   Because the publisher only gets half the cover price.
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:55.420]   The bookstore charges a cover price,
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:56.540]   publisher gets half of that.
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:58.220]   And then the publisher takes this percentage,
[01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:01.820]   usually five, 10, 15, if you're a lucky percent of that
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:03.180]   and gives it to the author.
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:06.900]   Meanwhile, Amazon gives you, what is it?
[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:09.980]   5% of the cover of the price they sell it for?
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:10.820]   - Yeah.
[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:12.460]   - In addition to what you're already getting
[01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:15.540]   for your publisher, this is a completely legitimate way.
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:18.940]   If you love Jeff, it doesn't cost you anymore.
[01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:20.140]   He just gets more money.
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:22.940]   If you buy his books from those links,
[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:24.500]   I'm presuming you use the Amazon.
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.780]   - I just use the Amazon one, yeah, that's all.
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:28.500]   I didn't mean to go for the super plug here, but.
[01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:31.220]   - No, you know, that's, look it.
[01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:34.460]   It, can I tell you what a huge difference
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:36.100]   to the bottom line it makes if you click that?
[01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:38.340]   And this is good for every author.
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:41.140]   If you buy the books to the Amazon associate code
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:43.140]   that the author has on their webpage,
[01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:44.740]   it costs you no more money,
[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:48.420]   but they will get like three times more money.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:51.540]   - You know that Best Buy has an API
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:53.660]   so that you can part your own store on top of it?
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:54.500]   - Oh, that's neat.
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.700]   - I would love to see the Twit store.
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:57.580]   - Okay.
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:59.740]   Well, we put our recommendations for products.
[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:00.580]   - Exactly.
[01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:01.420]   - That's a great idea.
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:04.420]   - And if you're gonna buy them, buy them through a Twit.
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:07.060]   - I had more energy, I would be doing that.
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:08.540]   - You have no have 19 people.
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:09.380]   - I know.
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:10.220]   - It's one of their jobs.
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:11.220]   - If they had more energy, I would.
[01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:12.660]   (laughs)
[01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:13.780]   They're taking the week off,
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:14.740]   but that's a very good,
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:15.580]   we actually looked at that.
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:16.420]   Amazon does something similar.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:17.340]   You can make an Amazon,
[01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:19.140]   we could make an Amazon Twit store,
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:22.380]   and then we'd get associate fees for all of that stuff.
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:25.020]   It'd probably be a significant amount of revenue,
[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:27.180]   especially now that Amazon's made a deal with California
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:30.140]   so that we can make my associate revenue again.
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:33.940]   Jeff, always such a pleasure.
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:35.780]   - As always, I mean, it's such an honor
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:37.300]   to be on the show and a rommer to be around you
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:39.380]   and the Twitter army and a great year,
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:40.580]   and I look forward to next year.
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:41.420]   - Thank you.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:42.260]   - Jeff Jarvis.
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:43.460]   - Yes, we miss you.
[01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:44.460]   - We'll see you next week.
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:45.380]   - Yes, we'll be back.
[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:49.900]   We do the show at one PM Pacific, four PM Eastern time.
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:51.460]   - On the 11th, we're doing something different.
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:53.220]   We're doing the 11th show on the 9th.
[01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:55.140]   - Oh, because of the CES, we're moving it.
[01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:57.420]   - So on Monday the 9th, just so people know their dance.
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:24:59.940]   - So we will still do it, and I will be here for that.
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:00.860]   - And I will too.
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:02.380]   - And we, of course, make this show available
[01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:05.300]   in audio and video, high quality video,
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:07.660]   as well as smaller files for those of you
[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:10.180]   on bandwidth constraints or on smaller devices.
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:11.980]   At twit.tv, that's the place to get it.
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:14.340]   Do subscribe, that way you'll get every issue.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:15.660]   You won't miss an episode.
[01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:19.820]   TWIT.TV, thank you, JJ.
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:20.660]   - Thank you, sir.
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:23.460]   - Happy new year, and we'll see you next week on Twig.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:26.040]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.620]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:31.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.780]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:36.360]   (upbeat music)
