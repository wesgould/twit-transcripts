[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Having a whole bunch of fun.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   We're having a whole bunch of fun as well. We're planning to, for the next little bit,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   join us as always, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   This is a lot of stuff here. I didn't put all this in, but I'm going to do my best to say it.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Buzzmachine.com, the Leonard Toe, professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism

[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   at the City University of New York.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   That's me.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And this is my new Google Home device, which is talking to me, so I apologize.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I'll turn it on by my mic.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Yeah, and I think you're going to like that device.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Literally just unboxed the Lenovo Smart Display, so you haven't even had a chance to play around with it yet.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Soon.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Hey, there it is.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Fancy, fancy.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Also joining us, Stacey Higginbotham, creator of the IOT podcast at IOTpodcast.com
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   and the Internet of Things newsletter at StaceyOnIOT.com.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I feel like we need to have a bunch more stuff for a really wide, lower third for you to equal.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   No, I am good.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I don't want to -- I'm not dressed as well as Jeff.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I don't want to equal him in title link.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I'm good.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Well, it's good to see you guys.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It's been a little while, and I always enjoy getting the chance to do this show with you, so thank you.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I vote for Goddess of the Internet of Things.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   This is the ballroom, sir.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   That works?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   That is my title, actually.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Were you not aware of that?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Straight to the point and true.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   You pray to me when things break, and I do nothing.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Right, because it's the Internet of Things, there's only so much that we can even do really.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Yes.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Let's be honest.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I just tell you to reboot.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Well, why don't we start with the Internet of Things, because that device, Jeff, that you just
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   unboxed and you started setting up, that's running on Android things.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Did you know that?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I do.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   But I have to explain what that means to me, because I just --
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Well, it's like a stripped down, more specialized version of Android specifically made for IOT
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   implementations.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   But what you'll notice when you're playing around with the UI on that is that it's very much
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   in line with Google's new direction of user experience and UI.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   It doesn't look like Android necessarily.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   It kind of has its own thing going, but along their kind of style guidelines, it's really
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   nice.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And it comes with additional support, and so it's not still crazy long support, but it's
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   still really long support, but you'll have it for a little bit longer, and that's good,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   because these devices shouldn't die.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Some of them won't die after three years, for example.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Let's hope not.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So what all can I do with this wonderful little thing?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Can I watch this again?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Okay.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   You can.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   So Kevin bought one, and we talked about it on our show earlier today.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   So I can tell you, if you would like to know, all the things that Kevin has done with his 36
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   hours of the device.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Kevin is a show off, but that's okay.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Yes.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.280]   He is the most delightful show off.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.200]   So he connected it to his YouTube TV account.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.840]   So he watched CNN.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.640]   He said he could voice control it.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.320]   So he would say turn to channel 10 on CNN or turn to channel 10 on YouTube TV, and it
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.320]   would work.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.800]   Netflix is built in, so you can say, Hey, watch, you know, nailed it on Netflix, and
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.320]   that'll happen.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.360]   YouTube works.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.880]   It's also a Chromecast.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.400]   And here's my favorite thing.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.160]   You can set it up to Chromecast, your Google photos.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.480]   Sorry, not Chromecast.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.720]   You can set it up to show your Google photos when it's like in neutral mode.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.040]   So off, but not really off.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.440]   So those are all really cool things.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.480]   And then it ties into your, if you have a Nest doorbell or a Nest camera, it's going
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.480]   to tie into those.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.680]   So you can say, Hey, show me the front door and it will.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.960]   But there's like a six to seven second delay.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.640]   But it does if this is in your kitchen or whatever, which I think is kind of the kind
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.360]   of the default like, what do I do with this?
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.520]   It seems like a great kitchen device, right?
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.080]   If you're in the kitchen, you're cooking, maybe you want to watch something or maybe
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.040]   you want a recipe is always another big use case for something like this.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.040]   Looks really nice.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.040]   Okay.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.040]   What's the news?
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.360]   You're the latest news.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.680]   Prepare yourself.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.640]   Prepare yourself for the latest news.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.840]   Take a deep breath, Jeff.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.840]   I don't know.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.840]   I don't want that.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.840]   No, stop.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.840]   I don't want that now.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.840]   Stop me.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.520]   And you'll, as you, as you play around with it, you'll get kind of more used to it took,
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.000]   it took me a little getting used to last night on all about Android, the kind of swipe
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   actions from the side to get to different pieces of information that it can surface
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.680]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.720]   But now, now it's like in the back, how do I, it's in the background playing me this?
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.720]   I don't want it.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   Tell it to stop.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.720]   Hey, stop.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.720]   Oh, that's right.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720]   Hey, stop.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.720]   I feel so powerful.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   You did that, Jeff.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.720]   Congratulations.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.720]   I do.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.720]   I'm only because Stacy told me.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:07:00.720]   I'm going to do the dad.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.960]   I'm calling these dad hands or Jeff hands from now on because that's the exact same thing
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.720]   I do when something I'm like, God, what do I do?
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.640]   Oh, my favorite thing you do, Stacy, is when you get excited when you do the, ooh, ooh,
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.640]   yeah.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.320]   I'm going to get excited about stuff later today because I was at Google's cloud conference
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.480]   last week and those were those.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.040]   Yeah, it's exciting.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.040]   Okay.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.920]   Someone in the chat room asked if it works with ring.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.640]   It doesn't work with ring yet.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.120]   So it is a bummer ring, of course, sponsor on the network.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.720]   But that would be, I wouldn't want to use it for in the kitchen.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.800]   That's one of the things I can do.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.600]   I can find calm.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.600]   I lost it about 40 years ago.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.600]   I can find calm.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.600]   I don't think Google's going to help you with that, Jeff.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.600]   I can play.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.600]   What is it doing?
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   You find noises.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.680]   They're like white noise and stuff.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:00.000]   That's incredibly irritating and will not make me calm.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.480]   Jeff, I think something might be wrong with your Lenovo Smart to Spy.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.480]   Stop that.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.560]   Don't ever do that again, Jeff.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.440]   Can it go portrait to landscape or is it one way?
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.440]   Oh, it's close to when we do video call.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:26.960]   Let me see if I can, I'll show it once the call is made because it shows information on
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.960]   the screen.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.520]   I don't want to show your number or all the people in my contacts list.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.520]   Let's see here.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.880]   So I'll put in just like this.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.080]   Bam calls anyway.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.400]   So oh, it says I have to invite you.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.320]   Okay.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.080]   You called me a minute ago.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.520]   Well no, I went into duo and it's in order to call Jeff.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.520]   It said I had to invite you.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.960]   That's because I'm trying to call you from.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.200]   Add me on duo.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   Okay.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.200]   Add me on duo.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.200]   Use this.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   I'll just call your number.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.040]   I did it through the contacts this time and for whatever reason it.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.040]   Okay.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.040]   So give me a second here.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.040]   Fire.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.720]   Yeah, it just takes me to hangouts now.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.720]   That's weird.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.520]   It worked before.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.520]   Phone number.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.520]   Okay.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.440]   This is the story of the Internet right here.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.120]   See, it just works every time.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.440]   Oh, hey, now it's working.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.200]   Now it's coming into my phone, but it's not coming into the duo, into the thing.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.200]   It's not.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   Oh, what?
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.640]   Oh, you probably haven't hooked your phone up to the duo.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.800]   So it knows your number.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.800]   Does the do it?
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   Did you when you signed up on the show?
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   I think it did it.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.640]   It's a whole map.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.640]   Okay.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.640]   Then.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.120]   Jeff, I'll call you.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.920]   Yeah, so I just put my number into the doc chat.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.720]   Hold on one more thing.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.640]   We'll take that and we'll see if that works.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.200]   Explore more things you can do.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.200]   Where's make a call?
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   Oh, I see.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   I just tell it, right?
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   Yes.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.200]   Hey, G call Jason Howell.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   I wonder if that'll work.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   Okay.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.200]   Oh, hey.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:07.600]   Hey, call make a call.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.000]   I don't know how to call make a call.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.360]   Okay.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.360]   Make a call.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.680]   What do you want to call?
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.440]   So now I say Jason.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.400]   I might not be saved.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.960]   You're not like, I can't just put a number in.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.960]   You should be able.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.200]   So I can dial from Google Home.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:34.400]   I can say, okay, call blah blah five one two five five five six six eight.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.400]   Hold on.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   I'm not a good idea.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.920]   I'm a good idea.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.520]   And we can we can just wait for it to happen.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.400]   See these on show demonstrations always work.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.000]   Well, this is how people can see the learning curve.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.600]   They're like, Oh, oh, Google actually dialed that for me.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.840]   Oh, like, someone's talking to me.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.400]   Thankfully it was just a five five five like fake number.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.520]   At least you didn't say 911.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.080]   That would have been awkward.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.480]   It's giving me a few notes first telling me emergency numbers aren't available.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.720]   Okay, good.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.640]   All right.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.400]   So I'm waiting once I start to see something here.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.760]   I'll let you.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.080]   I'm getting a I'm getting a notice on my pixel book.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.080]   I'm not getting.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.320]   Oh, no, I'm getting a private call number or private incoming call.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.960]   That's not duo.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.600]   Oh, that took me to phone.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.600]   That's you.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.080]   Hi, but it's only audio.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.080]   There's no video.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.080]   Oh, it's a call call.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.080]   How's it going?
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.800]   Yes, this is the I'm I'm very confused.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.080]   I need to find some calm.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.720]   I think we all need to find some calm.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.520]   I'm going to hang up on you now.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.720]   Oh, my gosh, you guys.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.160]   So it just it just works.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.320]   I really want this to work.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.320]   I want to see.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.320]   I want to see the video.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.600]   I want to see how I can force it from my end.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.880]   Like I yeah, it must there must be some sort of like account setup on your side to allow
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.800]   a coming calls to it.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:18.080]   I can call Kevin TOEFL on his on his screen if he will.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.160]   He'll answer on the screen if he's there, but I don't know.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.880]   I'm going to try one more time, Jeff.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.520]   See if the see if the call comes through on your.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.520]   Huh?
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.920]   No, I came through on my phone.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.240]   Well, at least we saw a call complete.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.840]   At least we have this.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.880]   Yeah, so just works the way it's the way it was never intended.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.880]   It is verticals.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.520]   I can't fit in dead hands.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.480]   Well, you should flip your thing to the side is your thing landscape or portrait.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.240]   Well, so this is on the phone.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.200]   This is not on the phone is not as great of it.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:13:00.240]   So if you go to Kevin's Twitter account, you can see he and I using duo if you want to
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:06.720]   it the when you put it in landscape mode, you look a little wider than you are.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.800]   Oh, no, I don't need that now.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.640]   But that's on the bigger one.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.200]   I don't know if the other one does it.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.960]   You get a finer resolution on that one.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.640]   So obviously the if you're getting one of these for yourself and you plan on making
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.600]   video calls, you're probably not going to jump right on a podcast two seconds after
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.440]   you unbox it.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.160]   And so you're probably going to have better luck than we had just then.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:34.120]   I'm guessing there must have been some sort of setup process that we missed.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.640]   I just kind of assumed if you logged in with your account and do as tied to your account
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.760]   that it would work, but then at the same time, your Lenovo smart display is not tied to
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.760]   your phone number.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.920]   And if I remember correctly, when duo launched, that was its big thing was it's secure because
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.320]   it's tied to you like you don't use your Google account.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.840]   You use your phone number.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.520]   Did that get changed at some point?
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.400]   It must have in order to enable this.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.960]   Talking through like a smart.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:03.840]   No, no, because you actually give it your phone number like so my Google assistant.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.840]   Oh, hold on.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.840]   I just said.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.840]   I just want to ask my phone number in the app.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.840]   Wow.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.840]   Free calls.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.840]   Okay.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.840]   So let me try to go allow free calls.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.840]   Oh, okay.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.680]   Yeah, because you don't if you don't want this because people can video call you you get
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.600]   the chance to not accept it, but.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.600]   Okay.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.960]   So allow free calls is now activated.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.960]   Is that right?
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:35.480]   I'm wondering if once it is just let me know when I should try again and I will Jeff.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   I just called you.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.120]   I'm just dialing you now.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:43.920]   Oh, no again, I'm getting it from a phone incoming Wi-Fi call.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.920]   Is there a video?
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.920]   Hello.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.920]   Hello.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.040]   Thank you for calling this week in Google.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.040]   This is Jason.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.560]   So do you have to do a lot on your phone?
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.280]   Jason, we're you on the.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.280]   Okay.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.840]   We're you on the show.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.920]   Were you hosting the time we called customer support at Google?
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.920]   Yes.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.920]   Yes.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.400]   That was one of our greatest moments ever.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.400]   That was fantastic.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.360]   If we do say so ourselves, let me try calling you then because for whatever reason that's
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.560]   not working, but now that you've set that up, maybe my incoming call will appear.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.560]   Nope.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.560]   It's coming on the phone.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.560]   All right.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.560]   I don't know.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.200]   I think I think I think we have to abort.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.040]   I don't know if it's going to work, which is weird.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.240]   Watch, watch, watch.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.200]   It doesn't work because it's my apps account.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.560]   Oh, oh, that might.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.560]   No, no, it shouldn't have any impact.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.560]   That was a joke.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.360]   I wouldn't be surprised though.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.160]   Seriously, history seems to make that a possibility.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.160]   All right.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.360]   Apparently that's not going to happen.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.520]   I would like everyone to know that within a few moments of unboxing his, Kevin and I
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.760]   did complete a perfectly acceptable duo call.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.760]   Apps account.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:08.160]   I have an apps account, but it's based on phone numbers and it rang me on my duo.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.760]   I got to, it pops up.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.360]   It's like, will you accept a duo call from Kevin?
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.360]   Let me try this.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   Let me try this.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.360]   Let me try.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:23.240]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.240]   One more time.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.240]   Just one more time.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.240]   I'm going to say make a video call.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.240]   Oh, yes, please.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.240]   Yeah, please.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.400]   That would be the way to go.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400]   Cross and fingers.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.600]   Especially since you're dressed so well.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.400]   All right.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.000]   So yes, we'll see it.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.720]   We'll see how this goes.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:45.880]   He's firing off the command to the Lenovo smart display.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.280]   I'm still looking at myself and my Google.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.680]   Sorry, something went wrong.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.440]   Try again in a few seconds.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.000]   Don't you love that?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.640]   I think I want everyone to know if you're listening to this later that we did actually
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:01.720]   sort of try this before we started the show.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.560]   I think we thought we were better set up.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.560]   We actually were.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.880]   I mean, you know, it should work.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:13.560]   I would imagine if you log into your account and you then fire up the video call, you know,
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.240]   software that's that's on the device, you'd think it would work.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.040]   Apparently, I feel like it might work.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.800]   I mean, now I'm I almost want to buy one just to take it back on the plane with me just
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:29.000]   to see if I can make it work because I feel pretty confident that there's some user error
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   happening.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   So it's interesting.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Do you want to?
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Oh, hey, Stacy.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.320]   I feel like there's a lot of variables here and maybe something.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.040]   One variable named Jeff.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.040]   I know.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.040]   I know.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.800]   Now, let's just blame Google for everything.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.800]   Google's used to.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.800]   Yeah, we can blame Google.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.320]   I mean, it should be easy for everyone, even Jeff.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.080]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.080]   Stacy.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:02.240]   It's in the U.I. is interesting because you click on the explore more things you can
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.240]   do, right?
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.280]   And any of those things and all it does is give you a sample thing to say.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.280]   Right.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.560]   There's nothing else to click on.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.560]   Touch.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:15.720]   But if you all voice, but if you fire off commands like to control your lights or something
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.880]   like that, or you know, turn up the heat on the connected thermostat or whatever, it'll
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.760]   give you an on screen kind of interactive control that you can interact with them.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:30.000]   It's like your voice starts the process, but there's no way there's no way to go to
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.360]   the screen and just fire it off.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.680]   It's like that, huh?
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.280]   I would play live TV and all does is give me six commands.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.720]   Play Sports Center on YouTube TV in order to do that.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.720]   Say this.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.720]   Okay.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.720]   Play MSNBC news.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.680]   Sorry, I can't help with that yet.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.680]   Sorry.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.680]   I can't help with that yet.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.680]   Oh, is NBC.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.680]   Play CNN.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:02.160]   Here's the latest news.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.640]   It's not going to give me the live.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.640]   Wait, wait.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.280]   You have a YouTube TV subscription, Jeff?
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.520]   I have YouTube premium red thing.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.480]   No, premium red is just for YouTube.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.560]   So actually do this.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.800]   Say show me for you.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.960]   Okay, what part me?
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.960]   What part?
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.680]   Because you're asking it to play TV, but you don't have the TV subscription.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.960]   So say you have a Netflix.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.160]   Oh, we haven't just haven't played cool videos on YouTube and then you should see it play
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.160]   something for you.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.160]   Okay.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.640]   Play corgi videos on YouTube.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:42.880]   Here's pictures.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.080]   And then you should be able to press a video and start it.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.520]   YouTube premium.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.720]   Is that what that says premium?
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.120]   Oh, there it is.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.120]   Funny corgi compilation 2017 best funny corgi videos ever.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.960]   2018 is already out.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.960]   This is so old.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:01.960]   This is dated.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.200]   These corgis that's so eighties.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.120]   I mean, come on.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.120]   They're pegging their pants and popping their collars.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.880]   Are you are you going to get into corgi when you get home?
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.880]   Am I going to get one?
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.400]   No, I have a dog.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.720]   Okay, so you can see that.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:24.360]   And if you had a YouTube TV subscription or if you tie it to your Netflix account, then
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:28.720]   you can say, watch, you know, whatever, right?
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.080]   It's a fine, fine.
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.080]   I can say it's a fine.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.080]   I can say it's a fine.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.080]   I can say it's a fine.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.080]   I can say it's a fine.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.080]   It's a fine.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.080]   I don't know.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.600]   Yeah, I don't know how far, like Netflix I know is built in.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:08.120]   And if you get YouTube TV, then all you say is play NSM, S, N, B, C on YouTube TV and
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.120]   it will.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.120]   Aha.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.800]   So how much is YouTube TV cost?
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.800]   What is it?
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.760]   Like 40 bucks a month or something, I think?
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.760]   Yeah, no way.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.760]   No way.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.760]   Because I...
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.760]   It replaces cable.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.760]   It's 40 bucks.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.760]   Yeah, no, I'm like, I got a cable.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:23.760]   It's your own file.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.760]   It's a cord cutting app.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.760]   Basically.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:31.400]   I drop into YouTube TV if something's happening, like the Olympics that I want to watch, then
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.920]   I'll buy it for a month and then I'll be done.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.680]   You know, I'm afraid this could be like the right thing here.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.680]   What was it?
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   The Zumbi?
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.680]   Remember that?
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.680]   The Chumpy?
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.680]   The Chumpy?
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.680]   No.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.440]   Okay, no, this is way more functional than the Chumpy.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.440]   Okay, that's good.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.720]   Jeff, just give it a few minutes and set it up properly.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.600]   If not on the show, I feel like in a week we're going to come back to you.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.280]   And we do things on the show, things happen like you lock yourself out of your account
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.480]   or you can't do video calls.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.240]   So we keep learning this lesson time and time again.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.680]   It's a bad idea.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.360]   That's why it makes great TV.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.120]   News sources, custom mods.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.360]   I think you'll like it.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.040]   It's a nice device.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:17.840]   I like that they add the hardware toggle for the camera.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:23.200]   I'm afraid to use the word switch because Karsten was giving me static on that prior
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.720]   to the show.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:29.520]   But it actually has a physical slider so that you can put a cover over the camera if you
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.520]   don't want the camera to be.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.520]   Oh, that paranoid thing, yeah.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.800]   Better than putting a piece of tape on the camera if that's what you want to do is cover
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:38.800]   the camera.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.800]   So.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.960]   And I think devices like this, that's just going to set some consumers' minds at ease
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.280]   to have something like that baked in.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.280]   So why not?
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.720]   All right, well, we started with the Lenovo Smart Display.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:58.560]   My initial thought was that we were going to start with Google's big news that from
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.560]   this morning from the Intercept.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.880]   But I'm worried about this.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.120]   We went in a different direction.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.960]   But let's talk about this after we thank the sponsor because we've got a few ads today.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.520]   So I want to first take some time real quick here and thank the first sponsor of this
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.000]   episode.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   And that is LastPass.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.640]   And then we will talk all about Google's China situation.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.360]   So this week in Google is brought to you by LastPass.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:27.120]   I'm a huge fan of LastPass been using them for years now according to one survey.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:32.040]   32% of employees share passwords with others.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:38.960]   What is your company doing to protect itself, to ensure that those passwords are being shared
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.400]   appropriately?
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.980]   LastPass Enterprise makes passwords sharing convenient for employees while keeping access
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.160]   to corporate data secure.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:52.120]   It even allows for full customization of access, including the ability to set master
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:59.440]   password requirements, enable password resets, configure over 100 policies, access security
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:06.600]   reports, create shared folders, so many features, organize database logins, SSH keys, software
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:12.320]   licenses and other important business information so you can protect that information securely.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:18.060]   And the LastPass makes it easy to restrict access when it's needed, when employees say
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:23.220]   leave the company or no longer need access to that particular account to get their work
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.380]   done.
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:28.460]   You can further protect your business with multi-factor authentication.
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.700]   There's LastPass Authenticator, which is an app.
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:37.020]   It's a verification button inside the app that pops up on an employee's phone to guarantee
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.780]   that they are the only ones with access to their accounts.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:45.240]   And even if credentials are happen to be compromised through something like a phishing attack or
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:49.960]   malware, the app then makes sure that outsiders won't have access.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:55.380]   LastPass Password Generator makes it super easy to come up with unique, random passwords
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.440]   that your employees don't have to remember or write down.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.240]   They don't have to come up with one on their own.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.100]   It randomizes the whole process, inserts the right kinds of characters in there to make
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.640]   it really easy to generate strong passwords.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:13.300]   Now employees can log in to LastPass with their Microsoft Active Directory credentials, so
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:18.320]   they truly only have one password to remember, and that would be their AD password.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.680]   And data is encrypted and decrypted at the device level.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.320]   Data stored in the vault is kept secret even from LastPass.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.060]   So even LastPass doesn't know.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.660]   From easy onboarding to password auto fill.
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.320]   I love password auto fill.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.020]   Makes my life so much easier on Android.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:38.620]   LastPass makes it easy for businesses to take control of passwords and reduce the threat
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.620]   of breach.
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.060]   LastPass also offers LastPass Premium.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.140]   That's more for personal use.
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:51.860]   LastPass Families for your entire family and LastPass Teams for Teams of 50 or fewer.
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.460]   Like I said, love LastPass.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.660]   Been using it for years.
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.060]   Got my wife on board.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.780]   We rely on LastPass.
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.900]   We've come to rely on it over the years.
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:07.700]   Because it just works, it takes the second guessing and poor security practices out of
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.100]   your life and puts it into a secure package.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:16.100]   LastPass also, by the way, celebrated its 10th anniversary this July.
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.380]   So happy anniversary, happy birthday.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:25.180]   More than 13 million people trust LastPass, the number one most preferred password manager.

[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.940]   We thank LastPass for their support of this week in Google.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.940]   All right.
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:37.940]   So this is getting him.
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:42.620]   Our dear friend Ant Pruitt just tweeted that he thinks what we did just now was funny.
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:43.620]   No ant.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.620]   He sat.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.340]   I thought it was funny.
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.340]   He enjoys watching the world crumble around us.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.340]   Yeah.
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.340]   Thanks a lot, Ant.
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.820]   And definitely a good friend of the network.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:56.820]   He is indeed.
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.820]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.420]   So thank you for tweeting that out, Ant.
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.420]   I agree.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.500]   It was kind of funny, but I also agree it was kind of sad.
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:04.500]   We should have been able to get there.
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.500]   I'm not sure why.
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.660]   Tragic, our techno-tragic comedy.
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.460]   We'll figure it out the second we stop recording this show.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:13.900]   We'll be like, oh, that's what we should have done.
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:20.340]   So Jeff, tell me why it gives you pause that Google might be censoring its service for
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.540]   China.
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.620]   I was very proud of Google as an outsider.
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.540]   I mean, like, like, I'm their parent.
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:32.260]   But I was proud of them for taking a principled stand and not doing this before and leaving
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.260]   China.
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.820]   And it was a, you know, whereas Facebook's been trying desperately to get into China,
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.300]   Google was there.
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:47.540]   But when forced to censor on their own, Google said, no, and they fundamentally left.
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:48.980]   And I thought that was a principled stand.
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.820]   And right now we're expecting the platforms to make principled stands.
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:28:00.500]   We're pushing YouTube and Facebook to get rid of info wars, we being lots of people.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.540]   And so I think it's more important than ever for the platforms to act on principle.
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:09.180]   Now I well understand the fiduciary view that China is a gigantic market and Google's dying
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.180]   to get in there.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.180]   Facebook is dying to get in there.
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.180]   But they've got to know their line.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.620]   They've got to know what line they won't cross.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.740]   And I think censoring search has to be Google's line.
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:22.380]   Well, Google had already kind of gone through this to a certain degree, right?
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.380]   Yeah.
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:28.580]   They did this back in, I think, 2010 pulled out of China because for a few years prior
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:35.160]   to that they were doing similar things, kind of a stripped down, censored version of their
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.700]   service operating in China.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.700]   And they got an intense amount of scrutiny.
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:40.700]   Why is it different now?
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.300]   Why would they get less scrutiny now?
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.860]   I don't know.
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:49.300]   Yeah, go ahead, Stacy.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.820]   Well, so far they haven't done it.
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.420]   So they may still get this scrutiny coming.
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:29:01.220]   But I mean, I imagine it's the economic, I mean, they can't not be in China.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:08.220]   They've watched 10 cent and we, weibo, weibo eat their lunch.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:14.460]   And how do you say no to being in a country with a billion people?
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.660]   Yeah, I know.
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:25.740]   I mean, yeah, like you said, Jeff, from a fiduciary standpoint, yes, that makes sense.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.980]   And Sundar Pichai CEO has been very dedicated to the next billion users.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:35.060]   And this is an obvious way to do that is to crack the Chinese market.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:45.100]   But it seems to strengthen those that pointed to Google removing the don't be evil tagline
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:54.540]   from their company, no big glacier, to kind of be like, okay, well, now, when you're stripping
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:30:03.180]   away features that enable an entire country to be misinformed and not allowed to understand
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:09.500]   or know that certain things exist for reasons that the government stands to gain from because
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:14.260]   of the communist regime or whatever the case may be, are you then enabling that?
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:19.380]   And does that set a precedent for other countries to say, well, now Google is willing to do
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.380]   this.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.380]   So we'll do that too.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:28.060]   And also I would be interested to see if the employees freak out much like they did with
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.500]   the Pentagon contract for machine learning.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.500]   So it's possible.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.500]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.780]   I remember the arguments we had on this discussions.
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:42.500]   We had on the show back then, you know, the belief by some that a hampered Google is better
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:46.500]   than no Google in China.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.820]   And you know, that's a decision Google made was no.
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.380]   And I agreed with their decision at the time.
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.220]   One could argue that.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:31:03.900]   I mean, I guess I understand and I do think it's a terrible line to cross, but I am also
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:10.420]   kind of like, yeah, they've been acting a lot more public, but more like a public company
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.980]   paying more attention to their shareholders lately.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:17.420]   So it kind of makes it doesn't surprise me.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.540]   So Stacy, here's another way to look at it.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.340]   Because what's the line?
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:25.700]   So Facebook right now is under a lot more pressure than Google is, which is why this
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:29.620]   is a convenient time for I think Google would make a decision like this is paid squirrel
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.900]   look over there Facebook, what they did now, right?
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.940]   So, but what would the line be for Facebook?
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:36.940]   Right?
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:44.460]   What would, because we're asking Facebook, we society, media, government are asking Facebook
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.500]   to set a better line.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.140]   Those lines are culturally determined.
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.140]   And so another.
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:56.780]   Partially and authoritarian only are different things.
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:57.780]   Right?
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:58.780]   They are.
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:08.940]   Now, I would say that in China, there are some cultural norms that Facebook could respect
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:16.060]   that we would find kind of abhorrent in like, I mean, so.
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.260]   And I don't love a theory.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:23.340]   I thought I can't even say it authoritarianism and censorship.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.540]   But a lot of people in China are very adept.
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.780]   They work to get around censorship.
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:34.340]   Yeah, but, but I don't think it's ideal, but maybe Google's kind of like, and maybe they're
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.340]   like screw it.
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.860]   The world is burning anyway.
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.620]   Let's get our money while we still can.
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:43.660]   I want to like them better than that, Stacy.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.340]   I want to be proud of them.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.940]   I don't know why I'm sounding like such a dork.
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.460]   I'm like, that's so cute, Jeff.
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.460]   You know, because it's.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.460]   Put your faith in Mozilla or something.
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.060]   It's really hard these days.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:01.420]   I mean, I'm causing a position defending Silicon Valley, depending on the tech companies.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:02.420]   It gets harder.
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.420]   I'm tired.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.140]   I'm not behaving as well, Jeff.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:11.660]   I mean, I defend technology, but even I look at this and I'm like, dang, you can call it
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.620]   no panic, but we're building a lot of tools without thinking about the ramifications.
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:20.140]   And when we are thinking of the ramifications, we're saying, eh, shrug, someone else will
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.140]   worry about that.
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.940]   Well, so watch out or the data is already done.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.500]   I've been reading Gutenberg books like crazy, man.
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:29.500]   So watch out.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.340]   I'm going to do Gutenberg stuff.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.340]   Okay.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.820]   Right.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:39.980]   So, so the press is invented and there's peasant wars and there's, there's huge disruption
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.300]   and one can't control the future.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.140]   You know, you can try to do things right or wrong.
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.140]   I agree with that.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:52.100]   But I think there's, I think there's a limit to your ability and authority to determine
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.100]   the use of these tools.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:57.340]   Now, I don't think Facebook's gone far enough to say that.
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:02.060]   I think that info wars is should whatever that if info wars doesn't fail to test the
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.820]   test is wrong at Facebook.
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.620]   So, so I think they should be doing more.
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:11.580]   I think that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't thinks that he has the role of free speech in society.
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.380]   As I said last week and he doesn't.
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:16.940]   So he needs to set standards for what's acceptable on Facebook and he has more authority there
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.020]   than he wishes to acknowledge so far.
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:27.260]   Having said that, I think that that it's a bit hubristic to think that we can say we
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:31.580]   can know what all the impact is and determine it and fix it all now.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.580]   I don't think we can.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:38.460]   But I last week I was in, it was a community summit for, it was like an analyst or some
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.900]   people who influenced, I think it was an influencer thing.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.700]   Y'all, I was really appalled to find this out.
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:43.700]   Of course, you're an influencer.
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.020]   I was like, no, I'm not an influencer, but I was there.
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:54.980]   And one of the people there who did, we had a discussion about AI and a person who was
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:35:02.180]   with Accenture's ethics in AI group started really pressing them on what does it mean
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:09.060]   to develop these tools and how do you view, yes, it's a tool, how do you view rules and
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:12.780]   how should we start thinking about this and what is the role of companies like Google.
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:18.900]   And the Google guys, he gave the very standard technology is like a rock.
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.140]   It could be used for good or evil.
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:25.940]   And I would argue that it's not actually because AI is invisible and rocks are pretty
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.300]   obvious when you commit crimes with rocks, you're left with like a dead body or a broken
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:33.980]   window when you commit ethical violations with AI.
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.460]   They aren't noticed necessarily.
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.060]   So that's just me.
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.020]   But he kept talking about that.
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.980]   He kept saying it's the role of the government and the person kept pressing them on.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.300]   Well, don't you think you as a company have a job to think about those ramifications?
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.300]   Right.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.540]   Yes, it's a tool.
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:54.500]   And they were like, no, that was not a thing that they wanted to bring up.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:58.940]   And I know that Google has gone very far and has their AI standards.
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:03.860]   But they still aren't thinking about the future.
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:04.860]   I agree.
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:05.860]   I agree.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.780]   I just think that you know me.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.620]   I get allergic to thinking that we can regulate this future.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:15.460]   But should the companies come to their own standards of deciding what appropriate behavior
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:16.460]   is?
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.460]   Yes.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:22.060]   And as you said, one of you did, the employees may well do that as they did with the drones.
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:25.940]   So I just saw Wall Street Journal headline today in which the Wall Street Journal is saying
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:30.020]   more people will die because the employees did that with drones and Google.
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.780]   No, that's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.780]   Yes, it is.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:37.340]   Like, it's hard to count that.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:43.380]   But I do think it is your job if you're going to invent a technology or a platform to think
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:48.420]   hard about the worst ways it could be used and to reach out to people and say, hey, what
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.060]   do you think could happen if we do this?
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.060]   And listen to that feedback.
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:59.740]   Well, I interviewed Jonathon Zugger, who's a brilliant engineer who was at Google, who's
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.700]   now doing a startup.
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:06.620]   And so I talked to him about this, about where's the line and how do you set it?
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:11.180]   And his analogy I liked was to civil engineers in the early days, right?
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:16.620]   If you built a bridge and it fell apart, you didn't do your job right.
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:20.620]   So your job was to figure out how to build a bridge that doesn't fall apart.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.860]   Now that was okay because it was the bridge and you can look at the bridge and say it's
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:24.860]   up, it's down.
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.420]   It's a different matter when you get into human behavior and impact on human behavior
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:33.500]   is very hard to predict and hard to measure and hard to control.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.900]   And maybe in some cases, we shouldn't control it because in lots of cases, we shouldn't
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.940]   because people can discover new freedoms.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.940]   What is that?
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:40.940]   Was that an event?
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.500]   Sorry, go ahead, Stacy.
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.220]   What about an analogy like drug trials?
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:49.780]   Because that's something where you have subtle, sometimes subtle, not always subtle long-term
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.940]   effects.
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:56.340]   So maybe mechanisms like that to be put in place for something like algorithmic bias
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.340]   or why not.
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:59.840]   I don't know.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:06.580]   I think that they have a responsibility to measure their own impact.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:10.260]   And what they do with that and how transparent they are with that and how much you can rely
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:13.020]   on that, different questions.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:17.580]   But to not try to measure your impact, I think would be irresponsible.
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:18.580]   Yes.
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.580]   And I don't think they are measuring.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.700]   Well, I think you're right.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.820]   I have to imagine to a certain degree they are, though.
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:25.820]   This is Google.
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:31.380]   And with the amount of people that are working on this sort of thing behind the scenes, although
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:36.140]   the Intercept said it's a very small amount of people, probably like 200 people according
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:41.620]   to the person who leaked the information about this kind of China plan.
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:45.940]   But I mean, even Sunar Pichai, I guess we don't really know Sunar Pichai on a personal
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:49.460]   level, but I've always kind of thought of him as a very thoughtful individual.
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:54.300]   I imagine that they, I imagine in thinking about this, I'd be really surprised that they
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.500]   don't weigh those consequences.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.740]   It just seems that right now, according to this leak, they've decided that, eh, you
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.700]   know, we've weighed the consequences and we stand to gain a lot.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:09.900]   So why not try and that's that's a fair assessment for a business to make.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:10.900]   Sure.
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:15.540]   I mean, it's not a great assessment.
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:21.100]   Is that an assessment that were used to hearing a company like of Google, of Google making
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.100]   specifically or?
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.460]   Well, I was going to say, you know, the companies make these assessments all the time.
[00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:30.860]   You look at someone like, Oh, I don't know, Exxon, who says, Hey, you know what, climate
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.860]   changes a real thing all the way back in the 70s and said, you know what, this isn't good
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:35.860]   for our business.
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.860]   Let's fight this for a while.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.860]   Let's do this.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.540]   I mean, there's a look at DuPont.
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.900]   I mean, we can find many examples.
[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:48.060]   And now the tech companies are going to become part of this, this wave of companies making
[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:51.220]   decisions that benefit them and not society as a whole.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:55.220]   And that should not surprise any of us because that's what companies do.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:40:01.020]   And especially these, these companies are making ridiculous amounts of money by doing
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.340]   so, you know, and that's what governments for.
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:08.420]   I mean, that's, that's historically why we have it is because as individuals, we can't
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:14.220]   assess this stuff, we can't enforce policies and I mean, you see it with tobacco companies,
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.220]   we see it.
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.500]   I mean, just this is what they do.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.500]   We're just going to move in.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.060]   Government can figure it out Stacy.
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.060]   That's what I mean.
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.220]   So in every case, they're, they're basically abrogating to the company and look like the
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.220]   right to be forgotten.
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:29.780]   Google, you figure it out, right?
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:33.620]   The hard thing here is because it's the Internet is a worldwide phenomenon.
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:38.140]   Yes, smoking is a worldwide phenomenon, but you could sort of police it at the borders
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.260]   with taxation, for example.
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:46.100]   With the Internet, we don't have a way to police these things and the mores and values
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:53.940]   of one country versus another, you know, they, it doesn't matter.
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:55.500]   I don't know.
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.500]   Yeah.
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:02.100]   And now that everyone's sad and depressed, I mean GDPR is a wonderful effort to try to
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:06.460]   make this like Europeans privacy thing and it'll matter for Europeans, but I'm not sure
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:09.340]   if it'll matter everywhere else.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:15.740]   And it has on a tenant consequences like, like, by for Katie in the web for news consumers
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:16.740]   in Europe.
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.380]   Right.
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:23.260]   And that's because again, the Internet knows no borders and that's a, that's a benefit
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.260]   and a challenge.
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.260]   Yeah.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:31.940]   I just goes back to my, this is why I'm going Gutenberg crazy again is, is, yeah, the notion
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:35.140]   of the nation changed after the book, the notion of a culture changed after the book
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.380]   and after language was, was standardized.
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.380]   Things can change again.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:40.820]   The nation may not be forever.
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:47.460]   So, yeah, and a long, in a long term view, things probably will change.
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.180]   Nothing lasts forever.
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:54.620]   And who knows at what point in that inflection we are right now, except podcasting podcasting
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.620]   will be forever.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.620]   Yeah.
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.180]   Never going away.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:59.180]   Just stay in the same.
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:03.060]   You'll always get your podcast through the same pod catcher and the say you'll always
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.060]   download it.
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.060]   Yeah.
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:07.260]   Subscribe to RSS feed.
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.100]   That's it.
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.100]   Good point.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.100]   Good point.
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.100]   Let's see here.
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.100]   All right.
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:16.940]   Well, you know, we're kind of touching on, on Facebook and Jeff, you are dressed to the
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:17.940]   nines.
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.100]   I would say maybe the eights.
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.380]   I don't mean to show the video.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.940]   I just put it in there to explain why I am dressed this way.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:25.940]   Yeah.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:31.420]   So you were, you were on MB MS NBC earlier today talking about this kind of Facebook, this
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:36.020]   recent Facebook news about coordinated political influence campaign.
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.020]   Yes.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:42.780]   And I think that there is a growing one day consensus that the Facebook is perhaps getting
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:46.300]   this act together, that Facebook this time did right.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.460]   It announced, Oh, we found bad stuff.
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:53.780]   We found efforts to have an impact on the political.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.340]   They did not say what country it came from.
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.700]   It was an only thing they felt they had enough evidence.
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:02.580]   But to everybody outside, it looks an awful lot like the IRS stuff from Russia.
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.620]   Yeah, everybody's just a good Russia.
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.820]   People were assuming, but I don't know that's a good assumption because what happens, what
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:13.180]   data in society to think tank Joe Nautomans from finds often is that there is a copycat
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:17.820]   structure here where you see very similar techniques happening among Russians and then
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.300]   trolls.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.580]   So I would bet on Russia too.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:22.580]   But who knows?
[00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:27.300]   They also did not release the entirety of the material they found because some of it, I
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.540]   guess is just so horrendously offensive.
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.020]   They didn't will be associated with that.
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.420]   I think I'm okay with that.
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.580]   I think about it.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:36.540]   But the point is they did something.
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:41.820]   And so what I said on MSNBC this morning was that what we've got to we got to change
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.140]   now that they're getting their act together.
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.860]   We've got to change our attitude here.
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.700]   Facebook is the ally of democracy.
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:52.700]   And Facebook properly done is is our best hope because our government, Kristin Nielsen
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:59.460]   did finally change her tone today, but her tone has been, there's no Russian stuff going
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:02.180]   on, whistling past the Kremlin.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:05.740]   And so who is going to protect us from the Russians?
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:06.740]   Donald Trump?
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.260]   Apparently not.
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.100]   Facebook is our best defense.
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.700]   And that's a weak defense.
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.780]   They would be the first to say.
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:18.940]   But there are ally in this and they're also a victim of this manipulation.
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.780]   And so I think we have to once they get their act together and get going, I think we have
[00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:25.540]   to change our mindset of, oh my God, Facebook's rule of democracy.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.780]   Facebook is trying to save it now.
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:36.820]   Oh, you cynics.
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:40.180]   Well done.
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:43.580]   Nice, nicely timed there.
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:44.580]   I don't know.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:46.180]   I'm going to have to internalize that a little bit.
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.140]   I don't know how I feel about that.
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:51.020]   That's a hard, hard turn for me to take.
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:54.820]   My gut response is, God, if that's what we've got, we're in deep.
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:56.820]   That's where we are.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:58.780]   We are in deep.
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:02.620]   I don't use Facebook all that often.
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:12.500]   So I look at this and I'm like, yeah, I guess I'm still in love with newspapers and conversation
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.460]   and the civic outreach.
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.660]   And that is not happening on Facebook.
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:21.460]   And I don't even know if young people are there anymore.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:27.860]   So I'm confused as to who is influenced by Facebook.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:32.060]   And I'm not saying that that's not happening because I see that it must be.
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.540]   So I'm just, I just don't know.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:37.140]   That's really important to see because what you're also going to there, which is one of
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:40.580]   the other things I contend is we can't take all of these actions and make all these
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.580]   presumptions without data.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:46.580]   Now, part of it is because we can't get all the data we want from Facebook, but this
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:53.700]   presumption that all of civic discourses ruined, you heard me say on the show before, show
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.660]   me the Nazis in your Facebook feed.
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:59.820]   They're not there when I was on MSNBC this morning, Stephanie Ruhl, who I think is great,
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:00.980]   said, well, this is like bear.
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:06.660]   And if there's five contaminated bottles on the shelves, then bear took them all off
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:07.820]   the show, shouldn't Facebook do that?
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:09.660]   I said, really take off all the conversation?
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.020]   Which is it, should they?
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.540]   I said, no.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:16.500]   And Bob D'Oracelli, former senator from New Jersey, was on the panel as well.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:23.460]   And he made an eloquent defense of free speech and worried eloquently about the slippery slope
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:28.460]   and the risk of free speech, not that Facebook is an agent of censorship that's government,
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:35.700]   but that depends on what we expect of them to take down where it is freedom will come.
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.740]   These are hard.
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.140]   And people are always going to believe stupid things.
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.140]   I mean, good Lord, people.
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.140]   I mean,
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:46.420]   I mean, I'm not going to be a good guy.
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:50.420]   And I know this makes it easier to spread, but I don't know.
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.540]   This is not a problem I'm equipped to solve.
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:57.140]   It's not even when I'm equipped to talk about really because I am not a deep ponder on this
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.140]   type of stuff.
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.140]   Let's talk about chips.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:00.140]   Talk about chips.
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:01.140]   Yeah.
[00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:04.140]   What kind of lays, Cheetos?
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.140]   Are Cheetos really chips?
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.140]   I don't know.
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:12.580]   Actually, as I said that, I was like, well, does that qualify?
[00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:13.580]   I don't know.
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:18.140]   Stacey, if you're in Britain, of course, you call French fries chips, which is my segue
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:25.500]   here to ask whether you've had Taco Bell's Spicy Fries and queso.
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:26.740]   I have not, Jeff.
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:27.940]   I'm so sorry.
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:30.380]   I'd like your critical opinions, Stacey.
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.860]   I'll be fries and queso.
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:33.620]   I don't like French fries.
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:35.620]   I think it's important to know that.
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:39.900]   And I think it's very odd to put them in queso, but I still want your critical opinions,
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:40.900]   Stacey.
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:41.900]   Oh, no, cheese fries can be good.
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:45.500]   I mean, that's something I'm like, oh, no, no, that's a great food.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:46.500]   Okay.
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:47.500]   All right.
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.100]   Cheese makes everything better.
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.020]   Does cheese make chips you about?
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.940]   Does cheese make, what is it?
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:56.580]   Edge tensor processing units?
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.580]   Delicious.
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:58.580]   There we go.
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.780]   I believe it makes them highly effective.
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:01.780]   Okay.
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:02.780]   What can you tell us about this?
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:07.860]   Google basically has a new TPUs for IoT devices.
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:10.140]   What are these going to be used for?
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:11.140]   IoT devices.
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.140]   It's just like a TPUs.

[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:38.660]   Well, it's actually, I look at it as actually being pretty good because there's privacy
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.020]   components.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:46.620]   You can actually do a lot of the image recognition at the edge and you don't actually have to
[00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:50.780]   send it to the cloud, which means you could use it and dump it.
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:56.140]   I don't think that's actually what Google's going to do, but you know, one could do it.
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:54:02.180]   So you could have in your home, for example, a video camera that says, you know, these
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:05.860]   are the five faces that I recognize.
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:10.340]   And once I recognize those, when I see them, I take note of them.
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.060]   I use them locally and then I dump them.
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:14.140]   So there's no actual record of who came in.
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.140]   Does that make sense?
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.140]   Yeah.
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:21.660]   So I'm sure there are any other recognition process.
[00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:25.300]   If a stranger comes in and you want to know who that stranger is, then it has to go back
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:27.180]   up in the cloud and say, here's who I see, who is it?
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:29.900]   Because all the data is not going to be there to recognize that stranger.
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:30.900]   Yes.
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:35.500]   And what most people don't care who this stranger is.
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:38.980]   Like I get notifications on my phone from my doorbell right now from Google and it's
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:42.660]   like, hey, I saw a strange person at your door and I'm like, oh, yeah, check it.
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:46.340]   It's the UPS man or, oh, that is a strange person.
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:49.420]   You know, and sometimes I look at it and I'm like, oh, no, that's my husband.
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.020]   We're in sunglasses.
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:52.020]   Right.
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:59.020]   So, and I'm sure there, I mean, there are all sorts of evil things when I'm not a really
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.020]   evil villain.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:01.380]   I don't have that mindset.
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:05.140]   So yeah, I don't know.
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:09.740]   But you know, some interesting, like scary things would be like you could interfere with
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:15.460]   someone's model and then you could like screw up their manufacturing process or something
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:19.020]   if you're running like you'll using it to analyze yields.
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:23.900]   You could anytime, any things at the edge, that means it's accessible physically.
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:28.300]   So you have to start thinking about that and depending on how much faith you want to put
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:29.300]   in that stuff.
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:31.460]   But that's kind of out there.
[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:35.180]   I don't know.
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:40.900]   Were there any other things, you know, in your time at Google Cloud next that because
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:45.380]   I know last week on the show, a bunch of the topics and a bunch of the announcements were
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:46.380]   mentioned.
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:49.540]   Aside from these chips, was there anything else that really?
[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:51.020]   105 announcements.
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.020]   Yes.
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:54.220]   I mean, the list is huge, but it's ridiculous.
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:56.300]   I didn't see all of the announcements.
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:56:03.060]   I thought it was interesting that targets now working with Google Cloud makes sense.
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:07.220]   And you know, because the retailers don't want to be on AWS.
[00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:15.060]   I think the Kubernetes on premise is a big deal because that, you know, that expands
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:19.820]   the orchestration environment for containers, which is like the hot thing in the cloud to
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:21.660]   people's on premise database.
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:27.380]   Overall, it feels like Google is finally maturing its cloud offering in a way that listens to
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.700]   customers and what they want.
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:33.580]   In a way, I associate more with Microsoft as opposed to Amazon because Amazon's like,
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:34.580]   we built it.
[00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:35.580]   You can use it.
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:38.780]   Here's how Microsoft's always been like, we listen to our customers.
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:40.140]   We try to build what enterprises want.
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:45.020]   And Google's always been like, we invented this crazy, wacky, cool technology.
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:47.060]   It's so awesome.
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:48.740]   And you'll like using it, but they never show you how.
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:50.220]   They never help you get there.
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:54.020]   And it feels like they're actually taking all the cool technology they've developed and
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:57:01.220]   trying to help people get there and use it, which is a big step for Google.
[00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:06.220]   So that's the broad kind of, I don't know, thing to think about.
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:12.700]   And from a news bits, I'm just, I'm thinking, I don't know.
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:16.140]   That was last week.
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:17.140]   Yeah, I know.
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:18.140]   That was ancient history.
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:20.380]   Oh, I lied to you.
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:21.380]   Machine learning.
[00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:22.380]   Good Lord.
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:28.460]   They are so they are doing some crazy stuff with machine learning with their customers,
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:31.700]   especially with things like map and location data.
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:38.660]   Man, they are applying that to just crazy stuff, everything from like parking to like,
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:43.140]   I don't know, florist delivery to like disease epidemics.
[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:45.100]   I mean, it was pretty cool.
[00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:47.180]   Some of the stuff they were showing off there.
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:48.820]   So.
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:54.100]   So speaking of the cloud, I just, Carson, I just sent you a photo and I came across in
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:55.100]   New York yesterday.
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:57.100]   Did you get it?
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:58.100]   Email.
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:02.020]   Yeah, he's, he is checking right now.
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:06.700]   I can hear his eyes looking at a browser.
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:07.700]   You can hear his eyes.
[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:08.700]   Yeah.
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:10.620]   So what AWS loft?
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.900]   Did you know about this?
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.380]   Oh, they did want to San Francisco for a while.
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:18.420]   This is where like you could just go and work there for a while.
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.900]   So this is your AWS customer.
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:25.380]   I think it's if you can, it's like for startups or anyone to come in and it's kind of, it
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:28.260]   used to be a coworking space in San Francisco.
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:29.900]   It's like a pop up store they create.
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:30.900]   Oh, interesting.
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:31.900]   Wow.
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:32.900]   A pop up coworking space.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:33.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:37.660]   I don't know if it was a hundred percent coworking or if you just go in to find out a,
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:40.300]   you know, it's been so long since they've done it.
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:45.660]   So I'm like, I don't remember what it was exactly here.
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:47.700]   Let me look it up so I can tell you accurately.
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:49.060]   I guess I could have done that.
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:51.820]   Oh, boot camps for AWS stuff.
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:53.700]   So they're pop up lofts.
[00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:56.460]   They have them in New York and San Francisco and London.
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:58.460]   They pitch events.
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:00.020]   Ta-da.
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:01.020]   What's hot?
[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.020]   It's the loft.
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:03.740]   Container day, you guys.
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:04.740]   Serverless days.
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:06.180]   Oh my gosh.
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:07.740]   You get a container.
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:09.740]   You get a container.
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:10.740]   Yeah.
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:11.740]   Cool.
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:12.740]   All right.
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:15.700]   You didn't, you didn't go in Jeff.
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:18.020]   I didn't go in because I didn't feel worthy and plopped down.
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:21.500]   Oh man, you could have learned all about serverless and been very excited.
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:24.740]   I thought I'd be quizzed at the door.
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:26.740]   Why are you here?
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:27.900]   No.
[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:29.420]   Are you looking for MSNBC?
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:30.420]   It's around the corner.
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:31.420]   Man in Thai.
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:33.740]   You're not allowed to hear with a Thai.
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:34.740]   What do you think you do it?
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:35.740]   Oh, that is true.
[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:38.460]   Sir, we have a dress code.
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:41.260]   You can't wear that Thai in here.
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:42.260]   Woody or go.
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:44.260]   Let's take a break.
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:46.140]   I could take the Thai off now, couldn't I?
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:47.140]   Yeah.
[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:48.140]   Yeah.
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:49.140]   Go casual.
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:50.140]   Relax, sir.
[00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:52.540]   The first half of the episode, Jeff was all business.
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:53.540]   Now Jeff is all party.
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:56.220]   The other thing is I don't think you can see in the background there's a white shirt hanging
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:57.300]   on that doorknob.
[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:58.300]   Yeah.
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:02.300]   That's my, um, that's my twig shirt.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:05.700]   So I finally figured out the proper reason I get pink all the time is because if I wear
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:09.740]   all black and everything's black, it doesn't know what to do with my face and hair.
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:10.740]   The camera.
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.580]   So when you wear all white shirt, look at this.
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:14.780]   I'm kind of like normal.
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:15.780]   Yeah.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:16.780]   You look human.
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:17.780]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.780]   Rare.
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:22.820]   I mean, your shirt is blinding, but yes, that better the shirt than me.
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:23.820]   Right.
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.820]   That's true.
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:25.820]   Fair enough.
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:26.820]   Fair enough.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:27.820]   Do we weight balance on my face?
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:28.820]   Right.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.220]   Yeah, it does look pretty good.
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:31.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:32.300]   You're doing good.
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.620]   We got a lot more to talk about.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:38.580]   Before we do, uh, I think a sponsor and this is actually a brand new sponsor on the network.
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:42.820]   This week, uh, this week's episode of this week in Google is brought to you by masterclass.
[01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:48.720]   I got to tell you just from a personal perspective, uh, I had noticed, started to notice, I watch
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:54.860]   a lot of, you know, in music production realm side of things, watch a lot of tutorials and
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:55.860]   stuff like that.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:01:03.100]   And I started seeing, um, ads for masterclass and I saw, I'm so thrilled that they're on
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:09.060]   the network because it's given me the opportunity to take a look at, at their content and really
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:12.660]   kind of dive in because it's really, it's awesome.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:18.700]   Imagine if you will learning, um, the things that you're interested in from probably the
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:21.820]   people in the world that are most notably doing those things.
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:26.260]   For example, imagine learning new recipes from Gordon Ramsey or photography tips from
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:27.980]   Annie Leavitz.
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:34.380]   Now you can, and obviously this with masterclass, masterclass offers online classes taught by
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.940]   the best in the world.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:40.660]   Malcolm Gladwell teaches writing, Chris Hadfield, that's, that's probably a really great one.
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:44.860]   teaches space exploration, uh, best in the world people.
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:49.540]   And I'm not sure how masterclass did it, but they were able to get some really amazing
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:54.940]   people to come in and just teach their craft, teach what it is they are known for Ron Howard
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.820]   teaching directing.
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:02.540]   Each class is shot with cinematic production quality and offers on demand lessons loaded
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:06.580]   with exclusive content that you're only going to find this at masterclass.
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:11.780]   So you go on there, it's, it's almost like, I almost compare it to like, uh, the criterion
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:16.540]   collection when if you ever watched a movie, a criterion collection movie and you turned
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:22.300]   on kind of the director's commentary and you got this really inside detailed background
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:25.820]   scoop or idea of what it was like to create the movie.
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:30.780]   It's that, but that mixed with like a documentary because they film these, these interviews
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:35.620]   and these courses, they're full on courses, step by step courses, and they're just shot
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:36.620]   so well.
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:37.620]   They're beautiful.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.980]   They sound great.
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:43.340]   And it's almost like you're there with that person as they're teaching you what they are
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:45.340]   so known for.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:46.420]   Just really great stuff.
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:53.020]   I'm, I'm actually just getting started with the two that I heard about months before that
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:58.220]   I was really interested in getting into a musician who you main, you probably haven't
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.060]   heard of, but dead mouse.
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:01.420]   He's an electronic musician.
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:05.940]   Also another DJ musician, uh, Armand van Buren.
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:09.300]   And so far like there's just, these are great.
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:10.900]   Bob Woodward teaches journalism.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:14.980]   Steve Martin, I was like, yeah, William or Bob Woodward.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.140]   That's the one I would do.
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.140]   Yeah, I know.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.900]   I've known about this for some time.
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:23.460]   The Serena Williams teaches tennis for God's sakes, but, but they really have gotten a
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:33.140]   phenomenal, uh, constellation of the best in their fields and they shoot it really well.
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:37.860]   And yeah, as an educator, we've taken notice this at our school that they're, they're really
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:38.860]   quite something.
[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:39.860]   We want to do things like this too.
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.340]   I mean, I imagine like, you know, acting is just one example.
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:47.820]   There's a number of different, um, you know, ways from, from the director's perspective to
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:51.260]   acting to script writing, screenwriting, all that kind of stuff.
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:55.540]   Like you could base curriculums around the concepts that they're teaching here and have
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:59.500]   this, you know, really be the kind of supportive background behind it.
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.420]   They're adding new classes all the time.
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:05.580]   So they've got a whole roster of new classes that they plan on adding in the future.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:09.500]   Uh, and you know, this isn't just for someone who's looking for skills.
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:14.780]   Like for me, music production, I'm going to find actual usable, uh, skills from the
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:19.780]   dead mouse and the arm and van Buren walkthroughs that I can use on my own productions.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:26.100]   But maybe you just enjoy watching professionals in their, in their scenario in their perfect
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.100]   situation.
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:28.100]   They're really what?
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:29.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.740]   Or, or working with people.
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:31.980]   How do they work with people?
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:36.220]   It's just, it's all from that perspective, it's almost like a documentary and educational
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:40.060]   documentary, uh, split into course, you know, topics.
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:42.300]   It's, it's really fantastic stuff.
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:49.100]   Masterclass has been featured by the New York Times, Vanity Fair, ESPN, and you know, this

[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.720]   Oh, there needs to be a podcast one.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.720]   Obviously.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.580]   That's, that's, that's got to be next.
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:53.580]   That's gosh, Ian teaches contouring.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:55.740]   Sign up for that.
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:58.420]   All right.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:00.840]   So, um, what do you, what do you guys think?
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:05.100]   I mean, we've got so much in here and we've, we've hardly scratched the surface.
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:09.100]   Do we want to talk about, uh, uh, pixel rumors?
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:10.100]   All right.
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:13.100]   Or have we already done that?
[01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:14.100]   Okay.
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:18.820]   A little bit, but I think, but I think that, that tweet made me, me be potentially happy.
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:19.820]   Okay.
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:20.820]   Potentially happy.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:21.820]   You want to talk about it?
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:22.820]   Heroshi Lokheimer.
[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:26.900]   On Twitter, he said, uh, this was a couple of days ago, I was away on a business trip
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:31.980]   for a few days, came back to a desk with a stack of new devices to test out.
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:33.540]   Sorry I didn't take any pics.
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.540]   And don't.
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:35.540]   Don't ask me anything.
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:38.300]   Well, humble brag there, I think.
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:43.180]   So I went in and left a reply saying, I hope that one of those is a pixel book and then
[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:46.540]   today I went back in and said, now that I'm thinking about it, I hope you find time to
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:51.700]   just smash a little phi sim into that pixel book.
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.300]   That would be nice.
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.700]   That is, uh, that would definitely be a nice addition.
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.220]   Hey, you're not happy.
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.220]   You're not far off.
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:06.820]   You have leaks a week ago said, noted leaker on Twitter or leaks, leak source, Evan Blass
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:11.460]   on Twitter said, add to this fall hardware lineup, a second generation pixel book with
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:15.580]   smaller bezels scheduled to ship before the end of the year.
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:18.580]   Let's just hope that they have that, uh, that LTE baked in there for you.
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:19.980]   That'd be, that'd be lovely for me.
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:21.420]   I would, I would like them a lot.
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:22.420]   Yeah.
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:24.500]   I love, I love my pixel book.
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.500]   I love that.
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:29.380]   So you, you, you, you were elegant and I got into a macho off.
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:35.300]   It's the exact opposite of macho as to who loves, uh, Chromebooks more.
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:37.900]   I didn't, I didn't do this.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:42.180]   I didn't set it up with somebody email me afterwards, uh, sent me things that, uh, my
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.820]   consent snotty about and dismissive of my Chromebooks.
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:47.340]   Oh, and in years ago, okay.
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:48.340]   Yeah.
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:49.340]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:52.420]   Oh, but I mean, for what he's doing in the digital nomad stuff, like the pixel book is
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:54.060]   like the perfect device.
[01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:56.580]   I just insisted that I love them more sooner.
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:57.580]   All right.
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:58.580]   Yeah.
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:07:59.580]   I was there before you.
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:02.620]   He was the hipster, the original hipster Chromebook lover right there, a pixel book
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.620]   lover.
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:04.620]   Right.
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:05.620]   Yeah.
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.420]   I, well, the thing is now I see all these stories about, oh, wow, you could just use a
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:09.420]   Chromebook and they're wonderful.
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:11.300]   And I, you know, I, I've been there for three years.
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:12.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:13.300]   I've been there.
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:16.060]   And the price by the way on, even though obviously this means they're replacing, but
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:19.660]   the price on the current pixel book now on Amazon is down at a record blow.
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:20.660]   Yeah.
[01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:22.460]   It dropped, uh, I know I put that in here.
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:23.460]   I'm not seeing it.
[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:24.460]   I'm here.
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:25.980]   Oh, it's all the way up there.
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:26.980]   So yeah.
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:32.260]   So $750 for the I five, eight gig, 128 gig storage model.
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:33.740]   I actually think that's what I have.
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:35.820]   I got, I got the lowest entry.
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:38.100]   I did too, which is, which is huge.
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.100]   Totally.
[01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:40.100]   It's fine.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:46.140]   I have no problems at that, at that level, but yeah, $750, which, um, I feel like for
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:47.860]   the, for the build quality and all that.
[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:49.940]   It's a, yeah, that's a great price.
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:52.660]   I don't think it's ever been that low.
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:56.620]   And then, oh, by the way, related to the, the pixel book I had spent, I just reviewed
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:03.060]   last weekend on the new screensavers, the Acer Chromebook tab 10, which is the first
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:05.860]   Chrome notebook form factor.
[01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:08.540]   So no keyboard whatsoever.
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:11.060]   And that's 330.
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.980]   So that's a different type of device entirely.
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:15.820]   It's, I don't know.
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:16.820]   Yeah.
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:20.380]   It's, and it's really geared for the education market.
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:22.660]   In fact, initially it wasn't even for sale.
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:27.300]   You can only get it K through 12 with schools that were supporting Chrome and that sort of
[01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:28.300]   stuff.
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.460]   Now they've opened it up so you can buy it for $330.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:33.460]   I mean, it's, it's a tablet running Chrome OS.
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:34.460]   Obviously it runs and right now.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:37.740]   Amazon stuff doesn't run, but it has problems.
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:38.740]   What's that?
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:39.740]   Anything involving CRM.
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:43.340]   Anything involving CRM as an Amazon app does not run well.
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:44.340]   Netflix is not run well.
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.340]   DRM.
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:46.340]   DRM.
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:47.340]   Thank you.
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:48.340]   Okay.
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:49.340]   Salesforce.
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:50.340]   We're all doing that.
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:51.340]   My awful.
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:52.340]   That's my.
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:10:01.180]   Jason, have you tried the, the HP one, the Deceperable?
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:05.780]   The HP has one now out, which is a, the screen is separable.
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:07.340]   Thus becomes a tablet.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.660]   Oh, becomes a tablet.
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:09.660]   Oh, okay.
[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:10.660]   Yeah.
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:11.660]   It's interesting.
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:12.660]   It's in the stores.
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:13.660]   Oh, poor Stacy.
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:14.660]   She's yawning at the topic of Chrome books.
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:15.660]   Sorry.
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:16.660]   No, no, no, no.
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:19.300]   I, I, every time you guys talk about Chromebooks, I'm like, man, a lot of people are like, I
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.300]   people like these things.
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:21.540]   So then I feel bad that I'm not Kevin.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:25.940]   Guys, Kevin could be just like diving right in here and telling everything.
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:29.860]   We should, we should do a, um, dual call with Kevin on these things.
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:30.860]   Yeah.
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:31.860]   If only we could connect.
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:37.020]   If only we could connect the single duo call.
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:39.180]   I don't, I have not played around with that one yet.
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:45.100]   I will say that in my, in my experience with this one, Chrome OS on a tablet with no connected
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:48.300]   keyboard was for me kind of a nightmare.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:49.300]   Um, yeah.
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:53.500]   Anytime you want to type anything on the screen, the full screen keyboard takes up two thirds
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:57.980]   of the screen, leaving with you, leaving you with this little sliver of anything to work
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:02.900]   inside and just when you're talking productivity, it just, man, talk about slowing you down way
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:04.940]   slower than any, anything else.
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:11.100]   So I think the LA public schools made a big mistake to my mind when they went with, um,
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.940]   Apple tablets versus Chromebooks.
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.460]   And you know, they went with no keyboard in the schools.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:18.460]   It was a disaster.
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:21.540]   And I think you've gotten it from the earliest age, kids need keyboards as an entry.
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:23.540]   It's what I'm going to be using.
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:28.220]   So I'll be sure there for content creation as opposed to content consumption.
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:29.220]   Right.
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:31.940]   And kids, you really want them creating some content.
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:32.940]   Yeah.
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:37.300]   Well, I couldn't imagine like typing out a thesis, you know, on a touchscreen.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.580]   I mean, obviously you're probably not going to do that.
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:43.780]   But when you introduce that as the form factor is the baseline minimum, it just sets you
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:47.220]   up for failure, I think in the worst possible way personally.
[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.380]   But we don't have to talk about Chromebooks.
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:50.860]   I know Stacy, you're probably bored.
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:55.420]   Are you more, are you more excited about the, the Pixel three XL and the fact that it might
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:57.980]   have a wireless charging?
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:58.980]   I am.
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:01.580]   I would love anything that involves wireless charging.
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:02.580]   Yeah.
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:06.460]   Cause yeah, cause I'm like, I'm out of outlets.
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:08.420]   I'm out of USB slots.
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:11.100]   I'm out of, I mean, I have connected jewelry people.
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:15.380]   I mean, I've got just connected everything, everything's plugged in.
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:16.700]   I just need wireless power.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:17.700]   Like yesterday.
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:22.980]   Save me from having to actually connect a wire into my devices and I'll be happy that
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:28.780]   some, some day in the future, your home will be lined with power walls, just projects
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:31.620]   power into our internal organs will cook.
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.180]   It'll be great.
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:34.980]   You're going to love it.
[01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:36.940]   Like it'd be fun.
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:42.940]   Yeah, apparently the latest Google app alludes to something called Pixel Stand, which might
[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:48.180]   actually be some sort of wireless charging, well, Pixel Stand for like your night table
[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:49.180]   or whatever.
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:50.180]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:54.540]   I mean, cause if I could just stick, I mean, my, my goal in people, people who are like,
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:56.340]   wireless charging isn't really wireless charging.
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:58.540]   You just have to plug something in.
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:03.500]   I just want to have a dedicated spot in my home where I could just stick my phone and
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.780]   my earbuds and my ring and my Fitbit.
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:07.780]   And my whatever.
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:08.780]   So it's easy.
[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:09.780]   Uh huh.
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:10.780]   The issue is this.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:15.340]   So when we built this, when we renovated this house low many years ago, we were very
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:19.700]   proud we have mud room off the garage and we put it in a closet there and we had a shelf
[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.780]   with nothing but electric plugs behind.
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:25.940]   Oh, every night that's where we put our phones.
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:27.420]   Why don't we use that anymore?
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:29.740]   Because our phones are there for bed.
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.180]   Yeah.
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:34.260]   So having a place where you charge all your stuff and I might get your jewelry on it, but
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:36.220]   a lot of this stuff you go, you want with you.
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:40.700]   Well, you could put that charging tray on your night tube.
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.140]   It doesn't have to be far away.
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:43.740]   Could be on your nightstand.
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:44.740]   Yes.
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:48.540]   The idea is that you just have, instead of having to like plug things in, you could just
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:49.540]   set it on something.
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:50.540]   Right.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:53.460]   Or you could buy an Ikea table that's all charging, right?
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:54.460]   Isn't it?
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:55.460]   Yes.
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:58.540]   Well, the top is the top is that holds the top.
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:03.980]   Like if you lead it up against a leg, maybe not.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:06.780]   Oh, enough of it is though.
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.300]   That would be incredibly convenient.
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.580]   Stacey's Pro-Tit for better sleep.
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:16.980]   I actually plug my device in in, I have a little area in the bathroom with a dresser.
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:23.140]   I plug it in there instead of by my bedside table and it is, I'm a more relaxed and happier
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:24.780]   individual because of it.
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.420]   Yeah.
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:30.580]   You don't, you aren't tempted to like wake up in the morning beluga.
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:32.900]   I never want to be that person.
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:36.140]   Swiping the first thing you do before your feet even touch the carpet.
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:41.540]   I used to do it when I was at giga-ohm and it was terrible because you just, you wake
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:46.980]   up to crap, you go to bed to crap and you know, it's no bueno.
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:47.980]   Yeah.
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:49.780]   So I wake up this morning, I was at a working home today.
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:52.860]   I thought, okay, you know, I wait for my wife to get out of the shower.
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:58.300]   I pick up the phone, you know, a little Twitter and I see the email saying, is it 708?
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.820]   Can you be on MSMC at nine?
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:04.700]   I live more than an hour and a half away.
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.420]   Oh, no.
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:08.620]   I'm okay with life passing me by like that.
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:12.940]   That happens to me sometime and I'm just like, yeah, that's almost almost.
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:13.940]   I have no phone.
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:17.980]   And I'll have some dork on the show instead of me and no, no, no, no, I know, you did,
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.140]   you did great.
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:24.060]   Yeah, you had, you obviously had some coffee before you, before your, I arrived with four
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:25.580]   minutes to spare.
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:27.060]   Oh my goodness.
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:28.060]   Sweaty.
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:29.060]   So, so the nice.
[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:30.060]   You're a pro man.
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.060]   You're kidding.
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:36.660]   Nice makeup lady gave me this so I could wait, dog my own forehead on the show.
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:37.660]   Yeah, gliding papers.
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:39.860]   Meanwhile, 20 minutes leading up to you arriving.
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:41.820]   They're like, is he even going to make it?
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.300]   He said he was going to be here in time.
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:48.780]   He's, I'm sending updates, you know, weighs says 833 at the port authority and the producer
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:49.780]   are they're used to this.
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:51.220]   There's a, okay, we'll have somebody downstairs.
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.220]   Get your upstairs.
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:53.220]   It's okay.
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:54.220]   So, okay.
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:55.460]   Hey, it all worked out.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.860]   So I'm glad I had my phone there.
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:57.860]   Yeah.
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:58.860]   Well, that's true.
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:15:59.860]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:04.980]   Oh man, I've enjoyed just waking up and not checking any notifications, nothing for like
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:07.940]   the first two hours that I'm awake, but I'm waking up at five o'clock now.
[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:08.940]   So why?
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:14.180]   Yeah, if I check, if I check email or anything before I work out, I don't work out.
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:15.180]   Yeah.
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:18.180]   So, just get you distracted sends you down that path.
[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:19.180]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:24.020]   So I'm just like, in that way, you know, yes, I might miss on being on an MSNBC, but dang
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:25.020]   it.
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:28.260]   I'm going to get my workout in for the day.
[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:29.260]   Yes.
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:30.260]   Fair enough.
[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:31.260]   Fair enough.
[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:33.860]   When do you go back to Tejas?
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:35.340]   August 15th.
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:39.420]   And then I leave again to go to Banff.
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.060]   And then, oh, why?
[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:42.060]   I know.
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:47.060]   I do anything I can to avoid Texas.
[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:50.300]   Banff is a 40th birthday present to myself, my best friend.
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:52.060]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:53.580]   Sounds fun.
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:55.820]   It will be.
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:56.820]   Yes.
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:57.820]   And almost happy birthday.
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:58.820]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:00.420]   My birthday was months ago.
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:01.420]   Oh, happy birthday.
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:02.420]   Oh, then.
[01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:03.420]   Yes.
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:04.420]   Months ago.
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:05.420]   It's a 41st thing.
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.140]   Hey, hey, we're not there yet.
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.780]   Come on, man.
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:09.780]   Happy Wednesday.
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:10.780]   How about the old?
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:11.780]   Happy Wednesday.
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.900]   Hey, how do you guys feel about notches?
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:16.620]   I think I know how good it feels about notches.
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:20.420]   So, why my notches?
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.860]   You just kind of go blind to them, but three notches.
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:24.020]   Where are they putting all these notches?
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:25.020]   That was my question.
[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:27.060]   I'm not sure that we'll see a three not.
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:33.020]   Well, we definitely won't on Android because apparently only two notches are allowed in
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:39.020]   Android P. They've mandated a requirement of only two notches, only the bottom and top
[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.100]   and only one per side.
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:44.260]   So, in other words, you couldn't have your two notches both on top.
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:48.180]   Not sure why you would want to do that, but Google has gone to the lengths to make sure
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:49.180]   that you don't.
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:50.180]   Because who knows?
[01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:52.980]   Like, you know, someone might just die on a phone.
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:53.980]   It's all notches.
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:54.980]   Yeah.
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:59.260]   It's kind of what I was thinking like almost like a border, a border of notches.
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:00.660]   Yeah, like a scrapbook border.
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:02.780]   Like a cute little like.
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:03.780]   Why?
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:04.780]   Because we can.
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.580]   This is for the notch lover.
[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:08.740]   Oh, you know, did you guys read?
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:10.140]   It was in Logic Magazine.
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:11.940]   I thought this was really fascinating.
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:14.300]   Where is my copy of Logic Magazine?
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:16.300]   Do you actually have that?
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:17.780]   No, I've never heard of it.
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:18.780]   Oh, I was like, are you?
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:19.780]   Do you really?
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:20.780]   I never heard of it.
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:21.780]   So, I was like, wow, Jeff.
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.980]   It was on Shenzhen.
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:33.700]   And this whole creation of how Chinese manufacturing is like changing basically how Chinese manufacturing
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:38.700]   is grown to this like wild and crazy world where people just build on top of bills and
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:43.140]   they were talking about like people designing phones that have a compass that points to
[01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:45.540]   Mecca and it's popular in the Islamic world.
[01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:50.740]   It was just like, it felt like science fiction, the world that they were describing.
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:52.900]   It was such a fascinating article.
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:55.420]   And so now I'm sad that I cannot find it.
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:19:00.700]   But it was Logic Magazine letter from Shenzhen, I think.
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:06.780]   And I highly recommend everyone check this out because it was just a glimpse into this
[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:12.220]   culture that, wow, you know, that's.
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:15.860]   What's the company that makes all the phones?
[01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:16.860]   Fox.
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:17.860]   Yeah, Foxconn.
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:22.420]   A friend of mine went there for me with the high executives and just the story of going
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:26.260]   into the belly of the beast and Foxconn is amazing.
[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:27.660]   Yeah.
[01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:34.860]   So this is Logic.iO is called letter from Shenzhen.
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:37.460]   I put the link at the bottom of the dock.
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:42.940]   It's called Shanzai, which is like knockoffs.
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:48.300]   But now they're calling it the new Shanzai and it's like this concept of basically kind
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:51.140]   of like open source hardware where people just build on top of other stuff like the
[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:58.700]   long tail of Chris Anderson's long tail in physical goods and technology.
[01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:03.460]   So super crazy, super fun.
[01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:04.460]   I want to live it.
[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:07.140]   I kind of made me want to live there just to see all the crazy stuff, but I don't really
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:11.460]   want to live in China because, you know, I'm a journalist and I like saying things.
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:13.460]   You're uncensored Google.
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:14.460]   I do.
[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:15.460]   I like Google.
[01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:21.460]   But the parallels they were making is like we think like in urban areas, we might be
[01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:26.700]   used to all this, but even in super rural areas, these guys are can do all this crazy
[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:31.060]   stuff with their just their mobile phones and I don't know.
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:32.900]   Go read it and be like, dang it.
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:35.540]   No wonder China's going to kick our butts.
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:39.540]   So that'll be included in the show.
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:44.500]   That'll be included in the show notes as well.
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:46.300]   Let me think here.
[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.700]   What else do we got?
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:51.940]   Well, we're probably also going to see not that it really matters to very many people
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:52.940]   anymore.
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:59.100]   A updated daydream viewer at the event I'm guessing because apparently the headset is
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:02.340]   now $70 off that began today.
[01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:04.060]   So they're blowing out the daydream view.
[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:06.340]   It's 30 bucks now at Verizon.
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:12.340]   The description lists the item as EOL skew so end of life.
[01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:18.340]   So I can only imagine that a new daydream viewer is around the corner using it.
[01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:20.340]   Phone though, I suppose I'm guessing.
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:25.340]   I mean, they have the standalone one by the Lenovo, I believe.
[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:27.940]   Of course, it's Oculus instead.
[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:31.020]   Yeah, the Oculus go.
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:34.940]   So Dr. Androids, what are you thinking of this pixel watch?
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:41.100]   Oh, Dr. Androids, I like that.
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:45.300]   I mean, I'm having a hard time getting excited about watch anymore.
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:50.700]   I suppose that the Wear OS thing kind of passed me by at this point.
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:56.780]   But I'm really surprised that up until now Google hasn't done their own pixel watch
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:57.780]   of sorts.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.700]   And we've been hearing about rumors that it might happen for quite a while.
[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:05.580]   A few months back, Eveleagues again tweeted that there would be an unveiling at this event
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:11.620]   also updated Pixel 2 buds or Pixel Buds Generation 2.
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:15.740]   But now we're hearing that there's going to be possibly three different versions of
[01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:18.540]   the watch, the pixel watch.
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:23.940]   Some of those versions with heart rate sensor, all using a new version of the Snapdragon
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:26.700]   Wear 30 100 system on a chip.
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:29.940]   And this has kind of been in the works for a while by Qualcomm.
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:32.140]   And then of course, always on a stick.
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:37.140]   Do you think the watch needs its own sim or his own phone?
[01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:39.340]   Um, I do.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:40.340]   You do.
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:44.860]   I never figure out if I really needed it or not because I always have my phone on me
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:45.860]   anyways.
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.300]   But why do you need one?
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:50.540]   So I would need it because I don't carry my phone all the time.
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:53.900]   So I like to go running or walking and doing things with my phone.
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:54.900]   How do you do that?
[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:55.900]   How do you do that?
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:58.660]   I know, Jeff, I look again, this this FOMO thing.
[01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:03.580]   I'm like, eh, so, but I like to have my music, for example.
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:07.580]   And I like to, you know, this way I don't actually have to worry about missing out or
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.340]   I need directions.
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:14.180]   So those kind of things being in my phone are actually really useful.
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:19.980]   Kevin is called me from his Apple watch, which I don't really recommend, but you know,
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:22.420]   it sounds fine.
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:23.420]   And I don't know.
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:28.460]   I think for, depending on the price, obviously, but if it's a reasonable price, I'd love
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:30.060]   having data in my watch.
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:36.260]   Well, I mean, no matter what, it's a monthly data fee that you have to kind of factor
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:37.260]   in.
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:41.420]   So I guess you just have to ask yourself, like, does this thing, this piece of technology
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:44.820]   that I wear on my wrist, is it worth a monthly fee?
[01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:50.340]   I don't know if you can get a, I mean, five, ten bucks a month.
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:52.540]   Is Phi data only?
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:55.700]   Phi data only is you don't be in the three talks a month without, are you?
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:57.380]   I don't think so.
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.380]   Is that, is that on cellular?
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:04.700]   Yeah, the Phi, you get a Phi data only set, right, right.
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:05.700]   Okay.
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:06.700]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:07.700]   So something like that for 10 bucks a month.
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:08.700]   I don't know.
[01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:10.980]   Is it 10 bucks a month worthwhile?
[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:11.980]   Probably.
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:16.300]   I mean, I spend hours without my phone.
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:18.580]   Plus I wander around my house without my phone.
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:19.580]   Easy.
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.540]   Well, I don't have pockets.
[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:26.780]   Women's clothing doesn't have pockets and phones are freaking huge.
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:33.420]   So even when I do have pockets, then I have this heavy, big, old, ucky phone.
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:36.340]   When I see somebody now, I used to do this in the trio days.
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:38.140]   Used to have the old belt clip.
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:42.980]   I see that now and I think how dorky can you get.
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:46.060]   But like, if you have it in your jacket pocket, I hate this.
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:50.460]   My husband, the dry spleen nuts, it ruins the line of his suits and he's just like, I
[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:51.460]   don't care.
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:56.740]   But I'm just like, and if you're wearing jeans and you shove it in your back pocket,
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:25:01.300]   that is prime spot for your phone to go into the toilet when you pull down.
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:03.140]   It's happened to me.
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.580]   It's happened to everyone.
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:05.740]   I mean, come on.
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:08.540]   That's why you need a waterproof phone.
[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:10.540]   Even then.
[01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:11.540]   Yeah.
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:12.540]   I'm like, and Lysol wipes?
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.540]   I don't know.
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:15.900]   No, just waterproof.
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:16.900]   That's all you need.
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:17.900]   No.
[01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:23.100]   I just looked up the, what is it data only on product Fi?
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:26.300]   I guess I didn't realize that's no additional monthly cost.
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:28.580]   You just get the sim and it ties into your normal.
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:30.420]   It ties in for the same data?
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:31.420]   That's what I'm seeing here.
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:32.420]   Cost.
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.420]   No monthly cost.
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:34.420]   Just pay for the data.
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:35.420]   Oh my God.
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:36.420]   I want this in my devices.
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:37.420]   Oh yes.
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:40.020]   This high tech HDMI connection we have here.
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:41.020]   No monthly cost.
[01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:44.020]   Just pay for the data you use at the usual 10 gigabyte.
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:49.260]   Is that a separate $10 a month or is it included in your own?
[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:54.460]   At the time for the data you use at the usual 10 gig rate.
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:59.540]   So if you have two devices or you pay $10 a month, $10 a gig or does it combine the
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:00.540]   same gigs?
[01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:03.100]   That's a good question.
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:04.980]   All the gigs are different, Jeff.
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:05.980]   All the gigs are different.
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:06.980]   I would think so.
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:07.980]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:10.140]   I loved my Nexus 7 dearly.
[01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:13.780]   I missed that, which also fit in my back pocket by the way, but I knew it was there
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:17.620]   before I started sitting down.
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:18.620]   And it had a sim in it.
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:20.380]   It was a beautiful thing.
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:22.260]   I loved it.
[01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:24.100]   Yeah.
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:29.020]   I don't know if I'd pay extra for a sim in my watch, but hey, if I was on, well, I
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:33.180]   am on Project Fi and if I had a watch and I could just do it a data only sim and it
[01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:35.780]   would tie into my normal data usage.
[01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:37.620]   Yeah, hell I got.
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:38.620]   Add the up.
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.020]   Why not?
[01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:42.620]   No extra fee, but I'll pay for the data that it uses.
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:43.620]   Why not?
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:48.780]   So yeah, I'll be curious to see on that regard.
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:50.260]   What else are we missing here?
[01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:52.420]   I know that there's a bunch of other stuff in here.
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:53.820]   Is there anything you guys are?
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:57.820]   Oh, Google cleaning up the Play Store.
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:26:58.820]   That's happening.
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:26:59.900]   I saw that.
[01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:03.140]   I was not like that Apple did that a while ago.
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:04.140]   Yeah.
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:05.340]   It didn't seem.
[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:06.340]   It seemed really reasonable.
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:07.340]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:09.180]   Nothing jumped out of me like, oh my God.
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:10.180]   What are they doing?
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:12.460]   Well, actually they're doing a number of things too.
[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:18.700]   Like the cryptocurrency ban, the cryptocurrency mining apps from the Play Store are now banned.
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:23.020]   That seemed to get the majority of the news, which is what Apple did very recently.
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:24.380]   They also kind of blocked this.
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:28.260]   And Google's done this in a number of different ways with Chrome extensions and its Web Store
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:29.260]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:34.700]   So they're basically saying if you're managing with an app, cryptocurrency mining in the cloud,
[01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:35.700]   that's OK.
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:37.540]   But on device, it's not OK.
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:45.660]   But they also are prohibiting a bunch of other app behaviors, let's say, in this post.
[01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:51.940]   Repetitive apps, so apps that have a very similar user experience or very highly similar
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:53.340]   content to other apps.
[01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:57.700]   So if there are multiples that offer that are basically the same, those are no longer
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:28:03.940]   allowed apps based on templates, apps where the singular purpose is serving ads.
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:08.100]   And I don't know if you've ever seen an app where it's like an ad appears after every
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:11.820]   single flipping thing you do inside of it.
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:17.300]   And that app is probably not for anything other than generating revenue based on the
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:19.420]   ads that are being served to you.
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:23.540]   Apps that appeal to children but contain adult themes, apps that facilitate the sales of
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:27.740]   firearms and explosives or instruct on the creation of them.
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:32.980]   And then finally, apps that intentionally mislead users, which, wait a minute, that wasn't
[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:34.180]   a rule before.
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:36.220]   But OK.
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:38.260]   Good that it is now, I suppose.
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:40.380]   So cleaning things up in the Play Store.
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:42.860]   I mean, at this point, the Play Store is just so filled.
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:46.060]   You got to clean it up a little bit.
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:53.580]   Yeah, I can't believe we've gone through so much stuff.
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:56.620]   Here's what here's the story we're talking about with that.
[01:28:56.620 --> 01:29:00.660]   New York City kicking spectrum formerly known as time Warner Cable out.
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:03.300]   I think it's a big deal.
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:04.940]   That is a big deal.
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:11.420]   And what I think is super ironic because way back in the day when the case, OK, so they're
[01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:15.060]   going to do there because my question was, well, holy cow, how are they going to do
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.060]   that?
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:18.820]   And they want to revoke its franchise agreement.
[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:26.860]   And the irony here is when the cable guys wanted to launch broadband and voice services,
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:32.500]   they appealed, they used to have to get their franchise agreements at each municipality.
[01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:34.940]   And they were like, God, that's such a pain for these new services.
[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:40.820]   We want to launch so instead so we can compete better with the telcos, let's just get it statewide.
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:45.340]   And so they managed to get pushed that through in a lot of different locations, including
[01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:47.340]   New York and Texas.
[01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:52.780]   And now New York has this massive stick they can just pummel them with and be like, you
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:55.340]   did not meet your standards.
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:57.980]   You did not treat rural people correctly.
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:29:59.980]   You did not deploy what you said you were going to deploy.
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:02.700]   So no more franchise for you.
[01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:05.100]   I have to assume that they're going to fight this.
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:06.420]   Oh, they are.
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:09.060]   But let's say they did get forced out.
[01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:11.260]   They sell the infrastructure to another comer.
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:12.260]   Is there a price?
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:13.740]   How does that work, Amanda?
[01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:20.780]   Well, they said that they said that they had 60 days to find another comer to come in
[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:26.100]   because the other thing is, and they would have to, they did say that they would have
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:28.700]   to sell some of their infrastructure.
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:34.380]   Now this is where the lawsuits get really crazy because, I mean, can you really force
[01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:37.020]   a cable company to sell off their infrastructure?
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:41.740]   Because, I mean, on one hand, you're like, New York has said, it's illegal for you to
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:42.820]   sell services here.
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:46.380]   So it's the opposite of them in a domain, I guess.
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:47.380]   Yeah.
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:48.860]   I don't really know.
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:49.860]   Yeah.
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:51.340]   This is kind of unprecedented.
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:53.540]   Yeah, I was amazed.
[01:30:53.540 --> 01:31:00.460]   But because the telcos and the cable companies have promised this stuff for years.
[01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:04.260]   They've done this for decades and knowing it, they make it a fine or two.
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:06.140]   But for the most part, we just let it lie.
[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:08.700]   Like, oh, yeah, screw those rural people.
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:09.940]   They didn't get what they wanted.
[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:12.060]   That's why they had such a crap broadband.
[01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:15.900]   So yay for New York for doing this.
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:18.900]   Especially since our forensics is-
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:23.740]   And holds a cudgel over the other companies.
[01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:28.100]   I got to say this, I have had huge problems on the show over the years of the Verizon mobile.
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:30.820]   My Verizon files is, God bless amazing.
[01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:32.940]   We had an outage recently for a few hours.
[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:35.740]   First time I can remember.
[01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:36.740]   It's great service.
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:39.060]   But not everyone can get files.
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:40.300]   And Verizon said, you know what?
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:41.300]   I know.
[01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:42.300]   We're going to stop deploying this.
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:43.300]   I know.
[01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:45.820]   It's tragic because it's some very good service.
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:46.820]   Yeah.
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:49.580]   Well, apparently.
[01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:50.580]   Not good enough.
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:52.580]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:53.580]   Anyway.
[01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:57.220]   I always dread that they're going to sell it to somebody like Charter.
[01:31:57.220 --> 01:31:58.220]   You know?
[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:05.300]   I mean, in some ways broadband has become basic infrastructure like electricity and
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:06.300]   water.
[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:10.020]   And there are arguments that, you know, maybe more of it should be municipally owned.
[01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:12.780]   I don't know if that's where we should go with that.
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:17.180]   But we should have, I don't know, that we've never been to.
[01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:20.100]   I'm not going to get into this.
[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:21.580]   Too late.
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:24.740]   Stacey gets sad to be about our lack of competitive broadband.
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:25.740]   I am a communist.
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.540]   I mean, I'm not.
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:28.540]   But.
[01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:31.660]   You want to talk about facial recognition?
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:36.580]   And how the ACLU used Amazon's recognition.
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:38.420]   Recognition with a K.
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:44.420]   Recognition with a K. And, you know, we're trying to kind of make a point, I imagine,
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:48.620]   by running, what did they run here?
[01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:52.700]   Just a number of, you know, the members of Congress, I think all the members of Congress
[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:57.740]   through the system to see if it matched up, if it paired up through the facial recognition
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:04.420]   algorithm with people who, you know, may have been arrested for a crime at some point.
[01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:13.740]   It erroneously identified 28 members of Congress through the system at an 80% of matter rate,
[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:16.420]   if I remember correctly.
[01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:18.500]   So there you have that.
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:21.500]   The software was set at 80, 80% confidence setting.
[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:24.060]   Apparently that's the default.
[01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:27.700]   And Amazon said after the fact, well, we recommend 95% percent.
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:32.860]   Because at 80% more matches happen than should.
[01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:37.140]   But they don't necessarily like the default setting is 80%.
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:41.900]   The reason it's 80% though is because you have the same people.
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:45.740]   If you're dealing with like security photos, for example, you're going to have crappier
[01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:46.740]   photography.
[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:49.740]   You're not going to have a straight on image of someone.
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:52.020]   So that's the reason they suggested.
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:56.740]   So it's a chance to get more images of the same person.
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:01.300]   Like if you're trying to match somebody in a crappy photo, I'm just.
[01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:06.340]   I'm not saying that this is, but there's you can play it both ways.
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.340]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:11.060]   No, and that's a really interesting perspective on that.
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:12.980]   I hadn't heard or read about that.
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:15.060]   So that's a good point.
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:22.500]   However, you know, but at the same time, 28, 28 matchups to those with mug shots proves
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:25.060]   at least a certain point, right?
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.700]   Yeah, it does.
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:31.180]   I mean, and they talk about how cheap it is, which I think we should have less than the
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:32.180]   mug shots.
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:38.740]   The fact that you can take 25,000 mug shots, train something, run it through and then run
[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:42.740]   the database of Congress, whatever.
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:46.020]   And it only cost you $12 and 33 cents.
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:49.220]   That to me is like, Oh, cow.
[01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:56.300]   So imagine taking all the images, like imagine you're a stalker or something creepy.
[01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:59.540]   Those are the kind of things that I worry about less.
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:01.900]   I mean, yes, I do worry about racial bias.
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:02.900]   That's not true.
[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:03.900]   I do worry about that.
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:08.780]   But this makes this technology super accessible in ways that I don't think we're quite aware.
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:14.900]   I mean, you could build an app that scans public parks for your employees who say they're
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:20.180]   out sick if you wanted to, if you were that kind of a player.
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:21.180]   Yeah.
[01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:24.380]   So I don't know.
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:27.420]   Interesting to say the least.
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:29.340]   All right.
[01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:33.940]   I think unless there is something that I am missing, I mean, the only thing that we didn't
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:39.820]   talk about was free guacamole fail at Chipotle because I know you guys like to talk about
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:41.060]   Chipotle.
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:44.740]   What was the free guacamole fail?
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:47.340]   You could get free guacamole if you ordered online.
[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:48.340]   I think it wasn't.
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:49.340]   Of course it crashed.
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:55.020]   Oh, that's like the Amazon free echo spot that was not Chipotle just made a bunch of
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:56.780]   people sick in Ohio.
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:57.780]   Really?
[01:35:57.780 --> 01:35:58.780]   Oh, it's sad.
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:01.380]   Why does this keep happening in Chipotle?
[01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:03.780]   Because they like those fresh ingredients.
[01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:07.100]   And let me tell you, when you have fresh ingredients, you got to clean them real well.
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:08.900]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:09.900]   No kidding.
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:12.140]   Oh, oh, parasites.
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:13.860]   I like me some Chipotle.
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.460]   I don't like me some parasites.
[01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:19.060]   What does it kill you makes you stronger?
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:20.060]   That's true.
[01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:26.380]   This episode of this week in Google is brought to you by our sponsor, Wink, spelled W-I-N-C.
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:32.380]   If I ask you to pick out a wine that you'll love, but you haven't had before, are you even
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:34.060]   going to know where to start?
[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:35.380]   Where would you start?
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:38.580]   Wink makes it easy to discover great wine.
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:39.580]   This is awesome.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:45.740]   We love that we can have everything delivered to our door these days and discover new things
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:46.740]   through these services.
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:48.220]   Well, now it's wine.
[01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:52.660]   If you like wine and you want to be a little surprised about what you receive, this is
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:53.660]   the perfect way to do it.
[01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:59.460]   Wink's wine experts select wines that are matched to your taste, personalized for you,
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:04.620]   and shipped right to your door starts at just $13 a bottle.
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:10.980]   And you think that you like coming home and finding mail in the mailbox or maybe somebody
[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:15.220]   shipped a present to you or whatever, there's nothing quite like coming home to a box of
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:17.980]   delicious Wink wine that's selected just for you.
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:19.980]   You're going to want to drink it that night, of course.
[01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:22.580]   It's the best day of the month and you're going to look forward to it.
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:29.220]   Just fill out Wink's palette profile quiz, simple questions that your average store clerk
[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:34.620]   wouldn't ask or be able to translate into a recommendation.
[01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:36.980]   Questions like, how do you take your coffee?
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:38.460]   How do you feel about blueberries?
[01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:39.460]   That sort of stuff.
[01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:42.980]   Then Wink sends wines curated to your taste.
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:48.260]   And the more wines that you rate, the more personalized your monthly selections.
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:50.780]   And Wink is not just a wine club.
[01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:52.620]   It's a wine company.
[01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:56.700]   Wink works directly with top winemakers and growers from around the world to make all
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:58.820]   of their own wines.
[01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:02.140]   So each month, there are new delicious wines.
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:05.940]   I'm just pulling them out of this huge box here.
[01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:10.220]   Outer Sounds 2017 Sauvignon Blanc.
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:11.220]   There we go.
[01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:13.340]   All, well, what else do we have in here?
[01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:23.820]   We have the Diviner Santa Inez Valley Santa Barbara County Cabernet Sauvignon 2016 bottle
[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:24.820]   right here.
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:27.020]   So there's four bottles in the box.
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:31.980]   And this will keep you busy for a little while until the next shipment anyways.
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:33.260]   All sorts of other wines that they send.
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:35.980]   They also partner with local artists to develop wine labels.
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:40.700]   So these wine labels that you see, unique works of art on the bottles.
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:42.140]   No membership fees.
[01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:43.620]   You can skip any month.
[01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:45.180]   Maybe you're traveling this month.
[01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:46.820]   So you want to suspend it.
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:47.820]   You can do that.
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:49.300]   You can cancel anytime.
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:50.300]   Shipping is covered.
[01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:52.900]   And if you don't like a bottle that they send you, guess what?
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:55.180]   They'll replace it with a bottle that you're going to love.
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:56.980]   No questions asked.
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:38:59.060]   That's pretty awesome.
[01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:03.620]   So sit back and relax or celebrate with Wink.
[01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:06.340]   You don't have to settle for the same bottle of wine that you always get.
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:10.020]   Discover great wine today and kind of change it up for yourself.
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:13.140]   Go to trywink.com/twig.
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:16.260]   You're going to get $20 off your first shipment.
[01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:17.220]   That's trywink.
[01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:23.900]   T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com/twig for $20 off.
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:25.460]   That's trywink.com/twig.
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:30.700]   Thank Wink for their support of this week in Google and for filling our glasses with
[01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:33.300]   a nice glass of wine.
[01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:34.300]   All right.
[01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:38.300]   So Jeff, what might I ask is your number this week?
[01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:39.780]   Just a simple one.
[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:45.540]   9 to 5 Google is happy because this is the five year anniversary of what they call Google's
[01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:48.660]   first hardware win, the Chromecast.
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:49.660]   First hardware win?
[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:50.660]   I guess so.
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:51.660]   I was thinking about that.
[01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:54.220]   I was wondering if we'd discuss that.
[01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:56.220]   When did the Nexus come out?
[01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:58.140]   Does that not win?
[01:39:58.140 --> 01:39:59.140]   That's the question.
[01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:00.140]   Was that a win?
[01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:02.140]   And was that Google specifically?
[01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:05.140]   You know, Chromecast was Google created hardware.
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:06.140]   Nexus was always...
[01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:07.140]   Oh, that's true.
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:09.140]   It was always a different case.
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:10.620]   It changed how it first.
[01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:12.780]   A real elegance from the beginning.
[01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:16.460]   It wasn't a wait for the version 3, they figured this out.
[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:19.260]   It was useful and fun from the very beginning.
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:20.780]   So congratulations.
[01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:24.300]   Mazelplow to Chromecast.
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:26.060]   And it's evolved over the years.
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:30.180]   Now you can do 4K HDR with the latest one.
[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:36.300]   Initially it was a stick and then they went with a kind of floppy kind of hang behind
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:37.300]   the TV model.
[01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:38.300]   So it could fit in the odd places?
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:40.380]   Yeah, so it could fit wherever you wanted it to go.
[01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:46.900]   Now it's baked into Android TV that no one has.
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:52.060]   And also by the way, one of my favorite things was Chromecast Audio, which now I don't need
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:54.060]   because that's basically what I...
[01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:58.660]   You know, one of the many things that we use our Google Homes for, for kind of simultaneously
[01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:03.260]   playing music in different rooms before Google Home, you would do that with Chromecast Audio
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:05.940]   and have that hooked up to your stereo system.
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:09.180]   So yeah, good line up of hardware.
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:12.060]   I think that really has worked with Google over the years.
[01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:14.100]   And it passed the parent test.
[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:17.260]   When I went home to see my parents a couple of years ago, I brought a Chromecast that I
[01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:20.820]   had and I connected it to their TV and I showed my mom on her iPad.
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:23.780]   I'm like, "When you want to watch Netflix," which I also signed her up for at that same
[01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:24.780]   trip.
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:27.140]   I said, "You push this button on the tablet and it sends it.
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:29.580]   Just make sure you're on the right input on your TV."
[01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:32.300]   And two days later I called to check in and I'm like, "How's that work?"
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:33.300]   And she's like, "It works great."
[01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:35.300]   So I was like, "Wow, that was easy."
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:36.300]   Oh, that was never happened with mine.
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:37.300]   I was so...
[01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:38.300]   I don't know, I'd get the call.
[01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:39.300]   What did you do to roll the TV?
[01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:40.300]   I can't watch Fox News.
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:41.300]   Oh no.
[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:42.300]   I expected that.
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:43.300]   I did it.
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:45.300]   It did not be easy and it worked.
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:52.660]   Although I like your subtle direction there.
[01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:53.660]   Figure way around it.
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:54.660]   Cool.
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:55.660]   Happy birthday, Chromecast.
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:58.020]   Stacy, what do you got?
[01:41:58.020 --> 01:41:59.500]   Okay.
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:03.060]   Because I am traveling, I do not have a fun gadget to show you, but I did promise you
[01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:10.380]   guys a review of a gadget that I showed a couple weeks ago, which was the Ozzram Lidify
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:14.900]   Outdoor RGBs lights.
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:20.300]   And they're relevant because Philips Hue is actually implementing or offering some new
[01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:21.500]   outdoor lights.
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:29.100]   So these were 60 bucks and they think they extended about 10 feet and they produce a
[01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:31.700]   lot of light, you guys.
[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:37.100]   They don't do a true white because it's just RGB, but the colors they do produce are beautiful
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:42.740]   and they go, I have a, it's two stories at that part of my house.
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:47.420]   So a two story house and you can see it all the way up the side of the house and it lights
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:50.220]   the bushes up really well there.
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:57.420]   So the one sad thing that I didn't like about these lights was that what was it?
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:43:00.580]   Oh, you can't individually change the color on each light.
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:03.980]   So there are nine lights and they, if they're going to be blue, they're all nine could be
[01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:04.980]   blue.
[01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:08.020]   So, but you're in the market for outdoor lights.
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:10.420]   These are quite nice.
[01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:12.180]   Nice.
[01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:13.900]   Nice thing.
[01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:21.900]   And then I, so I've complained about this recently on Twitter because I feel like, I
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:27.620]   feel like robocalls and spam calls to my, my cell phone have like gone out of hand.
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:28.620]   Like it's crazy.
[01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:30.740]   I get, I get multiples in a single day.
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:35.300]   I wasn't sure if it happened when I switched over to project five, it was a symptom of
[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:38.940]   that, but I'm pretty sure it's just everybody's getting these right now.
[01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:39.940]   Mm hmm.
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:41.860]   And there's a number of things that you can do.
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:45.420]   Actually, this, this weekend on the new screensavers, I cover a bunch of different things that
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:46.420]   you can try to do to help.
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:50.740]   But one thing I wanted to point out because I feel like somewhere in the news cycle, this
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:52.580]   really went under the radar.
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:57.540]   I didn't find out about it until a few weeks later, but if you go into the Google phone
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:03.980]   app, just the standard Google phone app and you go into your settings, there is a, there's
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:06.900]   an area in the settings that's caller ID and spam.
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:12.980]   You may remember a year ago, they added functionality that would pop up like a big red banner when
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:18.460]   a spam call comes, says suspected spam caller and it's like flashing red.
[01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:22.020]   And so you of course never answer it because like, why are you going to pick that up?
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:23.620]   Obviously, you know, it's on the other side.
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:26.460]   Google's telling you, well, they added a new feature to that.
[01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:31.140]   If you go into the settings that is filter spam calls and what that does is.
[01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:32.580]   Oh, that goes.
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:33.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:37.820]   Instead of seeing that red banner now, when it identifies it with the red banner, it's
[01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:39.420]   not even going to send it to your phone.
[01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:40.420]   You won't get a call anymore.
[01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:42.620]   It's going to go directly to your voicemail.
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:45.740]   And so it's one last thing you have to worry about.
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:49.820]   Wait a second because I am currently in my phone app show.
[01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:50.820]   Oh, show me.
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:54.980]   I was trying to find it because I'm not seeing the option to do this.
[01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:56.380]   Oh, is your phone app.
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:44:58.740]   You go back, Jason, to show where you got to it.
[01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:03.660]   Well, here, let me try and do this without showing everything.
[01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:05.060]   So that's my one.
[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:06.060]   That's OK.
[01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:08.780]   But the overflow menu settings.
[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:09.780]   OK.
[01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:11.620]   Hopefully, you saw enough there.
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:13.620]   Caller ID and spam.
[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:15.020]   Yeah, I don't have that.
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:16.020]   OK.
[01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:19.180]   So what are you carrying these days?
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:23.020]   I have my Pixel 2, Pixel 2.
[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:24.020]   Yes.
[01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:25.020]   You should have it.
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:28.100]   I'm like, it is up to date.
[01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:29.100]   That's the same.
[01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:30.100]   Huh.
[01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:31.100]   I'll see.
[01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:32.100]   I wonder why.
[01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:34.940]   It's the straight up phone app, right?
[01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:35.940]   Yeah.
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:36.940]   Default audio.
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:38.180]   Yeah, just making sure that's the straight.
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:39.580]   Yeah, I got it.
[01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:42.340]   If I hit that, I just get uninstall updates.
[01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:43.340]   Oh, that's--
[01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:45.620]   Instead, that's so weird.
[01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:46.620]   So weird.
[01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:49.500]   And if I go to advanced, I can go to modify system settings.
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:50.500]   But that is not what it is.
[01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:53.700]   It sounds like the same app.
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:54.980]   Is that-- are you in fact?
[01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:56.620]   Phone or contacts or--
[01:45:56.620 --> 01:45:58.100]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:45:58.100 --> 01:45:59.340]   Oh, oh, there we go.
[01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:00.340]   OK.
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:01.340]   So show--
[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:02.340]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:03.340]   She held down.
[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:04.340]   She held it down.
[01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:06.220]   Just click on it.
[01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:07.140]   Oh, so--
[01:46:07.140 --> 01:46:09.100]   No, just go into the phone app.
[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:11.740]   Don't go into the settings into your settings.
[01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:11.740]   Oh.
[01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:13.420]   Like you're going to make a college call.
[01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:16.580]   Yeah, so just go into the phone app, overflow menu,
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:18.540]   settings from within the phone app.
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:19.540]   There we go.
[01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:20.540]   I was confused.
[01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:21.540]   Sorry.
[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:22.540]   I was--
[01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:23.540]   No, I was confused.
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:24.540]   I don't want to write that.
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:27.020]   I was just facing if you made a fun to meet the first half
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:28.020]   hour of the show.
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:30.020]   One to one.
[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:31.020]   Awesome.
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:32.020]   And she just--
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:33.020]   I'm just tired.
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:34.020]   You feel better.
[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:35.020]   Guys are tired.
[01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:36.020]   Yeah.
[01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:37.020]   So now you won't get those red things out.
[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:38.860]   I'm getting more calls that aren't identified as spam.
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:39.860]   Yeah.
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:40.860]   They just go right to voicemail.
[01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:41.860]   And of course, you won't get a voicemail.
[01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:44.420]   Because they'll be like, oh, the voicemail.
[01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:45.980]   Well, that would be the worst if they filled it.
[01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:47.660]   Oh my gosh, I hate people who leave voicemail.
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:48.980]   So I currently have two voicemails.
[01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:51.180]   And I'd load both people who put them in there.
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:52.180]   Yeah.
[01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:53.180]   I know.
[01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:57.740]   I'm pretty allergic to voicemail sees, Dave, as well.
[01:46:57.740 --> 01:46:58.740]   We did it.
[01:46:58.740 --> 01:46:59.740]   We made it.
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:00.740]   We did it.
[01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:01.740]   Good work, boss.
[01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:05.660]   Another this week in Google is in the history books almost
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:06.660]   anyways.
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:07.660]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:08.660]   It's always fun to do this.
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:09.620]   And I appreciate--
[01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:12.180]   I appreciate you allowing me to come on to the show
[01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:13.740]   and hang out with you guys.
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:17.500]   Jeff Jarvis, what do you want people to know about everything
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.500]   you're up to?
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:20.500]   Nothing.
[01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:21.180]   Nothing.
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:21.700]   OK.
[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:25.140]   Buzzmachine.com is all you really need to know.
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:26.140]   Add Jeff Jarvis.
[01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:27.140]   You need to slash Jeff Jarvis.
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:28.460]   There we go.
[01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:29.220]   See, that's bonus.
[01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:32.460]   That's bonus content.
[01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:33.460]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:35.460]   And Stacy, what about you?
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:38.380]   Where do you want to work on anything exciting that you
[01:47:38.380 --> 01:47:41.820]   want people to know about?
[01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:45.420]   No, just the usual newsletter every Friday.
[01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:48.700]   Stacy on IoT and the podcast every Thursday.
[01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:50.460]   Fantastic.
[01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:52.820]   Thank you, Stacy.
[01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:56.820]   We do the show of some of us or all of us.
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:59.380]   There's sometimes none of us because I'm not normally on
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:47:59.980]   Leo's here.
[01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:02.780]   But usually the show happens every Wednesday at 4 p.m.
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:07.980]   Eastern, 1 p.m. Pacific, maybe more like 130, to be honest.
[01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:11.180]   1,200 UTC at twit.tv/live.
[01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:13.700]   If you want to watch live, you can do that.
[01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:16.660]   We stream all of our shows, the recording of all of our shows,
[01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:18.700]   and a live continuous stream throughout the day
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:19.900]   at twit.tv/live.
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:23.060]   So you can tune in, take part in the chat room, and have fun.
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:25.060]   And sometimes even get involved in the show.
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:27.660]   Like, you put something in the chat room, and we pick up on it,
[01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:29.500]   and we bring you in.
[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:30.500]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:33.820]   If you catch this show in podcast form, you'll want to go
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:38.940]   to twit.tv/twit.tv/twig.
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:41.220]   There you will find all of our past episodes.
[01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:43.540]   You'll find ways to subscribe to all of our shows,
[01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:46.140]   audio feeds, video feeds.
[01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:46.740]   You name it.
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:48.140]   Everything's there.
[01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:51.140]   And you can start from the beginning, episode 1,
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:54.460]   and catch up, and become an expert in everything Google
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:57.460]   and the cloud and everything in between.
[01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:59.140]   But that is it for this week.
[01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:00.540]   It's been a lot of fun.
[01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:03.380]   I know that Leo is out of town in September
[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:05.140]   for a few weeks in a row, three weeks.
[01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:07.460]   So if anything, I'll see you guys then.
[01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:09.300]   It'll be a lot of fun.
[01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:12.420]   But until then, have a fantastic week.
[01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:14.140]   And the folks that surround me here,
[01:49:14.140 --> 01:49:16.380]   we'll see you next week on another episode of This Week
[01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:17.100]   in Google.
[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:17.540]   Bye, everybody.
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:20.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:49:20.900 --> 01:49:24.260]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:26.840]   (upbeat music)
