[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.800]   The show where we talk about Google, the cloud, Facebook,
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.200]   Twitter, whatever's on our mind.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.080]   A lot of media too because Jeff Jarvis is here,
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.320]   professor of journalism at CUNY, the City University of New York.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.080]   Thank you for coming out for our New Year's Eve party.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.440]   Jeff is still beardless, which he did for $20,000.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.960]   I am still hairless, which I did for $40,000.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.160]   We raised $75,000 for Unicef, the United Nations
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.800]   show was fun, isn't that great?
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.360]   Amazing.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.880]   Nice job.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.120]   That's Gina Trappani from ThinkUp.com.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.760]   Hello.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.240]   And all about Android.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.280]   And I have some very sad news.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.000]   This is her last Twig.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.320]   Well, my last weekly, right?
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.880]   I mean, I'm--
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.400]   We said come back whenever you want.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.720]   But I know that the business that I think up
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.560]   has gotten busy, busy, busy, and you just
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.920]   don't have time to do.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.320]   She's also leaving all about Android.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.760]   In fact, you don't have any podcasts, right?
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.280]   No.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.560]   No.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.280]   I won't be doing any podcasts the first time.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.360]   In like six years.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.600]   Yeah, this is just so sad and bittersweet.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.680]   But I started building this company, ThinkUp.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.840]   And I think we have a shot at making something
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.120]   that is sustainable.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.120]   But it's been-- it was like a weird kind of year.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.280]   2014 was hard.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.040]   We raised some venture capital, and then we figured out
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.520]   that we're a business, but we're not a venture capital
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.080]   business, meaning that we're not the hockey stick guys
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.280]   or 10 times, whatever.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.920]   We're just a regular business kind of building revenue
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.640]   very slowly.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.400]   So we decided, hey, we're not going to do VC.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.440]   We had to lay off a bunch of our team, which is really tough.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.400]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.880]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.440]   That's OK.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.600]   I mean, my team was fantastic, and everyone
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.400]   was extremely understanding, and totally got it.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.160]   Everyone landed on their feet, and it was a small team
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.440]   to begin with.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.400]   But yeah, it was tough.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.800]   It was definitely painful.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.520]   But you know, Anil, my co-founder, and I,
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.120]   really want to give this a go.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.960]   And we want to work on it full time, the two of us together.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.880]   And that's what we plan to do in 2015.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.760]   And so it's going to be a full time job and a half.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.000]   And I've just been trying to be real honest with him
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.920]   and with my family and try to figure out what's best.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.320]   You have a new baby, and I mean, you just moved.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.920]   And so there's a lot on your play.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.960]   I completely understand.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.080]   And I'm still bereft.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.960]   I'm still very sad.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.800]   Jeff and I had the same reaction the chat room is having
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.240]   right now, because they're hearing it for the first time.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.880]   I said, in capital S, this is horrible.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.680]   Jeff, what did you write?
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.200]   It was great.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.640]   I got to read Jeff's tribute to Gina.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.560]   Because it was-- you said it, of course,
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.320]   you're the words, Smith.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.320]   You said it better than either, at least, or I could do.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.040]   You're just quite moving.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.880]   Let me write it to you.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.400]   I am so depressed about this, Gina.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.880]   Oh, wait.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.840]   This is our email.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.320]   Yep.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.840]   If there's anything that would make the show possible,
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.280]   I'd be so happy to keep working with you.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.640]   And we have worked out something, so stay tuned.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.040]   Gina's genius is bringing both a technologist's perspective
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.880]   and a profoundly ethical view of technology.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.440]   And she's the nicest person I know.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.640]   These are going to be impossible shoes to fill.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.640]   We all agree.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.760]   Speaking of shoes, I then try to push Gina--
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.560]   Gina, pervericade.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.240]   But I tried to push that we could do this like a shark tank,
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.040]   where Barbara and Laurie shift off.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.720]   You could be the part time.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.720]   Your response, Gina?
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.840]   I said, I only wish that I could wear heels the way
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.480]   that Laurie and Barbara wear heels.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.920]   That email thread was quite fun, I must admit.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.440]   And Jeff really said it eloquently, for Lisa and me,
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.440]   both.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.120]   There's no way we can replace you.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.040]   You have agreed.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.960]   I'm happy to say to come back once a month.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.680]   Yes.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.520]   Yes.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.480]   And thank you for letting me do that,
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.080]   because I tell you the idea of quitting completely cold
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.440]   turkey really freaked me out.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.160]   This was such a hard decision.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.320]   We've been through a lot together.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.720]   It's been six years, 400 hours once a week.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.320]   I mean, I've lived in four different apartments.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.320]   I've done this show from people and offices
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.000]   from my mother's basement.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.560]   I mean, yeah, I had a child.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.000]   I mean, yeah, a lot has happened.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.480]   We've been together for a long time,
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.360]   and I really wrestled with it.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.760]   And it's just a matter of hours in the day.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.200]   And part of it is that I'm primarily a developer.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.680]   You guys are embedded in news, right?
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.880]   It's easy for us.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.280]   It's always about all week long.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.640]   But there have been times, and I'm sure,
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.760]   that our listeners have occurred.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.040]   There are times when I show up, and I'm like,
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.000]   I haven't heard the story.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.600]   I just haven't been reading the news.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.040]   So it's a little bit more prep time for me.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.800]   And it takes my hat out of, you know,
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.160]   I get into that coder flow thing.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.360]   And I'm just going to have more of my plate this year.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.040]   So it was such a hard decision.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.280]   But I've so enjoyed my time on the show.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.960]   And I am going to be back once a month.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.360]   Thank you.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.840]   And if I can harass Jason and Ron into having me on time--
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.760]   I don't think that'll be hard.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.760]   Horace.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.440]   Are you killing me?
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.720]   Hopefully, I can come on and do it.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.040]   Anytime you name the date, you're--
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.080]   Let me ask you this.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.520]   And to be honest with me, if you had won the Aparena,
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.640]   would you have stayed?
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.200]   Is this what we needed to do to keep you?
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.320]   Is that because I can fix it?
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.760]   I went out strong last night.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.720]   And I'll be doing a show the episode next week.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.720]   But yeah, no.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.720]   It was Ron's turn.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.120]   It was all good.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.640]   I needed to give Ron a run.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.320]   And I did.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.800]   I took him to the last episode of the year.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.240]   At this point, every regular host on all that Android
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.120]   has won a year.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.480]   So it kind of worked out in a strange way.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.920]   I still like it.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.840]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.360]   It has.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.880]   It has.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.360]   Well, you really are a huge part of Tuit.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.320]   And we won't let you go.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.160]   But we will let you have a little more time to yourself.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.800]   I understand that.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.280]   I appreciate that.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.120]   I appreciate that.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.080]   You've all been so supportive.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.000]   Door's always open.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.400]   You know that.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.080]   And so Jeff and I will soldier on without her.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.880]   We are going to--
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.840]   We're open to other--
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.920]   [SCREAMING]
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.280]   I know.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.120]   We're open.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.280]   We have so many great people who have filled in
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.640]   and have been on the show in the past.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.880]   Annie Sullivan, Kevin Marks, Matt Cutts.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.160]   In fact, I told Lisa, you know, call Matt
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.680]   and see if he left Google.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.120]   Because I could see this is Matt Cutts' new job.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.360]   Matthew Ingram.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.880]   So many good people have been on this show
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.760]   on a regular basis.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.560]   Kevin Tofel, Adam Pash.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.200]   So we have certainly plenty of people who will rotate in.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.080]   And we'll--
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.200]   I think--
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.240]   Well, Matt, you know, I think it's also really important.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.040]   I don't want to discuss that a little bit.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.000]   But a female perspective on this tech world is so valuable.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.360]   Well, that's right.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.840]   And so we are going to look for a woman.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.840]   I think it does, for sure.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.040]   But it's--
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.880]   You know, I was racking my brain.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.160]   That's what's wrong with technology.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.360]   It is so hard.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.200]   Janae, you're rare in more ways than one.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:01.960]   Yes.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.000]   Well, and the great women in tech are in great demand.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.440]   And there's a lot of competition.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.520]   But you made a suggestion.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.040]   We're going to call her.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.120]   I'm being an unabashed feminist and suggesting lots of--
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.120]   We need that.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.120]   Yes.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.120]   We need that.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.120]   We absolutely need that female perspective.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.120]   Keep the names coming.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.760]   On all our shows.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.680]   I make-- you know, Intel announced yesterday that they're
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.600]   going to devote $300 million to improving diversity at Intel,
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.440]   which is, you know, pretty much white and Asian men.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.560]   And they're going to fund scholarships.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.640]   They're going to do education.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.720]   They're going to create jobs to get African-Americans,
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.560]   people of color, but also women in the door there.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.080]   And it is something we all need to do so much.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.520]   And you have my commitment that throughout all of our shows
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.720]   that we're going to add diversity as much as we can.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.440]   And we really try as hard as we can.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.440]   Well, I want to help with that as much as you can.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.360]   So if you ever need suggestions, and I will continue
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.040]   to make the suggestions for my replacement here,
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.400]   but any time and any capacity, I want to help with that.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.080]   And I'd love to have a coder, because that
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.320]   was the other thing you brought here.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.120]   That's the other thing.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.360]   Exactly.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.360]   Right.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.640]   The real perspective is very valuable.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.880]   So we won't replace you, but we will find some other people
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.080]   to be on the show.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.560]   And there will always be a chair or an avatar,
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.480]   as we call these screens.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.120]   James, you're the best.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.200]   You're the best, Gina.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.560]   Thank you.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.000]   Now I know how Nick Denton felt.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Oh, well, screw Nick.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.320]   Heck, Nick.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.320]   Getting to the news, and we will do the final change log.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.880]   I don't know if we can do the change log, Jeff, without Gina.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.560]   I think that's her--
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.240]   We've screwed it up every time we fry.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.640]   We are so bad at that.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.720]   So bad.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.080]   Well, you'll find someone who can do the change log,
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.080]   or you can retire it and do a different segment.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.880]   Yeah, I figure out some.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.080]   The chair is so over-climped.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.080]   They're just--
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.040]   They're so sad.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.880]   I kind of almost feel bad for them.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.840]   Chatter them.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.640]   You guys are awesome.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.040]   This was really hard, but I'm actually
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.240]   glad that we got an out in the open.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.080]   And now I'm thinking about all the time
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.880]   we spent together and how great it is.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.000]   Yeah, we love having Gina on.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.280]   And by the way, speaking of Matt cuts $1,000
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.120]   from Mr. Matt for our UNICEF donation.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.120]   Oh, that smells good.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.560]   Smell it.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.840]   We'll also say his timing.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.160]   Why?
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.120]   Because he put us over 50.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.640]   I--
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.680]   His 30-day challenge is, can I get a tattoo on Leo's butt?
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.640]   And he succeeded.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:36.680]   It's amazing.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.400]   It's in one click of the pay-top button.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.760]   Or whatever it is.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.960]   He did his 30-day challenge.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.760]   Matt, I invite you to quit Google.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.040]   You're tired there.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.000]   Come to work for us.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.840]   OK, just telling you.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.880]   I'm just saying.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.400]   Google did finally weigh in on net neutrality.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.560]   Both Google and Microsoft fact, all the big tech giants,
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.120]   had stayed strangely silent in this--
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.280]   in the open comment period, where the FCC was deciding,
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.240]   how do we protect net neutrality?
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.720]   You remember President Obama suggested Title II regulation.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:12.160]   That's the part of the Telecommunications Act of 1934
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.440]   that allows the FCC to regulate common carriers.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.160]   In 1934, that meant the phone company.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.680]   One of the approaches to protecting net neutrality,
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.840]   even the court suggested this in the Verizon versus FCC case,
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.200]   would be to declare broadband providers common carriers.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.840]   Then the FCC would have jurisdiction.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.760]   There'd be a lot of rules that maybe we
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.840]   don't want applied to internet providers.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.320]   President Obama suggested a legal term called forbearance.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.200]   That is, the FCC could selectively enforce Title II.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.920]   Google has weighed in, finally, with a comment.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.560]   There was some thought that really the big tech giants
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.480]   were actually lobbying against Title II secretly
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.000]   through their lobbying, their governmental lobbying arms.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.920]   But Google filed a comment and said
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.520]   that if the FCC does treat broadband internet providers,
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.880]   like Google Fiber as telecommunications services,
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.840]   that would be potentially good for Google,
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.520]   because Google Fiber would then get access to utility polls
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.840]   and other essential infrastructure currently
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.840]   owned by the utilities, including other broadband
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.080]   providers.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:37.840]   Really thrilled to have Google make some statement in this regard.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.800]   And I'm kind of thrilled because it
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.480]   means Google may even be considering Google
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.760]   Fiber as a business, which we weren't sure.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.120]   We thought maybe--
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.120]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.640]   The statement is a little weird, though.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.160]   I mean, is this in support?
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.360]   I mean, it felt like a little bit of a zinger.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.360]   Like, oh, great.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.520]   We get access to the polls now.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.440]   It felt-- I wasn't sure.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.440]   It was a zinger to Comcast.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.240]   It's like, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.240]   Like, this is what we got there.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:05.880]   So what you said?
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.600]   Because Comcast has access to the polls, by the way.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.080]   AT&T, Comcast, all these others, they do have access.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.440]   Doctors-- Somebody on Twitter said,
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.640]   if we're at the point of negotiating the rate for access
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.560]   to the polls, then things have changed.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.320]   Right.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.120]   Google Fiber, which competes against Comcast and AT&T,
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.080]   does not have the right.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.520]   And the service has had trouble getting access to some polls
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.800]   as it builds out its fiber optic networked homes.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.040]   A lot cheaper to put a wire on a pole than a trench.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.000]   It's very expensive to dig.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.720]   So it's about a tenth the price of digging trenches.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.600]   Reid Hunt, who was chairman of the FCC in the '90s,
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.680]   said, "Pole access is fundamental,
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.900]   and Google will never be able to make the case for Google
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.760]   Fiber without it."
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.440]   If Title II gives Google pole access,
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.640]   then it might really rock the world with broadband access.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.320]   Please, wouldn't everybody--
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.440]   Well, maybe not everybody, but wouldn't-- almost everybody
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.560]   watching want to at least have the choice of Google Fiber.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:06.960]   Because you know what?
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.840]   Competition is good.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.880]   We believe in competition.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.560]   It has had an effect.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.560]   Just like T-Mobile just had an effect on AT&T,
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.640]   Google has had an effect on Comcast.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.960]   It's good.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.000]   It's the American way.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.080]   According to this article in the Wall Street Journal's
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.840]   digits, Colin Alister Baer writing,
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.760]   he quotes a lawyer at the firm, Kelly Dryon Warren,
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.800]   who is also involved, a lobbyist in this.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.160]   They are saying-- saying-- Google's saying to the FCC,
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.840]   if they go the-- if they go the Title II route,
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.480]   here's a fine point to deal with, regardless of whether they
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.280]   support or oppose the general approach.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.640]   This is what you're saying, Gina.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.200]   It wasn't exactly-- you should go Title II.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.440]   It was-- well, if you do--
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.960]   So he says--
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.480]   Give it to us.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.400]   He says Google's covering its bases there merely being
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:56.900]   pragmatic.
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.160]   I know--
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.360]   Why we like them, Sumatra?
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:01.720]   Right.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.640]   They're very pragmatic.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.520]   There's no doubt about that.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.040]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.220]   Love to get Google Fire.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.700]   At least I have that option.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.640]   That'd be fabulous.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:17.080]   Let's see.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.880]   Google TV is dead, but we'll save that for the change look.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.520]   So we can-- yeah, we can talk about it now,
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.680]   or we can save it either way.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.480]   We'll see.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.720]   We'll chat about that.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.040]   Because we got Android TV.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.960]   We don't need Google TV.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.600]   We got Android TV.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.720]   Yeah, that's the upshot.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:38.240]   Google also lobbying to free up low cost and unused air waves.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.240]   This is the other shooted drop.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:44.360]   They've talked about the super Wi-Fi for a long time.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.480]   And I think that's the other thing they're going to push.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.280]   It's about 150 megahertz of spectrum
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.520]   around 3.5 gigahertz.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.000]   So it's not that low frequency.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   But they're saying leave it unregulated.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.080]   Just like 2.4 gigahertz is unregulated.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.480]   Look what we got because of the unregulated spectrum of 2.4.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.120]   We got Wi-Fi.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.240]   We got a Sonos.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.200]   We got all sorts of interesting things.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.880]   3.5 gigahertz is not particularly useful to wireless
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.200]   carriers because it's not good for a long distance
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.240]   and it doesn't go through things.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.640]   But it does carry a lot of bandwidth.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.840]   So it would be good for perhaps things
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:28.080]   like local wireless networks in parks and things like that.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.200]   So Google is lobbying saying free the spectrum.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:33.800]   Free it up.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.960]   Free the spectrum.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.280]   Wireless better than it is, release me.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:45.200]   But Google has-- like all the tech companies finally
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.000]   realized that if you really want to get anything done,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.400]   you've got to go to Washington.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.680]   You've got to pay some lawyer with access to congress critters.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.720]   A lot of money.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.040]   And--
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:55.800]   Yeah, play the game.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.120]   Gotta play the game.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.240]   Windows 8.1 vulnerability.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.280]   Microsoft knows about it.
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.760]   In fact, they've known about it for three months
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.480]   because Google told them Microsoft waited.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.320]   Google announced it.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.640]   They said after 90 days, it's a fair game.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.840]   Microsoft, I'm sure, would have preferred
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.760]   that Google said nothing.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.160]   But Google's pointing-- I think it's well taken-- is,
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.040]   if there's a security hole, it's reasonable for us
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.440]   to give the company a time to patch.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.480]   But it's also a public's right to know if this hole exists
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.960]   because the company could otherwise just ignore it.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.800]   And attackers could find it.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.360]   Now, don't worry so much because Microsoft
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.200]   points out that a bad guy would have to have valid login
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.720]   credentials and be able to log on locally to a targeted
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.040]   machine.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.840]   It's not something that could easily
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.840]   be done over the internet.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.640]   And--
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.120]   I have weird mixed feelings about this.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.040]   It feels like-- I mean, on one hand,
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.840]   I totally understand that Google notified Microsoft
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.240]   about this vulnerability.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.320]   Gave them 90 days.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.280]   And once the 90 days were up, even though Microsoft
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.000]   didn't issue the patch, announced the bug, published code.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.360]   I don't have a site bug.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.720]   They showed you how to do it.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.240]   I mean, I sort of get it.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.720]   But I also wonder a little bit, like, somebody from Google
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.480]   couldn't pick up the phone, didn't call somebody
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.880]   from Microsoft five days before.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.800]   And they're like, hey, no, really?
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.240]   Well, they may have.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.080]   It felt like a little bit of a public shaming slap
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:24.800]   in the wrist.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:32.040]   VR thing going on here at the risk of opening up users
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.440]   to a vulnerability.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.720]   I really can see both sides of it.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.400]   Well, it certainly is true that Google-- there's
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.360]   no love loss between Google and Microsoft.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.000]   They are competing.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.640]   Microsoft Windows competes kind of with the Chrome OS.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.720]   In fact, Microsoft is very aggressive about that.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.280]   But like, users lose.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.040]   The users lose.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:52.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.720]   Like, just because of a corporate spat
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.560]   doesn't mean that users should be happy.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:56.960]   I do.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.640]   I think this is a standard though of security.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.960]   I can remember 20 years ago talking-- well, maybe not 20.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.080]   15 years ago, talking with Matthew Conover of WOOO,
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.480]   which was one of these early security firms,
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.400]   they'd found a bad bug.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.680]   They'd asked Microsoft to patch it endlessly.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.920]   And after six months, they finally said, you know what?
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.320]   The hackers are going to find this.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.800]   We've got to tell the world.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.040]   So it's a debate that does go on inside the security
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.080]   community all the time.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.040]   What's an appropriate amount of time?
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.520]   And I think everybody understands.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.560]   You can't sit on it forever.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.920]   Yeah, that's absolutely right.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.120]   And it concerns me that Microsoft wasn't
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.200]   able to push a patch.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.160]   I mean, it concerns me just from a software perspective.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.680]   And we talked before, the measure of good software
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.360]   isn't how many bugs.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.800]   It's how the company responds to those bugs, right?
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.000]   Like how quickly gets fixed and how well.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.640]   And that doesn't-- but well, in six months, is too long.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.400]   And I get it.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.520]   I totally get the argument.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.160]   But it also feels like, why are you putting users at risk
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.520]   to sort of make a point that Microsoft is slow
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.360]   and didn't fix it?
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.400]   Well, you can blame both.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.280]   Microsoft-- right.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.480]   Microsoft ignored it for three months.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.600]   Microsoft's too slow.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.160]   And Google didn't-- you know, Google--
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.640]   They're going to fix it now.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.800]   I'm sure that they will.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.200]   I'm sure somebody's in trouble at Microsoft for that.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:15.560]   I know.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.080]   At least I hope.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.880]   Google's policy to do this has been in place since 2001.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.600]   So it's been a while.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.880]   In fact, it's kind of a general practice
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:32.040]   in the security industry.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.160]   I know what you're saying, Gina.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.560]   It would be a little easier if these two weren't battling
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.560]   each other.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.560]   It seems like they hate each other.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:43.280]   Microsoft published the Gmail man reading your emails
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.560]   and don't trust Google.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.200]   Well, and hires lobbying companies to go after them and PR
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.760]   companies to go after them stealthily.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.920]   And now they're pretty nasty.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.360]   Well, Google has never made a good version of any of the Google
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.800]   Apps for Windows phone.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.880]   And even tried-- forced Microsoft
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.000]   to get rid of the one version of YouTube they had.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.840]   The Microsoft did, right?
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.080]   Microsoft hasn't put Skype on Chrome.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:08.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.600]   You're right.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.600]   Although I think now you can--
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.960]   isn't there a Chrome extension?
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.560]   There is a way to--
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.200]   Not yet.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   No?
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.920]   [GRUNTING]
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:27.640]   Google has been asked to remove 354 million pirate links in 2014.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.280]   This is according to Torrent Freak.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.760]   That's a lot of infringing links, 345 million.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.640]   Not only that, it's an increase of 75% since 2013.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.760]   75%?
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:48.720]   In 2008, Google received only a few dozen takedown notices.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.000]   Now it processes more than a million a day.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.760]   I mean, these companies have to be automating these takedown
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.640]   requests, right?
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.480]   I mean, they're not hiring humans to submit these.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.320]   Like they were back in '08.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.040]   There's probably somebody sitting in the Capitol Records
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.080]   building in Los Angeles that's sold jobs to just keep
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.320]   pressing send on that email button.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.480]   This one, and this one.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.120]   Send.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.320]   Send.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.000]   345 million times.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.080]   The way Torrent Freak came up with his number, Google
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.960]   doesn't do a yearly figure, but Torrent Freak went through
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.360]   each weekly report, which Google does do.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.680]   And found, by the way, this is unique URLs.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.520]   Not merely requests.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:33.640]   345 million, 169,134 unique URLs.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.320]   Most takedown requests were sent for the domains.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.160]   4shared.com-- just in case you're a pirate and you want to
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:39.960]   know where to go--
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.360]   4shared.com, rapidgator.net, and uploaded.net.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.840]   Each had more than 5 million targeted URLs.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:55.280]   UK Music Industry Group BPI is number one, 60 million
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.440]   reported links from BPI.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:58.960]   Wow.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:05.960]   Does Google sometimes does pull these down, right?
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.120]   I mean, they aren't they required to by the DMCA?
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:12.720]   They do.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.360]   I thought they'd take down most of them, I thought.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.280]   Not all of them.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.440]   I guess they're related to the MPAA, one kind of sour,
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:22.800]   because--
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.080]   The Sony-- part of the Sony leak showed how the MPAA and Sony
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.840]   had been in concert attacking Google by doing such sleazy
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.520]   things as hiring a former Mississippi State Attorney
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.240]   General to lobby current Mississippi State Attorney
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:46.120]   General Jim Hood to sue Google over pirate links.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.200]   We didn't do it.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.360]   Sim.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.600]   Over there.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.320]   Google says, "The right combination of price, convenience,
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.760]   and inventory will do far more to reduce piracy than enforcement
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.760]   can."
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.600]   I have to agree with that.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.880]   It's mostly true, right?
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.960]   I mean, look, there's always people who
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.680]   are going to go out of their way to not pay.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.400]   But I think most people--
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.600]   I definitely had that shift.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.520]   There was a time when I was acquiring video files in ways
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.360]   that I will not describe in detail here.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.360]   But I think some--
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.360]   But I think some--
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.360]   --was amazing.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.360]   I'm just going to pay for it.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.360]   I'll just stream it.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.360]   I'm just going to pay-- it's easier.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.360]   I don't have to deal with all these crazy clients and weird insights.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.080]   I'd rather just pay the $4 back to the kitchen books
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.440]   or whatever the heck it is.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.680]   It's just easier.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.680]   Now I do.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   I pay for everything.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.480]   It's all in the up and up when it's available.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:41.440]   You know why Game of Thrones is the number one pirated show of 2014,
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.360]   because HBO didn't offer it to-- you couldn't watch it.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.640]   It's too hard to get.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.240]   So you had to pirate it.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.640]   If they offered it for sale, I bet you
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.520]   half of those pirated copies would have been sold.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.000]   The other question is how many of the pirated copies
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.040]   would that-- those people have ever spent any money anyway?
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.000]   Are you actually losing sales?
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.600]   So how much impact will the new wireless ESPN--
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.600]   Oh, isn't that a good--
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.400]   Let's take a break and talk about that.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.080]   This is an announcement from CES from EchoStar.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.520]   They make the dish network.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.240]   They've got a new sling TV, which
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.960]   means you don't have to have a cable TV subscription.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:25.560]   You can use your current internet to get ESPN, CNN, and others.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.280]   Sports is a big part of why people have local TV.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.080]   No.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:29.440]   Cable.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.800]   Well, let's take a break.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.600]   We'll talk about that in just a bit.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.920]   Gina Trapani's last show.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.080]   Oh.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.400]   Die again.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.680]   Jeff Jarvis is your dude.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.560]   We're crying.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.560]   We're babies.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.560]   Go ahead.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.440]   [DING]
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.160]   I have a dream.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.520]   Not forever, ever, not forever.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.520]   No, I have a dream.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.760]   I have a fantasy that, you know, think up is going to take off.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.960]   You're going to sell it to some big company, make a billion
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.200]   dollars, and then you're just going to work for free here
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:56.960]   forever.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.800]   The alternate possibilities that think up fails completely
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.480]   and in politics--
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.520]   No, no, that's not my dream.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.560]   Can I say, Leo, please hire me?
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.880]   I will triple.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.160]   I will quadruple your fee.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.360]   Whatever it takes, we got to make sure
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.960]   Edda gets plenty of applesauce.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.360]   Does she eat applesauce?
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.760]   She loves applesauce.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.160]   We've intrigued her in a like in the non-sweetened stuff.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.160]   Ooh.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.280]   Yeah, she's a tree man.
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.080]   Smart.

[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.800]   They're great teachers.

[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.920]   SEO fundamentals.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.520]   Got a website.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.760]   You got to know that.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.680]   And the good stuff too, right?

[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.640]   there.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.760]   In fact, they have that-- what is that?
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.960]   Code competition they have there.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.760]   That's so cool.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:15.080]   Where each week they have a new assignment,
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.480]   and then different instructors show
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.960]   how to do it in different languages.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.880]   What a great way to learn how to code.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.000]   Oh, man.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.840]   Just nice.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.920]   Some of the courses-- oh, I already recommended those.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.440]   Yeah, or the Android Development Tools course teachers
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.840]   who had a built-in Android app with easy-to-use development
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.200]   tools.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.560]   Code clinic, that's the one I was talking about.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.880]   I love Linda.com.

[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.960]   lynda.com.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.160]   So I'm not sure what the details are yet
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.320]   on Echo Star's new sling TV.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:17.760]   But--
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.520]   Moneybox.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.760]   It includes--
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.760]   How much?
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.200]   --P&M, 20 bucks a month.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.640]   That's not bad.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.680]   Yeah, it's just ESPN.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.720]   No trust real networks.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.640]   And then not ABC, CBS, NBC.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.640]   But Turner, scripts.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.120]   I thought I saw CNN as well in here, but maybe not.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:44.880]   As previously reported by Variety, Dish, at some point,
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.600]   anticipates being able to offer broadcast programming
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.400]   in a separate premium tier.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.720]   So this is kind of like what that area was,
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.440]   but with the cooperation of the content creators.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.280]   Starts at $20 per month.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.520]   And that includes ESPN, TBS, and TNT.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.880]   You know, ESPN is the most expensive cable network.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:12.600]   Cable companies know that customers keep their cable TV
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.520]   because of ESPN.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.040]   Well, but there's also stuff from my son's home, Jake's home.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.920]   Nobody here watches ESPN.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.000]   But I have no choice.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   You have to have ESPN.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.080]   And it's the biggest single cost.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.400]   I think it's $16 a month to the cable company.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.000]   It's a lot.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.120]   I would love to go like hard.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.240]   I mean, I wish they were doing amazing things.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.840]   ESPN is amazing.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.240]   But I'm not a sports fan.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.640]   You'll get the Disney-- all three--
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.280]   ESPN, ESPN 2.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.040]   Now, remember, ESPN is owned by ABC, which is owned by Disney.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.480]   So it's also the case.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.120]   You'll get the Disney channel and the ABC family.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.080]   You don't get like the ABC broadcast.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.520]   Yes, we also get the eighth or ninth.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.120]   Orchoe.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.560]   Elochoe.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.280]   There's so much more now.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.640]   You'll get Cartoon Network.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.520]   You will get CNN.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.320]   I was right.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.160]   Adult Swim.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:05.040]   And YouTube stuff from Maker Studios.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.080]   Because Disney owns Maker.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:12.680]   That's interesting.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.320]   So this is kind of almost a Disney deal.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.160]   There's a kids extra option for $5 a month
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.440]   that gets you more Disney Disney, Junior Disney, XD,
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.600]   Boomerang, Baby TV, and Duck TV.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.040]   You'll be getting those soon, Gina.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.760]   Yeah, you know, this, honestly, I mean,
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.800]   when we moved to the new place, I
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.720]   introduced the idea of not getting cable.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.520]   And it was like, came to a dead stop.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.960]   Because my partner is just a huge sports fan.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.160]   And she was like, no football.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:36.880]   Like, I-- what?
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.400]   Same thing.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.080]   I couldn't do it.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.000]   At least it would kill me.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:41.240]   So like that thing.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.960]   And there's no way to watch NFL football,
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.800]   unless you're a Verizon customer.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.600]   Right.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.080]   There's no way to watch it otherwise.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.760]   And I like to watch this Sunday.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:55.000]   My favorite drunk awards show, The Golden Globes.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.520]   I like to watch-- there's some live stuff.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.240]   I like to see you can only see on network television.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.000]   She likes the voice.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:00.840]   What's a while.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:00.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.280]   Once in a while.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.520]   I personally-- if I would just watch
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.720]   Downton Abbey all day if I had a choice.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.800]   But that's because I'm so posh.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.520]   You are posh.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.320]   You hate Downton Abbey, Jeff?
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:13.880]   No, no, no.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.560]   I don't hate it.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.840]   But I just-- it's-- oh, Leo.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.360]   Really?
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.240]   Yeah, I love Downton Abbey.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.240]   What's wrong with that?
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.720]   I love it, too.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.680]   It's like Glee in costumes.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.520]   It's not at all likely in any form or fashion.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.200]   Oh, no.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.840]   I watch it just for the Downton Abbey lines.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.720]   No, she's so great.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.160]   Oh.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.040]   Maggie Smith.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.800]   Now, you will not get a sling TV set top box.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:50.320]   You will be able to use Roku or Fire TV, the Amazon solution,
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.360]   or Google's Nexus player.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.160]   Some smart TVs, too, from LG and Samsung will have it.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.520]   Xbox One will have it.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.240]   And of course, you can do it on your computer
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.000]   and Android and iOS.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:03.680]   Interesting.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:10.000]   I think we're starting to see the shift to IPTV.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.880]   It's going to be slow.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.040]   It's going to be painful.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.680]   You know that Comcast and everybody else are going to--
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.480]   you know why they're doing this right now?
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.800]   I swear the Comcast Time Warner merger
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.960]   has left Comcast a little bit weakened.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.840]   They haven't done it yet.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.520]   They want to get this through, right?
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.600]   And it's boy, it doesn't-- it's touching go.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.560]   And so Comcast has got to sheath its claws,
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.440]   even though you know they'd love to spank these companies.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.560]   So well, if you're going to do that,
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.200]   I guess you don't need us, do you?
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.680]   It's great use for you, too, Leo.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.400]   I mean, for your network.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.720]   It means that maybe it means that it's easier.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.400]   It'll be easier for people to discover,
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.720]   quit on their devices and whatever devices
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.520]   that they're using.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.680]   You know, last night on all about Android,
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.840]   we had the founder of HASTAC TV, which
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.720]   is a mobile app that does personalized video--
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.000]   like news video for you.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.240]   So you're like, I'm interested in CES, for example.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.560]   I'm going to show you news clips from various sources
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.240]   in the app.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.600]   And it was a great conversation.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.360]   I highly recommend it.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.560]   But what I loved is that the app started
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.480]   as basically as a Chromecast app.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.800]   As a web page that would kind of pick out news clips
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.760]   you'd be interested in, then cast them to your screen.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.600]   So it started on Chromecast, became an Android app,
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.960]   and now they're on Android TV, which we'll talk about later.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.160]   So they're an aggregator of others' content?
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.880]   News clip aggregator, right?
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.000]   So like, I don't need a cable subscription in order
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.280]   to just watch the news clips that would matter to you.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.800]   And how do they get the rights?
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.720]   It's all YouTube.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.760]   It's all YouTube.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.200]   It's all YouTube.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.280]   So they're basically-- yeah, from what he said,
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.120]   they're basically-- if it's on YouTube,
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.400]   then they have the ability to play it through their player.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.120]   And news organizations are more and more
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.920]   putting up their individual segments.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.600]   Yeah, but they're going to stop if it costs them money
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.160]   to do this.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.720]   And so if people choose this in lieu
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:01.680]   of paying for a cable subscription, that comes right.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.080]   It's kind of hard to understand this.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.760]   But the money you pay to the cable company
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.360]   for the local channels then goes to the local channels
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.960]   to some degree.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.280]   The cable companies are paying the local channels for this.
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.960]   So if the cable companies can't sell you local packages
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.440]   because you don't need it anymore,
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.160]   because you can watch news on YouTube,
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.000]   that's going to impact them, I think.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.720]   And I think that's why this whole thing is so rickety.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.160]   Everybody--
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.680]   Right, it's a shifting business model, right?
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:30.600]   It's got to be a shifting business model, right?
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:37.520]   Yeah, and this is why it's taken so long for ESPN and others
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.680]   to say, OK, we're going to go over the top.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.280]   HBO is a perfect example.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.280]   We're going to go over the top.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.880]   We're going to become an internet channel.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.560]   Because the cable companies, either it's in their contracts,
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.320]   they can't.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.760]   It was with tech TV.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.080]   The contract was very specific.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.880]   You cannot put this stuff online.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.440]   I mean, there were some limitations.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.520]   You can only do a certain number of minutes per hour
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.520]   and so forth.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:02.280]   And I think these clauses persist in existing contracts.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.520]   But also, there's the threat that if you do it,
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.160]   well, I guess you don't need us anymore.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.520]   And right now, the business model for HBO and CNN
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:14.200]   and ESPN and everybody else is you got to be on the cable.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.040]   So I don't know how to--
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.920]   I don't know, frankly, how they're leveraging this.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.280]   I have to think it's because of this time-water thing
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.560]   that Comcast can't really threaten them.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.040]   And they're hoping they can get some--
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.800]   Look, you're right.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.440]   I think they're hoping they can get some critical mass,
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.680]   some momentum up before Comcast and Time Warner's over
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.960]   one way or the other.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.160]   Because they're trying to play nice.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:35.600]   But everything right now.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.880]   They don't dare say anything.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.560]   They can't say boo.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.600]   All right.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.200]   I got to ask you about this one.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.480]   Gina, you did 23 in me.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.160]   I did 23 in me.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:48.760]   So we're done.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.120]   We all have wet ear wax.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.040]   I know that.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.760]   Yeah, we all-- I have brown hair, by the way.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.520]   I don't know if you know this about me.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.840]   I don't know.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.920]   Brown eyes.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:57.520]   We don't know.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.640]   But my spit says my hair is brown.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.840]   So I love this idea.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:06.200]   In fact, if you go to 23 in me on the web,
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.480]   they sell this whole idea that, hey, it's great.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.680]   You're going to-- it's a genetic ancestry service.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.120]   And for $99, you spit in a little tube.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.640]   And they tell you kind of weak stuff, frankly, about--
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:25.000]   like, I'm 2% in the end or tall or something like silly stuff.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.200]   But read this page carefully.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   Because I'm wondering where it says, oh, and by the way,
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.240]   we're going to sell your genetic information
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.280]   to big companies for tens of millions--
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.640]   I do believe-- with permission, I do believe the story says.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.920]   They say, and I don't remember them asking me.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.560]   No, no, no, they'll have to go and get permission now.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.880]   Oh, they have to come back.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.000]   Because they-- look at this.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:50.520]   Look at this.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.480]   First case, Parkinson's.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.520]   It's secure.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.360]   If you have Parkinson's, Leo--
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.360]   Yes.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.360]   And if you believe that sharing your data
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.800]   is going to be helpful to try to find a cure for this disease,
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.360]   then you would want to do that.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.760]   And you would absolutely-- I think
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.760]   want to do that.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.440]   And the story that I read said that you'll
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.800]   be given the option to that.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.880]   We'll have to see.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.880]   So they haven't done it yet?
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.680]   But this is going to start exactly the kind of technopanic
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.600]   that you start to allude to.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.040]   But it's--
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:19.240]   Well--
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.360]   --to me, it is going to happen, where sharing data could save
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.360]   what?
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:22.880]   I agree.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.520]   I agree.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.920]   But I feel like they should have been more clear upfront,
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.600]   or it should say on the page as one of the features
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.800]   and benefits.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.960]   Because paying them $99 to share my genetic data
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.040]   for tens of millions of dollars with Pfizer
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.960]   isn't, in my mind, how the deal was.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.320]   Now, if they ask me, we'd like to share your stuff.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.920]   It's opt-in or opt-out.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.680]   Or did I already, when I signed up with a lot of fine--
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.040]   I think the story I read-- the story I read--
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.400]   and I've got, I can't find it right now--
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.800]   said that they were going to have to go back to 3,000 people
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.160]   who have Parkinson's and ask them for me.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.080]   Oh, that's for those.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:04.080]   That's because they want to combine the medical information
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.760]   with the genetic information.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.440]   But they are also selling the larger database of genetic
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.800]   information that they have gathered.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.040]   So that's different.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.280]   Wait, this is an anogromised, an aggregated, or this is--
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.760]   Yeah, I presume it is.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.760]   Not the 3,000.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.600]   That's the difference, I think.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.080]   I see it.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.760]   Well, this isn't-- it's not completely clear.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.840]   So I guess we should find out.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.400]   But I saw a lot of people being saying, oh, look, they've
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:36.240]   said, if you ever saw their slide deck for their investors,
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.840]   you would know this was the plan all along.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.680]   And so I immediately went to the front page of the website
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.320]   expecting something around this.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.920]   But I didn't see anything.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.640]   So I think maybe it was in their slide deck.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.160]   But unless you go to those kinds of conferences
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.840]   or you're a venture capitalist, you may not be completely clear.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.680]   So this is the first of 10 deals with big biotech companies,
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.400]   Genentech is going to pay $60 million or up to for access
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.360]   to 23 and me's data to study Parkinson's.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:11.800]   Since 23 and me started in 2006, it's
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.920]   convinced 800,000 customers, including the three of us,
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.880]   to hand over our DNA, one vial of spit at the time.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:24.160]   By the way, they don't do a full analysis of the DNA.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.800]   They only do small little bits.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.480]   It's not a full genome you're getting back.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.400]   But 23 and me wasn't going to find a big business
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.600]   by selling spit kits at the cut rate of $99.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.840]   Well, I don't know about that.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.080]   They've made $80 million.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.080]   Well, they started.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.320]   They started it was like $2.50.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.320]   They had to get the more.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.960]   You've been lower the price.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:48.560]   Big data has been in 23 and me's DNA from the beginning.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.320]   Uh-huh.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.440]   Right, Sarah Zhang in Gizmodo.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.440]   Ha-ha.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.480]   She's actually-- it was founded by Ann Wojiski,
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.680]   who was-- was Larry--
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.960]   I'm sorry, Sergey Brin's wife.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.280]   She told the New York Times she watched in the early days
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.080]   of Google, she watched Larry and Larry would say,
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.240]   I just want the world's data on my laptop.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.240]   She said, I felt the same way about health care.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.920]   I wanted the world's data accessible.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.840]   So that's why I started 23 and me.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:18.400]   But I wasn't the sales pitch I got.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.080]   It's funny, so I feel like I'm probably
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.320]   the most pro-privacy of the three of us.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.720]   But I don't have any problem with this.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.240]   In fact, I feel like--
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.840]   you know, I want-- this is data I want to help,
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.720]   given that it's aggregated and anonymous.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.480]   I mean, they're not giving my name and address
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.560]   in Social Security number along with my sequence, right?
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.160]   They're-- well, they will in some cases,
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.640]   but they'll ask you for permission.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:40.640]   They'll ask you for permission.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.600]   But they're asking about my lifestyle and where I live
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.040]   and my background.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.760]   And then if I have certain genetic markers,
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.400]   and they're going to do research on how those things correlate.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:53.400]   And I mean, that's the best possible use of my data.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.200]   Well, this is ironic, because I did--
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.880]   I tried to sign up for that MIT project,
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:02.200]   where you would very publicly give them your entire genome.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.520]   You'd pay for it thousands of dollars,
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.800]   and then they would give your information, by name,
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.720]   to companies who wanted to do genomic research.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.920]   And then I was behind.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:13.440]   But--
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.360]   I was so you feel duped.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.520]   Like you feel like you were--
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:19.200]   Yeah, you got to be-- you got to tell people this.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.360]   I don't disagree with an atleo, but I do agree with Gina
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.520]   that in general, I think it's a good thing.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.160]   It's a necessary thing.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.760]   And the real issue to me when it comes to privacy
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:33.080]   is not that some pharmaceutical company gets tons of data
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.760]   that they can analyze and get some correlations out of that
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.920]   have value.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.880]   I think that's a good thing.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.960]   The real question is, could the police get your DNA
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:46.480]   and use it against you in a way that you don't know?
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.000]   That's privacy.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.240]   Well, but I'm also reading their privacy statement.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.560]   They don't mention that they're going
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:56.920]   to sell your anonymized-- they should say specifically.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:02.800]   And we may sell your anonymized data to big pharma.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:03.920]   They don't say that.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:05.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.640]   They should definitely be transparent about it.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.600]   It should not be in their only in their slide deck, for sure.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.120]   I think because I knew the company's connection to Google,
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.360]   I just assumed that that was part of the business model.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:19.520]   But of course, that's because we do what we do.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.600]   And there should be a big link on the front page
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:27.400]   that's been in this privacy to this setting.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.280]   Yeah, I haven't logged into 23andMe in a long time.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.680]   It does say, if you've given consent for our genetic and self
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:36.400]   report information to be used in research, 23andWe--
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.480]   this is another business, I guess-- 23andWe.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:39.960]   Oh boy.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.920]   Research, as described in the applicable consent document,
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.000]   no link.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.120]   We may include such information in the aggregated genetic
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.520]   and self-reported information intended
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.880]   to be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:56.400]   It does imply that it's their own research arm, 23andWe.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.640]   Hmm.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.640]   I don't know.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.040]   I feel like they should have been a little more upfront.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:07.640]   I agree with you.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.000]   I mean, there's a huge societal benefit to this.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.760]   But people need to explicitly know what they're doing
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.680]   if they're going to do that.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.200]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.520]   I think I told you guys that when I did do the 23andMe,
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:26.080]   it was one of the weirder user experiences I ever had,
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.280]   because I had submitted my spit sample.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.160]   And then I got this email from them that said, oh,
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.440]   you've got this new information, has been unlocked.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.800]   And then I logged in and it said, hey,
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.360]   we have now identified this marker for Parkinson's.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.440]   And now we know whether or not you have this marker.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.040]   But this is potentially life-changing information.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.200]   And you might want to sit down and get some privacy--
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.440]   That's appropriate.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.520]   By the way, they don't do that anymore.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.480]   And I was just like, I was totally free.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.400]   And like, I was in the middle of my workday.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.320]   I nodded on that.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.280]   And it all prepared for this.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.160]   And I clicked on the button and I was like, oh, no,
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:57.800]   you don't have it.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:01.400]   And I was just like, it was just an extra--
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.920]   It implied that you did, right?
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.960]   It was a very bizarre interaction to have with a website.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.240]   Like, that's an interaction I expect
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.600]   to have with my doctor.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.720]   And it was weird.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.560]   It felt like they'd built up this big reveal when they had
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.520]   nothing to tell me, essentially anyway.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.360]   I think that was required.
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.000]   And remember the FDA went after them.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.880]   And they have now stopped giving health information.
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:26.560]   OK.
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.200]   OK.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.840]   I think that was the thing the FDA didn't like.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:29.920]   That was the thing with the FDA.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.560]   The FDA got FDA, yes.
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.400]   OK.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.400]   OK.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.920]   Yeah, I had the same experience.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:41.720]   This is a very long privacy statement.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.520]   I don't see anything.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.040]   They mentioned advertisers, general service providers.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.000]   We may share aggregate information with third parties.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.720]   Stripped of re-registration information
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.720]   is different from individual.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.080]   It's a data about genotype.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:04.920]   I just think nobody's going to deduce
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.520]   that they're going to sell us for $60 million to Genentech
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.720]   from this information.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.040]   OK.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.040]   Withdraw my consent.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:16.600]   You can go to your account settings page.
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:16.960]   All right.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:17.800]   So let me do that.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.120]   Let's see if I can do that easily.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.760]   Well, I won't do it on the air because I've decided.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.840]   Would you withdraw your consent?
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.840]   No, you think this is good.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.880]   Hello?
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.000]   I do.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.040]   You give them consent.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:33.520]   Yep.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:37.680]   And like I said, I mean, I never got selected.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.440]   But Esther Dyson had done this big thing.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.840]   And it was a really cool idea.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.600]   And I wanted to do it.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.280]   Oh, wait.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.520]   So did they send an email?
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.760]   Did they send you an email saying, hey, there's--
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.880]   Do you want to-- no, they didn't.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:48.400]   OK.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.120]   I'm looking.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.280]   Privacy consent.
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.480]   I do not want to receive sharing invitation.
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:57.480]   See, you get all these invitations from third cousins.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.400]   I want-- right.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.160]   That's different.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.600]   Relative's opera.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.080]   Basic research consent.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.280]   Here it is.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.680]   So apparently, I have given consent
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:07.440]   to participate in 23andMe Scientific Research.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.960]   Stripped of identifying registering information.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:10.840]   Yeah, that's the other thing.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:17.200]   It worries me a little bit is that--
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.160]   how much can you anonymize genetic information?
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:24.320]   Right.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:27.720]   And by the way, they still have my spit.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:33.520]   There's a button that says discard sample, not recommended.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.800]   I think they want to keep my spit.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:40.760]   Can you imagine that warehouse?
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.760]   In the spit warehouse.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.120]   The spit house.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.280]   800,000 saliva samples.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.160]   The brick spit house.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.000]   I want to see that.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:53.360]   If I withdraw my consent, does the info that they sold
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.760]   get taken back?
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.800]   No.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:57.880]   Anyway.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.640]   It isn't really learning more about yourself this new year.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.200]   It's really more letting Genentech learn more about yourself
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.280]   this new year.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.160]   But who's going to invent the drugs that are likely to save?
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.520]   I agree.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.040]   I agree.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:13.160]   It ain't going to be you or me or AT&T.
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:13.840]   Right.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.960]   It's going to be them.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:15.440]   You know what?
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.200]   Everybody should be aware.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:17.960]   That's all.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.480]   And I wish they were a little more clear.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.000]   Because I missed a slide deck.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.720]   Inevitably, the answer is clarity and transparency.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.480]   And you cannot make an informed consent
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.480]   if you're not informed.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.880]   Right.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.040]   That's the key.
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:33.560]   That's true.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:39.040]   This really scares me.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:44.040]   Remember the FBI says that, well, we know that it was South
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.760]   of North Korea.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:50.280]   FBI Director says those sloppy hackers revealed their IP
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.800]   addresses.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.040]   That's how we know.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.120]   Oh, dear.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.880]   Oh, lie.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.200]   Oh, dear.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.840]   Speaking at a Fordham Law School Cyber Security Conference
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.960]   on Wednesday--
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.320]   yeah.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.360]   Hackers in the attack failed on multiple occasions
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:11.720]   to use proxy servers revealing the IP addresses that
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.080]   tied them to North Koreans.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:17.680]   They got sloppy.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.720]   But we saw--
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:24.200]   so maybe that's the secret information.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.160]   But as everybody knows, this stuff's
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.840]   more complicated than it might appear.
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.800]   This also felt like a PR slap in the face a little bit.
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.160]   I was just trying to embarrass North Koreans.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.400]   They were sloppy.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.240]   They were sloppy.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.320]   You know, Axsony.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.360]   We know it was North Koreans.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.120]   We know.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:40.760]   They were sloppy.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:41.920]   Most sloppy North Koreans.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.560]   They always leave a mess behind and we can identify.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:47.000]   Unless it was sloppy Chinese people
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.240]   who pretended to be North Koreans.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.880]   But wait a minute.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:52.200]   Verizon is apparently, according to Bloomberg,
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.800]   approaching AOL for a takeover or a joint venture.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:59.200]   Joint venture, big deal of takeover, interesting.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:02.440]   Verizon wants to do more video.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:07.240]   And the company isn't having significant acquisition
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.840]   instructions according to Verizon Chief Executive
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.440]   Lowell McAdam.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.800]   But there is potential for us to do partnerships.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.080]   But I think that would be very interesting for Verizon
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.400]   acquired AOL.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.840]   Boy, that would be a sad end.
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.520]   A sad story.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:25.280]   It would be-- I have my doubts about it.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.840]   I think this has been--
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.120]   I was pretty appalled Christopher Mims
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.800]   from the Wall Street Journal, who I think
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.480]   was good at covering technology.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.760]   Put up a tweet that I thought went over the top.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:42.200]   And said that Sir Ross Levinson, the former Yahoo
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.680]   Executive, who I guess speculated to him about this,
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:47.280]   said he shouldn't be ever able to work in a tech company
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.280]   again.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.200]   Geez.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.080]   God.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.360]   And I finally said to him, there
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.040]   are people who say that about your proprietor
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.120]   and journalism.
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:56.620]   So--
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:51:05.360]   Megan J. Smith, former Googler, MIT
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.320]   trained mechanical engineer, and now the nation's chief
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:16.320]   technical officer has a BlackBerry and a 2013 Dell laptop.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:22.160]   Wait, wait, Megan has a what?
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.600]   Did you just say?
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.600]   A BlackBerry and a 2013 Dell laptop.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.280]   Isn't that sad?
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:31.200]   And by government standards, state of the art, baby.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.920]   Oh my god.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:40.080]   She says, I am here to upgrade the internet, the White House.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:48.560]   He must just laugh when she goes home to her 2015 5K iMac
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.200]   and puts the government computer aside.
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:53.120]   Or perhaps, in her case, a pixel.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.000]   She might have a Chromebook pixel, too.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:55.480]   Why not?
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.480]   I should not.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.920]   Why not?
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:58.640]   We've talked before.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.240]   We talked with Clay Johnson, who
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:05.000]   found her Blue State Digital and the guy who ran Obama's online
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   campaign in 2008.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.720]   He said, you don't have any idea how bad it is when you arrive.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:16.040]   And you see these clunky old CRT monitors.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:21.080]   His technology is not up to date by any means.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.240]   They-- it's slow.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.320]   Yeah, it's slow.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.240]   You want government to be slow.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.400]   You have a security program.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:26.920]   Oh, right.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.800]   You do, right?
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.440]   Until they hand you the BlackBerry
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:31.800]   and the--
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.640]   Yeah, then you go, oh, that's slow.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.520]   That's really slow.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.880]   And by the way, it's not one of them new BlackBerry classics.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:40.800]   Oh, no.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.400]   Nothing like that.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:46.000]   We haven't done the change log yet, have we?
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:46.920]   Let's take a break.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.800]   When we come back, Gina's final change log.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:54.880]   A couple of babies.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:59.400]   If you shaved your head, we'd both look like babies, Jack.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:01.520]   We have baby butt skin now.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.160]   That's true.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.640]   Very soft, very luscious.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:08.120]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:10.600]   Beginning of the year means it's a good time
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:11.880]   to get your life in shape.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.320]   And I know you've been putting off stuff
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:19.000]   like protecting your family with a will or a living trust.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.720]   LegalZoom can make this very easy.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:21.600]   We just got the will kit.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.880]   It's so great.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:24.400]   I think Lisa is doing it.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.280]   I mean, nice binder.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.880]   All the stuff you need, it couldn't be easier.
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:30.400]   It also means getting control of your financial affairs
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.840]   if you're thinking of starting a business,
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.440]   or maybe you already have one.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:39.000]   Protect it simply, easily and affordably with LegalZoom.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:39.880]   You can incorporate.

[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.520]   of people get the personalized attention they need.

[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.720]   with an independent attorney in more states.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.360]   But understand, they're not a law firm.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:56.120]   They're actually, they're kind of better.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.480]   They help you do the legal work you need to do
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:02.360]   with their guidance, their questionnaires there.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.800]   Don't let another year pass by
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.040]   before getting your life organized
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.760]   for legal help you can count on.

[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.240]   That's a good one.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:38.200]   Legalzoom.com.

[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:44.800]   Check out now, time to play the trumpets one last time.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.680]   (whimpering)
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.920]   The Google change log.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:51.680]   (dramatic music)
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.120]   Here's to you to Japan.
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.200]   You guys are killing me.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.280]   I know, it's me.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.560]   I'm enjoying the love fest.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:01.120]   The love fest is great for my ego.
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:02.320]   I'm getting it in the chat room.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:03.320]   We're getting it on Twitter.
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.760]   (laughing)
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.800]   It's still you're killing me.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:09.160]   I really don't want you to retire the change log.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.240]   I feel like I want to get you a new host
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.480]   that will continue the change log.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.640]   Okay, okay, okay.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.320]   Now we're gonna hang the trumpets up
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.840]   over the stadium, retired.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.720]   We'll get a fog horn.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.040]   (laughing)
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.360]   The Cheetah jersey will go there on up.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.560]   The vuvuzela, you know, in the other room.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.000]   The vuvuzela, the ex-polly burrito,
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   and the gli-el, yeah.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.480]   (laughing)
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:35.320]   Aw.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.160]   Aw.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.520]   You got a raise.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:38.480]   Aw.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.440]   Aw.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:40.680]   All right, the change log.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.880]   Let's talk about Google Cast.
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.640]   Not just the Chromecast, but the protocol,
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.080]   the cast protocol.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:50.200]   At CES, Google announced Google Cast for Audio,
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.720]   which will let you play back sound from apps,
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:56.440]   directly to speakers, sound bars, and AV receivers.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:59.600]   Sony LG and Denon will be the first
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:01.960]   to offer Google Cast Ready products this spring,
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:02.800]   Google says.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.760]   So you'll be casting your audio.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:06.600]   That's cool.
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.600]   I actually already used my Chromecast to cast audio.
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.120]   I Google Play music, but you know,
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.120]   your TV has to be on, like the screen has to be on.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:13.320]   So this is kind of nice.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:17.840]   Hangouts for iOS is basically that Google's updated it,
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.800]   and it's basically brought it to parity
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:20.920]   with the Android version.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:24.720]   So hangouts at iOS now has Google Voice integrations.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.280]   You can access SMS and voicemails from your Google Voice
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.000]   account and Hangouts app.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.760]   You can quickly share your location.
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:35.840]   You can add status messages and access stickers, of course.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.840]   So that's all on iOS.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:37.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.360]   We have stickers?
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.640]   There are stickers and Hangouts.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.960]   Hangouts has gotten kind of fun in a weird way.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:48.080]   I texted a hooray to someone recently,
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:50.200]   and you know, this little cute little guy.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.920]   If you just type a ray, it does it?
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:53.520]   Yeah, if you send it to.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:57.080]   Or if you say like, where are you or if someone texts you,
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.800]   where are you, there'll be a little button will show up
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:01.120]   that'll say like tap here to share your location.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.120]   It's gotten really smart.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:07.000]   So it actually kind of, it analyzes the text of what you're
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.120]   sending or receiving and then will respond.
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.680]   But not on the desktop, only on the smartphone.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:12.800]   On the right, right.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.800]   Oh, that's why.
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:14.160]   Okay.
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.840]   Let's see.
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.240]   What else we got here?
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:22.280]   Google search results now displays song lyrics right in the one
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.080]   box at the top of the results page.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:28.480]   So if you type in the song title, lyrics, it's kind of hit or miss.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.280]   You'll get lyrics if the song is basically in Google Play.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:34.640]   So the results are powered by Google Play.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:39.880]   So if you type, you know, Beastie Boys, fight for your right lyrics,
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:43.600]   you'll see the song lyrics right there, right there in the results.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:46.680]   I tried a couple of other, tried a couple of other songs.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:47.280]   I didn't get them.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:49.560]   But really, it's got to be in Google Play, but still kind of nice.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:50.840]   Well, here's a question for you.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:56.400]   Wasn't that long ago where lyrics sites were being taken down just as
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:59.840]   much as download sites because lyrics were copyrighted.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:00.840]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:04.680]   Now we have things like wrap genius.
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.680]   Yep.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:09.960]   Is it now, do artists now say, what the heck my lyrics for my promotion?
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:10.480]   It's okay.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.120]   And nobody's fighting it anymore?
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:13.680]   I don't think so.
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:14.680]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.360]   I remember when that was, yeah, that's interesting.
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.360]   That was a thing, right?
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:19.560]   That was a brief thing.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.840]   And I maybe they lost a court.
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:25.880]   So what is the search you type lyrics?
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:28.280]   Yeah, you just type the song title lyrics.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:31.600]   So if you type like, you know, yeah, they're okay.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.200]   Try that one.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.800]   Because this is, yeah.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.520]   And then, and then, and then look at this special thing.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.360]   Yeah, try, try that.
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:40.360]   Be the, try Beastie Boys, fight for your right.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:41.760]   That one definitely works.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:42.320]   Okay.
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:43.600]   It's got to be a song in Google Play.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.280]   So it's a little bit limited to sit or miss.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:48.560]   So I type in, take me to church.
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:49.800]   I saw, and I like, by the way.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.800]   There you go.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:53.000]   I get the video and then I get maps to churches.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:59.280]   So maybe I have to type Rolling Stones, honky tonk woman.
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.640]   Yeah, you see what says full lyrics on Google Play,
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:02.800]   the bottom of the box.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:08.120]   Because this one, I never could understand the words of.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:11.320]   I would really love it if Google, yeah, see, I guess it's not in there.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:12.760]   Yeah, it mustn't be in there.
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:13.880]   In their database.
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:14.880]   Okay.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.800]   Nobody knows the words.
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:17.880]   Nobody.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:19.800]   I think when Tina Turner.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:24.240]   Wanted to record it, she actually had to go to Mick Jagger and say,
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.240]   could you write the words down?
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:25.800]   Cause I don't.
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:27.560]   Could you just stop talking?
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:28.280]   How are you saying?
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.440]   I'm in.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:34.560]   What is that exactly?
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:37.200]   You should have done like the Google voice transcription version.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:45.080]   Finally, Google TV, Rest in Peace.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.520]   It's effectively dead.
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:50.480]   Google pulled support for the Google TV developer tool, developer tools,
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:53.400]   which basically means you can't build apps for Google TV anymore.
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:57.200]   It doesn't mean that existing TV, Google TV devices will stop working.
[00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.360]   Those will continue to work.
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.440]   The apps that you have on them will continue to work.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:04.120]   But essentially the Google TV team is going Android TV.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.880]   Android TV is the new hotness.
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:09.200]   So, yeah, no more new Google TV apps.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.680]   I know we were all in the edges of our seats waiting for new Google TV apps.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.120]   Well, I bought many a Google TV.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:15.920]   I have several.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.120]   I had the Logitech one.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.920]   I think that the same one.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.280]   My, what a fool I am.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:25.160]   And oh man, it feels pretty antiquated now.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.400]   It feels about as bad as a 2013 Dell laptop.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.560]   We don't remember just the big pitch for Google TV being like,
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.440]   you get the web on your TV.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:36.480]   And I remember like, yes, but it was just the implementation that was wrong.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.440]   And Chromecast is what Chromecast was the right implementation.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.280]   It's so lightweight.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:40.920]   It's so great.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:49.640]   David Schmidt on Twitter just tweeted to be and said, isn't the pixel itself a 2013 computer?
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.840]   Oh, it is.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.840]   Like Tushay, I said.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:54.080]   Yeah, a lot of people in the chatroom are mad at me saying, what do you mean?
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.040]   A 2013 Dell, what's wrong with that?
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.920]   Well, I'm just going to say in most companies, including ours, when a new
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.800]   employee arrives, they're given a new computer.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.280]   Whatever, you know, so it would be, you know, you don't give them somebody else's hand me down.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:12.960]   It's not antiquated, but it's not normal in business to do that.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.680]   Maybe it is.
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.520]   I don't know.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:15.360]   You're right.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.880]   2013 is the only two years ago.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:22.480]   I'm showing my snobbery and that.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:31.400]   Well done, Jason.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.320]   I got my Google conch.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.000]   Nice.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.560]   My mournful conch.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:39.920]   Oh, it's just not.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.040]   It's almost majestic enough.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:42.720]   But not quite.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:44.720]   That's me.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.280]   Almost majestic.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.520]   Almost majestic enough.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.240]   Sounds like a bull elephant mating call of a bull elephant.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.400]   It's not good.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:54.600]   I think it beeds.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.400]   That's fancy.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:00.080]   This is a this is a voussella from South Africa from the previous World Cup.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.480]   And a fan brought it.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.800]   It was actually played in South.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:04.680]   Oh, it's not beads.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.280]   It's like knit.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.240]   It's knit.
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.040]   It's pretty nice.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:07.560]   It is.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.240]   But it's a knit.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.400]   It's not made of beads.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.760]   It's a knit cover.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.280]   Gotcha.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:11.920]   It's like a cover.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:12.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:12.800]   Very nice.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:13.800]   It's pretty sweet, huh?
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:17.720]   Hey, if you'd come to our New Year's Eve party, I would have let you play it with the band.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.240]   Oh, man.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:19.760]   Next year.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:29.320]   Anything else you want to say before we get to our picks tips and number or last.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.200]   Oh, already there.
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:35.200]   I thought Evan Sarah Lacey.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.400]   I didn't even know they were fighting.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:41.880]   Well, Sarah wrote this call and then she got she got some some grief for her.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:47.960]   She wrote a piece basically saying that tech guys don't have the courage to be media guys.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.720]   I use it as an example of Midear and Ev.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.920]   And I forget the other one saying they were conflict diverse.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.120]   Chef Bezos, maybe.
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.240]   Basically, yeah.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:00.200]   And she was she was comparing and she was comparing herself to her rule.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.120]   Some said to her role model.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.240]   OK, Graham.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:04.760]   Oh, please.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.520]   What's your post?
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.880]   And what's my role model?
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:13.480]   Well, so that was so that was so that was so that was he was already getting some some grief over that.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:13.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:19.520]   And then I came back, I think, with a very, very good response in which he said, you know, what are you what are you saying?
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.120]   I'm I'm conflict diverse or risk diverse.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:26.640]   You know, he's I know have risked everything he had to get longer going.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:29.400]   He's risking constantly.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.960]   He's changing the world of third time now.
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.040]   He's doing amazing things.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:37.400]   And you're not going to say what the kicker is, but I'll just say people go to the link and read the kicker because it's great.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.520]   Brilliant.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:39.840]   Yeah, I just read it.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.800]   And it's brilliant.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:42.960]   OK.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.400]   I won't spoil it for you.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.200]   Just go read it.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.120]   Well, she said to have.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.680]   F off, right.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.800]   And then at.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.520]   Yeah, that.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:55.600]   Oh, no, that was her.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.320]   That was his response to her.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.280]   OK, the her.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:05.960]   Because because she said that he doesn't like conflict and his response to that was F off.
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:06.640]   I see.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.480]   What do I I'm OK with conflict?
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:11.760]   See, that's what was brilliant about.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.280]   Oh, there it is.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:13.720]   I get it.
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:18.600]   You know, it's so inside baseball and so few people even know who Sarah Lacey and
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:19.400]   have Williams are.
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.400]   I know it's true.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.480]   It's like they're fighting.
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.200]   Oh, it's fun for us.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:24.960]   It's fun for us.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.160]   We know they are for us.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.880]   And we know the backstory, the incessantly long.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.480]   Back story.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:33.840]   I somewhat I mean, I'm not going to get it.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.440]   Richard Stalman.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.640]   Oh, I just I feel like if.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:41.680]   I mean, there is a point taken that he's really not.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:45.520]   I mean, medium is is about as much about journalism as blogger, Twitter.
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:46.480]   Well, that's what he says.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.280]   That's what he says to us.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.120]   Why are you going after me?
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.480]   I'm a magazine publisher.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.520]   Some of the stuff we publish, we publish ourselves.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.680]   Some we don't gave gave.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.240]   He's gotten crap because one piece was taken now, but he didn't take it down.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:56.640]   The author.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:57.160]   Right.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:57.680]   Right.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:01.800]   You know, I was creating a platform and people can create and say all kinds of.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.400]   You love me.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.800]   I'm you publish on medium, right?
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:11.120]   I do a lot and I'm publishing my entire book, the Experian gifts available now, not only to buy, but you can read it.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.480]   I'm still a positive.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.200]   I've said this to you many times.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:17.040]   I don't understand why you would give away your content to have.
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:23.320]   Um, well, in this case, my goal is to change the world and brainwash people.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:23.640]   Right.
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:27.360]   You want to see as many people see as possible, but medium isn't like YouTube.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.160]   I can see you do it on YouTube because YouTube is where everybody goes.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.440]   But really is medium, like a big publishing platform.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.520]   It's for the time.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:41.680]   Well, it's pretty and it's easy to you.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.200]   It's pretty and it's easy to you go there.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.200]   Nice tool.
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.720]   Not spiritual.
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:49.560]   And there's a certain, uh, cache about it, right?
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.640]   I mean, it has a certain, um, yeah.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.200]   Very good at that too.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.920]   But it's all to his benefit.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.440]   He's a businessman.
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.200]   That's okay.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:05:59.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:05:59.920]   That's okay.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.480]   I mean, I, the, the, the, the, this is part of the stolen piece too.
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.360]   There's this paranoia that occurs.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.080]   If somebody else gets benefit out of something that you do there.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:18.440]   Um, you know, I remember when, when, um, but Richard Stalman, who I love, who created, uh, well, he created good news.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.640]   He's got amazing things in his career, absolutely amazing thing.
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.600]   He was one of the original MIT hackers.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:23.800]   He wrote EMAX.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.200]   Um, he's religious.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.520]   He's religious about it.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.320]   In fact, he doesn't want people to call it Linux.
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.880]   He says and won't do an interview with you unless you call it GNU Linux.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:35.880]   Um, he does, he doesn't like unfree software.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:38.880]   He said all software should be free as in Libra.
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.200]   Libra.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:44.760]   And, uh, he says, don't use Uber because it uses a non free program, an app.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:48.560]   And it requires the use of other non free software.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.120]   It lets Big Brother track you.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:50.960]   Well, okay.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.160]   Non free.
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:56.320]   Program is not using Uber.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:00.640]   Yeah, because it uses an app, which is a non free program and a non free program.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:03.840]   Tramples his users freedom, but I understand Richard's philosophy.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.720]   He's he is a purist.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.400]   Oh boy.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:11.040]   But there's no, I mean, it's just not practical in the real world to only use
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.600]   Libra software.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.760]   He's still has to exist.
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.200]   I'm glad that he exists.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:16.800]   I am too.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.040]   Right.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:17.400]   Yes.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:17.880]   Yes.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.680]   He has, he sets an extreme bar, right?
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:21.240]   And then you can.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.040]   And he asked questions, maybe that no one else.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.480]   I think it's important to have kind of the radicals, you know, in the world.
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.400]   And he's one of them.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:31.320]   And I, I, you know, he does, by the way, and the remainder of the article, talk
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.720]   about all the other completely legitimate and good reasons you shouldn't use.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:39.080]   There's plenty of ways you complain about, about, uh, over and think it's an
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.880]   awful company and does some bad things.
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.040]   I have no problem with that.
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:46.520]   But the rationale behind this, this, if it's free, it's bad routine.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:49.160]   You know, if you're, if you're, you're, you're, you're the product.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:53.480]   Where she, I'm, I'm just tired of the camera.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:55.400]   And you'll also hate to that line.
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.440]   Well, you're going to miss this.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.480]   You're going to miss this.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:05.720]   I'm always in favor of open versus proprietary, but it doesn't.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.400]   I'm not, I'm not religious about it.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.240]   I'm not, which he is, which is fine.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.480]   I don't, you know, I think he's right.
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:18.560]   Remember, he comes from the earliest days of computer Hackeray, where if you
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:25.000]   needed a program, you wrote it yourself and it would be rude to not let others
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.280]   take your program, modify it for their own use, you know, that kind of thing.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:31.080]   And that's what that's always saying.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.000]   And that comes from that.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.160]   I think that in many ways, you know, it's like, it's like Marxism.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.840]   It's a little bit ideological, but I understand what he's saying.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.200]   I may be more on his side than not.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.440]   Oh, you just do that to be a tree.
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.720]   Oh, I'm here.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.200]   Hairless among the hairy.
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.760]   He is very hairy and he plays a mean recorder.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.920]   And we got him on the screensavers to sing the open source anthem.
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.800]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:07.360]   Oh, by the way, you know, some time ago, I really wanted a bar low to come on
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:11.560]   and do a dramatic reading of his and he, no, he wouldn't do it.
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:12.120]   He wouldn't do it.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.240]   I asked him to, he wouldn't do it.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.120]   Now he's done it.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.200]   You see that?
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:15.680]   No.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.800]   There was a there is a dramatic reading.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:23.280]   I don't think it was quite the old, I would have given it of his declaration
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.560]   of independence for cyberspace.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.600]   And you can buy it as a limited edition.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.040]   Nice.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.400]   Final disc.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:31.160]   And I hope he says inspired by Jeff Jarvis.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.960]   No, no, I'm sure I was one of many who asked him to do this.
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:38.240]   It is a fine.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.040]   I probably I probably is a proprietor.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.040]   And I can't play it.
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.040]   No, that was him.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:48.080]   Well, I maybe have to pay for it and give money to the EFF.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.240]   I love John Perry Barlow.
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:54.240]   We, you know, he when he was on the triangulation, I I mentioned that.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.440]   He said, I don't he said, I don't believe in it anymore.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.600]   He said, I wrote that a long time ago.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:05.080]   Search for JP Barlow, the Declaration of Independence, final, and you'll find it on
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:05.680]   Boeing Boeing.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.720]   Final, isn't that funny?
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.280]   Isn't it funny to you?
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.080]   Yeah, I go by it.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.600]   It's a limited edition vinyl.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.680]   He wrote it in 1996.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:23.960]   It's a 180 gram vinyl edition from the Department of Records, black on black
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:27.960]   sleeve with an embossed title, a high quality printing of the declaration inside
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:31.800]   and the B side sports aversion backed by an original score from Drosan, button,
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.040]   button, Jack, Jack.
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.560]   Mustn't.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.120]   Wow.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.320]   But it is you're right.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.320]   Free CC license downloads.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:38.840]   Of course.
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:44.720]   Governments of the industrial world, you weary giants of flesh and steel.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.800]   I come from cyberspace.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.200]   It does.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.600]   Oh, but I love it.
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.760]   Well, played just a few seconds.
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.320]   Should I, if I could find it, is the audio on your
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.640]   go to the link, go to the other.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.040]   You got it.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:10:59.400]   All right.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.160]   Let's see here.
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:01.120]   All right.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.200]   There you track one.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, we give you.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:08.920]   John Perry Barlow, a declaration of the independence of
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:09.920]   cyberspace.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:18.080]   Governments of the industrial world, you weary giants of flesh and steel.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:23.040]   I come from cyberspace, the new home of mine.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:26.840]   So like hearing Ezra pound read his poetry, it just takes a little of the
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.120]   swing out of the sails.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.200]   Some people are better.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:32.040]   Reachable supposed to be mad.
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:32.880]   I'm here.
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:40.160]   On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.240]   This is 1996.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.560]   It's a great piece.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.720]   I still think you're not welcome among us.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:49.200]   You have no sovereignty where we gather.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:54.320]   We have no elected government nor are we likely to have one.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.960]   I wish this were true.
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.000]   Let me play it with the music.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:57.960]   Let's see how that sounds.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:08.200]   Governments of the industrial world, you weary giants of flesh and steel.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:13.200]   I come from cyberspace, the new home of mine.
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.760]   I'm sure there'll be a YouTube video.
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:19.040]   On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.680]   Wow, Jeff, this was your idea.
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.120]   A declaration of the other.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.600]   I was hardly the only one.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.440]   Department of records.co.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.600]   That's who made it.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.640]   And I guess this is the first of many from the Department of Records.
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.080]   And I think we should buy it.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.560]   I'm going to buy it.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.320]   How much is it?
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:41.240]   You can get it in flak MP3 or for 50 bucks, you can get it in plastic.
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:44.720]   And then all you need is a turntable.
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:45.400]   Turntable.
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:54.160]   Ladies and gentlemen, this is the worst time I've ever had in my life.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:58.440]   Because I have to say goodbye to temporary goodbye to Gina Trippini.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.800]   She'll be back every month, though, which is nice.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.320]   And you'll see others on the show as a chance for us to get many of the other
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.440]   hosts that we've had filling in the past on on a regular basis.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:13.760]   And I think we're going to we're going to find a woman of color who is a
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:18.840]   computer programmer and an Android lover to replace you.
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.720]   That's my goal.
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:21.680]   You can do it.
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:22.920]   You can do that high.
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.680]   That's a bar.
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:26.600]   Hey, Gina, you're the best.
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.880]   You really are people.
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:32.920]   Please let's keep Gina gainfully employed by going to think up.com and
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:33.960]   subscribing.
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.440]   It is awesome.

[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.960]   The insights you get will be amazing.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.120]   I'll show you my insights.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:44.120]   Jeff and I are subscribers.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.880]   Oops, I went to the wrong page and we love it.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:51.000]   It attracts my F words religiously.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:51.640]   Beautifully.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:53.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:54.240]   Let's see.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.680]   Cashmere Hill has changed her bio.
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:00.320]   I got three interesting new followers, including somebody named Jupiter in
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.000]   velvet.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.480]   Now the head shaver got some big, big favorites.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:08.400]   Big favorites.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:12.640]   19% of my status updates contained into the word I mean mine.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:13.560]   That's not bad.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.840]   I am not as bad as people think.
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:21.720]   Uh, look, this is my most popular tweet two years ago.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.120]   What happens in Vegas city badge on four square?
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:25.200]   Mm hmm.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:28.560]   Those were the days.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.120]   Remember that?
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:34.080]   Uh, hundreds of replies on my bald passport picture.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:39.840]   And Steve, you can thank me for generating more than a half a million more people
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:40.720]   seeing your tweet.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.880]   So this is fun.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:43.560]   This is what you get.
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.000]   Think up.com.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.360]   Thank you so much for talking about think up and being so supportive.
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.800]   You and Jeff and Jason Ron on all that.
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.080]   And right, I really appreciate it.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.200]   And yeah, we'll see what happens.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.880]   It's a lot of fun, but uh, you'll be bad.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:57.360]   You'll be bad.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:57.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.800]   And thank you for for six amazing years of talking about Google.
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.680]   I've this been such a, uh, such a pleasure and a privilege to have this time with you
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:06.600]   all every week.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:11.200]   And you know, we were, I've always been such a fan and, uh, you know, I remember
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.720]   when Merlin man said, I want to do a productivity show with Gina
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.000]   Trippani and we called you.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   Uh, and from then on, it's been nothing but a romance.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.560]   And so you're the greatest.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.480]   Gina, Gina, I can't tell you how much I've learned from you and how delighted
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:24.520]   I am to be near you.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:28.000]   And, um, we're going to make sure you get rich.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.040]   So you retire right here.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:29.640]   Yes.
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:31.760]   That's my fantasy.
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:35.720]   Verizon comes along, buys it for a hundred million dollars in you, uh,
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:38.480]   spend the rest of your life doing podcasts.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.480]   You know, it's not my main goal, but I'll take it.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:45.360]   I would turn that down.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.480]   Well, thank you.
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:48.320]   Thank you again for everything.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:51.520]   And so I've learned so much about broadcasting and about watching, especially
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:54.920]   you Leo and especially Jason, two viewers, just such a consummate professionals.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:55.960]   And you're so good at what you do.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.280]   You're such incredible experts.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:00.840]   It's been six years and I still trip over my own words and have a hard time
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.760]   forming a complete sentence.
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.360]   And I, I, it's been, it's been incredible.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:08.040]   And, uh, and I'm really glad that I'll be back in a month.
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:08.560]   Yes.
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.800]   We'll make sure of that.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:10.560]   Yeah.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.800]   I'll be inside the Jason.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.840]   I, I got your email and your number actually.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:15.240]   We know that.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.240]   It's cool.
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:16.760]   We know.
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.400]   So we'll just skip the tip and the number and just make, because I think this is
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.200]   the way the end of the show.
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:24.160]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.320]   Or, Gina.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.000]   Gina.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.160]   You could shave your hair now if you want.
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:32.000]   Your hair, I wanted to say this, but then I thought, Oh, it would be sexist and
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:32.200]   wrong.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.120]   Your hair looks great.
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.880]   Oh, I think you're very good.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.960]   I'll take a hair compliment any day.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:37.880]   Thank you very much.
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.800]   You can say the same of me if you wish.
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:44.440]   And I, and I just really wanted to thank the chat room for, I mean, just all the
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.600]   love I am getting today.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.560]   Thank you so much.
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.280]   I'm not, my head isn't going to fit into the Skype box.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:52.560]   You guys, this is incredible.
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:52.880]   Thank you.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.360]   And thank you to the, to the chat room.
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.320]   Are you scared me at first in the first year?
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.280]   But after that, it was, it was a love affair.
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:01.240]   Are you going to continue to post at scribbling.net?
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:01.640]   Yes.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:02.600]   Yes, I am.
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:03.280]   I am.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:03.880]   I sure am.
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:08.520]   In fact, I did a post about, about, about wrapping up here.
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:11.480]   And yeah, I'm going to try to be writing a little bit more.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:16.920]   And you're going to want some self expression and more than just a PHP.
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:21.080]   The, you know, you need a little more than just a little C code, a little Java here and there.
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.280]   You got to use pros, baby.
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:24.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.480]   Good.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:26.040]   It's true.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.080]   I love that picture.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.760]   I love that picture too.
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:31.400]   I hope, I mean, I included that picture because I love.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.240]   We're looking more like those guys.
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:38.320]   Yes.
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.840]   I like the Miss Piggy version too.
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:40.960]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:42.720]   All right, Gina.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.440]   All the best.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:44.400]   Thank you so much.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.240]   Thank you.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:47.080]   Jeff, you'll be back next week, right?
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.600]   I think you should play Gina off with the trumpets.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.080]   You should never quit this show, Jeff.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.720]   Well, plots.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.880]   Well, I'm just afraid that our ratings are not going to go down to zero.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:56.880]   Because I've already watched for Gina.
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:00.120]   Could happen.
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:00.720]   Right, boss?
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.360]   Sad elephant trombone.
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.200]   Good night.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:08.800]   See you later, Gina.
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:09.440]   See everybody.
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:10.400]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.200]   See you next week.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.200]   God, this week in Google.
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:12.720]   Bye bye.
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:22.720]   [MUSIC]
