[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.320]   This week in Google, I am here.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.240]   So is Gina Tripani of smartawear.org.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.560]   And she's looking really good.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.040]   Oh, there it is.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.040]   It was--
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.880]   Wow, Gina, your hair's gone white.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.680]   Pretty much surely white.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.600]   That's great, Gina.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.280]   Good to see you.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.880]   Jeff Jarvis also here from buzzmachine.com,
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.440]   professor of journalism.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.560]   And as you can see, we can see the CUNY band
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.760]   brand right behind you now.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.120]   That's nice.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.520]   And a little later on, we're going
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.960]   to be joined by somebody from Google, Ido Green.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.800]   He's a Google developer advocate for Chrome OS.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.960]   And as you know, I've been a little bit baffled by Chrome OS
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.880]   and even more so by these new Chromebooks.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.520]   And he's going to explain to me why the market is demanding
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.520]   that Google have a second OS and a browser-based laptop.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.000]   It's a hell of a lot more successful than the touchpad.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.960]   Yeah, wow.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.280]   That's not saying-- actually, I don't know,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.800]   after the $99 touchpad.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.840]   Yeah, I tried to buy one.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.360]   Nobody.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.880]   Yeah, I did.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.840]   Did you really?
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.040]   Wow.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.400]   Well, yeah, but then I was saved for myself.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.880]   No, wait a minute.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.000]   I guess this story broke the day after we
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.200]   did the show last week.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.720]   Yeah, I guess so, yeah.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.520]   So we haven't had a chance to talk about this yet.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.680]   I know it's kind of old news.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.440]   But yeah, you covered it on your other shows, yeah.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.080]   But any thoughts?
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.760]   I mean, HP gets out of the PC business and kills WebOS,
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.960]   except wait a minute.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.160]   That's not what they meant to say.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.880]   This is the funniest story.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.440]   They so botched the press release
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.840]   that the whole news cycle for the first 24 hours was HP
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.160]   kills the PC business and WebOS.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.760]   And it turns out what they meant to say is, oh, no, no, no,
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.720]   no.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.920]   We don't want to be making hardware for WebOS.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.960]   We're going to license it as Microsoft does, as Google does.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.960]   And others can continue to make WebOS hardware.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.520]   And we don't know for sure what's
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.000]   going to happen with the PC business.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.360]   Maybe we'll spin it off.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.280]   Maybe we'll find a buyer.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.680]   We don't know.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.560]   Michael Dell, have you seen Michael Dell in Google+,
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   he was just having a field day.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.680]   We're happy to story the PC business.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.640]   Buy HP.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.000]   Yeah, it's good for them, isn't it?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.240]   It gives them more market share.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.120]   HP, in fact, Dell has been down--
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.480]   I think they're now third or fourth HP is number one.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.080]   So I'm sure Michael's very happy about that.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.400]   Kind of a misstep, though, because I
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.440]   don't think there's anybody in the world now that doesn't
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.920]   believe that WebOS is dead, dead, dead.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.920]   So these $99 touch pads just add fuel to the fire.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.920]   They're clearing them out.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.000]   Apparently, according to one of the tear down sites,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   it costs them $300 to make these.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.440]   So they're losing $200 for everyone they sell.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.280]   There are, reportedly, a million in the warehouse, a million
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.360]   that were made.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.440]   So we're talking a billion dollar write down when you talk
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.840]   about engineering staff and everything.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.080]   Microsoft's going after the developers.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.160]   They've had 1,000 people respond to their email saying,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.000]   yeah, let's show us something about Windows Mobile,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.280]   or Windows Phone 7.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.440]   I think it's too late.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.640]   I think HP inadvertently killed WebOS.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.560]   Gina, you would never develop for WebOS now, right?
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.200]   No.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.040]   I mean, honestly, I wasn't really close to the alarm.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.360]   Well, in too anyway, I got to tell you the honest truth.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.160]   The Times did a good article called
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.280]   "Sell Bigger Die Fast," where Apple's
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.240]   kind of set this precedent.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.280]   But if you don't launch a product and have this huge uptake
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.960]   right away, it gets killed.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.520]   They were talking about the kin and the touch pad,
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.120]   and they mentioned wave.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.600]   Wave.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.440]   And it is kind of--
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.720]   The flip cam?
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.520]   It is kind of interesting and a little sad, right?
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.040]   Because, I mean, back in the day, like two years ago,
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.240]   you give a product a little more time
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.720]   to kind of prove itself out, although I have a--
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.680]   The flip cam-- the flip cam is wrong, though,
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.600]   because the flip cam did become the number one cam
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.320]   quarter out there.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.280]   It was big.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.520]   It's just Cisco was an idiot.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.640]   Or it wasn't big enough, or something went wrong.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.840]   It's like the Hollywood thing.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.640]   If you don't have a big first weekend,
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.920]   it's very difficult to have a second act in Hollywood nowadays.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.800]   You've got to go out big.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.480]   Well, it's like media, too.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.360]   You have two ends of the spectrum.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.440]   The blockbuster economy is still there, right?
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.480]   For movies and things like that.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.840]   But it's much, much, much harder and riskier
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.200]   to try to get a blockbuster.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.360]   Or the teensy economy.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.880]   And a teensy economy works because you have all these platforms
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.240]   and you can do things really cheap,
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.840]   and you can do a physical product,
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.040]   people who are on Kickstarter, or 3D printers, or blog,
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.520]   software, all that kind of stuff.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.800]   So the teensy economy works and the jagundo economy works.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.920]   It's the middle economy that doesn't work.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.440]   The mid-to economy.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.840]   Mid-to economy.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.840]   It does not work.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.240]   Yeah, it is interesting.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.440]   Although, again, I think that HP--
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.640]   they claim their intent was not to kill WebOS,
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.200]   but merely to say, well, our hardware products aren't
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   selling well enough for us.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.960]   And we think others can do a better job.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.520]   But I got to say, I don't think anybody's
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.400]   going to pick up WebOS at this point.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.000]   You know, developing for WebOS is not
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.080]   so different from developing for a lot of platforms,
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.080]   including Chrome OS.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.720]   It's just HTML5.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.160]   Yeah, yeah, which is really smart.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.480]   I wouldn't even think about developing for WebOS.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.720]   I would think about developing--
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.560]   HTML5.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.280]   HTML5-based widgets, which so many platforms support now,
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.560]   and it's a smart move to do so.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.960]   And then it would run, I guess it would run--
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.360]   well, here's the example.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.560]   read.kindle.com.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.240]   Amazon's HTML5 Kindle.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.480]   They develop that once.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.040]   They do it in standard HTML5.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.520]   It runs great on a Chromebook.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.240]   It runs presumably well on WebOS and every other HTML5
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.160]   browser.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.760]   Who needs an app?
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.480]   Right.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.160]   Or you could-- I guess there's some way to wrap the app
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.640]   so that on HTML5 apps so that it's kind of a standalone app.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.480]   But it's the same thing.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.680]   You don't have to-- it's probably not a lot of work.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.320]   I haven't looked into it, but I would imagine
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.280]   it's pretty straightforward.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.240]   They must have some sort of packaging tool.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.920]   Yeah, I would imagine they probably do.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.480]   But as long as they stick to the HTML5 standard,
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.920]   that's a smart move.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.000]   And it's less of a commitment for developers.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.040]   Do you think Android made a mistake by saying
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.280]   you've got to learn Java?
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.520]   You know, I guess the native app versus the web app
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.920]   on Android and iOS and more still sort of rages on.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.120]   I mean, I think that you have the option.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.080]   You can go either way.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.360]   I'd like to see Android support native web apps maybe
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.800]   a little better, like that they would act a little more
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.640]   like native apps versus just looking like a bookmark
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.760]   on your home screen.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.480]   I don't think they made a mistake.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.360]   It's a lot harder to develop.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.840]   It's a lot harder to develop for Android.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.880]   So I have to think that the future of apps for mobile
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.720]   is going to be HTML5.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.080]   It is, but native apps just give you
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.040]   access to hardware-level controls that you just
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.400]   don't get with HTML5.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.680]   What could you not do?
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.400]   You have access to the accelerometer?
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.160]   I mean, isn't this up to the Google anyway?
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.040]   Couldn't they give you access to everything?
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.920]   Yeah, I mean, that's what they would need to do.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.000]   I'll tell you the truth.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.960]   I went straight into-- because I was comfortable with Java,
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.920]   and new Java, I went straight into native app development.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.040]   Because the kind of party line at that time was, hey,
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.120]   if you want to make a really great mobile app that
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.520]   doesn't have weirdness, just go native.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.480]   So I don't know exactly the difference is.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.200]   I think that the Android browser--
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.760]   and actually, hopefully we'll talk about this
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.200]   in a few minutes in our interview--
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.600]   I'd like to see the Android browser--
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.200]   We need Chrome.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.080]   --more Chrome-ier.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.240]   Not just the Android browser.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.120]   I'd like to see it really based on Chrome.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.320]   Some of the edges are smooth.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.600]   And if Android can get even better web app integration,
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.680]   kind of just in the home screen and hooks into the share menu
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.480]   and all those hooks into the search button, that kind of thing,
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.120]   then I think developers would be a lot more willing to go web app.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.080]   But I think for now, really, you want to go the native app.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.120]   And I think most iOS developers might say the same thing.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.040]   I think-- although I think iOS has a little better web app
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.920]   integration that you can make a mobile web app
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.240]   and put it on your home screen.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.960]   And it behaves really nicely.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.400]   It has that smoothness of the native apps.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.760]   I'd love to look into this.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.080]   It seems like you could develop once in HTML5,
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.920]   but work on the web, work on mobile.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.880]   It would work everywhere.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.320]   Wow, isn't that what you want to do?
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.000]   Especially for your content company.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.160]   Maybe not if you want to make GPS app.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.520]   Right.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.560]   I mean, there's always going to be those advanced,
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.360]   those really cool advanced features,
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.040]   like the accelerometer and the turning.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.840]   And that the mobile device gives you
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.040]   that you're not going to be able to get.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.040]   So it always feels like a little bit of a trade-off.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.800]   But that right-once-run, most platforms
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.080]   is very, very attractive, especially for small companies
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.400]   that want to get an app out on different platforms all at once
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.920]   and not have to have an iOS development team
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.800]   and an Android development team.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.120]   There are lots of iOS apps.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.160]   I would love to see on Android.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.080]   And if they were HTML5 and the integration was strong
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.360]   on both sides, it wouldn't be such an issue, reporting.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.000]   I saw the first research--
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.920]   oh, I'm going to go for a proprietary research.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.560]   I don't know the numbers and couldn't share them.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.800]   But an AI agency in Canada did research on apps
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.280]   and found that most of the activities people do,
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.520]   so the obvious, like games, is on the browser.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.520]   The proportion of used versus downloaded apps,
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.040]   the people who use less than half the apps they download.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.040]   And the whole notion that apps are going to take over the world,
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.760]   you have to write apps, you have to write apps.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.640]   I think that it's not just the right-once issue.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.920]   It's also the issue that people are probably going to start
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.680]   using browsers more and more and more on these devices.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.120]   Right.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.040]   And this is the point of HTML5.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.800]   If you can get an application-like experience with HTML5, why not?
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.640]   The chat room is pointing out there are a couple of tools
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.560]   that are designed for this.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:38.720]   There's PhoneGap, which is a framework for HTML5 apps
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.920]   that allows your app to run everywhere.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.400]   It's a framework like Ruby on Rails.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.880]   And then there's Appcelerator Titanium, which
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.800]   is a similar idea, Build Native Apps,
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.560]   but basically build them with HTML5.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.560]   So this is an area where third-party developers--
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.480]   of course, that's not going to help you much with the iPhone.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.680]   Yeah, I mean, the other issue is the revenue issue, right?
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.160]   I mean, when you have an app handy,
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.520]   you can easily collect payment for an app through the store,
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.400]   through the market with this--
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.400]   a user isn't going to want to type in his or her credit card
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.120]   details into a phone through a web interface.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.280]   So I mean, I think there are definitely some issues.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.000]   For a developer who wants to make money now,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.240]   they want to go native app.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.720]   Yeah, I'm thinking this is me classically thinking
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.520]   as a content creator instead of developer.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.960]   For content creators, it strikes me
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.200]   better than writing an app for your magazine.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.560]   Make an HTML5 website.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.880]   Then it's standards compliant.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.120]   It works everywhere.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.840]   And you can have that full experience, can't you?
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.080]   I mean, isn't that the way to do it?
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.200]   Speaking of which, did you see that Zite got sold?
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   That was the--
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.000]   Well, it finally got confirmed.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.480]   Oh, CNN.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.480]   I don't know, confirmed.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.960]   Everybody's running the phone.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.960]   We're insane.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:59.520]   Zite was the flip board style magazine app for the iPad
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.200]   that was getting a lot of trouble-- time Warner,
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.520]   among others, suing it.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.600]   And then the rumor wasn't.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:04.880]   You're right.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.360]   I haven't heard the confirmation that CNN, the time Warner
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.680]   company, purchased it for $20 to $25 million.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.920]   That's one way to get somebody to sell, sue them,
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.080]   and then say, or you can--
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.440]   I'll give you $25 million.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:25.080]   Speaking of the touchpad, you didn't get one, huh?
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.000]   No.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.200]   I saved for myself.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.480]   There may be more.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.520]   There may be more.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.880]   And you might want to look at it because there's a project
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.480]   now, TouchDroid.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.200]   They're trying to put Android on the touchpad.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.040]   Now, admittedly, I don't think you should buy--
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.080]   I don't think the touchpad hardware is the best hardware
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:40.600]   out there.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.280]   No, that's the other thing.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.480]   Well, you know, I almost wish I could have bought 10 of them
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.440]   for the school.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.400]   Students could have had--
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.000]   Especially if you could put Android on it.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.640]   I mean, for $99, you go--
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.720]   now it's just Wi-Fi.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.120]   It's not 3G, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.880]   We'll give it to my sister, the minister, who's never rich.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.840]   There you go.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.440]   Well, it's not too late.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.880]   They say HP says we got a lot of them in the warehouse.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.240]   We'll be restocking soon.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.040]   So keep an eye on the HP websites and places like that.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.360]   I wouldn't go to Best Buy anymore.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.440]   I think they probably aren't going to get any more shipments.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.080]   But HP may well.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.240]   We're making it even less--
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.640]   what did they have to give Best Buy?
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.680]   So it's even-- it's $300 tear down cost, right?
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.840]   They're selling for $99.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.640]   What's the margin they had to give Best Buy still?
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.680]   I don't know.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.880]   HP has said that they expect a $1 billion write down next quarter.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.600]   So that's significant.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.280]   All right.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.080]   This is a test of your literary ability, Little RoarShock Test.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.080]   Go to google.com and tell me who the hell we're celebrating
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:37.520]   this today.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.720]   I know.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.800]   What the hell is that?
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.280]   You see?
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.280]   You could see Google in there.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:43.680]   Yeah, you can.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:49.160]   It's Voorhace, the 112th birthday of Jorge Luis Voorhace.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.200]   Help me alt text.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.040]   You hear my only hope.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.080]   You hear my only hope.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.600]   They've picked the strangest things.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.120]   And that is it.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:57.800]   I don't even know.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.720]   Is that an illustration from something?
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.160]   It must be one of his books.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   But I don't recognize it.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.160]   No.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.520]   One of my favorite authors, though--
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:14.040]   great Argentinian writer, essayist, and poet.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:19.760]   And he always wrote the magical stuff,
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.320]   things magical, things happening.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:27.480]   What was it, the 100 years of-- what is that?
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.520]   I can't remember his book.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.520]   You know, those meetings have to be obnoxious.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.760]   I'd hate to be in there fighting for Voorhace.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.960]   They've got to be showing off.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.960]   You're afraid to say, I don't know who the hell is.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.920]   Is this in the world?
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.800]   I think this is the takes the cake for the most obscure
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.560]   Google Doodle.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.040]   It does.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.040]   112 birthday.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.040]   Is the 112 birthday significant?
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.720]   No.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.960]   No, it's just--
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.640]   They pick weird things.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.240]   They do.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:50.760]   They do.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.880]   100 years of solitude, isn't that it?
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.080]   I love that book.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.720]   Didn't he write that?
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.040]   Or am I wrong?
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.040]   That's Marquez.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:14:59.760]   Well, damn.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.520]   What did Voorhace write?
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.960]   Maybe he's not your favorite author.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.120]   No, I like actually read.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.080]   I was thinking of Marquez.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.580]   Huh.
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:12.800]   Where is the books of Voorhace?
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.040]   Where, where?
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.360]   Is he right for Huffington Post?
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.720]   No, he's long gone.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.040]   I believe at 112 I'd be-- now there,
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.240]   you deserve a doodle if you're still around.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:26.200]   I can't--
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.200]   I'm sorry I have no help here.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.280]   I'm so ignorant here.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.560]   I've been showing my ignorance.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.040]   Oh well.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.560]   Maybe our guest knows.
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.120]   We can ask I don't--
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:35.720]   why?
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.400]   Why, I don't?
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:36.760]   Why?
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.000]   No, he's not responsible for the Google doodles.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.560]   Let's take a break.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.320]   We will get Idaho on.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.240]   We're going to talk about Chrome OS, Chromebooks.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.440]   There's lots more to talk about.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.880]   Goodness gracious, including this verification badge
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.320]   on Google+, and Bradley Horowitz's interview
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.520]   with Tim O'Reilly.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.720]   How come Tim O'Reilly does an interview with Horowitz?
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.520]   It gets all that attention.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.640]   We do an interview on the day Google+ launches
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.440]   at Horowitz.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.360]   They don't even mention it.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:01.680]   I know.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.600]   What the heck?
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.360]   What's wrong with us?
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.120]   What don't you like us?
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.240]   Don't you like us?
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:14.640]   Dutch court bans the Galaxy S in Europe.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.360]   Google TV ad on Android S, DK, gives developers a path
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:18.960]   to big screen.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.080]   There's lots of stories in here.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.560]   Lots of stuff to talk about.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.840]   But we want to talk to Idaho.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.720]   In just a second, first we're going
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.640]   to talk about squarespace.com, the secret
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.280]   behind exceptional websites.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.880]   If you are on Facebook, and you say--
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.560]   and I see this all the time-- well, I have a web page.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.680]   It's facebook.com/mywebpage.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.600]   No, no, that's a Facebook page.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.840]   That's not the web.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.840]   It always bugs me.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.160]   People think Facebook is the web.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.040]   And I know Facebook wants you to think that.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.000]   But truthfully, if you're a business, if you're an individual,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.080]   if you've got a hobby, if you want to publicize something,
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.400]   if you want to show people your photos,
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.960]   you have to have your own site where you control the content.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.360]   And this is where squarespace is so good.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.320]   Because it's everything you need.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:55.840]   Soop to nuts.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.120]   It's the server.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.640]   Best serving, best absolutely best web service out there.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.880]   Plus, the great content management
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.000]   software that's running on squarespace.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.240]   And it's great for so many reasons.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.480]   For you as a designer of a site, it's fantastic.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.800]   You get these 60 plus designer templates
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.240]   that are very easy to customize with drag and drop.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.200]   If you know CSS and JavaScript, of course,
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.440]   fully HTML 5 compliant and all that,
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.640]   you can do anything you want.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.320]   But you don't have to to make a unique site.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.280]   And now just look at some of the incredible example
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.720]   sites on the squarespace site.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.480]   If you go to squarespace.com, take a look
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.920]   at the blogs, at the business sites,
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.680]   at the photography sites, the nonprofits.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.560]   So many people use squarespace these days.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.320]   I just love it.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.280]   So here's what you do.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.600]   You go to squarespace.com.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.600]   You see a big green button.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.800]   This is the other thing I really encourage all of our advertisers
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.120]   to do.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:53.760]   And they all do it.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.520]   And I love it.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.520]   Try it free.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.640]   So you go there.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.280]   You don't need a credit card or anything.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.120]   You just put in the name of the site, the password,
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.720]   the email address so they can notify you
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.080]   when your site's about to expire.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.200]   Now, for 14 days, you have the free reign of the place,
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.680]   which means-- and I do this all the time-- you can create a site
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.920]   and then just throw it out and say, oh, no, no, that's not it.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.240]   So I actually do a lot of ad hoc site design in here.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:22.280]   And if you like it, then you come back before the 14 days is up.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.240]   And you sign up for as little as $12 a month.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.960]   That's hosting plus the software.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.400]   And you know what?
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.400]   If you use the offer code TWIG8,
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.400]   TWIG, the number 8, all one word, you'll get 10% off
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.240]   for the first six months of your site.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.960]   Makes it even more affordable.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.760]   Squarespace is the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:47.800]   Always secure, always fast, always fun for every--
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.080]   for photography, for social media integration,
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.720]   the iPad and iPhone app.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.240]   I just love it.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.920]   Squarespace.com.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.080]   Give it a try today.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:56.840]   Squarespace.com.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.440]   Use the offer code TWIG8.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.240]   Let's welcome our guest from Google.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.480]   It's Ido Green.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.280]   Is that how you pronounce it Ido?
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:06.800]   Ido.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.200]   Ido.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:07.640]   It's a pleasure.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.280]   It's not Ido.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:08.720]   Ido.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.400]   I was going to say Ido.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.720]   Is that Italiano?
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.240]   No, no.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.080]   I'm from Israel.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.640]   Israel?
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.280]   OK.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.040]   You're the Google Developer Advocate for Chrome OS.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.240]   Exactly.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:20.800]   Exactly.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.480]   So in fact, you have your own little WordPress blog.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.080]   You got to get you over to Squarespace.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.600]   Greenedow, WordPress.com, and you, of course, on Google+.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.160]   How long have you been on the Chrome OS team?
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.400]   For the past six months, I'm quite new to Google.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.480]   But I'm having a great time here.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.240]   I'm really passionate about Chrome OS and this new platform.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.960]   Now, we all got one, right?
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.880]   Well, not all of us.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.640]   Just didn't go Google I/O.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.200]   But we got our beautiful little white Samsung.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.720]   This is a basically netbook style hardware
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.960]   and Adam process or not a lot of memory.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.760]   But what's different is not running Windows.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.800]   It's running Chrome OS, which is basically-- it's a Linux kernel,
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.320]   right?
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.320]   You know?
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.320]   On Linux.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.120]   But don't let that scare you because you don't see Linux.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.280]   Really, all you see is Chrome.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.080]   If you've used Chrome, you've used Chrome OS.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.040]   Exactly.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.440]   And actually, for power users, there's a little nice trick or tip.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.640]   If you do want to see the shell just because you want to SSH
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.840]   to another box or you want to see what's live beneath,
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:34.040]   you can do Control Alt T. And then you're just getting a shell
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.720]   that is trim and secure and limited.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.160]   But let you and Gina and other power users
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.160]   to see more than just the browser itself that you see.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.800]   That's kind of cool.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.840]   I mean, you do get a full command-- or not full,
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.280]   but you do get a command line here.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.480]   But you said the word-- I think that this is the word
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.400]   that I keep hearing when I talk to Sundai and others--
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.640]   is secure.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.000]   Is that the primary reason for Chrome OS?
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.600]   I guess the question that I keep having is, why do you need
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.160]   another OS?
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:03.920]   You've got Android.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.680]   Why do you need Chrome OS?
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.920]   So Chrome OS was built from the ground up
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:14.120]   on the three Ss-- speed, security, and simplicity.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.480]   And like any other things that we're doing in Google,
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.320]   we want to make sure that we're giving the best experience
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.440]   to users.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.600]   And Chrome OS was designed to users that spend the vast majority
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.960]   of the time on the web.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.360]   Now, in Google, as you know, we really
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.120]   want to foster innovation.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.720]   And we are in a very lucky position
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.280]   to have those two wonderful ecosystem, open source projects,
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.560]   both Android and Chrome OS, and see what will come up on each
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.280]   and every one of them.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.440]   In Chrome OS, what I'm truly passionate about
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.160]   that in the end of the day, you are dealing with APIs
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.400]   that are accessible in Chrome.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.960]   And for web developers, we have an extra mile, if you will,
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.080]   of APIs that's letting you deal with files locally.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.160]   The File Browser APIs and some others
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.000]   that harnessing web developers with even more capabilities
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   and power.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.680]   So that kind of speaks to the conversation
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.240]   we're just having about why don't people
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.720]   do more HTML5 development?
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.560]   Right.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.240]   So actually, I can see in the environment today,
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.800]   lots and lots of people startups, medium company,
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.320]   and even big companies like Facebook and Netflix,
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.080]   investing a lot of efforts in HTML5.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.640]   And I had a conversation that you had before with Gina.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.840]   And I'm 100% agree with what you said,
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.440]   that HTML5 harnessing companies and developers
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.000]   with a great capabilities to be more productive
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.200]   and to give more to users on each and every mobile device
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.680]   that they are using.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.000]   So when I complain that I say, well, I just run my MacBook
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.680]   here with Google and rather with Chrome,
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.560]   and now I really have Chrome OS and everything else,
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.160]   that's really kind of a specious argument
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.960]   because this is not the market that you're selling the Chromebook
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:54.160]   to.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.920]   This is for people who don't want to spend as much money.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.120]   They want something that's more secure, less complicated.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:00.560]   Correct.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.600]   And one of the big promises, and I personally truly
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.080]   passionate about, is that I think
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.000]   that the Chromebook will do the writings in verticals
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.120]   like EDU and this, where it's not only the hardware,
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.600]   it's not only the software that we keep updating.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.160]   You have a new version of Chrome every six weeks
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:22.680]   with more security feature and more speed and other new APIs
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.240]   that we are baking into it.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.640]   But the hardware itself is going to be updated
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.360]   with those new initiatives.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.240]   And that's something that, in my humble opinion,
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.320]   going to change a lot of things in those verticals.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.160]   You know, the problem I still have, though,
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.600]   that stops me and I stops a lot of people
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:45.000]   is the inability to use it offline.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.360]   Right.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.880]   So not as connected as well as we would like to be.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.320]   We need gears back.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.680]   So we have actually something that is much better than gears.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:58.440]   And quite soon, you'll see our own products
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.120]   by the end of the summer with offline capabilities, which
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.160]   will be Gmail, Calendar, and Docs.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:08.720]   And even today, you have more than 100 apps in the app store
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.760]   that are giving full offline capabilities.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.480]   So just to name a few, Angry Bird
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.640]   will work offline after you install it.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.440]   It's you don't need any connectivity.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.640]   You have the New York Times app that
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:27.600]   will work nicely on a flight when you don't have a connection.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.920]   You have Amazon Reader and to Dooley and lots of others
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.120]   apps that just give you a nice offline capabilities.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.760]   And we're going to see in the near future more and more
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.600]   apps that are supporting it.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.360]   And I suspect that lots of companies
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.600]   will harness their web apps with offline capabilities.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.400]   It's quite new API that HTML5 harnessed developer with.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.160]   And I suspect that more and more of them
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.880]   will get used to it and will baked it into their apps.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.440]   So there are three different ways that--
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.520]   oh, I'm in guest mode.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.440]   This is kind of cool because this is Eileen's Chromebook.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.560]   And it has a guest mode.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.320]   And so it's completely private browsing.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.440]   It doesn't save anything that I do.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.480]   But I can't install Angry Birds, but that makes sense
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.760]   because it's not my computer.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.260]   Right.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.400]   But the computer doesn't cost you?
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.760]   No, it's a-- if you're guest mode,
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.440]   you can't install extensions, I guess.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.120]   Maybe you can.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:17.640]   I don't know.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.200]   Extension and apps.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:22.200]   But if you log in with your account,
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.640]   you'll be able to do it, of course.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.640]   And then obviously, it will sync between all the other--
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.080]   Other apps.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.720]   That's one of a very productive features
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.800]   that we have that you always get what you
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.840]   got used to.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.240]   You pin some apps that are--
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.840]   pin some tabs that are actually apps
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.960]   that you're spending the vast majority of your time of the day,
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.160]   like Gmail or Calendar or others.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.840]   And then each and every place that you are logged in,
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.360]   you're immediately getting the same layout.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.920]   Everything is comfortable.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.000]   Yeah, you don't need to--
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.120]   To some long setups.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.880]   It looks to me like that some of these apps are flash.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.080]   Some of them are HTML5 and have dedicated storage, right?
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.440]   So those can run offline.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.520]   Netflix, is that Silverlight or is that its own--
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.400]   what is going on with Netflix, for instance?
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.760]   Yeah, so it's not Silverlight.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.920]   With Netflix, we leverage the system of plugins.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.840]   And we do have several plugins in Chrome OS
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.680]   that are currently not exposed to external developers
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:26.560]   and things like native Flash and Netflix
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.800]   are built on top of that.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.960]   I see.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.960]   I see.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.000]   You said that by the end of the summer,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.840]   we'll have offline Gmail docs in Calendar.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.240]   And Chrome OS.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:41.960]   Yeah, in Google I/O, we said that by the end of this summer,
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.480]   we'll have those three with offline capabilities.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.800]   And we are on track to have them by the end of the summer.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.520]   Yeah, that'll be--
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.320]   I mean, if I can plow through my email inbox on the plane,
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.560]   that'll be a big upgrade for sure.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.160]   I'm with you.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.160]   I'm with you.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.160]   I'm with you.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.920]   That's news.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.720]   There's an else to Google I/O.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.080]   It was.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:01.760]   OK.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.160]   So I think it was last week.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.720]   We covered a story where we saw--
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.120]   I think it was a Chromium developer.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.840]   I don't think it was actually a Googler.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:14.200]   It looked to be a prototype of a touch-based Chrome OS,
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.800]   or Chromeium, version of Chromium.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.920]   Do you know anything about that?
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.360]   Or can you speak to a little bit to the Android versus Chrome
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.040]   question, which I'm sure you get all the time?
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:24.760]   Sure, sure.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.160]   So I don't know specifically about what you're mentioning,
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.560]   but I do know that you have today in JavaScript events
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.760]   that you could hook up and have the touch.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.160]   And you have actually lots of libraries and frameworks
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.440]   that giving you the ability today to easily maneuver
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.800]   and have touch events.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.680]   And as you know, Chrome OS is an open source project,
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.560]   and I suspect that we'll see it on other devices
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.040]   and on tablets in the future.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.680]   And you support WebGL as well in this, right?
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.160]   Right.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:52.840]   And--
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.600]   There's some WebGL stuff that just gives me chills.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.360]   The WebGL--
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.640]   Evan Wallace-- let's see if this will run on Chrome.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.440]   I don't know the Chromebook.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.960]   But this Evan Wallace water simulation with WebGL is absolutely--
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:10.080]   That's one and another one that will really blow your mind
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.640]   is ROMRO.ME.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.480]   It's just showing the power.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.520]   This is saying it requires the OES texture float extension.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.040]   So it looks like that is an HTML5 extension
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.000]   or a WebGL extension that's not enabled,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.760]   or is it because I'm in guest mode?
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.840]   I suspect that it's not enabled,
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:33.160]   but the best way to check it will be if you are not
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:33.800]   in the guest mode.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.880]   So I will-- I'll have to try it.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.240]   And RO-ME.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:38.800]   Let me try that one.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.240]   ROM-- ROM project, yeah.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.960]   So there's enough hardware in here
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.080]   to do a lot of those kinds of things.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.440]   Is there an accelerometer?
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.440]   Is there-- there's no GPS.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.800]   There is 3G on some models.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.040]   Right.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.960]   And one aspect that I really passionate about
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.960]   is that the hardware is going to improve over time,
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.880]   not just the software.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.360]   So for EDU and B, like we said, every three years,
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.000]   Google will support and will give a new device.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.680]   And that's something quite revolutionary in terms of,
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.600]   if you're thinking about those big organizations,
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.680]   they don't need to hassle and worry
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.120]   about the total cost of ownership of their IT department.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.760]   So right now, this is the water running on my Mac gear.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.520]   This is an amazing simulation.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.120]   In fact, if I turn gravity on--
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.240]   here, let me turn on gravity--
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.640]   the ball will fall.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.280]   Let's see.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.640]   G tackles gravity, there we go.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.840]   This is an amazing-- this is WebGL.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.240]   And it's amazing.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.720]   I mean, this simulation is incredible.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.840]   And it just loads in seconds.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.200]   I mean, that's pretty good.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.200]   If you could do that, you could do amazing gaming
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.080]   and all sorts of stuff.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.960]   This is using ray tracing and so forth.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.480]   Right.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.200]   We have lots of games today in the Chrome Web Store.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.760]   And I suspect that in the near future,
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.360]   you'll see more and more bold examples of what
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.640]   can be done in the browser.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.560]   Yeah, pretty incredible.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.280]   So it's $20 a month for education.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.400]   That includes 100 megabytes a month of 3G, which is low,
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.560]   but maybe for education, that's efficient.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.920]   And you're saying, of course, you get all the updates
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.120]   during that three-year lifespan.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.400]   And you're saying, at the end of three years,
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.160]   they get new hardware.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.120]   They continue to just pay $20 a month.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.120]   That's a trap.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.720]   I think that's where I really see a market for something
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.880]   like this.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.400]   And what's kind of uptake are you
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:31.240]   seeing in business and education?
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.120]   It's too early to say, you know, something
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.640]   meaningful because we just launch it.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.280]   But we are very pleased with the current response.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.360]   It's doing amazingly well.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.160]   Google is not one of those companies.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.200]   Jeff Jarvis, you talked about that
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.680]   have to have the hit in the first two weeks, or they say,
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.400]   we're out.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.400]   They've got some resources to go with this for a while.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:52.920]   That's true.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.080]   Well, I mean, Chrome is a huge hit.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.080]   Chrome, the browser itself, is a huge hit.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:56.960]   It's only a year.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.280]   Whatever happens to Chrome OS.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:02.120]   And Chrome is already really proven itself.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.640]   But I think Chrome OS is the thing
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.040]   that Chrome OS doesn't really speak to power users like us
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.800]   as much as it does to a student or in a small IT
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.120]   department that just wants a really easy way for people
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.320]   to get on and not have to maintain machines.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.640]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.640]   It makes sense.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.000]   We kind of lost on us a little bit, Leo.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.120]   Yeah, well, we're geeks.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.320]   We want more power.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.240]   We want-- but I think that there is certainly
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.560]   a market for something simpler.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.400]   Is that what you were saying before?
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.600]   If you're a developer, if you wanted
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.880]   light devices with light development,
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:41.760]   then Android is harder to develop for than HTML5 on Chrome OS.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.280]   No?
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.320]   If you're a company trying to get really light and once
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.200]   across development, that's going to be
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.080]   its long strength.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.160]   Yeah, Chrome OS will run HTML5s apps.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.160]   And as you're getting more and more powerful browser
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.120]   in other devices, it will run on all the devices.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.720]   And as I said before, you see Netflix, for instance.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.640]   It's not a small company.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.600]   And they're investing a lot in HTML5
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.600]   to be on each and every device.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.320]   Is the Chrome OS development really the same team
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.000]   is doing Chrome?
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.760]   Or are they separate teams?
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.480]   What kind of intersection is there between the two?
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:21.720]   So the team are all sitting together.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.240]   There are, of course, devoted people
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.640]   that are specialized in operation systems
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.720]   and doing very sophisticated stuff.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.600]   So we could have the simplest, most useful experience
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.480]   to users, but beneath the first layer,
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.800]   you have very sophisticated things.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.880]   So there are operations in the small teams,
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.920]   because each one got its own expertise.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.560]   But overall, they're all sitting together
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:50.680]   and all working to push that platform in the same direction.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.320]   I have a Rome running, but I think I might have something else
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.520]   going on in the background.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.840]   There's music on this by Danger Mouse, Daniele Lupey.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.600]   Oops.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.320]   And that's Nora Jones, I think.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.960]   Yeah, and after that, it's like a film.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.400]   It's like a film, but you could control the point of view.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.040]   Oh, interesting.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.320]   So as I move my mouse around, I get different points.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.520]   Oh, look at that.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.080]   Exactly.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:16.680]   Holy can.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.360]   This is WebGL also.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.680]   Wow.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:27.080]   That's a new film in which you can control a point of view.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.720]   Yeah, that is amazing.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.040]   And I like Nora Jones, too.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.000]   Yeah, the music's great on this.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.040]   My wife thinks she's terribly boring, but I like her.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.760]   Well, there's Danger Mouse is on here, too.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.360]   Everybody loves Danger Mouse.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.360]   Yes.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.720]   [LAUGHS]
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.480]   That's interesting.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:49.560]   So I wonder if you'll see more artists using this as well.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.760]   That's an interesting idea.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.760]   You have-- it's limited.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.520]   You can't look everywhere, but you can kind of look around.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.020]   Right.
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:02.440]   So the focus of the Chrome OS team continues
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.480]   to be on devices that have keyboards and not necessarily--
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:06.560]   not touch screens.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.160]   That's kind of-- the separation between Android and Chrome OS
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:13.200]   is still touchscreen versus keyboard device.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.160]   That's one aspect.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:16.720]   And you totally write about it.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.760]   We're more looking at people that are producing content
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.560]   and not consuming content.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.320]   But you could definitely see other benefits
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.800]   that you have today with Chrome OS.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:30.160]   And in that-- in lots of cases, you know less, it's more.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.440]   So you have less things to worry about.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.240]   So it's boot much faster.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.400]   The battery will last longer.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.960]   Lots of things that making people that need this netbook
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:44.120]   to be productive all day and can't hook it to electricity.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.360]   Just different type of device.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.040]   Do you see an OLPC-style market, a third world market,
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.440]   or an underdeveloped world market for this as well?
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.720]   Yeah, I think that one of the promising things
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:57.480]   is that as long as you could lower the price
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.480]   and make it better and cheaper for people,
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.440]   we could see it going across the board, definitely.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:04.940]   Yeah.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:05.640]   I really like that.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.920]   I like that differentiating between productivity product
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.400]   versus something you consume.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.800]   Jeff famously reboxed his iPad here on the show
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.040]   because he said, it's just to consume.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.440]   I can't write a blog post.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.400]   I can't--
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.480]   He might have been wrong and hindsight on that.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.360]   I'm impressed.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.600]   I've got it now.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.120]   I like it now.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.840]   But the tablet, the touchscreen, is really--
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.920]   I enjoy it most for watching things and for browsing.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.000]   But by writing a blog post, I'm going to sit at a keyboard
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.400]   or writing a Google Doc or creating any kind of Doc.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.880]   I want to be at a full keyboard.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.120]   So I like that kind of--
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.640]   It seems to me that the two most limiting factors--
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.000]   well, it's like three.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.120]   One is batteries.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.040]   Two is input.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.160]   And three is ubiquitous connectivity.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.880]   If we solved all those three things,
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.320]   if we had really easy input from anything,
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:02.360]   from just fingers or voice, if we could use them forever
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.760]   and use them everywhere, it's the next explosion.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.920]   And we do hang our best to address it in the Chromebooks.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.840]   I mean, you just touch the three points
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.680]   that the Chromebook excel at.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.560]   And to me, just the personal thing,
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.080]   I mean, the keyboard was really overwhelming good
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.680]   at the beginning, not just because of the cliques.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.640]   And it just feel nice.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.440]   It's the caps look.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.040]   I mean, in terms of this useless key
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.760]   that taking so much real estate,
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.200]   you have now a search button.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.320]   Now for people--
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.680]   This is the thing I like the best about the Chromebook.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.920]   Because every computer I get, I turn off caps lock.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.560]   And you're playing-- it was so smart to put a search key there
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:42.960]   instead.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.120]   And actually, a nice tip for people
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.080]   that are passionate about caps lock
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:52.040]   is just to hold the two shift keys together for two seconds
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.080]   or three seconds.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:56.160]   And then the caps lock, the search button,
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.440]   becoming a caps lock button.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.640]   So you really want to shout in a chat room.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.160]   Exactly.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.640]   Hold down both shifts keys.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.080]   You can do it.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.280]   It was refreshing to see someone say this caps lock key
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.960]   is useless for most people.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.240]   There's no reason.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.120]   Well, we thank you for your time, Edo.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:13.960]   Oh, thank you.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.880]   It's an honor.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.040]   I appreciate it.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.920]   I was at Google in December.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.280]   And Sundar Pichai and I kind of got
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.280]   in a debate over the merits of the idea of having just
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.240]   Chrome on a notebook.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.640]   But I have to say, having seen it, it's not for me.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.640]   But I really see the market for it with EDU,
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.680]   as you said, with education, with environments
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.680]   where you want security, simplicity.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.480]   And I can see even older people, non-computer literature
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.880]   people might be very interested in something like this, too.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.480]   I mean, personally, to me, it was overwhelming
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.360]   to see my father using it.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.280]   Because he's an avid email user and you
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.920]   Picasa and other photo sharing to send photos of his grandkids.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.080]   And it's just an amazing device for that.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.080]   Right.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.880]   Well, to me, it makes perfect sense for Google.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.440]   I mean, this is obviously perfect for Google.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.640]   The only question is, is it perfect for users?
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.800]   And the market will let you know.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   They're pretty good.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.000]   Yeah, and we are very excited to see where it goes.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.360]   That's absolutely true.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.520]   Thank you, Edo.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.040]   Thank you.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.040]   Thank you.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:16.760]   Thanks for coming on.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:21.720]   Edo Green is as a passionate developer advocate for Chrome OS
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.240]   and the Chromebook.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.800]   And yeah, it's great to have him on.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.640]   He has to be on.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.880]   He says he's a fan of the show.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.320]   He wanted to talk to us.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.440]   We're going to take a break.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.560]   And when we come back, we have more of those news items.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.480]   We're talking about Google and the cloud.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.280]   In fact, Jeff Jarvis, I want to ask you about the big Facebook
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.280]   privacy announcement of yesterday.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.320]   And just a little bit.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.520]   But before we do, let me remind you about Netflix.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.440]   You know, I just installed the Chrome Netflix app.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.200]   It's so cool.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.800]   I mean, it's really pretty much the same as it would be in the web.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:57.520]   But you can watch on your Chromebook Netflix, which is pretty
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.000]   neat.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.680]   Netflix is everywhere.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.280]   It's, of course, on most new TVs, all the new Blu-ray players.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.480]   PS3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.800]   It's on many Android phones.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.800]   I think 24 phones at last count, iPhone, even Windows
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.720]   Phone 7.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.920]   This is a movie.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.440]   I'm kind of-- I just like the title of it.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.000]   I don't know if I'd actually want to watch it.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.880]   Let me see if I can find this.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.800]   These are the new movies that have just come out.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.640]   So "Rutker Howr" movie.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.640]   "Rutker Howr" is "Hobo with a Shotgun."
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:30.960]   I don't know.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.640]   It just sounded interesting to me.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.120]   Here's the beauty of this.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.200]   This may be a terrible movie.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.960]   In fact, with 2 and 1/2 stars, it probably is.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.000]   But I could just watch it.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.200]   I'll watch it for five minutes.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.120]   No harm, no foul.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.520]   If it is bad.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.800]   I don't have to watch anymore.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.760]   There's more movies here.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.160]   In fact, I've watched a lot more.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.800]   And I've been more adventurous in my movie selections
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.120]   because I can just watch Netflix streaming.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.120]   I could see anything.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.760]   And if I don't like it, I can move on.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.000]   So I've got to recommend this if you probably already
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.520]   know about it.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.640]   In fact, if you're a Netflix user, just
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.240]   click that watch instantly tab.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.760]   But if you're not, you'd be doing us a favor.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.600]   If you go to Netflix.com/twit, you'd
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.120]   be doing yourself a favor too because you get 30 days free
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.680]   of Netflix streaming.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.680]   Share it with your friends and family too.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.880]   It's just incredible.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.120]   Mad men.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:22.440]   You are brave for putting up your cue on the screen, Leo.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.840]   I like loving it in public.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.840]   I love it.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.280]   So far, have you seen anything that I should be embarrassed about?
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.920]   Worst movie ever made?
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.440]   Birdemic is now on Netflix streaming.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.480]   What is it called?
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.200]   Birdemic.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.200]   Birdemic, I haven't seen it.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.880]   Yeah, it's kind of a homage to the birds.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.280]   But a real low budget, funny low budget.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.920]   Well, the movies you see here are because of what
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.480]   you've been watching, right?
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.920]   So I don't know how I get the emotional drug TV
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.840]   shows section.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:56.920]   I mean, they make stuff up by mixing stuff together.
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.880]   It's like a mashup of categories.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.440]   I just watched a Burning Man documentary.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.240]   So now they say, more like Burning Man,
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.840]   best of the Beatles, Revolution and Cairo,
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:09.640]   inside the Baker Boys, how to get ahead and advertise.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.280]   And that was an interesting movie.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.280]   "Witty Dysfunctional Family TV Shows."
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.240]   That's because I watch it home with my family.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.680]   They know.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.040]   So for goofy French language films, romantic showbiz dramas,
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.360]   you can't tell something about me, can't you?
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.520]   I always get the like surreal documentary
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.560]   with a strong female lead.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.680]   I get that one a lot too.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.640]   I like that.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.200]   I like that.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.640]   In fact, I think I do have these strong female lead category.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.520]   Cult movies, dark movies, foreign movies.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:36.960]   Here it is.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.160]   Farm movies featuring a strong female lead.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.200]   Nice.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.440]   The piano, what a great movie that was.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.080]   Anyway, you see, you can see why we love Netflix.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.240]   Netflix.com/twit if you're not yet a member.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.720]   And if you are, tell a friend.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.760]   Do us a favor.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.680]   We love it.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.080]   And now on the Chromebook.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.800]   I think that's pretty impressive.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.840]   They put it on the Chromebook.
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.480]   That's wild.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.440]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.560]   Gina Trapani as well.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.880]   We're talking about Google and the cloud and what's going on.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.960]   Now, Jeff, you got a briefing from Facebook
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.400]   on this privacy change.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.840]   It hasn't rolled out everywhere.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.040]   I guess tomorrow it's going to start rolling out
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.120]   a small group of Facebook users at a time.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.120]   But it's clearly to me a response to Google+,
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.200]   I know they deny that.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.280]   Yeah, they said they've been working on this for more than five
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.440]   months.
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.880]   So who knows?
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.720]   Who knows what they knew from Google and leaks
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.320]   or how this world works?
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:35.120]   But it certainly looks like an homage to Google+.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.840]   But I think the bigger thing that interests me there
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:42.680]   is I think we're moving toward now a shared norm about sharing.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:46.440]   And that putting the controls for sharing when you share,
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:50.160]   the appropriate controls there, is this much smarter way to do it.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.720]   The one time fits all preferences
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.600]   that you put in and the defaults that become an issue
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.800]   and all that, knowing what you're doing when you're doing it
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.720]   and finding a way to make that easy and fast,
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.680]   I think is very, very clever of both.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:07.320]   And I think it just advances this whole idea and this notion
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:10.920]   of sharing, which of course I'm in favor of.
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.600]   So I think it did a lot of smart things.
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:14.360]   I think they also gave you more control.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.160]   So it's a normal one when you share with whom you're
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.440]   sharing what you're doing.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.440]   Instead of everyone--
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.000]   On a share by share basis.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.120]   On a share by share basis.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.440]   They'll even give you a preview of what
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.920]   it's going to look like to the outside world, which is great.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.040]   You have a sense.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.520]   Then you also control your profile page
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.400]   so that someone can't put something there without you,
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.120]   which is really important.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.720]   And again, I think fairly obvious.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:41.360]   So if someone tags you in a photo, you get to approve or not.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.400]   You get to approve the tag in any case.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.560]   That was a huge problem before.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.640]   It was a big problem.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:51.000]   Now, of course, someone can still write a caption that says--
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:51.400]   This is you.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.680]   --teeter bannies in this photo.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.160]   Right.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.760]   But they can do that anywhere on the web.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:55.640]   There's no big deal there.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.600]   It just means that you're not searchable under that tag
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.280]   for that photo.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.720]   And I think the other person still
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.600]   gets to keep their freedom of speech saying, no, no, no.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:03.280]   Gina was there.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:07.040]   I saw her with that beer.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.720]   They changed the notion of everyone to public,
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:12.680]   which I think also makes a great deal of sense.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.840]   They added--
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:14.840]   interestingly, I forgot this one.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:18.280]   They added accountability to tags.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.360]   So when someone tags you, you now know who tagged you.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.320]   And it says so.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.480]   That's good.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.040]   Google Flush just did that themselves.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.680]   It's funny in the like button.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.520]   Yeah, I asked them whether that was going to be--
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.520]   Or the truth.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:30.440]   --true retroactively.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.760]   And at first, they said, no, they came back and said, yes.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.640]   So if you tagged someone who you shouldn't have tagged for,
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.560]   now they're going to know it.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.000]   This article on Search Engine Land
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.160]   takes what I just said one step farther.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.800]   They say, new Facebook sharing controls undermine Google's
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.920]   privacy advantage, the Google+ privacy advantage.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.840]   I think it was over--
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.360]   Google+ had never privacy advantage.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.360]   They had a functional advantage.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.440]   Functional advantage.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.680]   And I think you're right.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.960]   I think this is merely expressing what is now
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.120]   a standard way of thinking about how we share.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.320]   It's like how we turn a page online now.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.280]   Everybody's going to have this.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:10.720]   Everyone's going to have it.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.840]   This is the expectation of how you're
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.340]   going to do it.
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:14.360]   This puts a proper level of control.
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:16.200]   I think it makes people more comfortable with sharing,
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.160]   which is a good thing.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.720]   Yes.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.560]   Now, what's interesting to me is now your Facebook profile page.
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.840]   The Google profile page is a public page.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.760]   Period done.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.840]   And so what you put there is there for the world to see.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.000]   For Facebook, in essence, you end up
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.400]   with an infinite number of profile pages.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.720]   That's what's really interesting.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.080]   It's so granular.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.080]   Your page will look different to everybody.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:40.580]   Right.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.760]   I can share something with the Twig crew, but not
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.080]   with my journalism crew.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.600]   And of course, the problem here, though, for Facebook is,
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.080]   I don't have crews.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.460]   Because circles, they didn't have groups until well
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:53.480]   after I had all my friends.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.200]   And I'm not going to go back and retrofit circles into it.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:57.840]   So that's a problem.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.920]   That means I have less functionality
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.760]   by the nature of the timing alone with Facebook.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.920]   So what do you guys think?
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.480]   This is why competition is a good thing.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.000]   This is why we should say let 1,000 social networks
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.420]   flow because the best features will come out.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.140]   And hey, I believe that the Facebook maybe
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:16.780]   was working on this before Google+,
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.420]   I mean, people have been shouting about the fact
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.700]   that Facebook's privacy was so difficult to decipher
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.020]   for a really long time.
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:24.700]   But I'm sure that Google+ gave them a little nudge.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.220]   I think that has a little fire under the behind.
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.980]   So I'm really-- I'm glad to see this.
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:30.500]   I mean, the fact is in real life,
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:34.020]   you're aware when you're speaking of who can hear you.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:35.500]   And that's how it should be online.
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.900]   And I'd love to see that this is going to be a new standard.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.340]   That these are things going to be upfront and center.
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.820]   That it's not going to be difficult for anyone to understand.
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:45.200]   I hope that Facebook doesn't opt people into or out of things
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.340]   without asking them first or decide on aggressive default.
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.460]   I think they've learned that lesson, haven't they now?
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.660]   I hope so.
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:54.940]   But I think that having Google in the game
[00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:57.340]   and any other new social network in the game
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.540]   kind of helps them make those decisions.
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.460]   That's very successful.
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:04.140]   It's as successful as G+, helps them make those decisions
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:04.640]   faster.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:08.100]   But again, really happy to see a new standard kind of being
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:13.740]   set and these new concepts of public and subsets of that
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.780]   be upfront and center on these two major--
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:17.580]   these are the two major networks at this point.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.740]   I mean, besides Twitter, of course.
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.140]   But Twitter is just so binary.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.700]   It's protected or public.
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:24.780]   So great for Facebook.
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:28.420]   Bradley Horowitz, VP of Prada for Google+, spoke to Tim O'Reilly.
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:30.420]   Got a lot of press.
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.460]   Some called it-- in fact, this Matt McGee writing
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:37.460]   in Search Engine Land called it the state of Google+ talk.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:38.180]   Google's been great.
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.180]   Bradley's been great.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.460]   Vic has been great about talking about Google
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:45.140]   and admitting things like, as Bradley said in this conversation,
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.460]   we need to improve.
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:50.420]   He also though said that these Facebook privacy controls
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.100]   are good for users.
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:55.580]   And what they did was familiar implying that, in fact,
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:57.220]   yeah, it's very similar to Google+.
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:00.300]   But also, maybe if you could take it another context,
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.660]   familiar in the sense that, as we were saying,
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:06.860]   this is just what everybody's going to expect from now on.
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:10.180]   I guess not on Twitter because Twitter has a default of public.
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.220]   But anywhere where you might have some expectation of privacy,
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:16.260]   these kinds of very granular, very specific controls
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.180]   are just going to be the state.
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.660]   The problem here is I think we've
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:23.620]   got to move away from privacy being the structure
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:24.300]   of the discussion.
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.660]   Because as I've been trying to say for a long time
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.540]   and now others are saying it too, this
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:32.660]   is the wrong place to put a secret.
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:33.820]   It's not really about--
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.620]   It is about focused, relevant sharing.
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:39.100]   What the hell you doing putting those secrets on the internet?
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:39.460]   Right.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:39.980]   Stop it.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.780]   So be incredibly stupid.
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.500]   Better ways to share than better ways to hide.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.100]   It's just the right way to frame the conversation, definitely, Jeff.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:46.700]   Yeah.
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:47.940]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:50.500]   Someone in the chat room asked what I thought of the Nim Wars,
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.060]   what they're calling Nim Wars, pseudonym wars.
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:55.180]   And Bradley actually brought this up in his talk.
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.260]   Bradley said, straight up, that they
[00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:00.340]   need to improve their entire process for dealing
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:02.980]   with profiles that use pseudonym.
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.620]   And I'm not sure that he went as far as to say they
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:06.860]   need to change their policy.
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.460]   But I definitely heard from him that Google is trying to figure out
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:13.420]   what they need to do about pseudonyms and being anonymous.
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.340]   The Dr. Kiki discussion that we had a few episodes ago.
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.500]   It seems like they're going really slowly with this.
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.820]   I think they got taken off guard, frankly.
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:22.180]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:25.940]   I think that they made a kind of ill thought out decision, which
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.500]   if you don't really, really think deeply about it,
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:33.020]   is a good idea, which is, well, if people have their own
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.420]   their own conversations and use their real names,
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.780]   then we'll have a more civil Google+,
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:38.980]   they didn't really think it out.
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:42.660]   He said to Tim, he said, understand pseudonymity and anonymity.
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:46.020]   There are use cases that we don't need to be educated about.
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:51.020]   I understand the importance of this for the internet culture.
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:54.580]   He said, Google is working on a way to allow anonymity inside Google+,
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.940]   there's, quote, no moral opposition to that happening.
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:59.780]   We want to let them in in a way that's great for the whole community.
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:00.500]   It's a high priority.
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.020]   I think they just got blindsided.
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:02.580]   That's all.
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:02.860]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:04.900]   And they have the talking stick growth.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.780]   You know, that any other startup wouldn't have,
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:10.340]   just because they're Google only have the established user base.
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:10.660]   Right.
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:11.660]   And it is a beta split.
[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:12.820]   They can't work.
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:13.300]   Yeah.
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.940]   Well, but they have a tricky--
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.660]   it's not obvious the solution.
[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:21.300]   Now, they have added this verified button.
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:25.340]   So presumably Lady Gaga is verified, which is a pseudonym.
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.660]   She's not really Lady Gaga.
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:28.820]   Madonna as well, who I just--
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:29.900]   Madonna's on, I know.
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.620]   I just started following her.
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:34.460]   Her name is Madonna, and the last name is Dot.
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:35.740]   Madonna, Dot.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:36.620]   Madonna, Dot.
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:37.860]   But she's verified.
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.140]   She's verified.
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.180]   I didn't notice the Dot.
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:40.900]   That's pretty funny.
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:41.980]   That's her last name.
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:43.620]   Because you required to have a last name.
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:44.100]   Wow.
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.140]   I didn't even notice that.
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.900]   Well, Lady Gaga's first name is Lady.
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:47.420]   So--
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:47.940]   Right.
[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:48.700]   So she's got two names.
[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:49.700]   Yeah, it's a really-- this is an issue.
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:53.220]   Now, Madonna's not posting herself most of the time.
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.780]   It's her people.
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:56.180]   They don't even make any bones about it.
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:59.060]   It's like the use Madonna in the third person.
[00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.540]   But occasionally, she'll say something like,
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:02.260]   thanks for all the birth they love.
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:06.380]   And I presume that that's her, I don't know.
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:10.260]   So Bradley also spoke about the brand issue.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:14.740]   They said, we've kicked out tens of thousands of brands
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:16.620]   that wanted to get into the service.
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:18.860]   And angered millions of their customers, he said.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:19.420]   Yeah.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:20.140]   Yeah, he said--
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:21.700]   Yeah, Google Apps customers.
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:23.140]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:24.980]   We want to be a good experience for the brands,
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.540]   the people that want to follow them.
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:28.500]   And I think he's right to say this.
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:31.100]   And the people that don't.
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.980]   That's the issue.
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:38.140]   How do you allow brands in without junking up Google+,?
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:40.780]   I really appreciated that I got a verified badge.
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:41.860]   I think you did too, Leo.
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:43.340]   And you probably did too, Jeff.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.180]   Although, I wondered why.
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:47.100]   I mean, I know they said people that
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:48.660]   have been added into a lot of circles.
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:51.140]   Well, you're in the top 20 of--
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:51.980]   You're in the top 20.
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:54.260]   And I think that they invited us.
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:54.620]   Right.
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:55.180]   They invited us.
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:56.500]   But how do they know it's me?
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:57.340]   I mean, I--
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:58.980]   They never called you.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:00.300]   No, they never called me.
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:01.660]   I mean, I have a lot of people.
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:02.060]   It's your picture.
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:02.980]   So it was a set up.
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:03.340]   It's--
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:06.100]   It must be you.
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:06.380]   It's my--
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:06.660]   It's my--
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:07.140]   --to tell us.
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.740]   --that Tom Friedman this week.
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:10.460]   On plus.
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.780]   There was a fake Tom Friedman saying--
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:12.300]   Really?
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:14.660]   --who would fake Tom Friedman?
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:15.180]   I know.
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:15.620]   I know.
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:16.460]   It's like--
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:19.300]   Check out account with my credit card.
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.220]   They never asked either any of us, right?
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:22.260]   We never heard from them.
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:24.540]   They never said we want to verify it's you.
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:25.980]   Send us a hair for a DNA sample.
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:26.980]   I think it's easy.
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.700]   They knew where he melted us.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:29.820]   They invited us.
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.540]   We came on.
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:32.180]   We're easy.
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:33.780]   I don't know how this scales.
[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:35.340]   I don't know how verification scales.
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:36.340]   That's a thing.
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:36.940]   I don't know.
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:38.740]   I just feel like there has to be some sort of automated--
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:40.780]   I just wish that they would have said, I think,
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:42.340]   was it null that does it?
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:44.420]   There are products that verify your identity.
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:46.700]   That's how I verified my profile.
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:47.140]   If you--
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.700]   In the old days of the Google profile,
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.220]   you'd go to your null page.
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:53.980]   And then it would look up your phone number.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:55.420]   Or you'd give it a phone number.
[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:58.420]   It would do a cross look up if it matched in the phone book.
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:00.380]   You'd say, OK, that must be you.
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:01.820]   Or you would give it a credit card,
[00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:04.060]   which is what I did because I'm on unlisted numbers.
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:05.460]   And it said, oh, yeah, that's you.
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:06.420]   The credit card matches.
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:07.100]   So go ahead.
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:07.700]   You're Leo.
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:09.420]   And that's how I have a-- in fact, I was a little mad
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.900]   because I had a verified profile, which I lost when Google
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:12.460]   plus--
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:13.220]   All right.
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:13.660]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:14.980]   That must be the reason why I just--
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:15.500]   Maybe that's it.
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:16.500]   --had been upfront about that.
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:17.660]   I wish that they had said, people who
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.900]   have been added to a lot of circles
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.580]   and who had verified their profiles previously,
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:22.900]   or had a Google Checkout account.
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:24.980]   I wish that there-- there has to be some sort of criteria
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:27.740]   involving a phone number or credit card.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.020]   I just wish that they had been upfront about that.
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:31.740]   I worried I wondered about it.
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.900]   But otherwise, I think it's a good thing.
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:36.100]   And I'd like to see them be a little more transparent
[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:37.300]   about how this happens.
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.420]   Like Twitter, you can get verified on Twitter,
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:42.860]   but it's really not clear who or why or how what you need to do.
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:45.580]   And they only do it for people who are in danger
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:46.660]   of being impersonated.
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:48.660]   I just wish that that was a little more transparent.
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:51.020]   I think it could be actually a business or a service
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:54.100]   that you could outsource to the credit card company,
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:56.260]   the post office, somebody like that.
[00:53:56.260 --> 00:54:00.380]   And I'm actually-- I haven't written about the Nim fight
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:02.100]   yet much because I'm kind of very much
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:06.300]   in the middle of it on it, which is unusual for me.
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:09.780]   And I think they're both right and they're both wrong.
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:12.220]   Dana Boyd, whom I love and respect like no one on Earth,
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:14.180]   I think she's brilliant, but she called Google
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.900]   requiring real names to be an abuse of power.
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:17.900]   Well, I don't call that--
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:19.100]   That was strong.
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:19.540]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:20.620]   It's Google's service.
[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:22.020]   Google and beside what it wants to be.
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.340]   And people don't want to use it.
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:23.940]   They want to use it.
[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.300]   But it is their service.
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.180]   She makes an interesting point that the people who
[00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:32.780]   are disadvantaged by anti-anonymity policy
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:37.060]   are not people like you and me, the white male power base.
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:40.740]   It's the downtrodden that suffer.
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:42.020]   Well, I know you understand that.
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:43.140]   I'm not explaining it to you.
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.140]   I just want to make sure that it got heard
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:47.140]   that that was her point on that.
[00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:48.140]   Right.
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:50.820]   But yet we also have trolls.
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.940]   That's obviously Google's not trying to--
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:55.220]   Google's not trying to say, hey, we're white males
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:57.220]   and we don't need to be anonymous.
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:58.900]   They're trying to fight trolls.
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.700]   I rarely say this, but there's the need for a conference.
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:02.940]   There's a need to try to get--
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:03.900]   Great subject.
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:04.580]   Around identity.
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:06.140]   There have been some, of course,
[00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:11.220]   but in a different context about identity of the ways.
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.740]   But not anonymity and privacy.
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.140]   Identity and privacy.
[00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:17.100]   They all are-- there's a nexus of all three of these.
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.380]   And the value of publicness.
[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:19.500]   And the value of publicness.
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.700]   Which is why you should lead this conference.
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:22.540]   This is what I'll call--
[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:23.980]   And I will attend.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:24.980]   Because it's a really--
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:25.980]   But this should be.
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:26.980]   It's a good idea.
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:27.980]   This is me and this is my identity.
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:29.780]   And I want credit for this.
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:31.780]   And it's not easy.
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:33.980]   That's what I would say in Google's defense.
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:36.020]   This is a difficult thing to solve.
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.020]   I agree.
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:37.540]   It is.
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.780]   It's a great discussion, though.
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:40.380]   When I read Dana's post, I thought about,
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:42.260]   what's the first thing that the police does
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:43.940]   when they pull you over on the side of the road?
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.940]   They say license and registration.
[00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:48.580]   Like demanding identification and even going through China,
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:51.380]   demanding identification from everyone to use a service
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:55.260]   is definitely a way for an authority to assert power.
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:56.700]   Papers, please.
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:57.700]   Papers, please.
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:58.700]   Exactly.
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:55:59.700]   Exactly.
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:00.700]   Exactly.
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:03.420]   And I have to tell you, Michael, who plus gets spammed all the time
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:08.340]   by people who put in fake but legitimate looking first and last names.
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:12.860]   So this isn't-- so I think Dana's headline was strong.
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:14.180]   And her assertion was really strong.
[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:15.340]   But I think there's some truth in that.
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.340]   Anyway, I agree.
[00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:19.180]   It's something I think there's a middle ground here.
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.180]   And others have been trying to find the middle ground.
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:25.220]   And I think that the middle ground comes not to one size fits all rules.
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:26.940]   And that's where I absolutely agree with Dana.
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:30.340]   But there also comes the means where I as a user want to control.
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:33.700]   And maybe I as a user make the choice to only see verified people
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:35.140]   or real names.
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:36.740]   And I'm losing out of part of the world.
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:38.540]   And then maybe a foolish thing to do.
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:40.500]   But give me the control to do that.
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:44.460]   And Google should find a way to pull out of that and figure out how to do that.
[00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:49.460]   But I also agree that if it became nothing but stupid spam identities,
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:51.620]   it would be my space.
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:53.980]   And Tom Anderson gets this.
[00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:56.540]   He's written some really amazing things on Google+.
[00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:57.380]   I've asked him over the show.
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:59.140]   He doesn't want to do public stuff yet, ironic.
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.140]   He's just kind of getting back to being public.
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:03.420]   But he's written some really amazing things about this.
[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:05.020]   And I think he understands this too.
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:08.060]   My space was a bunch of fake identities and fake stuff.
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:09.820]   And it had no value in the end.
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:17.060]   Samsung, in its lawsuit with Apple,
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:20.980]   is claiming that Samsung stole the design for their tablets and their phones
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.620]   from the Apple iPad and the iPhone.
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.540]   Samsung, Exhibit D.
[00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:33.460]   Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film, 2001, A Space Odyssey.
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:34.660]   Yeah, this is great.
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.900]   The tablet in the clip has an overall rectangular shape
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:39.500]   with a dominant display screen.
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:44.740]   Narrow borders, a predominantly flat front surface, a flat black surface,
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:46.940]   back surface, which is evident because the tablets are lying flat.
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:50.020]   And a thin form factor.
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:54.260]   Samsung says those tablets are prior art.
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:59.260]   I wish they'd gone in and hacked it and put like Chrome on it.
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:01.180]   It just shows you the idea for a tablet.
[00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:03.420]   Isn't that original?
[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.860]   It is, you know, Ann Lee Newitz, who's the editor of I09,
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:08.180]   which is a fantastic sci-fi blog at this conversation
[00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:10.420]   at South by Southwest a few years ago about how futurism
[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:14.740]   and how science fiction is a way in which we, you know, plant the seeds
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:15.940]   for what will be, right?
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:17.220]   I mean, it's not just imagination.
[00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:19.300]   You plant these notions into people's minds
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.100]   about what the future could look like and then it happens.
[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:21.580]   Exactly.
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:22.540]   So I just love this.
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.380]   Exactly.
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:23.860]   Example.
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:25.540]   I just thought that was a great story.
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:28.420]   There's a famous one too of, and I'm forgetting who did it,
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:33.340]   but a night-reader prototype of a tablet in 1994.
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:33.820]   Right.
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:35.060]   That was a wood.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:36.060]   Right.
[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:36.900]   That existed.
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.220]   That was real, right?
[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:43.740]   Well, and Apple did do very famously in,
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:46.860]   I think it was in the late 80s, pretty sure it was late 80s,
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:50.580]   a film which I will find of the Knowledge Navigator,
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:53.060]   which is a tablet.
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:55.340]   So this idea has been going around and Apple,
[00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:59.180]   I don't think it was the first, but Apple has prior art too.
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:00.660]   But I don't think anything goes back farther
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:05.740]   than 2001, a space odyssey, which came out, I think, in 1968.
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:08.020]   I just added the link to the night-reader tablet if you care.
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:09.260]   Yeah, let me see if I can find it.
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:09.580]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:10.780]   It's under other.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:11.460]   Under other.
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:12.180]   Under other.
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:13.340]   We share Google Doc.
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:15.580]   That's how we talk to one another.
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:18.660]   We have so many things to talk about, and so little time.
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:22.900]   There it is.
[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:26.420]   Night-reader tablet.
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:29.620]   If I could find that Knowledge Navigator,
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:31.020]   that's actually a great video.
[00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:32.860]   That is a classic video.
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:34.340]   So this is 1994.
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:35.260]   Yeah.
[00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:36.020]   There it is.
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:39.660]   Night-reader, a vision for the future.
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:43.540]   So this newspaper plant is outmoded in old fashioned.
[00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:47.540]   Who needs ink and newsprint when you can put your newspaper
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:49.220]   on an electronic device?
[00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:53.100]   Someday in the future, this tablet PC will be come.
[00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:54.380]   We're going to talk up, man.
[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:57.140]   You are, you are.
[00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:59.060]   Well, I just had to happen there.
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:02.340]   Here in our factory, we're talking about it at a square table.
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:07.420]   Our engineers nod and agree, a tablet is the future of Night-reader news.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:09.420]   How do you like my hair?
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:11.060]   Wow.
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.140]   Not to a '90s.
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.420]   Yeah, look, you see this?
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:17.900]   This is a piece of paper.
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.380]   If we could only make something electronic that
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:24.060]   were the same form factor, we could conquer the world.
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.140]   Night-reader sold a McClatchy several years ago.
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:28.060]   No longer exists.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:28.940]   No, it is this guy.
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:35.820]   I wonder if I could find that old YouTube knowledge navigator.
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:38.860]   I bet I could Google knowledge navigator and probably find it.
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:41.780]   What other stories do you want to cover before we get to our tool tip
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.180]   and number of the week?
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:44.940]   Anything?
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:45.580]   There's so many.
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.340]   I'm looking at all these.
[01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:46.940]   It's amazing.
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:47.620]   Yeah, here's the video.
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:48.540]   It's on where?
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:50.380]   video.google.com.
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:53.820]   I'm going to miss Google video when it's gone.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.300]   This quality is not very good.
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:57.500]   I think it was from a VHS tape.
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.940]   Apple prepared this, I think, for the TED conference,
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:02.140]   one of the first TED conferences.
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:02.940]   Yeah.
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:07.140]   And the reason I know that is I have the laser disk from that TED
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:09.700]   conference that this video is on.
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.180]   That's what it was still called, Edward.
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.460]   Edward, the word was TED.
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:14.540]   Oh, come on, play video.
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:20.980]   Great music in this, too.
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:23.660]   So here we are in a kind of normal model.
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:25.300]   Oh, what is that?
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.300]   Why, it looks like the Microsoft career.
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.980]   You've got three messages.
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:31.780]   Oh, and by the way, he's got a guy in a bow tie inside of the talk
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:33.420]   to you.
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.460]   Robert Jordan, a second semester junior,
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:38.980]   requesting a second extension on his term paper.
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:41.420]   And her mother reminding you about your father's surprise
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:44.380]   birthday party next Sunday.
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:47.620]   Today you have a faculty lunch at 12 o'clock.
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:51.900]   You need to take Kathy to the airport by two.
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.700]   You have a lecture at 4.15 on deforestation
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.580]   in the Amazon rainforest.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.380]   So he does a lot of the stuff.
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:01.540]   He's got a graph, and he pinches it and arranges it.
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.780]   I mean, this is all very much.
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:04.260]   And this is a very old--
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:05.940]   Good movie university video.
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:10.980]   I think the main purpose of this really
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:14.500]   was to demonstrate voice navigation, as opposed to the tablet.
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:17.060]   But it just seems so obvious, I think, to everybody at the time,
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:18.820]   that that would be the form factor, right?
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.300]   Yeah.
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.180]   All right, prior art--
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.060]   It should be a talking paper clip, I think.
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:23.980]   That's a mistake.
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:25.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:26.820]   With a bow tie.
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.700]   Yeah, future we couldn't wait for.
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.060]   Good news for Google Music.
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:33.780]   I think in this decision, this court decision,
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:36.740]   that Michael Robertson's MP3 tunes
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:40.020]   was protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:42.340]   It was a service--
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:44.660]   by the way, Michael Robertson's company was bought by Google.
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.100]   And I think he's a Google employee now.
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.820]   He's a guy who started MP3.com.
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:50.860]   It was a service that allowed you to--
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:53.820]   well, it kept a single copy, just as Dropbox does,
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:55.580]   of any song that people uploaded.
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.620]   If it was the same song.
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.540]   And the court said, no, they can do that.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.100]   That's fine.
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.820]   There's MP3 tunes.
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:07.340]   They did actually find Robertson for his own uploads.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:08.580]   That wasn't OK.
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:11.180]   But they said the court-- and I think this helps Google
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:12.900]   a little bit.
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:15.700]   Google, you remember, and Amazon both declined
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:19.020]   to pay license fees to the music industry for the music
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.420]   they were storing on their service.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:22.860]   But they have been keeping, I think,
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.420]   separate copies of everything.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:28.700]   Let's see.
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:30.820]   There's a new YouTube version of Hangout.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.340]   Did you see that?
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:32.820]   Yeah.
[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:36.900]   There was a new link below YouTube videos.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.100]   Does that mean that you can send it to a Hangout?
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:42.100]   You can say, hey, come hang out and watch this YouTube video,
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:44.140]   which is-- it's under the Share button.
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:45.980]   So you have to be on YouTube video, look at Share,
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:48.820]   and then you can say start a Hangout watching this YouTube
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:49.340]   video.
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:50.900]   See, I think that's great.
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:51.380]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.020]   I mean, watching YouTube videos is kind of a cool way
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:55.020]   to use Hangouts, but it's sort of buried and not obvious
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:55.580]   how to do it.
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.380]   But now you can launch that straight from Hangout.
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:59.500]   I think we're starting to see a lot of--
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:02.580]   I think this is just the beginning of Google+ integration
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.420]   across the web.
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:05.740]   The plus one button also is getting upgraded.
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:06.820]   I don't have it yet.
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:09.340]   But you can share-- when you plus one something,
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.340]   it'll share a snippet to your Google+ stream.
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:11.460]   So--
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:12.780]   Right.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:14.980]   So I think that the neat thing about this
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:17.060]   is that we're starting to see Google--
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.180]   as we expected, see Google+ starting to show up
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:21.100]   in other Google properties.
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:23.260]   So it is kind of hidden.
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:24.820]   You click the Share button.
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:26.780]   That's where you get that embed code and all that stuff.
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.180]   And right there, watch with your friends,
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.940]   start a Google Hangout.
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:32.420]   And now I presume--
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:35.700]   That does that show up only if you're in Google+?
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:36.180]   I assume?
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.740]   No, this is on YouTube.
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.060]   It was on YouTube for everybody.
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.700]   Yeah, that's what's-- oh, I see.
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:43.260]   If you're a Google+ user, I don't know what happens
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.340]   if you're not a user.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.260]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:45.500]   You must--
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.900]   Probably it says, oh, you get that page where, oh, you're
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:50.420]   not a member, but you could join page.
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.860]   Yeah.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:53.300]   And this looks exactly like--
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.380]   I haven't done this with--
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.820]   I know you did it right away with YouTube, Gina.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:58.060]   But this is what it looks like, right?
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.180]   This is the normal.
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:00.700]   Yeah, well, that's what it looks like.
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:01.980]   And it should be loading up.
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.620]   It looks like it's a little bit slow there.
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:05.340]   Yeah, everything's going slowly.
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:09.980]   So I wonder if the video is paused until someone joins you?
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:10.620]   I suspect.
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:14.860]   It says it's waiting for Google sharedspacegadgets.appspot.com.
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:16.500]   There we go.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.780]   Oh, so it does start playing right away.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:18.980]   And then you can invite someone.
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:19.940]   I'm all alone in here.
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:21.980]   Nobody's watching this video with me.
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:22.700]   It's just me.
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:24.900]   But I don't get as I would see many invitations.
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:27.260]   I thought I should see that because I follow you,
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:29.180]   but I'm not going to see that.
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:32.380]   It depends on who you--
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:33.060]   Did I invite--
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:33.900]   I didn't actually--
[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:34.780]   Oh, there you are.
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:35.660]   There you are.
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:38.100]   So it's public by default, I guess.
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.900]   Because I didn't see an invite.
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:40.940]   Or maybe there was an invite.
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:41.340]   I just missed.
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:42.100]   I didn't see it.
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:42.860]   So it's published by--
[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:44.100]   But it would take my camera on that one.
[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.700]   I think it went to extended circles and not public.
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.140]   It goes to extended circles.
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:48.500]   Let's see.
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:49.500]   Let me look--
[01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:50.340]   Let me go back here.
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:52.500]   Start a Google Hangout.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.620]   Let's do it again.
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.020]   I got it online.
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.820]   Well, you're my extended family.
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:58.820]   Do you want a Lao?
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:01.980]   Yes, well, I don't know why it suddenly is asking me that.
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.380]   Oh, anyway, enough.
[01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:05.700]   We get it.
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.660]   I think the reason it's a story to me
[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:09.620]   is that it was just a matter of time
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:12.380]   before Google starts putting links to plus features
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:13.900]   in other Google properties.
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:14.100]   Yes.
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:14.620]   No doubt.
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:14.940]   No doubt.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:16.540]   I think we're going to see a lot more of those
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:19.340]   experience type things through Hangout.
[01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:22.660]   Games, and now they're pushing the YouTube capability.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:25.060]   So I'm really excited about screen sharing
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:27.100]   and being able to--
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.740]   I would love to be able to do a talk with demonstrations
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.780]   about ThinkUp, like a desktop.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:35.300]   So I'm hoping fingers crossed with that kind of thing.
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:38.140]   Now, I have a plus one button on my blog.
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:39.020]   Oops, it went away.
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:40.580]   Let's do it again.
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.060]   And look at this.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:46.500]   Now, this is just-- if you put a plus one button on your blog,
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.340]   before you just click it, it would give you a plus one.
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:52.060]   But now what it does is share on Google+.
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:53.780]   So this is a new feature as well,
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:57.140]   where everybody who has a plus one button on their blogs
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:07:00.660]   or web pages automatically has this built in share
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:01.580]   on Google+ feature.
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:05.860]   All people have to do is hover over the plus button.
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:06.460]   And they'll get--
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:10.660]   And that, mind-hearer, is about to be illegal
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.180]   in Schleswig-Hole-Shine.
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:13.940]   What?
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:14.340]   Why?
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:17.380]   The head of data protection in Schleswig-Hole-Shine.
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:19.380]   Oh, only if you're a government web page.
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:20.740]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:24.740]   Any page will get-- could be fined up to $50,000.
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:27.460]   But do you think they could find me from here, from there?
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.820]   No, no, if you're in-- if you're a site in--
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:30.580]   because that's the thing.
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:31.740]   That's the reason he didn't go--
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:34.420]   T-Dole Viker is the head of data protection there.
[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:37.140]   He couldn't go out to Facebook because he has no jurisdiction.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:39.900]   So instead, he's going after sites in the state
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:44.300]   that use the like button or things like that.
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.740]   I guess their point is-- and this is something probably people
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:49.500]   don't know-- is that when you put a like or plus button
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:52.500]   on your page, you are sending information to Google.
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:55.260]   Whether people click it or not, it gives Google a window
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:56.620]   on your page.
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.340]   But no different from an ad call.
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:58.820]   And my call--
[01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:00.260]   Exactly the same as an ad call.
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:00.620]   You're right.
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:02.980]   I said this is the way the web works.
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:04.420]   But that's a good point.
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:04.780]   Right.
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:07.660]   And so this guy's at Randstander.
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:11.820]   He and I went after each other in Berlin, which sounds strange.
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:12.820]   And--
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.460]   It really does.
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:16.540]   We're wearing black leather.
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:19.780]   We're wearing black leather.
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:24.060]   And so Facebook says that they're
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:25.740]   fine with his equivalent in Hamburg.
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:26.820]   But he goes after them.
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:28.100]   You ever call it Facebook.
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:30.020]   And he says that--
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:32.980]   yeah, if you click on the like button,
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:34.220]   you're telling the world you like it.
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:35.780]   Right.
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:39.700]   If you are signed in, but don't click, well, the servers
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:42.140]   can tell you, hey, your friends like this page.
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:44.220]   And they're using that to customize.
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.220]   And that's OK.
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:48.700]   And if you're not signed in, it sends your IP address
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:50.300]   for a brief period.
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.700]   But so does everything on the page.
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:53.460]   That's true.
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:54.820]   Yeah, I mean, what about Google Analytics?
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.580]   I mean, they're basically saying that any--
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:58.340]   That would be like a Google ad.
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:00.540]   --that sense would be illegal.
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:01.540]   Yeah, that sense, right.
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:06.620]   I mean, that's like saying that a web page can only
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:09.100]   request documents from one server.
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:09.940]   Yeah, isn't that weird?
[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:12.380]   It just so ignorant about how it works.
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:16.540]   And so I got to do a big tussle on Google+ about this.
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:19.020]   At the same time, I went into search Google News
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:21.860]   for a specific host on Facebook, and up popped a story out
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:24.940]   of nowhere that a 42-year-old politician had just
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:30.100]   resigned in disgrace because he had had an affair via Facebook
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:31.460]   with a 16-year-old girl.
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:32.900]   Oh, boy.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:34.460]   And so I went on that.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:36.500]   And my comment is, what berserk on me,
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:38.140]   that there was no comparison.
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.820]   It's the age you can send a 16.
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:40.820]   This is completely wrong.
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:42.460]   And why are you putting these two together?
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.060]   And you should put them together.
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:47.660]   I think that we have government officials who
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:49.940]   are sending the Facebook as a threat when it's not.
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:53.620]   It's the real men politicians who are.
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.540]   Yeah.
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:56.540]   We know that.
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.540]   Yeah.
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:03.020]   Um, in brief, a couple of other stories, Fox and CBS,
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:04.900]   both announced that we talked about this, I think,
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.300]   last week, that they were going to give you
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:10.860]   an eight-day delay before you could watch TV shows,
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:13.020]   like Glee on Hulu.
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:16.300]   You'd have to wait eight days after the original airing.
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.780]   From BitTorrent comes word.
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:21.260]   The law of an intended consequence.
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:22.980]   There's a major piracy surge.
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:24.820]   And this is exactly what we were talking about on Twitter
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:25.660]   on Sunday.
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:27.660]   What's the competition for Hulu?
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:31.060]   What's the competition for CBS's website?
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.980]   It's BitTorrent.
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:34.540]   It's Pirate Bay.
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:37.980]   And so you do this, of course.
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:40.260]   You're going to have more piracy.
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:43.220]   During the first five days of this policy,
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:45.420]   the number of downloads from the US for the latest episode
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:51.140]   of, for instance, "Hell's Kitchen" increased 114% for master's
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.940]   chef, 189%.
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:56.500]   Apparently, people who like cooking shows love to pirate them.
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:00.700]   I love those shows, but I don't pirate them.
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:01.740]   But it's not a surprise.
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:03.820]   But I guess you're right.
[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:06.820]   It was obvious that that was going to be the case.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:09.940]   Speaking of obvious, I've signed up for the Lyft project.
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:13.340]   I have no idea what it does.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:17.460]   This is the latest from Tony Stubblevine, who--
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.060]   It sounds like a cult.
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:20.100]   I'm excited about this.
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:20.940]   Did you sign up?
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:21.700]   I did.
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:22.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:23.340]   I mean, I'm excited about this.
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:25.300]   It's from the life hacker perspective of--
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:29.380]   I've been writing about goal setting web apps for into-do
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:30.860]   apps for years.
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:34.340]   And it sounds like this is going to be Twitter crossed
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:35.260]   with the goal setting app.
[01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:36.900]   So you set a goal.
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:39.300]   You say, I want to run a mile or I want to run a marathon.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:43.220]   And then it sounds like short messages or tweets that say,
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:45.460]   when you reach that goal or when you reach a milestone
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.700]   toward that goal and sharing it with other people.
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:48.700]   I love that.
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:49.540]   Yeah, I love that, too.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.860]   I mean, I love apps that are very different.
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:53.340]   I'll just fail every day.
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:55.380]   You'll get messages like, you suck, Jeff.
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:55.980]   You suck.
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:56.500]   You suck.
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:57.620]   You suck.
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:00.140]   It's positive reinforcement versus getting--
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:00.660]   Positive.
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.060]   --criticized.
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:04.660]   By the way, speaking of positive and negative reinforcement,
[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:08.380]   I made the bad decision to read all of Twigs one-star reviews
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:11.660]   in iTunes, which are out-numbered by the more star reviews.
[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:13.580]   But they were sad to read.
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.260]   So I'm going to ask-- but they were also pretty old.
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:16.380]   There weren't any new ones.
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:19.300]   So I'm going to ask our listeners to please go to iTunes
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:22.740]   and tell us what you really think and be nice.
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:23.300]   With that winning squad.
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:25.140]   But if you have criticism, let us know.
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.260]   Yeah, tell us the truth.
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:29.540]   Tell us the truth, but constructive criticism.
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:31.020]   Yeah.
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.580]   I never read those.
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:33.820]   But I will now, if you put them--
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:35.780]   Well, they'd you do that, Gina.
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:36.380]   You know, I don't know.
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:38.300]   She thought they'd be good.
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:39.460]   Many of them were really good.
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:40.900]   And thank you to everyone who did leave.
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:43.700]   And I actually-- I'm fine with negative reviews
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:45.700]   if I learn something and we can get better
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:47.180]   and we totally want to get better.
[01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:48.940]   Where they just kind of dumb.
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:49.620]   Yeah, I know.
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:51.340]   I know they told me to shut up.
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:53.900]   Well, they said that a few of them
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:57.740]   said that we were too pro-Google, which we are.
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:58.060]   Google fans.
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:59.660]   We're somewhat pro-Google.
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:00.420]   Yeah, I do.
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.860]   And that we wander off track sometimes.
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:05.300]   Obviously, new to the Twit Network when they say that.
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:07.740]   Right.
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:08.900]   Some of our--
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:10.620]   The shows never begin on time.
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.660]   Leo never stays on track.
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:14.340]   So this is why you never read these reviews?
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:15.420]   I know what they say.
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:16.060]   And they're right.
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:17.700]   I don't deny it.
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:19.580]   But that's why there are hundreds of thousands
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:21.540]   of podcasts for you to choose from.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:24.100]   Apparently, I was popping my P's back in 2009.
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:25.180]   I apologize for that.
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:25.660]   We fixed that.
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:27.060]   Or shame on you.
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:28.380]   We fixed that.
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:30.020]   Anyway, let's get back to the internet.
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:31.900]   It does impact us, though, because when people
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.340]   go to subscribe to the podcast, if there's negative--
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.580]   there's only two stars, or there's negative reviews,
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:40.020]   they're surfaced, people don't subscribe to the podcast.
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.980]   They may never hear our wonderful show.
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:45.620]   So put some good stuff in there, too.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:48.020]   So lift.do if you want to sign up.
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:48.700]   I did.
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:51.460]   But you didn't get in, did you?
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:51.980]   No.
[01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:52.500]   No, I didn't.
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:55.220]   I just-- the read write had some extra more details,
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:56.900]   even on the list site.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.380]   They do some good journalism over there.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:13:59.980]   So it sounds like Twitter for goals.
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:02.300]   I'm excited about it, because it appeals to life hacker
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.980]   productivity bent.
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.660]   So I'm excited to see that.
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:11.180]   Always glad to see new web apps, new web sites,
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.580]   and Twitter's behind this one.
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:14.660]   But Tony Sublefine is from--
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:16.300]   open-- well, geo, right?
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:17.660]   Not open geo.
[01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:18.740]   Simple geo.
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:20.540]   I think.
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:22.780]   I think that's where it came from.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:24.540]   I see that Gina, I have stolen.
[01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:25.780]   I apologize.
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:27.500]   You're at the week.
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:28.340]   I have a backup.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.100]   We're a tip of the week.
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:29.620]   Thank you.
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:30.380]   I'm so sorry.
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:31.900]   I didn't pay close attention when
[01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:33.340]   I was looking at links in here.
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:34.500]   It's a crowd vine, actually.
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:35.660]   Tony's from Crowdvine.
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:36.780]   Crowdvine.
[01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:38.300]   OK.
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:39.940]   But let us get our tip, our number,
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:42.440]   and our tool of the week, starting with Ms. Gina
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:47.340]   Trapani and her backup, rock and roll tip of the week.
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:48.900]   Google Docs is getting a little bit of an upgrade.
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:51.420]   You can upload whole folders to Google Docs.
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.260]   I mean, Google really wants you to put everything
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:53.820]   into the cloud.
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:55.820]   But if you have a folder with some folders,
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:57.860]   and you go into Google Docs, you hit the upload button,
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:00.340]   and it will upload all the files and those folders.
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:03.620]   The Google Docs Android app also got an update.
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:04.780]   So if you have the latest update,
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:06.660]   you can take a picture with your phone,
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:08.860]   and you can save it to your web clipboard, which
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:10.420]   means then you can go to your desktop,
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:13.220]   and it's available to paste or insert into a doc.
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:15.900]   So lots of cool Docs features there.
[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:17.900]   You can also say-- you can also use the share.
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:19.940]   If you're looking at a file on your Android device,
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:23.860]   you can use the share menu to send it to a Google Doc.
[01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:27.060]   So lots of more and more ways to get stuff into Google Docs
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:28.940]   these days, including tire folders.
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:32.380]   And I'm starting to use almost all of my disk space.
[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:33.380]   Don't tell us--
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:34.380]   I bought more.
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:36.020]   I bought like much a lot more.
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:36.540]   Did you?
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:37.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.500]   I mean, once you start keeping stuff there,
[01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.140]   it's like, well, it's just there, wherever I am.
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:44.660]   Don't tell Paul, because he's been using Microsoft's
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:49.460]   SkyDrive for the show notes for Windows Weekly.
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:50.460]   SkyDrive is good, too.
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:51.460]   No, it's not.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:53.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:55.140]   No, it's not.
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:57.060]   It's so funny, because I mean, I look at Google Docs
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:58.860]   and all the features, all these new features,
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:15:59.860]   are constantly being added.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:02.180]   It's very capable, very usable.
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:04.820]   And then SkyDrive, it's like, well, can I-- oh, I can't.
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:06.340]   Can I-- no, I can't.
[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:09.740]   I'm like, I don't know why you'd use that.
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:11.340]   I still love that you can take a picture
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:14.660]   with your phone of a whiteboard and create a Google Doc.
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:15.260]   Have it scanned?
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:16.100]   Awesome.
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:16.540]   Easy.
[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:18.740]   It's like-- it is the future.
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.020]   So yeah, Google Docs is awesome.
[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:21.300]   I've used SkyDrive.
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:22.100]   It's pretty good.
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:24.100]   As much as Google Docs.
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:24.660]   But--
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:26.460]   Yeah, so you don't want to get that review.
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.860]   She's such a Google fan girl.
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:28.820]   I'm such a shill.
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:30.460]   I'm such a shill.
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:32.660]   Oh, she's just the nicest twigger, that's all.
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:35.460]   The nicest twigger there ever was.
[01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:36.540]   She did a trip Annie.
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:39.100]   And your number of the week, my friend.
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:40.060]   Oh, don't--
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:40.860]   Oh, hold on.
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:41.500]   Hold on.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:44.260]   Wait till the door opens, OK?
[01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:46.140]   Oh, I should have said a couple of--
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:48.860]   I just got the hard copies today.
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:49.700]   It's here.
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.380]   Congratulations.
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:52.420]   Very happy.
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:53.420]   The new phone book is here.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:54.300]   The new phone book is--
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:54.740]   I don't know.
[01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:57.060]   The book book is-- the book book is here.
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:00.580]   Number one trillion, which is Facebook's page views
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:03.740]   per month in the last two months, which is pretty amazing.
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:04.140]   Wait a minute.
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:05.900]   Facebook's page views in the last--
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:06.900]   How many months?
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:07.900]   Trillion per month.
[01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:09.980]   A trillion page views per month.
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.260]   Trillion page views per month.
[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.020]   That's crazy.
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:13.340]   That's bananas.
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:14.260]   Wow.
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:14.780]   Wow.
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:16.780]   They are easily the biggest photo sharing.
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:18.740]   I think I just saw a stat that they're like number two
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:19.900]   in video after YouTube.
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:21.820]   I mean, they're just dominant.
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:23.780]   And it scares me-- you know, it's funny.
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:26.580]   Again, we talk about this, but it scares me so much more
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:28.660]   that Facebook's dominance than Google's dominance.
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:30.780]   I mean, the Google numbers are through the roof too.
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:31.300]   But--
[01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:31.980]   Yeah.
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:32.980]   Well, you know, it was funny when
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:35.980]   I wrote about the new Facebook stuff on Google+--
[01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:38.580]   you know, a little irony.
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.460]   The comments I got were Facebook haters
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:43.460]   who were on Google+ because they didn't like Facebook.
[01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:44.300]   Right.
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:48.500]   You know, the irony of what was the name of that anti-Facebook
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:49.460]   that was started?
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:50.780]   Diaspora.
[01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:53.340]   Diaspora, the irony is that I asked for this little startup
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:54.340]   because I went nowhere.
[01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:56.780]   And Google started the Facebook--
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:57.300]   Killer.
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:57.940]   --competitors.
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:58.500]   Right.
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:17:59.460]   Right.
[01:17:59.460 --> 01:17:59.940]   Right.
[01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:01.780]   Well, they need the signals even more.
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:02.540]   So there you go.
[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:04.940]   I mean, there is a market value to them
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:06.380]   that doesn't exist to others.
[01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:07.660]   Exactly.
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:09.340]   I'm going to show you something that actually
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:10.460]   is a Google competitor.
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:13.940]   And Paul Therat, to give him credit, showed me this earlier.
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.620]   And it's something I've used for a while.
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:18.620]   I just forgot about it because I do have some Nokia phones
[01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:19.940]   lying around.
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:21.980]   Now, Avi-- O-V-I is--
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:25.060]   thank you, Nokia.
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:27.540]   Is Nokia's brand, the worst brand in the world
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:29.940]   for their market place and so forth?
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:31.020]   And they have Avi Maps.
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:34.140]   If you go to maps.nokia.com and you install the 3D plug-in,
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:36.060]   I've installed the Chrome plug-in.
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:38.180]   Now, you know, this looks a little bit like Google Earth,
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:38.380]   right?
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:39.140]   Let's pick a city.
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:40.580]   Let's pick my favorite city.
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:43.900]   San Francisco, we're going to go to the Golden Gate Bridge.
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:47.220]   This is mind-blowing what they've done here.
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:48.060]   So we're going to zoom in.
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:49.860]   Again, very much like Google Earth,
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:54.260]   except that the 3D renderings are photo-realistic.
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:56.940]   I think they're actually photos.
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:58.140]   And you can zoom in.
[01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:00.100]   You can move around.
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:01.860]   You lived in San Francisco for a while.
[01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:05.860]   Jeff, I think you'll validate that as we move--
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:07.340]   of course, it has to download.
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:10.220]   They do a good job, by the way, of downloading
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:12.540]   kind of primitive polygons and then refining them
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:12.900]   as the download.
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:14.940]   Can you put an address in and see the building?
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:16.140]   Yeah, you can.
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.500]   360 Locust.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:18.900]   Is this your old building?
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:20.140]   I was my old building.
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:21.740]   I can walk to wealth.
[01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:22.700]   Let's see how you do it.
[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:24.540]   I don't know the--
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:25.900]   let's see.
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:27.620]   This is a bird's eye view.
[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:29.300]   So as it comes in, this is the Presidio.
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:30.300]   Presidio, yeah.
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:31.260]   That's amazing.
[01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:32.100]   Look how good this is.
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:35.020]   Or you see it building the elements.
[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:36.180]   Yes.
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:37.180]   Yeah.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:39.860]   And then those little blue circles are all the--
[01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:42.940]   so let me see if I can enter in--
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:46.180]   it says, which wonder would you like to see today?
[01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:51.260]   So they may not have got all the renderings for all of the stuff.
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:53.180]   Photos buys--
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:53.660]   I don't know.
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:54.820]   Oh, that's just that photo.
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:55.100]   Ever.
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:56.260]   Stock home--
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:56.620]   I don't know.
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:58.100]   Let me see if I can get-- if I can--
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:01.300]   I'm pretty sure I can enter in a--
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:04.700]   maybe if I go to the 2D view and enter in.
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:05.940]   What was it again?
[01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:07.660]   360 Locust, I think.
[01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:08.100]   Is my memory--
[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.500]   So where are you still live?
[01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.540]   I think so.
[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.180]   What I'll do is I'll go there, and then we'll see if we can
[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:15.700]   go to the 3D version of that.
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:16.220]   OK.
[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:17.940]   Or poor Nokia.
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:18.300]   I know.
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:19.540]   They've got this is great.
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:22.860]   And it doesn't matter.
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:23.580]   It doesn't matter.
[01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:26.380]   Now, if I go to the 3D, will we see a 3D of 360 Locust?
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:29.140]   Let's see.
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:30.100]   No, I guess not.
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:31.780]   It's just a demo.
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:32.860]   But it's a hell of a demo.
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:34.060]   It's a cool demo.
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:35.740]   Where do you want to go to Las Vegas?
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:36.100]   Sure.
[01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:38.540]   Let's go to Las Vegas.
[01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:41.540]   maps.nokia.com.
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:45.340]   It's basically like Google Earth, except wow.
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:46.340]   There's the stratosphere.
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:48.860]   There's Las Vegas Convention Center.
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:50.340]   And you can change the angle.
[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:54.900]   You can go up, go down.
[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:55.620]   Yeah, that's beautiful.
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:56.620]   Move in.
[01:20:56.620 --> 01:20:57.620]   Yeah.
[01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:57.620]   Yeah.
[01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.180]   Pretty cool.
[01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:03.020]   Well, that's just for fun, because it's in Germany illegal.
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:07.460]   So if you're living in Branschreig, high skyphen,
[01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:08.660]   don't watch that.
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:10.740]   It's a bad thing.
[01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:15.980]   I want to let the Twitter user Todolio down here,
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:18.820]   because he started the drinking game for the Habermas
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:20.420]   3.
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:21.180]   We haven't said--
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:23.340]   Oh, it's not fun.
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:28.460]   No Habermas is no Chipotle's 1Glee.
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:29.100]   That's the score.
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.260]   We should say that at the end of every show.
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:32.060]   We didn't do it.
[01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:33.860]   I mentioned Glee briefly.
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:34.620]   Oh, OK.
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:35.140]   Well, yeah.
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.420]   But I talked about the Fox 8 Day story.
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:37.920]   All right.
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:38.420]   Right.
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:38.620]   Briefly.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:41.260]   We didn't get into-- we didn't sing.
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:42.700]   We didn't talk about plot points.
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:45.660]   So I think it's kind of a minor.
[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:47.140]   We didn't sing.
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:48.540]   We didn't sing.
[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:49.500]   Look at the Bellagio.
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.260]   Look at this.
[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:50.860]   Look at the fans.
[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:51.900]   That's our ice review.
[01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:53.660]   At least they didn't sing.
[01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.540]   At least they put that in iTunes.
[01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:56.020]   Yeah.
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:58.500]   God, they didn't sing.
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:21:59.180]   That's perfect.
[01:21:59.180 --> 01:21:59.860]   Look at Bellagio.
[01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:00.860]   That's amazing.
[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:04.060]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:05.620]   Can you go see the pool?
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:06.220]   Yeah.
[01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:06.900]   You want to go back?
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:07.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:09.140]   I know what you want to see.
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:10.660]   You silly--
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.420]   Where's that hotel that does?
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:14.980]   It makes the death ray.
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:15.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:16.500]   The Luxor.
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:16.980]   It reflects the sun.
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:17.980]   It's just down the street here.
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:18.500]   Oh, no.
[01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.180]   Not the Luxor.
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:20.620]   It reflects the sun.
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:20.780]   Yeah.
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:22.340]   It reflects the sun down onto the pool.
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:23.620]   It'll start burning.
[01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:24.860]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:25.220]   Yeah.
[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:25.700]   Right.
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:26.500]   That's so fun.
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:29.500]   What hotel is that?
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:30.140]   Wow.
[01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:31.980]   We should just go see the pool anyway.
[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.060]   The chat room.
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:35.340]   I've never been to the pool at the Bellagio.
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:37.740]   Is it worthwhile to visit?
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:38.140]   There it is.
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:39.940]   I think, Leo, you've got it next time you go there
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:41.300]   for one of these photographer shows.
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:43.420]   You should do it not on the conference room floor.
[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:45.020]   From the Bellagio pool site?
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:46.740]   Pool site at the Bellagio.
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:47.660]   Yeah.
[01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:49.060]   See, I don't know what it is, but there's
[01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:52.780]   no people in these anywhere.
[01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:54.100]   Well, because it is rendered, I guess.
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:55.100]   Yeah.
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:56.860]   I was telling you about that there was this technology
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:59.540]   somebody did to solve the problem of blurring
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:01.180]   on street view.
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:02.100]   Yeah.
[01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:05.740]   And so I think it was University of Pittsburgh or something.
[01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:06.060]   And they did.
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:08.220]   It was very cool, but it would make mistakes once in a while.
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:10.420]   And you'd see a dog with a leash with no owner.
[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:11.380]   I think we saw that.
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:14.060]   I think we looked at some of those, yeah.
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:16.180]   All right, my friends, we are out of time.
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.340]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:19.820]   at the City University of New York.

[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:23.500]   And he's the author of--
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:26.500]   Yes, he has it now, the hardcover edition.
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:29.420]   Public parts.
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:30.260]   But it's not out.
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:31.820]   We can't buy it yet for another month.
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:33.420]   '27.
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:35.140]   So it's a little more than a month off.
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:35.980]   But how do you like it?
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:37.260]   How does it feel to have the old end music?
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:37.700]   It feels good.
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:38.540]   It feels good.
[01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:41.340]   Just fear the mistakes in it.
[01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:42.140]   It's permanent.
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:43.580]   You're in public.
[01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:44.500]   Welcome.

[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:49.220]   I know the spelling.
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:50.660]   I can't change it.
[01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:51.980]   I can't use straight terms.
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:53.460]   The edit button on this thing.
[01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:53.980]   Yeah.

[01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:06.540]   Check it out.
[01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:07.300]   Very exciting.

[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:10.140]   Plus.
