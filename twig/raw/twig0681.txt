[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.400]   Well, not just the Google verse, the Twitter verse, the Facebook verse, but as it turns
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.600]   out the word press verse.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.000]   Let me introduce our panel and then we'll introduce our very special guest, Aunt Pruehter.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.400]   Is here from Hands On Photography.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.400]   Hi Aunt.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.400]   Hello sir.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.400]   Hi.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.400]   You're in the Stacy seat today.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.400]   We'll put you over in Stacy's seat.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.120]   She's got the day off.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.720]   Jeff Jarvis is also here.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.560]   Should we do the whole rigamarole?
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.880]   Oh, does that have been morning Leo?
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.880]   Oh, wow.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.400]   You look like a Sith Lord.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.400]   What's the matter?
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.160]   That's the chromebook pixel.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.840]   Okay, we'll get to that.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.040]   Yeah, that's just a rumor at this point.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.600]   No, I think it's gone.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.160]   Jeff is the Leonard Taill Professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.920]   of Journalism at the City University of
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920]   Craig Newmark.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.920]   A little late.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.040]   A little late, but that's okay.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.040]   I have New York.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.040]   Now Jeff.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.040]   Now the important part.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.560]   You, I want you to introduce our very special guest.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.720]   Matt Mullenweg is here.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.520]   Matt Mullenweg is, you all know, the founder of automatic co-founder of WordPress.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.560]   Genius at social media, Savior of various services including Tumblr and others.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.760]   And what we'll talk about soon is Matt's vision and model for how he built the way I think
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.720]   the internet should be built.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.920]   But first, back to you Leo.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.720]   Hey Matt, it's really nice to have you on.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.880]   I use WordPress in the very earliest days.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.760]   Big fan.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.840]   I think we've talked before on some of our shows, but it's really nice to welcome you
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.160]   back especially because you're such a big shot now.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.280]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.920]   You're very welcome.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:19.440]   WordPress.com, WooCommerce, Pocketcast recently saved from the jaws of public radio.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.040]   Simple note, which has always been great.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.680]   These are all automatic holdings.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.560]   Tumblr, which you save from the deep evil dark lords at Yahoo.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.920]   Jetpack, which of course has been a long time of wonderful plugin for WordPress users
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.520]   as is a Kismet, the anti-spam filter.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.840]   I don't know happy tools, but this is not a list.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.240]   Newspack, great.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.520]   Day one, another recent acquisition of wonderful journaling program I've used for years on
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.200]   iOS.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.400]   Long reads.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.080]   I didn't know you owned that.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.080]   And Gravatar.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.640]   Wow.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.960]   You're building a publish.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.000]   I guess publishing would be the common thing here.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Yes?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.200]   We really love internet infrastructure.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.400]   So things that make other things go.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.280]   One nice thing about automatic, we're about 2,000 people now, which is more bigger than
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.920]   I would have ever imagined.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.240]   But 93 countries, I think, we've always been totally distributed from the beginning because
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.600]   we came out of an open source project.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.760]   And so you look at a room of automaticians.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.280]   You couldn't see more different hairstyles, stress, everything.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.840]   Everyone's very different.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.120]   We're really united with this idea of craft and of building the web for the long term.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:49.840]   So very, very different people who have come together to try to, as Stuart Brann would
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.440]   say, be good ancestors on the web.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.840]   I guess we are all ancestors.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.800]   I never thought of that.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.800]   Stuart Wood.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.800]   Stuart.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   Stuart Wood.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.200]   When did you start WordPress?
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   2003.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.200]   Wow.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   How is 19?
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   So you were 19.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.440]   It's the 20th anniversary next year.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.440]   And Mike, we should give Mike a little credit as well for starting it with you.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.080]   I'm coming in on my blog and we just started working together and that turned into this
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.080]   thing.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.680]   Truly an amazing success.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.720]   What percentage of the internet now runs on WordPress?
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.400]   I think about 42, although I will give the caveat now that that number is about to change
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.440]   because speaking of things shutting down, like the big book, that number was based on
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.440]   Alexa data.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.440]   Oh, good Lord.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.440]   [laughter]
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:51.200]   W3TEX would use the top 10 million websites from Alexa and that was the index.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.280]   A plugin, right?
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.280]   A plugin.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.600]   The people would run on their browser, a search plugin, they'd run on their browser.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.160]   And that way you could see all the sites they went to.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.920]   It's still around, isn't it?
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.920]   Are you still?
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.320]   It was on, it's finally shutting it down.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.240]   And the data will be gone.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.320]   So Alexa's now just a voice assistant, no longer a web ranking kind of thing.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.080]   Before there was Alexa, there was Alexa.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:22.280]   Yeah, I installed WordPress in MySQL on my blog hosting platform.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.020]   Probably around 2005.
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.560]   We used to teach all of our journalism students to install instances of WordPress.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.960]   We don't really need to now, but it was in the time it was a core skill.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.880]   And WordPress.com then kind of took over as a managed hosting and I would bet at least
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.760]   half of WordPress sites are on WordPress.com now, yes?
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.360]   Actually under 1% are.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.360]   What?
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.680]   So it's still a big open source project, wow.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.180]   Yeah, maybe a couple percent, but like, yeah, it's the vast majority of WordPress
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.320]   in the world are run on different web hosts around the world.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:02.360]   You know, Bluehost, WP Engine, Cloud Services, DigitalOcean, like thing.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.360]   You can run WordPress.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.320]   You can run it on a Raspberry Pi.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.680]   You can run it pretty much anywhere.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.960]   And so pretty resilient.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.960]   That's really cool.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.960]   Well.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.240]   We actually have a fun new proposal that I'm very excited about.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.240]   What's that?
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.120]   That came out of, we just had a work camp United States last weekend in San Diego.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:26.380]   And you know, I've been studying and admiring projects that are building for the long term.
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:32.780]   And one that I mentioned on stage was SQLite, SQLite, which is this flat file database.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.580]   That's super fast.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.020]   And they're designing it to be portable and thinking about it in terms of decades, like
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.300]   how would this data be accessible?
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.380]   And as a pretty cool proposal, someone put up to actually have WordPress be able to run
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.380]   on SQLite.
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.380]   Oh, wow.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.900]   So that would be, I might get some core support for that.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.280]   I think that would be pretty neat for longevity.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.800]   Word Camp Pittsburgh is where we met I Justine for the first time.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.800]   Oh, really?
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.560]   Yeah, we're so impressed by our energy.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.160]   This was, gosh, early 2000s.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.880]   I don't remember when this was long time ago.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.520]   And it was a fun work camp in San Diego because it was, we had a capped attendance at like
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.400]   650 because of the venue.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.200]   And so it felt like one of the old one.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   Old fashioned.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.200]   That's nice.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   So cool.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.600]   So, so cool, Jeff has said this a couple of weeks ago, if this was the impetus to get
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.480]   you on, is that you did it right.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.120]   Jeff, what did you mean by that?
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.960]   So, so Matt, here's the premise that I gave it.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:33.800]   I recalled when the partners at, or a few of them at Polaris called me many years ago,
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.400]   when I was in the car driving and they said, this guy Matt, we like and we like this WordPress
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.200]   thing, but he has a really weird model where it's going to be open source.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.520]   And then a company on top of that, we're just not sure we should invest in that.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.080]   And I'm proud that I said, God, yes, grab it.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.880]   And in the years since at that time, the wisdom that I saw was in comparison to movable
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.880]   type, which because it saw a conflict of interest in what it was doing, that others
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:09.880]   who ran movable type instances as businesses, movable type didn't want it six part didn't
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.440]   want them to compete too much.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.120]   So they, they throttled it.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.640]   You on the other hand had a completely different model, not to tell you what you will explain
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.560]   better than I can, but by having the, the open source base and then building WordPress
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:27.680]   dot com is the commercial end on top of that, you enabled this huge growth.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:33.240]   You enabled the contributions to that open source base.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:43.080]   And you in essence, almost created a, a, a foundation for creation on the net.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.280]   And so here's, here's what I argued is that if we look at let's say Twitter and since
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:52.080]   we had that show, Jack Dorsey has said most recently that he, his mistake was making,
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.480]   their mistake was making Twitter a company and that he wants, wishes the Twitter were
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.120]   a protocol.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.680]   And I'm very excited about what I see maybe coming with blue sky, which we talked about
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.960]   a lot, which strikes me as similar that you, you end up with a, a distributed open source
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.080]   space of speech in that case.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.240]   And then people can build enterprises on top of that.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.320]   You can others as you, as you demonstrated, others can too.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.240]   And many can succeed.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:26.040]   And the internet is not then in the control of a few corporations for good and bad in
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.080]   terms of outsiders trying to get them to control the internet in turn, governments and so
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.080]   on.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:37.040]   So it really struck me that you had long ago the model and I, maybe it was just the model
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.280]   of the internet, but you had a model for how to build out the infrastructure of the net.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:49.680]   And so I'm really eager to hear your reaction to what's happened since and what should come
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.600]   next if you're, if you're building the next Twitter, if you're building the next something,
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.080]   how do they follow your example?
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:02.400]   And as, as a big topic.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:10.480]   And we mentioned Stuart Brander earlier, another guy I look up to a lot is Kevin Kelly, and
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.040]   has a book called What Technology Wants.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.160]   And I'm a big believer in kind of this idea of adjacent possibilities.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.800]   So that, you know, the world wants something to exist.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:28.960]   The progress of technological, humanity culture, the culture, if I didn't, me and Mike didn't
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.920]   make WordPress, I feel like someone else would have made something like it with a different
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:38.360]   name, because the world needed an open source operating system for this, you know, website
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.200]   layer.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.640]   And I see that happening other places now.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.280]   So one of the projects I'm actually most excited about recently is Stable Diffusion.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.640]   I know familiar with this.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.400]   Oh, are we excited about that?
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.840]   Yeah, this is the AI.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.600]   And by the way, open source, so you can run it on your own software art generator.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.600]   Really fantastic.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.800]   We've been playing with the whole stuff being on.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.240]   So this idea that, you know, the work open AI is doing is I think something most interesting
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.640]   in the world.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.800]   And gosh, I would not have predicted that you can type things in and get like just such
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.920]   incredible art photographs, everything back from a dolly.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.960]   I think it's how you pronounce it.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.400]   And then, but the world kind of wants an open source version of that too.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:31.640]   And just out of that field, the, this stability AI company came and released able diffusion.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.600]   And now the package, you can run it on your Mac and like, you know, generate images in
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.360]   20, 30 seconds.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.280]   It's pretty, pretty special to look at what's generated.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.400]   You know, in terms of the news, I saw that a generated image actually won an art.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.400]   Yes.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.400]   In Colorado.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:57.920]   Ben Thompson, his detector, he started using, I think he's using mid journey to do some
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.120]   of the illustration.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.440]   We talked in our editorial conference yesterday, you'll be interested to know that about using
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.240]   stable diffusion for our thumbnails for the podcast.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.880]   And I've already said, you know, we got to get a cert, we got to set up a server in here
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:16.760]   so we could be running it so you can start with the, the photographic, you know, thumbnail
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.400]   that you're we're going to use and run it through stable diffusion and get some interesting
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.320]   variety on that.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.320]   It's amazing though.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.880]   That's like three or four weeks ago that they released that.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:31.400]   And it's, it's a Cambrian explosion of creativity because it's open.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.400]   Right?
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.240]   I mean, that's, that's what makes it possible.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:40.040]   Well, and that's what, you know, and cool stuff happens in proprietary companies all
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.040]   the time.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.920]   I would say that the way automatic and myself have done things is definitely a lot more
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.920]   complicated.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.760]   It's a lot more work to have a foundation and open source.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.600]   And you know, you can get WordPress from, who knows, do you can get WordPress from us
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.760]   or like it's, it's all like a, it's a lot more complicated than if you just, you know,
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:05.240]   type in, say Shopify and you go to Shopify, you know, there's only one place to get it.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:11.000]   But I think that that that user were Cambrian explosion, I think that's a great analogy.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.520]   Um, the evolution it can happen when people can really dig into the engine, see how it
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:23.520]   works, modify it, customize it and have complete freedom in how they choose to run it is really
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.880]   powerful.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:31.040]   And that's what I want to see more of in the world and certainly more of on the net.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:37.760]   And so that's what myself and Mary Band of 2000 friends and colleagues are, are working
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.920]   on creating more of.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:45.600]   When you started building automatic, uh, you know, I think about how I did quit, which
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.960]   is initially was scratching in an itch, you know, uh, I was a radio broadcaster and radio
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.520]   didn't look like a much of a future.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.240]   I thought, you know, I bet we could do this less expensively on our own.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:02.040]   Uh, and then it just kind of seemed to fall in place, which I think is that feeling of
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.400]   the other, the universe is ready for this.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.520]   But I didn't have a great strategic plan.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.120]   It was more like a random walk.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.680]   Did you think at the beginning, what you wanted to do with automatic or was it more
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.320]   that random walk?
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.760]   Hmm.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.480]   If I want us in the beginning, I was just hoping that we could figure out a way for myself
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.680]   and a few buddies to get paid for doing what we were doing for fun, which was riding a
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:41.320]   code for WordPress.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.320]   Cause you loved it.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.320]   And, uh, and yeah, you know, far beyond any monetary needs, like this is fun for me.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.320]   It's what I want to do.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.320]   Right.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.320]   Uh, it's what I hope to spend the rest of my life doing.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.760]   I think it's best if it starts that way instead of, oh, I'm going to make a million
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.760]   bucks.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.760]   How can I do that?
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.760]   It was more like, how can I make enough to keep doing it?
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.720]   And jazz musicians and Houston particularly have a long history of, uh, having a day gig.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.600]   You know, maybe they teach or, uh, I saw someone the other day.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.760]   He's a, uh, you know, a researcher at a university like, yeah, they do things during the day.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.560]   And then at night to come together, make their music, practice the graph.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:20.400]   Then there's a culture of people wanting to just start something to get the big buyout
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.400]   down the road.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.400]   I don't like that.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.400]   I'm assuming that was never in my mind.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.400]   So if you'd like to buy two of them.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.400]   I thought that would happen.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:32.720]   Like that's, I think, um, you know, one of my friends was journalist, Oh, my like, and
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.320]   he was like, yeah, you know, if you do this, yeah, we'll probably buy in a few years and
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.720]   I thought, well, that'd be great.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:43.720]   But then once it got going, I was like, um, I think we could actually build something and
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.720]   Holmes kicking himself.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:51.160]   I would want to be doing exactly what we're doing.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:56.040]   So let's just, uh, let's keep rolling and see what we can create as an independent company,
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.240]   which is, yeah, what we've been doing for the past.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.240]   So automatic started in 2005, so 17 years now.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.080]   Have you followed blue sky?
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.880]   Um, and Jack's vision for that.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.640]   Do you have any, any opinions about about that as a, as a Twitter is a protocol direction
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.880]   vision for a federated kind of, uh, open Twitter.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.720]   I haven't looked into the technology of it.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:27.360]   I will say that, um, publishing is complicated.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:34.720]   Like Jeff, you know, this in journalism, like I actually have begun as of age to appreciate
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:41.680]   um, the malability of our systems, why we have a court system, why we have laws, why
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:48.080]   we elect people like this whole process that we're trying to enshrine into code with things
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.880]   like blockchain and contracts and tokens.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:57.880]   Um, when we make it too inflexible, it, it also fies the vision of how it was supposed
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.480]   to work when it started.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.320]   And I think one of the beautiful things about human systems like this, it's a pyramid of
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.240]   American democracy still ongoing is the malability.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:12.840]   Now, of course, sometimes you find the cracks in that, but also that it can evolve over time.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:19.800]   So I really appreciate the more human driven projects with a, uh, room for error.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:26.400]   Of course, you started, uh, automatic and, and created WordPress at the height of blogging
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.040]   popularity, but it's kind of gone through a winter since.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.320]   Um, and yet you've survived.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.200]   How did you do that?
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.680]   You know, I, I'm never sure what the temperature is.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.560]   People always say blogging is at the height or dying.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.720]   It felt like we were pretty late actually because there were so, there were dozens and
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.320]   dozens of blogging systems, lots of platforms.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.880]   Blogger had already been bought by Google.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.880]   Right.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.280]   Um, by the time we started, Dave Winer had been doing it for eight or nine years, you
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.680]   know, with a scripting.com.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.720]   So they'll should get him on actually.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.720]   Oh, we love Dave.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.240]   We, we, we probably listening right now.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.920]   He's, uh, he's awesome.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.120]   He was such a pioneer.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:16.080]   What, and also what I love about Dave and part of his inspiration to me was doing it in public.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.080]   Right.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:22.200]   So share your thinking, share what you're learning, share your mistakes, share the code
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.600]   you learned, share the project you came across.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.680]   Um, he has this incredible archive now going back.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:34.480]   I forget when he started it is in the nineties, I think, um, of his kind of daily thoughts
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:40.480]   and my blog, I'm not blogging as much as I, I want to, or used to, um, but it's really
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.880]   neat to be able to go into those archives and see, you know, what I come across.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.280]   It's the number one reason I think people should journal a blog.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:53.560]   Um, and I know that that's part of why we bought day one is because, um, journaling,
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:58.200]   day one is basically local and scripted blogging for journaling.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:04.440]   Um, publishing does have an additional, uh, what do you call it?
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:09.800]   At risk or something, like people are more worried to publish than ever because you can
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:15.200]   have mobs, you can be attacked if you mess up, you can get in trouble, but, um, it is
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.200]   also where the, uh, the most beauty comes from.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.320]   I think that's one way the blogging has changed.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.320]   The world has changed.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.560]   You know, a lot of blogs no longer use comments because that's a, that's a place you can get,
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.560]   uh, rolled.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:32.840]   Uh, I think the advent of Twitter, I'll speak for myself, but I think a lot of people stopped
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.760]   blogging long for me.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.760]   Ruined us for blogs.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.760]   I could get rid of a thought.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.480]   I had 40 character blogs.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.880]   You know, uh, has Twitter notes too, right?
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.880]   The long form.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.760]   You think, well, and of course, and then, and then I've went off and did medium.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:52.480]   And I mean, so there is, uh, I think long form, I like long form, but I think it also
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.920]   looks maybe, maybe we're just reading the temperature wrong, but it looks like people
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.200]   aren't willing to spend that much time reading anymore.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.480]   Uh, do you think long form is a generational kind of thing?
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.520]   Because everything is such a short attention span nowadays.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.760]   I still think long form has a place.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.240]   I mean, we still have mediums and stuff like that.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.440]   People are still subscribing to New York for some reason, but right.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.280]   But, but I wonder if that's just a generational gap now, you know?
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.720]   Part of why we, we bought long reads and run a magazine called Adivis as well, which only
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:31.600]   publishes once per month, uh, super long pieces, usually 15, 20,000 words or more.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.280]   Um, yeah.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.960]   So I mean, when the fronds first came out, people are like, no one's going to create
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   on this.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.960]   No one's going to spend time on this.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.120]   But it turns out like, especially as the screens got better, we're always connected.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.400]   There's a lot of found time.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:49.880]   And so people do read, I would say there's probably more reading happening now, um, than
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.880]   ever before.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.880]   Um, video is enticing.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.880]   Right?
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.880]   We're doing it now.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.280]   Some people are watching this right now instead of reading.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:03.400]   Um, so the, the live interaction, short form videos, TikTok, obviously very compelling.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:09.120]   Um, but there's something that sort of ignites your imagination when you read that isn't
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.280]   replicable in any other medium, at least that I've experienced.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.000]   Yeah, I have, I'm not trying to this to go plug, but I have a book coming out next year
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.520]   called the Gutenberg parenthesis.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.120]   And so we, we share an idol, um, in that, in that name.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:27.320]   And at the end of it, I say that I was wrong to think that the book as a form should be
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.320]   updated, let the book be the book.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.680]   However, as I've thought about other forms of media, I think the other forms of media
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:40.800]   are largely evanescent that magazines, uh, have their time and then many go away.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.440]   I just want to say there are thousands of magazines that we, there are a lot of books
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.760]   are ephemeral as well.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.680]   I mean, let's say, right, but as a form, I'm starting to wonder about the magazine as
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.680]   a form.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.960]   The newspaper as a form, um, it's just, it's not.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.960]   Um, economically viable anymore, uh, to put it in print.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.440]   And so you mean?
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.440]   Exactly.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.440]   Yes, exactly.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.400]   Um, so I think we, we tie ourselves too much with presumptions of old forms and I still
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.960]   love the book and I still love reading books and I have many around me.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.520]   And I think it will continue, but I think that we go to other forms.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.800]   The magazine was started, uh, you know, in the US, they started taking off in 1850 with
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.240]   steam powered presses.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.320]   Uh, the newspaper, several of the steam powered presses.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.800]   We got to that mechanization and scale.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:29.320]   So I guess it's my, it's my long preamble to a question about people probably presume
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:35.040]   that in WordPress people are making, to use old terms articles or stories or things like
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.480]   that.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:44.360]   What are the exciting uses of the tool you've created that you see to go beyond what we
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.360]   knew?
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.680]   Yeah, there's an interesting tension right now in the WordPress community because there
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.400]   is an about actually half the signups we get to WordPress.com are bloggers.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:59.480]   So people blogging, you know, as, as that is traditionally understood.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.600]   And then the other half is people building websites on it.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.400]   The White House was on WordPress for a long time.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.800]   Wait, actually, yeah, it is today.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.800]   Still is.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.800]   It's still is.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.880]   And we're actually running that infrastructure, you know, not going to work.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:19.520]   We have, they switched over to our, uh, we have a, this enterprise service called WP
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.800]   VIP, which is basically like bulletproof WordPress.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.000]   Like we can just rarely scale it anything.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.440]   And that switched right before the Ukraine more started.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.240]   So all the criminal insights went down.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.240]   Why do I stay it up?
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.240]   I was very happy.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:39.760]   Um, the, to kind of your original question though, actually I lost it.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.760]   What was the question?
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.640]   Well, just kind of what, um, I'll do it.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.520]   Well, let me, let me, let me just try.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.520]   Okay.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:53.200]   Um, the essay and the novel and the newspaper were invented a century and a half after moveable
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:58.560]   type and it was then people said, Oh, wow, what can I do with this thing?
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:04.560]   So I wonder since you, you watch the WordPress ecosystem, what you're seeing about creation
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.600]   with it that's exciting.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:12.040]   You're that you see glimmers of a future that goes beyond the analogs we know of magazines
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.480]   and newspapers and so on.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.320]   Hmm.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:22.400]   So what I'm trying to do actually funnily enough with our, our new version of the editor is
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   called Gutenberg.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.400]   Yes.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.200]   Oh, well, I know well, I use it every day.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.080]   Sharing the, the shared idol.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.880]   It was actually really neat at the word camp.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.000]   Um, I just went to some people brought me some gifts from the Gutenberg museum, which
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.400]   was really, I never was there.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.400]   So I definitely.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.400]   You should go.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.400]   You must go.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.400]   You must go.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.400]   Um, what I'm trying to do is right now social networks in particular are forced to do.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:51.360]   Forcing people into, um, very generic forms, you know, you can't have really expressive
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:56.520]   layouts or be weird, you know, they kind of make all the profiles look the same.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.520]   It's very much like, um, I don't know, it feels like a Soviet housing block.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.880]   Sometimes people do interesting stuff inside the box, but I want to make it a lot easier
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:13.760]   for people to do outside the box layout design content creation.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.480]   Um, and build both sides of it.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:20.480]   So with Gutenberg, we have the, the editor that allows you to create like really rich
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.240]   widgets and bed maps layouts.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.080]   Um, you know, but things left and right.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:31.040]   And actually I just talked to, uh, DM'd with Dave Weiner about this other day is I wanted
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.960]   to reader as well that supports, um, these rich formats so that you can have, you can
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:41.160]   follow things and actually be like, as the creator intended.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.960]   The creator not being the man upstairs, but the person who created the blog.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:53.600]   But you also own Tumblr, which is interesting because Tumblr was created almost as, uh,
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:59.840]   an anti word press where it's, uh, it's more like the original blogs, Tumba logs, you know,
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.200]   and, uh, uh, I don't know.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.440]   I can't remember did David carp create Tumblr before WordPress or did you, did you create
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.840]   it after WordPress or WordPress after?
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.040]   It started a little later, maybe 2007, 2008.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.720]   Um, um, Tumblr was our very best competitor.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.720]   Cause it was so easy to create.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.720]   It was different too.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.720]   And it was very quick.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.680]   It is, you can still is, which is interesting.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.120]   I'm really glad you acquired it.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.360]   Cause I think it was in not in good hands.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.280]   And I really think it's an important platform for somebody who doesn't want to spend.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.080]   I almost don't want to tell people about it.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.840]   Like we're having so much fun on dollar right now.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.480]   It's actually quite, quite fun to you.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.360]   It's my favorite social network by far.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.000]   And I really liked Twitter.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.360]   Uh, it's, um, it's a very generative space.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.960]   You know, it's all about art and artists.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.960]   Right.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.720]   Um, and so you can just go there and kind of put on different identities.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.800]   It's almost like the burning man of social networks.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.680]   You can really kind of be free, uh, when you're on Tumblr.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.680]   Right.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.640]   Matt, what do you think about the state of the net?
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:06.880]   Um, we just had legislation stopped, uh, for now in the Senate.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.880]   Um, protection is for newspapers.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.840]   Uh, we see the California regulations that are going to be very complicated.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.320]   We all read Mike Masnick here and, and he takes us through the complications.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.360]   There's a lot of moral panic about the state of the net.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.360]   What's your doctor?
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.880]   What's your prescription for where it is?
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.000]   I guess this also brings us back to ask about blue sky.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.840]   You know, running a social network and running internet is really, really, really hard.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:36.600]   So remember I refer to that, you know, it's nice to have the human systems built in.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:42.680]   Um, you know, one of the things we did put a ton of effort to do in to Tumblr once we
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.600]   app on it was cleaning it up.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.960]   You know, there was a lot of hate speech on there.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:52.640]   There's a lot of kids, you know, talking about self harm or drugs or other things and like,
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.760]   you can't, um, you need to garden the space.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.040]   You need to curate it.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:05.720]   Uh, to create a healthy space and, um, the tension between that and the legality of freedom
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:11.240]   of speech and also like the popular understanding of freedom of speech is, uh, is kind of a
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.240]   beautiful tension.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.320]   And I think that we're always going to have companies in there and organizations.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.440]   I don't think we'll ever have a technical solution to this because it's fundamentally
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.640]   a human problem.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:27.240]   Uh, on that point, um, I don't still controversial about Tumblr because some people, um, want
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.440]   to do certain things that aren't, aren't legit there now.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.360]   But I, I do salute you because I think that yes, we have to invest in those spaces.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:38.960]   And if we abandon them or leave it to others, then we know what's going to happen.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.360]   We can know that well.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.720]   What was the investment?
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.280]   What is the, what was the investment at the beginning?
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.640]   What's the ongoing investment?
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:53.360]   Um, just in terms of, of scale of effort to keep Tumblr, of sociable and usable and nice.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:30:01.000]   So our, our big push right now is to get Tumblr to break even because it's burning, um, 40
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.600]   or $50 million per year.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.600]   Yikes.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.480]   And it's cost to run above what it makes.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.240]   And because of this kind of social.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.840]   We've been launching some subscriptions, some products where users can like blaze their
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.320]   posts to promote it.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.760]   Um, just different things to try to get to break even, but it is growing.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.120]   It is really popular, especially with youth in America.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:28.800]   And um, so I think there's, there's a real potential there, but gosh, I have so much empathy
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:33.800]   for the door seasons, Zuckerberg's of the world running a social network is darn hard.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.480]   I mean, I can see why you almost don't want to tell people about Tumblr because if the
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.320]   mass is invade, then that doubles, you know, quadruple or exploit.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.560]   Your, your problems with it.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.040]   How do you make, how do you make money?
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.080]   Is there advertising or is it, uh, paid subscription?
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.560]   So we have ads on Tumblr.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:58.720]   Um, I would say, you know, advertising is the default social media business model.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.920]   Um, so we have that as a base layer, but what we're trying to do is create something new
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.920]   on top of it.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.320]   So we have an upgrade to turn off the ads.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:12.240]   Um, we have upgrades, uh, where users can promote their own things.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.200]   So you can pay, you know, 20 bucks and put a picture of your cat in front of a hundred
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.200]   thousand people.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:24.520]   Um, you can, uh, there's upgrades to, for fun stuff, like to put these dancing crabs
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.520]   on your dashboard.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:31.480]   So we're trying to, and we're selling like actual physical goods, the most popular being
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:37.480]   shoelaces actually, because there's a long-standing Tumblr Tumblr, like, what?
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.480]   You ask about the shoelaces and you say, Oh, I stole them from the president or something.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:46.000]   And, um, the shoelaces, we have not been able to keep them on the shelf.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.240]   So for your combination of like merchandise, retail, digital goods, physical goods, we are,
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.440]   um, yeah, really grind into, get Tumblr back.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.400]   And the profitability, uh, I'm going to pay for it now.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.760]   Five bucks a month or 40 bucks a year.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.960]   I'm paying for it.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:03.960]   Uh, right now?
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.200]   I always, I've always, yeah, you need a little chime in your office.
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:12.280]   I've always, I've had a real soft spot for Tumblr.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.680]   And the reason I brought it up is because it is kind of, I also have a WordPress account
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.120]   and I also have a blog.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.080]   I actually have a self-hosted static blog on Hugo.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:24.640]   I've, I've gone through so many blogging platforms, but I never write anymore.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:30.480]   And I feel like Tumblr is kind of the antithesis of the, of the long form.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.840]   It's like just, it's fun.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.840]   It's quick.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.560]   It's a lot more in a way like Reddit.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.200]   Um, I'm, I'm, I want to see Tumblr succeed.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.880]   I'm so glad you guys bought it.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.840]   This is a loss of a treadmill than Instagram too.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.840]   Right.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.840]   I've got to get more.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:44.840]   I've got to be bigger.
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:50.360]   Um, no, this is my, it's, I love, what I love about blog so much is that it's the ability
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:57.200]   to have my place, um, and, and the ability to use that however you want then rather than,
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.200]   and I like social media.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.520]   I love Twitter.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:07.840]   Um, I, I deal with Facebook, but there's what I miss about blogging and I teach students
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.880]   this every, every year is it was that first moment when I had a blog post and somebody
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.120]   linked to me and I link back to them and I said, it's a conversation.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.080]   And somebody else used their space to talk with me and I use my space to talk with them
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:24.840]   and that changed my entire view of media, my entire view of journalism, my career,
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.160]   my life, everything was the link in the blog.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.920]   Well, that, yes, to that, to that end.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.880]   I mean, we used to have all of that.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:36.280]   Uh, how do you feel about web mentions, web hooks, things like that?
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.200]   Some of the newer stuff that people like Kevin Marks are doing.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:45.520]   Um, well, that, um, yeah, yeah, given marks, contact, shell, like, uh, Simon, will listen.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.520]   Eric Meyer.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.720]   These sort of web builders are good folks to follow to see what, uh, could be around the
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.720]   corner.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.120]   Alex Russell, another good person to follow.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.760]   Cause that's what we want to get back to is this kind of community, right?
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.680]   No matter what platform you're using.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:05.440]   I actually have a big project for it, uh, working on the rest of the year is to see
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.520]   what we can do to reinvigorate comments.
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.520]   Oh, it's a common interface.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.520]   Oh, boy.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.600]   As I said, a lot of people have turned off comments because what do you, what do you think
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.600]   that takes though?
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.600]   To do it.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.400]   Um, I think there's two things.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:23.280]   One, uh, you need to have a really smooth flow for like logging and commenting.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:30.120]   Um, I love that WordPress has moderation by default so that it's a curated space.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.280]   And then on the other end, you need the feedback loop.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.520]   So notifications.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:39.840]   So knowing when notifying a blogger, when someone comments, notifying the commenter,
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.000]   when someone replies to their comment, you know, that you just have to close that whole
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   interaction loop.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.560]   And I think it could be pretty exciting.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:50.560]   Cause if you look at what's happening on like discord, Reddit, like so much on the web,
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.040]   people want to talk to each other.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.040]   Mm hmm.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:58.680]   Like, we're not really happy with Facebook.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.760]   There needs to be a better way than Facebook.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.160]   I guess what I'm saying.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.160]   Um, you're being very diplomatic, Matt.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.160]   So I won't.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.160]   Right.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.160]   I actually like Facebook.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.160]   Okay.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.160]   All right.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.160]   There you go.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.160]   All right.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.160]   That's a bad word.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.160]   That's a bad word.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.160]   So good.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.160]   They are hyper targeting me now.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.160]   It's like scary.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.560]   It's like the exact artists that I like.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:30.160]   They're promoting the art to me and like, you know, I can spend more and like, so it's
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.560]   actually like it's been, it's kind of crazy.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.160]   I had to stop doing Instagram.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.360]   I'd spend money every night before in the morning, I'd look at Instagram and buy whatever
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.360]   the first thing I saw.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:44.760]   I was completely vulnerable to it.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:50.600]   So you mentioned, you mentioned Tumblr being a social network.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.480]   I've never really saw it as a social network.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:57.600]   I just see it as a platform, but everything you're describing sounds just like a social
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.600]   network.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:05.080]   Do you feel like Tumblr is in competition with the likes of Twitter or Facebook and
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.360]   in working to try to draw more people in?
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.280]   Or do you just feel like, okay, we're still just a platform where people can create content
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:15.520]   regardless of whatever's going on in the social media space?
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.320]   Yeah, it's interesting because there's actually kind of orders of magnitude.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:24.240]   So like Facebook's 3 billion, Twitter's 300 million, Tumblr's like 30 million.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.840]   So it's like one tenth of size of Twitter.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:33.040]   But with like one 80th or something, the number of employees is 200 people working on Tumblr
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.040]   right now.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.680]   It's totally a social network.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:40.040]   And the thing is, it's a social network that you really have to work at for it to be
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.040]   good.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:46.400]   That's what we're trying to fix because you just sign up for it.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:52.160]   You really have to curate who you're following and follow tags and kind of prune things.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.000]   It takes a little bit to learn how to use.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.960]   But then once you become a pro user, I think one of the stats we track is like, how many
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.520]   people log in six out of seven days?
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:10.040]   Hundreds and hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of folks who are like really totally
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.120]   into the service and super power users of it.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:18.000]   That's why I think it's web mentions and all that are very important because the internet's
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   like space.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.800]   It's big, really big.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.800]   And there's plenty of room for all of this.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.520]   But you don't want silos.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.520]   You'd like the, I like the Fediverse.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:33.520]   I like Mastodon because you'd like some porosity in these things so that people who use Tumblr
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.840]   can interact with people who use Facebook, can interact with people who use Twitter.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:44.440]   I feel like that's what people want, but it's not what corporations want.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:49.800]   How can we make it more than what people want?
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:54.520]   I think people are very quick to trade off freedom for convenience.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:38:01.920]   So I think the challenge to all of us who are trying to create this more open, federated,
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:09.400]   democratic free web is to make the user experience so compelling that people will choose it.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.480]   They don't have to care about the plumbing underneath being free or not free.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:18.160]   But if we can make the free version better, then I think we'll win.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.840]   That was really the thing I realized very early on because I kind of started off being
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.480]   like, oh, I'm just going to preach open source.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.400]   And once people understand open source, they will just choose WordPress.
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.840]   Yeah, it'll be obvious.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.440]   And then I very quickly learned, like, no, they don't really care.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.200]   They say you don't want to drill, you want to hold in the wall.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.480]   They're just trying to solve some problem.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.400]   They're trying to have a presence on the web.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.720]   That's not even the problem.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.800]   They're probably trying to get more people in their restaurants or more like readers to
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.400]   their writing or something.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.400]   And so I was like, well, if we want the web to be more open, we just have to, we're going
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.880]   to have to get really, really good at making user experience.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.160]   So that's been our focus still is today.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.080]   You still open source.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.080]   100%.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.080]   Yeah, promoter.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.080]   Good.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.080]   Because I think really that is--
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.840]   Open source is really my last word.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.840]   That is the thing that will--
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.040]   That's the model.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.640]   It feels like, you know, we're stewarding this for the next generation.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:17.760]   Like, while I'm alive and able to type in my mind works, I'm going to try to build as
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.120]   much open source stuff as possible.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:23.080]   And that'll pass on to the next generation.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:26.680]   And that's, I think, what's accelerating humanity's progress.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.880]   God's works are God's work.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:28.880]   I completely agree.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:36.520]   Because you've always had interesting interests, besides making as much open source as you
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:40.760]   can and running tons of companies and working on all this, what are your interests outside
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.800]   of automatic these days?
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.800]   What are you following?
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:47.600]   I'm just curious personally what you'd like to--
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:54.160]   You know, we just had a really fun thing at Burning Man that I helped fund.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.800]   It's called the Sonic Sphere.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:02.240]   So there's this crazy guy I know he has actually founded a company called Memrise.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.040]   His name's Ed Cook.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:09.480]   And he was reading an old book and came across the concept of what's called a Kugel Auditorium,
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.120]   K-U-G-E-L.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:17.120]   And the idea is that it's a 360 degree sphere of sound.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.400]   So the speaker's all around you.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.840]   And you know, the team actually built this at Burning Man.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:26.720]   So what you could do is you could climb up to it.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.000]   It was like maybe 15, 20 meters tall.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:36.640]   There'd be a net inside this kind of like bucky ball looking structure.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.880]   Maybe-- yeah, it kind of like that.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.400]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.320]   Those are some early prototypes.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:46.600]   If you scroll down, maybe they'll have the Burning Man one.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.120]   These are all the different prototypes you built.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.120]   Oh, yeah, there it is.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.120]   Which one?
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.120]   That is the--
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.120]   Not the photo yet.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.120]   The one on the right.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.120]   Ah, this is what they built.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.120]   What they ended up building.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.120]   Oh.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.720]   And so you'd be suspended in this net.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.120]   Oh my god, how awesome.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.120]   What?
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.520]   So you're in the middle of it.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.520]   It's just the--
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.520]   It's just the-- it's the-- it's the--
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.720]   And so sound would literally move around you.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.720]   Wow.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.880]   And they had all sorts of different sonic experiences.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:16.000]   So there was-- they had one where you were like the Apollo 11 launch, the audio from
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   that.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Cool.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Wow.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.200]   A different music.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.800]   A different music that had been composed specifically for this.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.120]   It's essentially like an instrument.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.840]   These 52 speakers.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.920]   Pretty amazing experience.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:36.560]   And also just to see the team that worked on that really, it was their life for half
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.400]   the year to bring it together.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:43.040]   And for did this for that, you know, we can have it Burning Man was pretty special.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.600]   So that's really fun.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.600]   Just art.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:46.600]   You know, you got to feed your soul as well.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.600]   I just went to the Rocco Chapel earlier.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:54.280]   If you're ever in Houston or passing through, highly, highly recommended.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:58.880]   It's a-- you know, Mark Rocco, the color field painter.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:05.240]   One of his last works was this purpose-built space, 17 Rocco paintings on the walls.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.680]   Open every single day of the year, 9 to 5, free admission.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.680]   You just walk in.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.360]   And it's kind of like a meditative space.
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.000]   It's just these paintings around you.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.600]   Kind of like an octagon.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.320]   And there's some benches and cushions in the middle.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.560]   And nothing like it anywhere else in the world.
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.360]   There's been a place in San Francisco.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:28.440]   I always think of it as an old hippie place called the Audium, which is sort of a similar idea.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.440]   That's so good.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.440]   Yes, it's been--
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.440]   Audium, I think, still runs on tapes.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.440]   It would be surprised.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.440]   Wow.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.440]   Really well-school.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.440]   It's from the '50s.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.080]   I think they built it in 1967, but the-- it's still there in San Francisco.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.560]   You can still go.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.560]   So I need to ask about these--
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.560]   Yeah, I count on a hookup the Audium folks with the Sonic's first folks.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.560]   He feels like it.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.800]   And the musician who I would love to play this instrument is Jacob Colier.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.840]   I don't know if you'll follow him at all.
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:43:01.000]   I think he's probably one of the greatest musicians alive right now, just otherworldly.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.040]   And he started as like a YouTube.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.040]   Yeah, he does it on YouTube.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.240]   And he's like, "I record every single track."
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:12.640]   Check out his-- don't you worry about a thing cover, as Steve went to cover.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:16.960]   If he doesn't take us down, I'll play a little bit of it.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:21.480]   He's one of these guys on YouTube who just overdubs, overdubs, overdubs, overdubs, into you
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:28.000]   get this amazing chorus environment where it's all him.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.600]   Yeah, we were talking about this some time ago.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.600]   Yeah, I loved it.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.600]   Wouldn't he be amazing on that sphere?
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.600]   All right.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:41.880]   We post some videos that are-- even if you're not a musician, just fascinating to watch.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.600]   He did a recording of "Moon River."
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.440]   He has literally hundreds of individual tracks.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:56.360]   And he walks through showing how he built it and just screen sharing his audio thing.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:01.280]   And it's fun to see a creator, someone in their element at the top of the game, one
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.320]   of the best in the world, sharing their passion.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:08.240]   And so actually showing how the sausage gets made is pretty incredible.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:12.720]   I think I watched two hours of this, even though I'm never going to like do what he does.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.880]   I was just so fascinated.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:20.960]   You give me a lot of hope, Beth, because-- and Jeff and I are old hippies.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:25.080]   And this was what we had hoped the world would be like.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:28.000]   And in fact, even at the beginning of the internet, this is what we hoped the internet
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.400]   would bring us.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:36.240]   And sometimes I don't know about you, Jeff, but I get discouraged by the most obvious surface
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.440]   of the internet.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:42.080]   But it's great, thank you, Matt, for reminding me that amongst all that, there are plenty
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:51.480]   of people like Jacob College who are using these media to do amazing things, maybe more
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.040]   than ever before, but they're just so much of it now.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.040]   It's easy to be fooled.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.040]   That's where all the hope is, Leo.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.040]   It is.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:01.840]   I'm saying it again, 150 years after "Moveable Type" after Gutenberg to come up with the novel
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:07.360]   with the Cervantes and the essay with Montaigne and the newspaper and the printed market for
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:08.360]   plays.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.000]   There's so much that can be done.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.320]   Once people, Clay Shurkey says that the tools don't become interesting until they become
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.320]   boring.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.360]   People accept them, they know what they are.
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.400]   And then the question becomes not the tool, but what you do with it.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.680]   Well, that's what I see exciting about everything in the history.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:28.000]   And history and time have a way of separating the wheat from the chaff.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   They're probably just as much chaff.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Oh, witchcraft.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.760]   A lot of crap out there.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:37.840]   But the stuff that survived is a mate, you know, is a Sistine Chapel.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.200]   And so, you know, we're in the midst of all of it.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.760]   Culture is what you remember.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.760]   And that's where it is.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.760]   That's a good word.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:53.480]   Matt, I've got to ask you, since you art, one word reaction, NFT.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.040]   What's your reaction to that?
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:59.120]   He's too political and diplomatic to say anything bad.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.120]   I'm trying.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.120]   Are you?
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.120]   Let me ask you this.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:06.640]   Are you making the web three version of WordPress?
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:12.720]   We do have someone in automatic who is working on, you know, just focused on creating bridges
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.520]   between WordPress and web three stuff and WooCommerce.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:21.680]   You know, we have this open source shop of WooCommerce that's doing quite and quite well.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:26.760]   I think 30 billion of transactions last year went through WooCommerce.
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.760]   Wow.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:28.760]   That's amazing.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.160]   You know, I think it's a distorted market.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:39.080]   So, you know, markets are free and open, but we forget how easy it is to distort them.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:45.120]   So if you look at basically the impact of one actor, which is like Saudi Arabia plus
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:51.360]   SoftBank on technology over the past five years and valuations and everything like that,
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.400]   it completely distorted this market.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.880]   So we have this myth of efficient markets in reality.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:08.160]   And I think the distortion in the crypto market is one you had such incredible riches created
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:13.360]   for early adopters, you know, people with thousands of Bitcoins or Ethereum.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:23.360]   And they to, you know, essentially sustain their original lottery ticket will put money
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:29.720]   into every single thing that could be they'll invest into everything that's on the network.
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.160]   And so that distorts the economics a little bit.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:39.040]   The other thing is that because you have this such rapid accumulation of wealth both in
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:47.520]   paper and in reality, there is this kind of this distortion where if you're creating something
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:53.840]   in the crypto space, I think it's tough to know whether you truly have product market
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:59.120]   fit like you've created something that users really resonate with or if people are, you
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.880]   know, trying to get in early on the token.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.920]   So it goes up and like whether you have like long term investors or short term investors,
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:10.040]   essentially people looking to make a quick buck or who are really actually using your
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.080]   product and service.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:18.800]   And I guess this goes all the way about the blue sky like, what was that crypto Twitter
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.960]   thing?
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.680]   They ranked everyone and you could buy and sell tokens for everyone on you followed.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.840]   That was short lived, wasn't it?
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:30.000]   I remember we talked about it and then it was gone.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.480]   I think it's still there and they built a distributed Twitter.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.520]   Like that was kind of interesting cool thing about it.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.520]   Okay.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:44.200]   Because yeah, they, I think it shows, I don't know what that shows.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:48.280]   I think it shows that just because something like the tokens got super valuable or you
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:53.840]   get a huge run of, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have the long term usage that
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:57.520]   is ultimately the lifeblood of any product.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:02.320]   What are you looking, what frontiers are next for you?
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:08.000]   The next open source you want to build, the next thing is you want to play with, exploit.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.720]   I guess I should say that I'm super into all the crypto stuff as well.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:12.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:21.000]   And particularly like zero knowledge proofs, Zcash, Monero, the stuff that's happening with
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   Ethereum.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.320]   I think it's some of the most interesting open source in the world.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.320]   It's happening right now.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.200]   And so I can't wait to see what it does.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:34.000]   I just, I don't think kind of like this whole metaverse stuff.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:40.840]   I feel like sometimes people try to create a trend where there isn't one.
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.040]   And we should just actually look at what's being used.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.040]   What am I excited about?
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:49.520]   I'm really excited about creating more canvas and paint brushes and colors for people to
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.520]   paint with.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.520]   Nice.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.520]   Bravo.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:59.680]   That's really, you know, the calling of folks at automatic is we make the tools.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.160]   And it's so rewarding to see what people do with it.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.880]   Do you get to code?
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.440]   Do you get to code anymore?
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.440]   A little bit.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.600]   I can be dangerous every now and then.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.600]   Nice.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:14.520]   It was actually one of my big regrets was prior to Burning Man.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:19.160]   I was hoping to do some LED programming for the Sonic sphere.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:23.960]   And I just wasn't able to get to it because there was so much work to take that week off.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:27.800]   I had to do it on a work beforehand and we had a board meeting right after.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.480]   So I wasn't able to get to it.
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:36.760]   But if I had like a few months off, I think probably what I'd play with is I think LED
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:37.760]   program, actually.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.840]   And it's probably not doing that in PHP.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:41.520]   I'm thinking.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.520]   What's that?
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.520]   Not doing that in PHP.
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.520]   I'm thinking.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.520]   No, there's a lot of there.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.560]   There's actually some cool open source stuff there.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.560]   What do you do?
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.440]   What do you code in when you get a chance?
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:56.560]   Oh, I actually write a lot of weird stuff in PHP.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:59.920]   Like all of my email actually runs through a PHP script.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:02.080]   Kind of a WordPress plugin actually.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:04.480]   That all gets piped to that.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:08.720]   It classifies it based on whether I emailed the person, how they're setting a database
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:09.720]   and everything.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.120]   That's part of how my email system works.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.960]   Do some scripting.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:16.280]   I really love like systems administration.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:17.640]   I love networking.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:18.640]   You know, unified stuff.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:19.640]   Awesome.
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:20.640]   Ubiquity.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:22.640]   It's just so much fun to play with.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.280]   And they've got their access control now.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.920]   So you can have the NFC cards, the cameras, everything.
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.280]   Like that stuff's really fun.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:29.600]   I actually have been planning to do that.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.800]   I have a Ubiquity house.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.800]   I've been thinking about doing that.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:34.800]   Ubiquity house.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.360]   I'm kind of enjoying the realm of technology moving from bits to atoms.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:43.120]   So I definitely appreciate being in the bit world where, you know, you can copy things
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.120]   instantly.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.960]   There's abundance and everything.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:52.320]   And I like as technology is starting to bleed into the real world and just improve it.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:56.160]   Just little things like can you walk in the room and the lights turn on?
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.760]   And is it a pleasing color and tone?
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.520]   And like home, what's it called?
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:03.360]   Home Assistant is the open source home automation thing.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:04.360]   Pretty cool.
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:09.000]   Matt Mullowig is at photo, Matt on Twitter.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.040]   I guess that's probably the best place to keep up with what's going on with you.
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.040]   Tumblr, Tumblr.
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.640]   Oh, what am I saying?
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:16.640]   What's your Tumblr?
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:17.640]   What's your Tumblr?
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:18.640]   Is it photo, Matt?
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:20.640]   All right.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.640]   I do tweet a lot.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:22.640]   I got to follow you.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.640]   I'm not following you.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:25.640]   On the web is my blog.
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.640]   There you go.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.640]   Matt on Tumblr.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.640]   Oh, thanks for following me.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.640]   Of course.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.640]   Now that I'm paying for Tumblr, I got to follow somebody.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:38.280]   By the way, I said ATT was Verizon was the evil empire that acquired Tumblr.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.280]   Let's get this.
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.280]   It was Yahoo.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.280]   Yahoo.
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:43.280]   Which emerged with AOL.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.280]   And then, yep.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.280]   Verizon bought.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.280]   It was a very diverse.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.280]   Oh, that stuff.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:51.040]   It was the Yahoo AOL thing that became Verizon Media.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.760]   And I think they spun it back out again.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:54.120]   It's not like another company.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.120]   Yes.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.120]   Oh, it's ridiculous.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.320]   But Matt, can I take you back to the beginning just for one second?
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.560]   Because I'm always curious.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:03.240]   After I spoke with Polaris, they ended up investing in you.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:07.400]   What were the conversations like with those first investors when you needed the capital
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:12.000]   and went for it, and you were such a different way to do things?
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   How did that work?
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.200]   I think, amidst them, this was a wise way.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:20.360]   Man, it was a strong filter.
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:21.880]   Most investors said no.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.880]   Also remember, I was a little Pipsqueak.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:25.600]   I was like 20 years old.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.640]   I couldn't even drink.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:31.040]   And I wanted to create a virtual currency.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.280]   I wanted to do all these sorts of things.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.840]   So I had very, very broad ambitions.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:39.240]   And yeah, that just filtered out a lot of people.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:48.600]   And the ones who ended up investing, I think, could understand the broader vision.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:54.120]   And one really nice thing we've been able to do as automatic is now a longer tenured
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:58.040]   company.
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.800]   We take our fiduciary responsibility shareholders very seriously.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:07.280]   So over the years, we've been able to essentially bring in new investors to buy out old investors.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:14.440]   So for whatever reason, for example, I don't think Polaris owns any automatic stock anymore.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:18.200]   Whatever their timeline or their-- when they invested in automatic, I think the valuation
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:21.720]   was $3 or $4 million.
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:30.040]   They put in a 1.1 on a 3.3 with the rounds or series A. So at that point, when you go
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:33.680]   revenue and everything like that, they can have an amazing return.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:37.200]   And the new investors can come in and say, "Wow, you're going to grow at this compan
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.320]   and your growth rate for the past five years."
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.280]   And it looks like you're going to do it for the next five years.
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.440]   Sign me up for that.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:47.600]   So there's just different classes of investors and it's all about finding the right partners.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:49.600]   Well I wish you nothing but the best.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:55.760]   You've been such a boon to everybody who wants to publish or create on the internet.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:00.400]   Your portfolio of companies shows that you've saved some of the best companies in the world
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.280]   from a fate worse than death.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:05.360]   You created the, I think, the best blogging platform ever.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.960]   We're trying to make a Berkshire Hathaway of the internet.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:09.600]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.040]   Wow, nice.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:15.040]   We'll call you the Wizard of where do you live?
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.600]   Houston, Mr. Houston.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.400]   All right, I like it.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.240]   Matt, thank you for spending some time with us.
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.240]   Thank you so much, Matt.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.240]   Thank you for everything.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.240]   Thank you for everybody who's watching.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.240]   It's really great to see you all.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.240]   And don't be a stranger.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.240]   Have to come on any time.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   Okay.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.240]   And I'll take you up on the border.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.240]   That's the show.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.240]   We have a big picture of the fan.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.240]   Okay.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.240]   I bought my mom a Pixelbook.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:36.240]   I love Pixelbook.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.240]   You can watch Jeff Gordon.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.240]   I'm so sad.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.480]   I'm so sad, Matt.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.960]   I really appreciate your time.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:50.240]   Matt Mullenwig, photo Matt on Twitter on, sorry, Tumblr, automatic and WordPress.com.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:54.080]   A legend and such a nice young man.
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.160]   It's such a clean cut, nice young man.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.160]   Thank you, Matt.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:58.160]   I appreciate your time.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.160]   Thanks, Matt.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:00.560]   It's great to see you.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:01.760]   Thank you, Jeff, for suggesting.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.320]   Oh, thank you for doing that.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:04.320]   That was just such a pleasure.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.400]   I'm honored to be able to talk to Matt.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.040]   I just think the world of him.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.040]   Great for you.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:16.080]   Truly, you know, for a mogul, he's pretty sweet.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.480]   Oh, yeah, amazing.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.480]   Right?
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.480]   He's pretty nice.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:20.480]   He's so soft-spoken.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.480]   So, I know.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:25.320]   I didn't sense much Jack Asory in him at all.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.320]   No, very little.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.320]   Not a bit.
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:28.320]   Not a molecule.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:29.320]   Not a hair.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:30.320]   All right.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.640]   Get your candle back.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:35.480]   We're going to do a little morning when we come back.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.120]   As I mentioned, Stacey, as we go.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:40.440]   Now that I know Matt's into home automation, now I really regret it.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:41.440]   I know the sheer.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.440]   Mm-hmm.
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:43.440]   Right.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:44.440]   Wow.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.440]   Wow.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:47.440]   They have had a conversation, but maybe Nick, we'll bring him back.
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.440]   We'll bring him back.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:49.440]   You know, it'll be fun.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.920]   And maybe you do this with me, Jeff.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:54.880]   Not necessarily a twig, but a special show with maybe Dave Weiner.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:55.880]   Oh, yes.
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:56.880]   Yes.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:57.880]   Yes.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:00.080]   I know you want to get David Weinberger on.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.080]   Yep.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:06.760]   Just some of the heroes of the early days of open source on the internet who are still
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:07.760]   doing amazing things.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:11.320]   And the funny thing is Matt is a hero of the other days of the internet.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:12.320]   He's still young.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:13.320]   He's a kid.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:15.080]   Well, he started when he was 19.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:17.680]   I mean, like Dave, like Dave Carp.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:26.200]   Our show today brought to you by IRL, which is an original podcast from Mozilla.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:30.080]   You know what IRL stands for in real life, but this is interesting because it's a show
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:36.400]   for people who build AI and people who develop tech policy.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:39.400]   Brigitte does such a good job hosting it.
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.280]   And there's a new season.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:47.240]   This season, IRL looks at AI in real life, who can AI help, who can harm.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:52.360]   We really are, as we were talking about going through a Cambrian explosion with AI right
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.760]   now, this is the time to start thinking about what it means.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:01.960]   And six of IRL features fascinating conversations with people who are working to build more trustworthy
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:02.960]   AI.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:06.760]   For example, there's an episode about how the world is being mapped with AI.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:11.600]   The data that's missing from those maps tells as much of a story as the maps themselves.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:15.160]   You know, how about the people who are working to fill in those gaps and take control of
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:16.160]   the data.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:21.120]   There's another episode about gig workers who use apps for their livelihood and how they're
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:25.760]   pushing back against algorithms that control everything, how much they're paid.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:29.520]   They're looking for new ways to gain power over data to create better working conditions
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.360]   for political junkies.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:35.320]   There's an episode about the role AI plays when it comes to the spread of misinformation
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.360]   and hate speech around elections.
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:40.280]   Obviously, that's a big concern right now.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:46.640]   It's a really interesting show about one of the most important topics in technology today.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:51.720]   IRL hosted by Bridget Toditz from Mozilla.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:53.680]   And you can find it by just going to our show notes.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:57.640]   We'll put a link there or search for IRL in your podcast player.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:58.840]   Use pocket casts.
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:00.920]   That's Matt's podcast player.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:02.080]   Great one too.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:05.960]   We thank IRL so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.360]   IRL.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.000]   Who has power over AI?
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   That's the question.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:20.920]   Yeah, I think about Instagram and I think about Flickr and all the places I want to post
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:21.920]   photos.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:24.200]   I want to hang with people.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:25.360]   There's just so many places.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:29.200]   We have our own social networks.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:32.600]   We have the Twit community and the Twit Mastodon.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.840]   But it all feels very fragmented.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:39.080]   I think that's one thing we would like to do a show about maybe is the open web.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:43.240]   It's whenever he's on talks a lot about that of course.
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:46.280]   I feel like there's a solution there somewhere.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:47.840]   Maybe it lies in open source.
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:53.240]   When I talked a course last term with Dr. Rushkoff, I think he's Douglas.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.240]   He's Douglas.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.240]   He's not going to.
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.240]   He's not going to.
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.240]   Yes.
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.040]   I'm Douglas for Mother's sake.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:03.280]   So Dr. Rushkoff, we taught a course in redesigning the internet.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:07.400]   And one of the big lessons to me was that the students who were masters students, they're
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.040]   a little older.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:13.280]   But they all came on the internet, they came alive in the internet when it was already
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.280]   corporate.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:19.400]   It was already past those early, heady, hopeful days that we had.
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.600]   And what I love too is to try to recap.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:27.040]   There were mistakes made in the early net, the early web.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.040]   We were too optimistic.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.480]   We didn't build in guardrails.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.880]   We didn't think of the impact.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.080]   All that's true.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:36.120]   But there was also, I want to recapture what that notion of hope was.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:42.480]   And for Matt at the end to say, he just wants to make canvases and pay brushes for people.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:48.760]   And to have the faith in that creativity is exactly what we want to recapture.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:54.600]   And to say with Dave Weiner, I love how much Matt respects Dave and stays in touch with
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:59.960]   Dave and takes advice from Dave, because Dave is always generous to give it and has a vision
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.800]   and has ideas.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.480]   And that's wonderful.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:11.760]   But his vision for the early web, and then you go to David Weinberger and philosophically,
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:19.120]   he had a philosophical perspective on what it could be and what it shouldn't be that
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.040]   he's had in his book since.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.040]   And I don't want to just go to the Old Farts, and I'll clue back the Old Fart list right
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.040]   now.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:31.160]   But I think there is something to learn from playing the tape back and asking what we did
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.800]   right and wrong, we put myself in a broad end or anything.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.240]   But the early days of the net, what hopes were right, what hopes have been lost, what
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:44.080]   hopes can be recaptured, I think that's so important.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:49.560]   Yeah, I mean, you might say, oh, you know, Matt's just a wide-eyed optimist, or maybe
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:50.960]   you're a wide-eyed optimist.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.680]   I don't know, I'm accused of that often.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:02:00.680]   But I think that if we don't do that, then we are stuck with the dystopia that we'll
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:04.120]   never get a slightly less worse than what we have.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:10.480]   All right, Jeff, light the candle, put on the hood, it's time to mourn.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:15.280]   Now I should point out that this is not, this is a rumor.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:21.120]   This is, and consider the source, the most ugly website you've ever seen, the Verge.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.120]   Do you see the new Verge?
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.600]   They've written it yet, they just was designed.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.600]   Hell is this.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:27.600]   Okay.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.800]   Hey, we said that about the first version of it too though, so.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:31.800]   Yeah, I guess.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.720]   You know, this is what hell will hold us.
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:37.200]   Well, it's the shtick is, it's the incomplete internet, the incomplete logo.
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.200]   So I kind of like that.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.200]   Is that what they say?
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.200]   That's what they say.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.360]   They have a whole page.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.360]   I put it the rundown.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.400]   You never look at my part of the rundown anymore.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.920]   I haven't gotten there yet, but no, I see it.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.920]   There's a line 67.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.640]   Is there, is there a design?
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.880]   Oh, look, something went wrong.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.840]   I don't know.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:58.960]   This isn't your link, I'm clicking the link on their site, Neelai Patel's article.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.580]   Welcome to the new Verge.
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:03.080]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.640]   Wrong with that script.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:05.640]   Oops.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:08.560]   See, see if one, well, it's a redesign.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:13.040]   That's okay, but I don't understand the thinking behind this at all.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:17.040]   And the other thing I wanted, and I pointed this out to Merigio Foley, if you go to ZDnet,
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:22.960]   they did a redesign too, where they're doing, see the slash, and when you go to read an
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:29.760]   article, it has the breadcrumbs, buy a slashes, go to the Verge.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.880]   Notice the slash, the breadcrumbs.
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:42.160]   It's a little weird, but I think that they, they kind of cribbed.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.120]   I like the ZDnet version.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:48.800]   Yeah, I like the ZDnet is a little bit anyway.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:54.480]   And then what's this thing, today's story stream, like they're, like they're doing a
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.480]   little Twitter.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.360]   Oh, some design company, man.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.360]   Twitter widget.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.400]   A lot of energy on a lot of nothing if you ask me.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.120]   But anyway, that's not what we're here for.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.680]   It is only a rumor.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:07.600]   The pixel, the pixel book is dead.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.440]   So don't mourn too hard yet, right?
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.360]   My candle of hope.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:19.640]   Google, according to Alex Heath and David Pierce, who I must say are very well connected at the
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:25.840]   Verge, has canceled the next version of the pixel book laptop and to add insult to injury
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.080]   dissolved the team responsible for building it.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:31.320]   That's what they would tell me that there's no going back.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.320]   Right.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.400]   The device was far along in development and expected to debut next year, according to a
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:40.840]   person familiar with the matter, but caught, cut as part of recent cost getting measures
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:41.840]   inside of Google.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.440]   What is Google's revenue last quarter?
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:45.720]   Yeah, not enough.
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:49.000]   Apparently cost.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.560]   So it is possible.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.920]   Because aren't they doing a tablet?
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.360]   Didn't they say we're doing a tablet?
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.360]   Right.
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.360]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.040]   And the whole foldable approach as well.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:04.800]   So maybe it's, maybe that they just feel like that's, and I presume a tablet would run.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.840]   Well, maybe no, it's an Android tablet though.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.840]   Android, not Chrome OS.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.120]   It's for OS is what I love.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:17.440]   I was wondering what if this was like a play Google did several years ago with the HTC
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:22.720]   partnership, they could go third party and say, Hey, you handle all of this hardware.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.560]   And then just, you know, we're going to give you some specs, but y'all handle it and take
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.040]   a little bit of the stress off of us.
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:34.000]   And then we'll provide the software and you just dump it into place for us.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.640]   We guess one could be positive and say, well, but it's so mature.
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.960]   The market is so mature now that we don't need to show the way anymore.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:45.280]   But they were still, you know, when I was looking for the last machine, what did I end up getting?
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.280]   The last Google Chromebook.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.280]   Right.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.280]   The Pixelbook.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:54.520]   The Pixelbook was always more expensive than anybody else's, but it was also higher end.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.360]   It was worth it usually.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.760]   I still have a couple of them.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.160]   I really like them.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.240]   But they're also, by the way, out of date now, right?
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.240]   You know, they're old.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.240]   You don't get up to you.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.240]   No, they are old.
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:10.160]   You do know they're willing to spend more on those other proprietary brands though, right?
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.160]   Oh, there's plenty.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:16.520]   My Pixelbook is also in black today in morning.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:24.280]   There are plenty of, you know, Chromebooks out there, Acer, ASUS, Lenovo, so HP, you know.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:28.440]   But my friend, Craig Newmark, called me last week just thinking he needs to get new one
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.240]   and ask me what I've done.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.280]   And I said, I love my Pixelbook Go.
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:36.160]   It's a really nice machine, but it's two years out of date now.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:40.120]   And I got a CX-9 and hated it.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.120]   That was the...
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:42.120]   I remember that.
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.120]   Oh, man.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:48.040]   I don't remember you getting that, not being thrilled.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.760]   I thought I was dying to get it.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.760]   I couldn't get it.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.760]   I was dying to be...
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.760]   My hands on it when I did.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:56.400]   I just felt like it was the same as buying Google Glass.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.760]   I felt like a schmuck.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:04.040]   All right, that's the bad news.
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.040]   Now all good news.
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.040]   Well, at the candle.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.840]   Morning is over.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:10.840]   Moving on.
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:18.160]   Wall Street Journal says they have learned that Twitter shareholders plan to approve
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.760]   the $44 billion takeover by Elon Musk.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:21.760]   They've already passed.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.600]   They've already passed.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.600]   They've already passed.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:25.600]   Okay.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.600]   They...
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:29.240]   The vote was scheduled for Tuesday, 1 p.m. Eastern.
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.720]   And so the vote is in and it's passed.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:32.720]   Not that that makes...
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:33.720]   Oh, well, mainly.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:34.720]   I voted against it.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.760]   I took my few shares and I voted against it.
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:43.680]   In my economic self interest, but in the self interest of democracy and freedom of speech
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:44.680]   and a free world.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:45.680]   Right.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.080]   And because you want to stick it to Elon.
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.080]   Yeah.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:49.400]   I voted for the other things.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.560]   There were three things on the ballot.
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:52.560]   One was paying the executives.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.240]   I said, "Okay, fine, pay him."
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.400]   I forgot what the other one was, but then I voted against the merger.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.880]   It's pretty clear after all of the revelations in this...
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:06.640]   The court case will be October 17th in the Delaware Court of Chancery.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:12.560]   It's pretty clear that Elon really only wanted to buy it for about five minutes and then
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:16.920]   immediately got cold feet because almost within a week he asked his lawyer, "Can we
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.560]   put this off because World War III is about to happen?"
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.560]   I want to buy it.
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:24.640]   I wanted to try to find the cash.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:30.760]   Well, I wonder, I guess it could be that that's what Soured and Mona is realizing how
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:33.280]   much in hawk he was going to be.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:34.840]   Anyway, it's pretty clear.
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.840]   He's looking for...
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:41.160]   Leo, that you used the phrase the other day that I kept the last couple of shows ago,
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.680]   when there's an external event.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.680]   Material adverse event.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:46.560]   Thank you so much for the World War III.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.560]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.560]   Is the material adverse event.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.560]   It's just hilarious.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:52.600]   This is the one thing that does get him off the hook.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:59.200]   Even though he stipulated, he's going to buy Twitter as is, if there is a material adverse
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:04.800]   event, everybody quits or the company loses a trillion dollars or something.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.440]   That is really significant.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:09.080]   That wasn't foreseen.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:13.640]   Then he can say reasonably, "Oh, yeah, well now I don't want to," and he's out.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.480]   And I don't know, maybe he'd still have the $1 billion break up.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:19.920]   He'd be willing to take that at this point, I'm sure.
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.200]   But that's what he's looking for.
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:30.160]   He's also saying that paying much, the former security director Peter Zatko, $7.75 million
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.560]   in his determination contract, is a material adverse effect.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:36.720]   He's saying World War III is a material adverse effect.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:40.920]   He's saying the bots are whatever he can find.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:47.040]   So we'll continue to follow the story as we get closer to court time.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.840]   What is the court, do you remember?
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:49.840]   October 17th.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:50.840]   17th.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.500]   What day of the week is that?
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.000]   You want to watch a live?
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.480]   Do a special.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:59.360]   Do a springing news, a special event.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.360]   It's a Monday.
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.840]   But it's going to go on for a week.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.840]   I'm sure you at least, yeah.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:03.840]   It's going to go at least.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:06.360]   They're going to talk to everybody.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:10.800]   So forth and so on.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.600]   Let's see.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:22.920]   Evan Spiegel, the CEO of Snap, when asked at the code conference about TikTok said the
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:27.480]   secret to, first of all, he admitted TikTok is eating Snap's lunch.
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.680]   I think everybody knows that.
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.480]   Along with everybody else's.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.480]   So follow salt.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.480]   Hank on TikTok.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.640]   It'll be a mighty tasty lunch.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.640]   He's not inside Hollywood again.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:44.200]   I don't know if they'll let me play this or not.
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:45.200]   They tweeted it.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.560]   It feels like they should allow me to.
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.560]   I don't know.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.440]   I don't know what I can play anymore.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.960]   I guess I'll just err on the side.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.080]   We haven't been taking down for TikTok videos.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.240]   I shouldn't say taken down.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.560]   We haven't been slapped on the wrist about.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:02.080]   Well, this isn't a TikTok video.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:08.680]   This is the inside Hollywood Mario Lopez with my son on the right.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:13.760]   Hank's French dip versus Owen Hans.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:19.200]   Of course he did.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.080]   Owen beat my son last time.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.840]   So this is a rematch.
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:27.840]   Henry is going to make a French dip that is.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.920]   Oh my God.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.160]   Would you eat that, Hank?
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.240]   Please and thank you.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:45.080]   So I won't tell you who won, but do watch Access Hollywood for the exciting, thrilling
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.080]   gripping.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.880]   So great that he's got that kind of emotion.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:51.520]   So TikTok is eating.
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.680]   Snaps, delicious lunch.
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:58.560]   But he says, the reason is, and this is kind of interesting, the Chinese government is
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:04.080]   pouring billions into TikTok.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:10.280]   You know, they can't lose because they are so well funded.
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:15.200]   The strongest criticism of the TikTok, this is from Forbes that came from Matthias Daufner,
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:17.440]   who is as you dip.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.440]   Dipfner.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:19.440]   Dipfner.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.440]   Dipfner.
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:27.920]   But this dipfner was, you know, is the CEO of actual Springer, which is a big German publisher,
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.920]   right?
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.080]   And by the way, they're big in America.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.320]   They own insider, political and protocol.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.280]   I didn't know that.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.280]   Ooh.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:42.480]   He says, TikTok should be banned in every democracy.
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.880]   I think it's silly.
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.400]   We can't have a China with Facebook, Google Amazon.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:52.280]   So if I should be allowed them in our free market economy.
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:56.120]   So then my least favorite media personality.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:01.120]   Scott Galloway, who will do anything to get attention, also said to be banned.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.680]   I still find him hilarious.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:03.680]   I'm sorry.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:04.680]   Oh, he's a gallery.
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:10.720]   He's a little bit of a, how should we say it?
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.720]   Yes.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.720]   That's the word attention.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:13.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:14.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:15.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:21.000]   He said, it feels like the kicking the poop out of everybody at the Code Conference.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.400]   Anyway, billions and billions of dollars.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:28.080]   That's what it takes to grow like TikTok.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:37.640]   But TikTok is to me right now, again, the most innovative platform because it gave people,
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:41.920]   to use Matt's words, a new canvas and new paintbrush.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:42.920]   Yeah.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:49.560]   You know, why isn't the likes of Snap or Instagram getting more support the way...
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.560]   What?
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.560]   ...take government support?
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:56.200]   Well, no, not government support, just financial support because we have investors out there
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:01.360]   investing in all kinds of things that that former WeWork guy put up.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:05.680]   Aren't those people smart enough to look at something like a Instagram or...?
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:07.560]   Well, they were at early on in Snap.
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.760]   I don't remember what Snap's raise was.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.120]   Snap's awful right now.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:12.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.960]   But as soon as Snap started tanking, I'm sure it became harder.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.720]   Where's the nearest door?
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.720]   And harder.
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:23.280]   Why not throw money at it to help bring them back up and dethrone the likes of TikTok?
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:26.040]   You know, it's just lost hope.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.040]   Well, okay.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.720]   It's like, yeah, this is TikTok's game.
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:33.320]   If their strategy is just to copy other...
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:37.360]   Innovation elsewhere, which is what Facebook has been doing and what Snap's been doing,
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:40.040]   then I would say they're not a good investment.
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:47.640]   To answer your question, when Snap was beginning and big, by the way, it was seven years ago,
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.680]   TikTok of the world, right?
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:51.520]   It was taken over.
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:58.160]   They're a series dev round of funding, $485 million.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.320]   They're series E200, but up to $500 million.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.800]   They're series F1.8 billion.
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:09.560]   So Snap got started with billions and billions of dollars.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.000]   Exactly the same.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.280]   So it's a little funny of them to say, "Well, it's so fair."
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:21.000]   But when they were hot, it was raising money like crazy.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.920]   The problem is that they're faltering because of competition.
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:26.920]   He's saying...
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.920]   I don't...
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.600]   I mean, it's not wrong.
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:34.360]   He says TikTok got this really great lead early on by aggressively expanding, spending
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:38.280]   a huge amount of money to do that, like somebody else.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:43.040]   So that people can train the algorithm and ultimately end up with a much more personalized
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.920]   feed that's harder to get a new service.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.920]   That is true.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.840]   It's clear to entry, just as there is with Google, just as there was with any Microsoft
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.480]   name, massively successful company.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:56.240]   So TikTok has this algorithm that's going to be hard to compete with unless you have
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.000]   the network effect.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.960]   Snap says, "Well, we'll compete with TikTok by focusing on connections with family and
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.800]   friends rather than strangers."
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.360]   But I think we've talked about this.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:09.680]   There was a flip in what social media did.
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:10.920]   At first, it was family.
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:11.920]   Oh, right.
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.520]   Now it's creators.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:17.800]   And I think that Evans wrong when he thinks that somehow they're going to come back by
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:20.720]   doing family and friends.
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:24.360]   I think that's why they failed, frankly, is they didn't have creators.
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.200]   They tried and they couldn't get creators to put stuff on Snap.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.200]   That's...
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.400]   Well, I also think we'll go overboard on creators too.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:32.400]   Maybe then they'll be the next thing.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.400]   Like influencers.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.880]   As usual, what do you mean by that, Mr. Jarvis?
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:41.120]   I just mean that now everything is creators, every dollar goes into creators, everything's
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.440]   creators, everything's content.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:48.120]   And we're losing the connections, I think, that people did value between them.
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.320]   So I think what we always do is we always go overboard.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.600]   In media, we do that and the technology, we go over, do that.
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:57.680]   And everything, everybody pivots the same direction and then marches together, only
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.480]   discover that there's too many people there.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.320]   In the early days of Prince...
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.480]   Mr. Jarvis, they have...
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:03.640]   They have reached.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:10.400]   Is it not logical to go towards someone that has a bigger reach to help push your product?
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.720]   I'm just trying to stay with your same there.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:19.360]   They have more of a reached in datgum CBS in some instances.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.480]   Well, you're right.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:22.480]   We've always said that.
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.480]   That's why we're big on Host Red Ads here at the Twit Network.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:28.600]   I completely agree with you.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:34.600]   I think when you see an older, you're an Ed McMahon feeding Alpo to a dog on the Johnny
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:42.240]   Carson show or Paul Harvey, flogging Bose Wave radios.
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.600]   It's very, very effective.
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.280]   That's not a new phenomenon.
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:48.600]   That's been since Arthur Godfrey.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.400]   That's always been that way.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.560]   Milton Burrell was sponsored.
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.600]   Who sponsored the Milton Burrell show?
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:54.600]   Buick?
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:55.600]   Remember that?
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:56.600]   It was like...
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.600]   Grandpa, I don't know.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.600]   Come on, Jim.
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:17:59.600]   You remember?
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.600]   You remember?
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.600]   Gee.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:05.040]   You remember the Milton Burrell show?
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.040]   Overrated.
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:08.040]   That's what I remember.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:12.960]   But the point being that creators have always driven ad sales, but I don't think that necessarily
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.600]   means that social media will always be driven by creators.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.960]   I think that's Jeff's point.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:23.520]   Yeah, advertisers may like it, but I don't know.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.600]   What would replace creators, Jeff?
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:28.480]   I mean, well, I think collaboration is one.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:30.120]   I think that's where it's...
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.240]   Collabs, yeah.
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:34.800]   I think we like stories.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:37.400]   I think that's what Facebook found out.
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.980]   That's what everybody found out is.
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:42.540]   Yeah, it's nice to see what Antmod's up to, but really tell me his story.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:46.360]   Well, there are the key is if you get authentic stories.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.360]   I think the one you're up to.
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:50.080]   Texaco, then Buick.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.080]   Thank you, Swamp Rat.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.080]   Okeleton Burrell.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:54.040]   Texaco, star, theater.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:57.160]   Now, don't ask him who Milton Burrell was.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.600]   Please, don't ask him anybody.
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.120]   Uncle Mothi.
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.320]   Where are he?
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.720]   I've lost it.
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:05.720]   Ah, good.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:06.720]   I did it.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.720]   I know I could.
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:11.440]   Well done, sir.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:12.840]   We were talking about creators.
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:13.840]   Go to Bloomberg.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.840]   I was going to do Google.
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:15.840]   No, don't mention Goomba.
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:19.320]   We were talking about story and how people like story.
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:24.320]   So Facebook thought at first it would really be about your friends and family connection.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.000]   Remember Mark Oi said, "Life's better when you connect."
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.040]   And he's still saying it, by the way, with this new metaverse thing.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.000]   No, we want stories.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.360]   Remember briefly, there was this thought that you would build your own movies or build your
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:39.360]   own books and choose your own adventure.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:41.560]   And then everybody realized, "Nobody wants to do that.
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:42.920]   I just want to sit back.
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.840]   Tell me a story, Daddy."
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:51.560]   That's all it's been ever since Homer was telling people about the Trojan war around the
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.320]   campfire.
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:57.520]   I trumped your Gutenberg and brought in Homer.
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.000]   I just want to point out.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.520]   Is there even hold of it?
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:10.120]   I mean, but I also told our journalism students yesterday, "Beware the power of the story."
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:14.640]   When we in journalism take over somebody else's story, we think it's our story now.
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.640]   We exploit it.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:17.000]   We extract it.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.360]   There's a power relationship there that I'd be careful of.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.880]   And I think that when companies also create a place where we're going to use your stories
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:27.360]   and make money on it, it's going to come off being false because then people start making
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:32.000]   up stuff to have a hotter story or a hotter take or a hotter whatever.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.440]   And I think it's authenticity is what's going to matter.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:39.840]   And I think that's going to come in different forms in different ways that people feel they
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:47.480]   have their own space and their own way and that we believe them as themselves.
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.960]   I think they're orthogonal.
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:49.960]   I can't see word.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:50.960]   Good.
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:51.960]   You got to use that.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:52.960]   Don't ask me what it means.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:53.960]   I think.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:58.960]   Don't ask me what it means.
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:04.200]   I think that we like story because it's how we make sense of the world.
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:10.080]   Really the world is a horrific chaotic place with no sense rhyme or reason.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:13.760]   But we survive by making a story out of it.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:17.240]   And that's how we understand things as we tell a story about it.
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:23.920]   The authenticity, I mean, story or not, the authenticity is, yes, we love that.
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:28.120]   But I think that's not the same thing as why we tell stories.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:32.680]   Yeah, I guess it'd be better if the storytelling was done by somebody who's got authentic.
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:35.840]   Well, stories can be authentic and stories can also be propaganda.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.440]   Yeah, but I think he's a lion stories.
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.000]   I mean, I think a lot of the stories we tell fiction is.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:47.280]   Yeah, in fact, the most compelling stories are lies probably, you know, just looking
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.280]   to.
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:51.080]   I wrote a post about two years ago and used this in the Gutenberg book.
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:56.640]   There's a book called How History Gets Things Wrong, The Science of Our Addiction to Stories.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:03.240]   And it's an academic book, but it argues that, I mean, the author says, I like stories
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:08.880]   as much as the next person, but we make this presumption about how they turn out.
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:13.800]   And I think in the media age, we presume that everything had a beginning and an end and
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.080]   everything was neatly contained in the Gutenberg argument here, right?
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.040]   And so the story is myth.
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:23.720]   What's true or real life is I think what we now think of as a stream.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:24.960]   Yeah, but I would submit.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:25.960]   We don't want that.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:26.960]   Absolutely.
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.560]   That's more accurate, but we don't, I would submit.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.560]   We don't want that.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:31.800]   We want fairy tales.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:34.640]   We want myth.
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:38.120]   Streams are working pretty well.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:44.640]   If you had a choice on a YouTube video with a beginning, middle and end or one that was
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:49.000]   just slice of life, sometimes we'll watch a movie or TV show.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.560]   Manchester by the Sea was an example, which I thought was a beautiful movie, but doesn't
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.360]   end.
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:58.880]   It's a slice of, it's what we call a slice of life fiction, right?
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:02.840]   It's just a piece of life with that a beginning and a little end.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:03.840]   Lisa said, that's it?
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:06.920]   I said, well, yeah, it's just a slice of life.
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:08.360]   It's just, there's no end.
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.480]   She said, well, what happened?
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:12.280]   No, no, it's, it's just a slice.
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.240]   She says, no, but what happened?
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.240]   Right?
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.080]   We want a beginning, middle and end.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:18.080]   We prefer it.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.440]   We're going to blog husband.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:26.200]   I think it depends on who the person is or the subject of that slice of life.
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.200]   Nice that.
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:33.920]   All he did was slice of life stuff and just totally blew up with it even more than his
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.560]   TV show did.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.760]   That was pure authenticity, wasn't it?
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:42.960]   That was authenticity winning because he's going to the streets of New York with a camera
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:45.080]   and people looking at him like he's a damn fool.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.520]   I don't think he's long lived though as a good story.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:50.680]   I don't, I think Shakespeare is going to last longer than Casey Neistat.
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:52.400]   Yeah, stories are passed down.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:57.680]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, let's put this, let's put this in granite.
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:01.280]   I think Shakespeare is going to last longer than Casey Neistat.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:07.400]   I feel the part, I'm just, yeah, because authenticity only gets you so far.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:12.440]   Do you care what shakes, if Shakespeare was an authentic guy, do you care?
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.960]   Oh, that Shakespeare, he was a hell of a guy.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.640]   No, the story survived.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:24.040]   The Shakespeare's, I care that Cervantes had an amazing life and used that life in his
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:25.040]   fiction.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:29.480]   Most people read Don Coyote have no idea what Cervantes life was like.
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:32.120]   Well, only because, but you'd realize that it's good.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:34.640]   The reason it's good is because he used to the good life.
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:40.320]   Well, okay, whatever it is, whatever fuel you use to feed your storytelling, that's
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.320]   nice.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:46.800]   That's why I say it's authenticity is orthogonal because it's nice, but it's not the same,
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:49.680]   it's not the same axis as storytelling.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:55.280]   Storytelling lives on and is as a long-term compelling value.
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.360]   And Casey Neistat, that's great.
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.360]   It's very authentic.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:05.080]   You like him, but, you know, no, no YouTube celebrity has, I mean, where's PewDiePie now,
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:06.080]   right?
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:09.560]   They don't last, we move on, don't we?
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:13.440]   Again, it depends on the person is.
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.880]   Yeah, PewDiePie is sort of forgotten, but Neistat is still doing his thing and still
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.920]   at all of the film festivals because of his name, recognition.
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.800]   He's on YouTube, though, right?
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:25.800]   He doesn't do YouTube anymore.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:26.800]   He's still on YouTube.
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:27.800]   He's still on YouTube.
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.520]   I just watched his latest show.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.520]   Oh, did you?
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:31.520]   Okay.
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.520]   I thought he'd slow down on YouTube.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.520]   Why?
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:34.520]   Why did you watch?
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:37.560]   Yeah, well, you're watching that stuff.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:42.200]   He's an interesting creator and I love the fact that he's someone that just-
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:43.200]   Oh, nice, Dad.
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:44.200]   I thought you were PewDiePie.
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.040]   No, what did you just watch?
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.040]   No.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:52.080]   See, I saw this video, which is him saying I miss being a YouTuber and I took that to
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.080]   me.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:55.880]   He doesn't do YouTube that much anymore, but I guess he does.
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:56.960]   Yeah, he's still going.
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:57.960]   I don't know.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.520]   Yeah, I mean, he got a million views on his list.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:04.000]   What happened to his whole big company and big studio and big, all everything?
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.400]   Is that still around?
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:10.160]   No, Beam, that was the last company I remember.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:15.200]   That was the little social network app and then there was another like a creator academy
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.320]   thing that he was working on in New York.
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:19.280]   Trust me, I'm not much about it.
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.280]   I'm not down.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.480]   Look, I'm not telling a story.
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:26.320]   I live on personality, right?
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:29.800]   And I'm nowhere near as successful as an I-step, but I mean, I'm not-
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:33.680]   I'm on that axis, absolutely, on the personality axis.
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:38.160]   But I think ultimately the stuff that really lives and lasts is storytelling and that's
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.160]   why-
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.160]   Right.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:49.200]   Well, I mean, you have to have a creator to tell a story, but I think the most successful
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:53.000]   storytellers, creators will be storytellers, I guess is what I'm saying.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.720]   I also think what part of what I do in the book, and I can't even give you a pre-order
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:00.800]   page yet to plug.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.000]   So wait till I get that, man.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.660]   I'm really gonna be bad.
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:06.520]   I talk about conversation over content.
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:12.520]   I think that media were in their early days truly conversational and that ended when
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.920]   it became mass and scale.
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:18.480]   And I think what the internet allows us to do is recapture that.
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.960]   And we're doing a rotten job of it.
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:21.560]   We're out of practice for 500 years.
[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:23.200]   We don't know how to do it as a society.
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:24.200]   But I think there's value in-
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:26.920]   But what we're doing right now, we're not really telling stories right now.
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:27.920]   No, we're telling-
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:28.920]   We're conversational.
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:29.920]   We're conversing.
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:30.920]   Yeah, and I think that has value.
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:31.920]   Oh yeah, I'm not saying-
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:32.920]   That's all a foggin' old to nothing.
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.260]   I'm not saying it doesn't have value.
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:41.100]   In fact, the problem with storytelling is you become passive consumers.
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:43.940]   You just sit back and listen to stories.
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:49.620]   And I think we do crave as human beings, we crave that kind of communication.
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:50.780]   So we definitely need that.
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:52.460]   But I think it's a different scale.
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:53.700]   Again, it's orthogonal.
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:28:00.740]   It doesn't mean that storytelling is not important or that creators and authenticity
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:01.740]   is-
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:04.740]   There are separate-
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:08.060]   There are right angles to one another.
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:10.420]   It's not either/or.
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:15.620]   And I actually wonder where we go with conversation.
[01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:19.180]   I mean, look at Facebook.
[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:20.980]   Look at most social media sites.
[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:26.300]   They become content sites, not communications sites.
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:27.420]   But we still have Discord, right?
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:29.860]   I really love our Discord.
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:33.060]   I love the conversations we have in there.
[01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:34.060]   So I don't know.
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:35.900]   I mean, I think we need that as humans.
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:36.900]   We need both.
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:37.900]   It's both.
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:39.900]   I mean, the Homer-
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:45.540]   To go back to you, would come in town and recite the story.
[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:49.220]   Yes, but then people would talk about it and would give them something to talk about.
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:50.220]   I got it.
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:51.340]   I got it.
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:56.900]   Stories, mass consumption.
[01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:58.460]   Communication is at a small scale.
[01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.220]   It's a personal scale, right?
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:01.220]   Yeah.
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:02.220]   I think so, yeah.
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:03.220]   I think the mistake-
[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:09.500]   I think Siva Vadianathan would argue that the mistake was thinking that connecting the
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.340]   whole world would work.
[01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:12.340]   That's not what we wanted.
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:14.620]   Well, that's not a question what we wanted or not.
[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:18.460]   We didn't have the norms and the structures and the guardrails to understand how to do
[01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:19.460]   it well.
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:21.220]   There was no definition of well.
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:22.220]   Right.
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:24.460]   But having said that, I love Mark conversations with you guys.
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:28.020]   I love the conversations I have on Twitter.
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:29.020]   I love a lot of conversations.
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:31.340]   I still have on Facebook.
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:33.580]   But you're right, Leo.
[01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:39.180]   You're either broadcasting or not.
[01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:42.180]   We talked when you were gone last week, by the way, all you hear of the concert was,
[01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:46.060]   and I'm glad you still have your hearing.
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:55.980]   We talked about a consent decree that expired last month that prevented studios from owning
[01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.060]   movie theaters.
[01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:58.060]   That's gone now.
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:00.940]   That's why we have so much streaming going on.
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:04.100]   And this was explained in the thread we talked about last week.
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:06.940]   And I thought about that more and more.
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:10.260]   The fact that NBC is rumored to be giving up at 10 o'clock hour.
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:16.860]   What I think we come to is an end of broadcast, writ large.
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:19.860]   And what we have now on social media is everybody's trying to be a broadcaster.
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:23.780]   Everybody's trying to broadcast everything they have to say to a lot of people.
[01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:25.620]   And because all we valued was scale.
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:27.140]   All we valued was huge.
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:32.140]   But if you go back before the steam powered press, sorry, guys, the average circulation
[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:36.860]   of a daily newspaper in America before the steam powered press, you want to guess how
[01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:38.860]   much 52,000.
[01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:39.860]   4,000.
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:43.820]   It was a sub stack newsletter.
[01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:44.820]   Yeah.
[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:45.820]   The average newspaper.
[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:46.820]   I think that's right.
[01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:47.820]   I think that's right.
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:48.820]   And scale changed everything.
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:49.820]   Yeah.
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:53.700]   In fact, that's kind of what we were talking about earlier with Matt.
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:58.900]   It's okay for Tumblr to be a tenth the size of Twitter, which is a tenth the size of Facebook.
[01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:00.020]   Yeah, which is great.
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:01.020]   It's okay.
[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:03.060]   In fact, we need a lot of small spaces.
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:07.060]   That's a better way to socialize.
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:08.020]   That's what we really want.
[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:13.500]   I think that's one of the reasons Discord rather is so cool that the Twit Discord is
[01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:14.500]   a small group.
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:21.260]   I mean, it's 3,000 give or take, but a relatively small group of people who know each other,
[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:23.700]   have a common interest and we hang out together.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:27.980]   It's human scale and it doesn't, but it doesn't scale well.
[01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:32.140]   I couldn't make this a 300 million person discord.
[01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:34.700]   No one would want to be in it.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:39.340]   Twitter in some ways was at its best when it was in the early days, right?
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:40.340]   Or was it?
[01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:43.620]   It depends on your ask.
[01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:48.380]   If you're asking a person is wanting to have community, they would say, yes, it was way
[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:49.780]   better back in the days.
[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:54.740]   So you make in a way, you make your own community by how you create your, you know, who you
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:56.620]   follow and stuff.
[01:31:56.620 --> 01:32:00.500]   So you can make a sub community within the Twitter.
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:01.500]   Right.
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:02.500]   That's I guess.
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:04.180]   And now they have this whole, what is it?
[01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:05.180]   Circles and.
[01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:06.180]   Yeah.
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:07.180]   I mean, I guess that's really the best thing about Twitter.
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:08.180]   Yeah.
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:10.580]   Get back to that aspect of it now.
[01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:14.660]   But again, if you ask a broadcaster, they're going to tell you, oh, Twitter's great.
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:17.620]   Now it's stuck in the beginning because nobody is there.
[01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:18.620]   Right.
[01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:21.740]   That was when I'm thinking about Tumblr is, oh, yeah, fine.
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:24.940]   I guess I'll post stuff there, but nobody will see it.
[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:25.940]   Right.
[01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:29.420]   There is a certain critical mass.
[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:34.700]   I look at our, our Mastinon instance, Twitter social, which I really like, but it's just
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:35.700]   not big enough.
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:40.700]   There's not enough people in it for conversations to really get started.
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:41.700]   We're just right in the edge.
[01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:42.700]   Right.
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:44.900]   This is, it's trying to mimic Twitter and it can't be Twitter.
[01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:46.540]   So it needs to be something else.
[01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:47.540]   Yeah.
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:48.540]   I think that's, that's all.
[01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:53.980]   And the same thing when I was writing last week about, about the TV stuff, I looked back
[01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:56.620]   at VidCon and a picture I had from 2009.
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:59.700]   I don't know what was it, 17, 18.
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:04.940]   And the ads from YouTube were all trying to create series because TV, YouTube wanted
[01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:05.940]   to be TV.
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:07.420]   No, YouTube should be YouTube.
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:08.420]   Right.
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:13.660]   Marshall McLuhan says that every medium is the content of every medium is the medium
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:16.060]   that came before.
[01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:19.980]   And so they first try to be what was before before they invent what they are.
[01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:21.540]   Right.
[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:23.220]   And ultimately you have to find your voice.
[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:27.460]   You have to find every medium has to find its unique style and voice.
[01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:31.380]   And that's why, you know, you don't post the same thing on Facebook or you shouldn't post
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:32.380]   the same thing on Facebook.
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:33.820]   You post on Instagram, you post on Twitter.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:34.820]   Right.
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:35.820]   Different audiences.
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:36.820]   It's different.
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:37.820]   Each one has to find some.
[01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:41.740]   What Snap did so well with media companies was they, they said you cannot repurpose.
[01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:42.820]   You cannot just take your stuff.
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:45.060]   You've got to be doing what's native to Snap.
[01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:46.060]   Yeah.
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:48.500]   Which was smart while it lasted.
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:49.500]   Yeah.
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:50.500]   Okay.
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:53.380]   Well, we solved that problem.
[01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:54.380]   Let's move.
[01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:56.620]   I don't know what we're doing.
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:58.700]   It's also made me think about though.
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:33:59.700]   Yeah.
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:03.380]   The whole discussion we had several weeks ago about Instagram and photographers.
[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:04.380]   Yeah.
[01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:06.900]   And just sort of be in more video centric.
[01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:07.900]   Right.
[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:11.860]   You've seen the rebirth, if you will, of Vero.
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:13.380]   Have you gone into Vero?
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:14.380]   V-E-R-O.
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:17.620]   Yes, sir.
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:23.900]   This is a social media platform and mobile app for photographers.
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:24.900]   Yes, sir.
[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:26.060]   Oh, you know.
[01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:27.060]   So we.
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:30.460]   I was looking at VSCO, which was the old school Vero.
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:31.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:34.060]   I started, I did Vero for a week.
[01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:35.860]   I remember Vero.
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:37.340]   Yeah, I did it for a week.
[01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:38.340]   Yeah.
[01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:39.340]   But did you download Vero to Vero?
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:40.340]   Oh, no.
[01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:41.340]   What's new with 2.0?
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:42.340]   I don't know.
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:43.340]   Voice and video calls.
[01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:45.340]   Okay, I rest my case.
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:47.740]   Everybody does what everybody does.
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:49.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:53.860]   Well, everyone was saying that, all right, I'm done with Instagram because it's not promoting
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:54.860]   my images.
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:35:00.540]   And well, actually they were saying I'm not getting any engagement.
[01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:03.060]   There's no community inside of Instagram anymore.
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:05.940]   What they were really saying is it's not promoting my images.
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:09.700]   So they're going over to the likes of Vero.
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:14.260]   And I'm wondering if people are going to just sort of bail out on it again because this
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:15.780]   isn't Vero's first run.
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:16.780]   Yeah, look at this.
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:18.020]   This is a pivot.
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:23.420]   This is Vero trying to save itself by trying everything.
[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:26.940]   So there is no orthogonality.
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:28.300]   You collect bookmarks.
[01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:29.300]   Everybody's doing what everybody else is doing.
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:30.300]   You do voice and video calls.
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:31.740]   We know all the same direction.
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:32.740]   You do music.
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:33.740]   You do both links.
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:35.820]   You do both links to articles in there.
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:37.380]   Yeah, you do.
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:39.580]   Well, beyond features of culture and sport creators.
[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:40.580]   You post your photos.
[01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:45.300]   Okay, I can tell you right now that's a failure instantly because what is it?
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:46.540]   Is it a music playing app?
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:47.820]   Is it a bookmark app?
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:49.140]   Is it a photo app?
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:50.140]   Is it a video?
[01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:52.540]   Whatever you want it to be Leo will be everything you want to be.
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:53.540]   Just love us.
[01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:54.540]   That's a failure.
[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:58.020]   Don't you think that's that's not going to go anywhere because that's this is total
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:35:59.020]   desperation.
[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:00.020]   Yeah.
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:01.020]   Yeah.
[01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:02.020]   Total desperation.
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:03.020]   Pick something.
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:06.100]   I'm curious to see what's going to happen with it.
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:10.260]   I still have my account in there and I'll post to it here and there.
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:16.500]   But I don't use these platforms for the same reason that other photographers use it.
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:18.860]   Did you ever use a VSCO?
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:20.460]   Did you ever use VSCO?
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:22.700]   I would use the editing tool in it.
[01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:24.940]   Well, this is why I like VSCO.
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:30.140]   So it is a very clean photo site with very nice built in editing tools.
[01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:33.780]   And I started posting there thinking this might be my Instagram replacement.
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:34.780]   But there's no one there.
[01:36:34.780 --> 01:36:35.780]   There's no one there.
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:38.780]   So there's also that.
[01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:42.740]   You know, if people don't know, if you're one in community, you still want you still
[01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:45.660]   going to want some people there.
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:51.100]   But if you're someone that's broadcasting like I tend to do, I definitely need someone
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:52.100]   there.
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:56.140]   If you're posting photos, well, I guess there's two reasons you could post photos.
[01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:57.300]   One is Facebook style.
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:58.940]   You want to show your family and friends.
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:03.220]   The other is Ant-Proit style, which is you want an audience.
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:05.260]   You want to show people what you're doing.
[01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:06.260]   Yep.
[01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:08.460]   You want to hold for it.
[01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:09.460]   Yeah.
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:11.340]   Whatever happened to 500 pixels?
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:12.940]   Is that still around?
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:13.940]   Still there.
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:18.020]   But I believe most of that crowd is turned towards Flickr because the community aspect
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:24.860]   of 500 PS tend to get a little bit tarnished with all of these snobbery back in the days.
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:26.420]   And now they have an NFT vault.
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:28.780]   So you know they're on their way.
[01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:31.180]   Yeah, it's sad.
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:34.060]   I think Flickr is kind of history.
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:35.060]   Don't you?
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:37.060]   Flickr is one of those that got ruined.
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:40.620]   But then they got bought by the wonderful folks at Smugmug.
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:43.060]   And log into my Flickr.
[01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:44.820]   I still use Flickr.
[01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:46.820]   We use it for the tech guy.
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:50.220]   We use it for our photo assignments, Chris Markworth.
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:51.380]   You know, we put photos up there.
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:55.860]   We have a tech, we have actually a pretty big tech guy group.
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:38:02.100]   I think there's, let me see, I think there's like 13,000 people in it.
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:05.300]   We have 13,926 members.
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:08.340]   So yeah, we're using it.
[01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:09.340]   But I don't feel like--
[01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:10.340]   You don't feel like--
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:11.340]   Yeah, I don't feel like this is on the--
[01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:16.100]   But I don't go there for community aspect actually.
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:23.900]   I'm using it more so for an easy way to share photos and an easy way to back up stuff.
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:29.660]   But if I want engagement and interaction, I'm going to Twitter and Instagram because
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:32.020]   that's where my audiences are.
[01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:38.140]   I recently had a photo on the Explore page on Flickr, which at one time was the thing,
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:39.140]   right?
[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:43.140]   You get a photo on the Explore page and you're going to get hundreds of thousands of views.
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:44.620]   I love that shot, man.
[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:45.620]   I know.
[01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:46.620]   I was very shocked.
[01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:47.620]   I love that one.
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:48.620]   Yeah.
[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:49.620]   So yeah, I was very honored.
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:50.620]   I got that on the Explore page.
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:52.420]   It didn't really-- nothing much happened.
[01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:54.580]   123 faves.
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:39:01.140]   So yeah, I think Flickr-- I mean, that's an indicator of Flickr is not exactly taken
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:02.140]   off either.
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:03.460]   I don't know.
[01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:12.220]   You know, I saw a thread a while back about this whole photographer's being pissed off.
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:16.580]   And the thread basically said, "Look, yeah, you want more engagement.
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:21.260]   But the problem is those other platforms that you're going to because you're thinking
[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:25.700]   you can get more engagement, they're not promoting to people outside of the world of
[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:28.780]   photography."
[01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:33.580]   So when you go to Vero, you're pretty much looking at just other photographers.
[01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:38.700]   And those other photographers who are not as engaging as the person is just in there
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:42.980]   to look at pretty pictures in general.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:45.660]   So it's all gotten much more fragmented.
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:48.940]   But I kind of agree with Matt.
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:49.940]   That's OK.
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:51.140]   Let a thousand flowers bloom.
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:52.140]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:53.540]   And we'll have our own individual.
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:56.260]   You know, you just have to find your community.
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:39:59.700]   So where your crowd is going, your audiences.
[01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:00.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:03.580]   Hey, an amazing story.
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:06.300]   Just in the New York Times, people are going crazy over it.
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:09.460]   Do you know the Patagonia label?
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:11.700]   This just went up, yeah.
[01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:12.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:20.820]   Patagonia is probably one of the best-selling outdoors clothing company they sell.
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:26.020]   You've seen the-- it's all the startup guys were Patagonia, Puffy Jackets, and Patagonia
[01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:27.020]   fleeces, right?
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:30.580]   If you go to Allen and Co., it's all Patagonia all the time.
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:32.260]   Very successful company.
[01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:39.060]   The founder who's now 83, he was, you know, just some guy who really liked mountain climbing,
[01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:47.460]   who started in 1973, von Schoenauer, has announced they're going to give the entire
[01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:50.540]   company away effective immediately.
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:54.860]   A hundred percent of Patagonia's earnings will not be reinvested, but will be distributed
[01:40:54.860 --> 01:41:00.980]   to the holdfast collective, which will use them to help fight the environmental crisis.
[01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:05.780]   One hundred percent of profits from now on, which is roughly a hundred million dollars
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:06.780]   a year.
[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:09.060]   Paul Newman got mad.
[01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:10.620]   Isn't that great?
[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:11.860]   Yeah, it is.
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:19.180]   You know, if you're an outdoorsman, here he is in his youth just before he started Patagonia.
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:23.700]   Ready to climb some rock, clearly.
[01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:30.100]   You know, and you want to sell outdoor goods, maybe, yeah, maybe donate.
[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:35.860]   For a long time, they donated a portion of the proceeds now donating 100 percent to ending
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:37.780]   the climate catastrophe.
[01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:40.820]   They're a down in Ventura, California.
[01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:41.820]   Nice story.
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:46.260]   This is from outside magazine.
[01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:48.700]   Let's take a little break.
[01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:51.460]   I kind of miss Stacy.
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:52.460]   Nobody has slapped me around.
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:53.460]   Nobody has slapped me around.
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:54.460]   Nobody has slapped me around.
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:55.460]   Oh, okay.
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:58.460]   Well, if you want to be slapped around, that's not going to do this.
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:41:59.460]   Okay.
[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:00.460]   All right.
[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:01.460]   I appreciate it.
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:06.380]   It's called Madam Matt and Madam Jeff and we're, yeah.
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:11.140]   Our show today brought to you by CashFly, really quite literally brought to you by CashFly.
[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:16.380]   CashFly is amazing and I know because I've been using them practically since Twitch started.
[01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:20.380]   That's when you download a podcast in your podcast client or you go to our website and
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:25.300]   download it, you're downloading it from our CDN, our content delivery network.
[01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:26.820]   That's CashFly.
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:31.340]   When we first started, we had a webpage you download from the webpage that failed immediately.
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:36.060]   We tried a whole bunch of different ways to distribute content, including BitTorrent.
[01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:41.660]   That's when Matt Levine, the founder of CashFly came and said, "Leo, Leo, Leo."
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:44.900]   We can fix this and they have ever since.
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:51.420]   In fact, when we started a video, I was really worried, you know, guys, we're going to go,
[01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:57.220]   you know, basically an order of 10 more size downloads and they said, "No problem.
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:43:01.100]   We do more than, I think we do two petabytes a month through CashFly."
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:02.100]   It's amazing.
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:08.420]   Now, CashFly has expanded into streaming video, ultra low latency video streaming.
[01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:13.900]   You can go live in hours, not days with sub one second latency.
[01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:18.180]   You can reach that ditch, that unreliable web RTC solution for their WebSocket Live video
[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:19.180]   workflow.
[01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:24.060]   Here's the best part, it'll scale to more than a million users without a hiccup.
[01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:27.900]   One of the reasons CashFly is so great is they have 50 points of presence, 50 servers
[01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:29.780]   all around the globe.
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:35.060]   Your content will be closer to your customers, which outperforms local CDNs and really makes
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:36.060]   a big difference.
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:39.820]   When you're listening to our show in, for instance, the Middle East, you're getting it
[01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:44.660]   from a server in the Middle East or South America or Europe or Canada and so forth and
[01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:45.820]   so on.
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:49.780]   You can also reduce your bandwidth, take a load off your origin servers, reduce your
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:57.740]   S3 bills with CashFly's storage optimization system, make your cash hit ratio 100% because
[01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:00.620]   your stuff lives on CashFly.
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:04.820]   They also have fully managed CDN solutions because you don't have time to run your CDN
[01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:10.660]   but with CashFly's elite managed packages, you'll get VIP treatment and 24/7 support
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:13.540]   with response times less than an hour.
[01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:14.940]   So what do you get with CashFly?
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:16.380]   What do we get with CashFly?
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:21.580]   Ultra-low latency video streaming that delivers video to more than a million concurrent users.
[01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:25.940]   Lightning fast gaming delivers downloads faster with zero lag glitches or outages, mobile
[01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:30.900]   content optimization that offers automatic and simple image optimization.
[01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:35.260]   After your site loads faster on any device, multiple CDNs for redundancy and failover
[01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:39.980]   intelligently balancing your traffic across multiple providers which gives you the shortest
[01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:42.900]   routes and mitigates against performance glitches.
[01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:43.900]   It works so well.
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:49.980]   They've had 100% availability in the past 12 months, 10 times faster than traditional
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:57.660]   methods on six continents, 30% faster than other major CDNs with a 98% cash hit ratio
[01:44:57.660 --> 01:44:59.220]   that's CashFly.
[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:05.620]   24/7/365 priority support too so you'll always have them there for you when you need them.

[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:10.260]   You've heard me say at the beginning of almost every show.
[01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:17.700]   Bandwidth for this week and Google is brought to you by CashFly at CACHEFLY.com.
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:19.620]   Thank you, CashFly.
[01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:20.620]   Thank you.
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:21.620]   Thank you.
[01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:28.500]   Thank you to Mr. Jason Howell who took over last minute last week.
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:37.820]   When I ran the hell out of here to go see Joan Jett, poison, motley crew and Def Leppard.
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:38.820]   All bands.
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:39.820]   Young anymore.
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:41.820]   I had no idea.
[01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:47.820]   I didn't know anything about these bands but Lisa loved them and she danced nonstop for
[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:48.820]   six hours.
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:51.460]   Got 27,000 steps.
[01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:52.460]   Wow.
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:53.460]   That show.
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:55.540]   Mostly just boing, boing, boing.
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:56.940]   It was really fun.
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:57.940]   It was really fun.
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:45:58.940]   Thank you.
[01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:00.620]   I hope it went well without me.
[01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:01.940]   How long did it go?
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:02.940]   Six hours.
[01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:03.940]   Geez.
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:05.940]   Four bands.
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:12.660]   Who started at about 4.30 in the afternoon and it ended about 11.
[01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:14.540]   Wow.
[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:16.540]   That was a pooped puppy, Leo.
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:19.020]   Oh, I just sat there and nodded off.
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:21.260]   I just went, "Let me know when Leppard's..."
[01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:25.700]   I had fun.
[01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:31.740]   What else should we talk about today?
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:35.140]   I thought this was kind of interesting when Queen Elizabeth passed.
[01:46:35.140 --> 01:46:41.660]   Traditionally, London Bridge is down, the code word.
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:48.180]   The plans call for the BBC, channels one, two and four, to interrupt all programming,
[01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:54.020]   briefly shift to a display of the network's famous logo and then broadcasting a unified
[01:46:54.020 --> 01:46:59.740]   message saying the Queen has passed quietly and so forth, so on.
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:01.940]   Then we actually saw it on TV.
[01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:07.700]   They put a poster up on the palace gates and all that.
[01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:10.340]   Not this year.
[01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:17.020]   The death of the Queen preceded the BBC announcement by several minutes thanks to the Twitter
[01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:22.020]   account of the royal family.
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:23.100]   They were so anxious.
[01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:27.580]   They tweeted it and then the BBC got to do its thing.
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:30.580]   I don't know if it's a breach of protocol, but it just shows you.
[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:35.020]   The BBC had already gone to a black banner on top.
[01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:42.660]   No, according to courts, according to courts, the news of the death broke first on social
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:46.780]   media with a poist from the Twitter account and then two minutes.
[01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:47.820]   No, no, no, I know that.
[01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:52.420]   But part of this thing is the BBC has a red logo banner on top.
[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:56.900]   Oh, before the death was announced, they switched to black because the doctors are
[01:47:56.900 --> 01:47:57.900]   very concerned.
[01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:01.500]   Oh, everybody knew it was imminent.
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:02.500]   OK.
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:04.300]   You know what that said?
[01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:05.300]   Is it OK?
[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:07.740]   Why is it a problem that?
[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:08.740]   No, no, no.
[01:48:08.740 --> 01:48:09.740]   It's a sign of the times.
[01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:10.740]   It's just a sign of the times.
[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:11.740]   It's not a problem.
[01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:12.900]   It's a sign of the times.
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:15.580]   You tweet it before you be bit.
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:16.580]   Right.
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:18.660]   So title.
[01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:21.940]   They are orthogonal orthogonal.
[01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:22.940]   They might be orthogonal.
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:23.940]   Yeah.
[01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:29.060]   I mean, yeah, it's kind of interesting, isn't it?
[01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:33.580]   I mean, this obviously was with the cooperation of the BBC and the Royal Family and everybody.
[01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:36.700]   This is probably was in the right up in London Bridge.
[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:41.020]   We haven't seen the secret plans, but I just think it's fascinating that they decided,
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:45.580]   you know, the first announcement shouldn't be a placard on the gates of the palace.
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:49.220]   Shouldn't be on the-- that was the old-- that was the way they did it for hundreds of years,
[01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:50.220]   right?
[01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:51.220]   And that's television.
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:53.140]   Oh, we're going to do it on radio probably first.
[01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:56.940]   Oh, we'll do it on radio first and now it's it's at the country.
[01:48:56.940 --> 01:48:57.940]   Now it's on Twitter.
[01:48:57.940 --> 01:48:58.940]   It's not even a British--
[01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:01.620]   It's not even a British to her Royal Highness.
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:04.580]   I'm not sure the proper way to address the Queen.
[01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:05.580]   Okay, you're American.
[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:07.340]   You don't need to worry about it.
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:13.740]   But was it wasn't that a credit to her as she was a bit more on the technological advancements
[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:14.740]   and things over time?
[01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:15.740]   I know.
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:16.740]   She didn't even have a smartphone.
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:17.740]   No, but I mean--
[01:49:17.740 --> 01:49:19.740]   So far as we wanted her out.
[01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:23.660]   No, I mean far as being someone that linked into the available tech.
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:26.620]   I want to say Mr. Ian Thompson wrote something up.
[01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:27.620]   Oh, did he?
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:28.620]   He's telling something.
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:29.620]   Oh, did he?
[01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:30.620]   Oh, interesting.
[01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:37.700]   I think it's-- you know, it's a-- they call it the firm, you know, the family business.
[01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:41.220]   And I think the family business is more savvy, absolutely.
[01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:43.300]   Or rather younger.
[01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:44.300]   Yeah.
[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:45.300]   Yeah.
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:50.900]   You know, well, and also just kind of more cognizant of what's going on.
[01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:52.100]   You know, I'll have to ask Ian.
[01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:57.980]   You know, it's funny because there are a lot of people who are not royalists, who are
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:01.980]   not, you know, saying, why are we making such a big deal about this?
[01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:07.180]   But Ian is very much-- as long as I've known him, he's always kind of a real soft spot
[01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:09.620]   for Queen Elizabeth.
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:11.780]   So, yeah.
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:12.900]   I'll look at the article.
[01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:13.900]   I didn't see it.
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:14.900]   I missed it.
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:18.860]   how did the story of next to the rundown end up in there. What's the connection?
[01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:21.800]   I don't know. I just put it there.
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:26.360]   You know what? Here's the connection. We talk a lot about supply chain, right?
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:34.740]   Okay. And I didn't know this, but this is has a lot to do with supply chain. Before COVID,
[01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:42.500]   if you wanted to buy an entire container, let's say you have a hundred thousand cupidolls,
[01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:48.740]   you want to ship from Shanghai to San Francisco, right before COVID, that would have cost you
[01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:57.100]   about $1,500. Not bad. You get those QP dolls in. That's one of the reasons Chinese guys are
[01:50:57.100 --> 01:51:07.460]   cheap, right? But as soon as COVID hit, that price skyrocketed to $20,000 by August 2021.
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:12.060]   So this is really a direct contributor to supply chain. You know, we talk a lot about
[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:16.140]   other non-attraction. There's, you know, you can't get enough containerships in the ports,
[01:51:16.140 --> 01:51:21.860]   et cetera, et cetera. It's simply cost. No, that's not inflation going for $1,500 to
[01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:28.500]   $20,000 a year. Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Absolutely. It's back down. By the way, it's right now.
[01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:30.460]   It's about $6,000, but still enough.
[01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:38.500]   That's going to happen any day now. What's that? Real strike. Yes. Yes. That'll be interesting.
[01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:44.780]   I am old enough to remember, you probably are too, Jeff, when who was it said there shall
[01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:50.580]   be no? Was it Johnson? Was it Eisenhower? Maybe Eisenhower who said the fans in said,
[01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:59.460]   no, no, no, no railroad strike. The nation runs on the railroads. And Biden kind of hinted
[01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:05.020]   at that when he said, no, no, it's too important to allow a strike. Especially before the mid-term.
[01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:13.180]   Yeah. I don't know. But would we notice? That's what I was thinking to. Well, the supply chain
[01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:18.700]   would. Yeah. The trucks, trucks don't carry so much. Right. Yes. It could do rail critical
[01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:23.820]   deliveries of chlorine to wastewater plants. See, it's weird, the things that are delivered
[01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:30.700]   by train. Oh, yeah. Right. Maybe because it's a dangerous chemical. You can't do that in
[01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:37.820]   truck us. I don't know. Yeah. Anyway, I thought that no, that's why I put that in there because
[01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:41.420]   I thought, well, that's really interesting. Well, it got to the point where towards the end of
[01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:45.820]   the COVID where Walmart was charting the chartering their own vessels just to get enough goods
[01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:51.260]   into their stores. Well, speaking of inflation. But then, wait a minute, there's a sequel to this
[01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:58.860]   because then as a result, they had too many goods in the stores. So, I mean, it's just it's just
[01:52:58.860 --> 01:53:05.500]   difficult to handle, I guess these. The party is over says Jonathan Roach,
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:13.660]   container shipping analyst at London based Braemar. Meanwhile, Amazon, which I think has had a huge
[01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:19.260]   impact on wages in America, thus inflation, but for good cause to get people's wages up higher
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:24.860]   because they paid over $15 an hour. They're now going to spend more on wages so they can hold
[01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:28.860]   on the staff and deliver through the holidays. Yeah. And so that's kind of a
[01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:35.020]   that's fine and dandy, but you still can't be ridiculous with your employment practices.
[01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:40.220]   And you know, they got not in trouble with all of the bathroom policies and stuff like that.
[01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:44.780]   I think they're making changes there too. Yeah. Yeah. I forget what I saw. I saw something about
[01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:53.100]   that Starbucks has an interesting angle on anti unionization. They offer benefits to
[01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:57.980]   employees who have not joined the union like a new student loan repayment tool and a savings
[01:53:57.980 --> 01:54:04.540]   account program. Don't join the union. Well, take care of you join the union. I'll say is illegal.
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:11.660]   Yeah, they were which state is it that legal in? They're doing it must be legal everywhere.
[01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:18.220]   I don't know. I mean, you could just say no, no. We figured the union guys, they got their own
[01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:23.900]   representation. So we're going to take care of the people who want any unions. I can't say too
[01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:28.940]   much terrible about Starbucks. I'm not a I don't go there to get coffee or anything,
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:33.580]   but hard head works for them and they take care of them. Yeah, because they don't want them to
[01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:39.420]   vote for a union. You bet. He's been totally fine between going to college and transferring
[01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:44.620]   up there without a hitch. I'm not against that. I think the threat of the union, if it makes an
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:50.140]   employer behave better, that's fine too. Right? Yeah, good. Right? Good. Yeah.
[01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:59.660]   Our son is in the grocery workers union. Local, late golden state, baby. Interesting. Yeah.
[01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:03.900]   He was a little surprised because they ding him 60 bucks a month.
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:12.140]   Hey, that's the price you pay. I've been the professional services,
[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:15.340]   commerce, whatever it's called as a professor. Are you in a union? Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[01:55:15.340 --> 01:55:21.340]   I'm a sag afterman myself. Of course, that's right. And I do pay. I pay at least that much
[01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:26.140]   in dues. I have a couple of hundred. What is it? I don't remember, but it's like maybe 700 a year.
[01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:30.300]   And boy, do I get a lot from that.
[01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:43.580]   Google. Oh, we got a Google story. Not a good one for the goog. But for that, we have to go back to
[01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:45.260]   urge.
[01:55:45.260 --> 01:55:56.460]   Why did you take parts of the letters out? Paul Therod said they took exactly enough out so that
[01:55:56.460 --> 01:56:05.340]   you can still read it, but no more, right? No excess. Very weird. Google has lost its appeal
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:13.740]   over illegal Android bundling. The fine, which was originally 4.3 billion euros,
[01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:21.180]   was slightly reduced, but the EU general court did largely confirm the ruling.
[01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:28.060]   The company imposed unlawful restrictions on Android phone manufacturers in order to promote
[01:56:28.060 --> 01:56:35.980]   its search engine on mobile devices. This is big 4.1 billion euros. That's a lot of money.
[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:42.780]   That's no slap on the wrist. Yep. The ruling by the general court today upheld the vast majority
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:50.060]   of the commission's original charges. The court did find, this is from the urge, that the Google's
[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:54.700]   revenue sharing schemes with manufacturers did not constitute an abuse of Google's market power.
[01:56:55.340 --> 01:57:03.020]   So adjusted the fine by 5% to 4.1 billion euros. I think it's the largest fine ever.
[01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:11.580]   Google has to wait two months and 10 days before it can appeal once more. So it can appeal to the
[01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:17.580]   highest court. There's one more appeal left, the court of justice. In the statement, Google said,
[01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:25.420]   "We're disappointed that the court did not know the decision at full. Android has created more
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:29.500]   choice for everyone, not less." Which is true, actually.
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:33.500]   And supports thousands of successful businesses in Europe and around the world.
[01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:40.540]   I think Google's getting the bad interest. This is like EU and Microsoft over all over again.
[01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:48.460]   And the difference is Android is open source. Yeah, so the deal was if you want to sell the
[01:57:48.460 --> 01:57:56.620]   Google version of Android, not AOSO, AOSP, you had to agree not to sell phones. If you want your
[01:57:56.620 --> 01:58:04.220]   phones for your official Google for your high end phones, you have to agree not to sell your low
[01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:09.420]   end phones with the open source AOSP. And... It makes sense from a branding perspective for
[01:58:09.420 --> 01:58:13.660]   Google is, am I getting a good Android phone or a bad Android phone from this company?
[01:58:13.660 --> 01:58:18.380]   Right. But you also have to install Google search and Chrome alongside the Google phone.
[01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:21.980]   Which also makes sense for consumers because I got a Google phone. Where's Google?
[01:58:21.980 --> 01:58:24.620]   Yeah. Yeah, I mean...
[01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:29.420]   They just want to go after them and they have.
[01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:31.820]   Yeah, I don't know where I stand on this. I mean,
[01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:35.820]   it isn't like there's a whole bunch of other choices.
[01:58:37.100 --> 01:58:39.180]   Right. Mr. Jarvis, if... Yes, sir.
[01:58:39.180 --> 01:58:44.780]   You walk up to someone on the street or what have you just, you know, the average person and
[01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:48.380]   ask them about their Android phone. Are they going to call it a Google phone or are they just
[01:58:48.380 --> 01:58:50.540]   going to call it? Oh, it's a Samsung. Right.
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:55.340]   Do they even... Oh, interesting. Get that this is... I never hear them say a Google phone. I hear
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:59.660]   them say a Samsung phone or an Android phone. I hear people say Android. But I don't hear Google.
[01:58:59.660 --> 01:59:05.340]   Yeah, I never hear Google throwing in the conversation. It's always a droid. I even hear that.
[01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:12.540]   It's a droid. Yes. Or I hear them mention something about Samsung as in as if they were in control of it.
[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:14.780]   So that's what I was like, I don't even know if that matters.
[01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:22.700]   They're going bonkers for Mr. Beast in New Jersey. Everybody wants a Beast burger.
[01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:30.540]   Mr. Beast, who is a YouTube phenom by, I think chiefly by giving away millions of dollars, right?
[01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:36.300]   Here he is at the mall where the Mr. Beast burger is... It's the first actual store because Mr.
[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:41.260]   Beast is a... What do you call those? Pop-post kitchen. Yeah, ghost kitchen. Yeah, they're not...
[01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:47.420]   So people waited in line for as much as 10 hours to get a Mr. Beast Smash burger.
[01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:53.900]   Boy, that is YouTube celebrity. Good. That is mind-boggling.
[01:59:55.580 --> 02:00:01.980]   Not nearly as good, I think, as a nice Ojou French dip sandwich made by Salt Hank.
[02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:04.940]   I'm just saying... Come on, make that happen, Salt Hank. Come on.
[02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:13.100]   Set up that store. YouTube's teaming up with Shake Shack for some new menu items.
[02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:16.940]   This is from the YouTube series, The Hot Ones. Isn't that the guys where they sit around and
[02:00:16.940 --> 02:00:21.980]   interview people and make them eat hot sauce? Yep. They get some of the biggest names. I can't
[02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:27.180]   believe... You know, if I had known that the secret to getting great interviews was to torture your
[02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:34.620]   subject, I would have done an electric chair in here a long time ago. We... Electric chair?
[02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:39.740]   It just happened a little bit. No, that's not the answer I was looking for. Make them jump.
[02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:46.060]   Put Elon in there. They get the biggest celebrities to eat their hot, hot, hot wings.
[02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:51.420]   Anyway, that show is still pretty good, sir. Yeah, because people are laughing at these
[02:00:51.420 --> 02:00:56.700]   celebrities because they're in pain. That's what TV was invented for, was to laugh at it and not be
[02:00:56.700 --> 02:01:02.140]   seen doing it. And some of those folks, they let go. You know, some of the celebrities are eating
[02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:08.140]   really hot food. Is that it? Here's Margot Robbie stripping down so she can eat some hot sauce.
[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:14.540]   That's not bad for ratings. People watch that pretty regularly here in the house. So,
[02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:18.540]   yeah, I know. I just wish I'd thought of this sooner.
[02:01:18.540 --> 02:01:26.140]   Well, you should honestly... If you had told me, oh, yeah, just you could interview celebrities as
[02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:33.260]   long as you hurt them, they love it. I don't get it. Where did I go wrong?
[02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:39.100]   Is that I just think... No, no, that's Margot Robbie. It's a world famous movie star.
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:42.140]   Margot Robbie. It was definitely in pain. It looks like her.
[02:01:42.940 --> 02:01:44.940]   [chuckles]
[02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:51.980]   I'm going to put in a little small, not a lethal electric chair, just a little make you jump
[02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:56.380]   electric chair. Just a little zap. Yeah. Well, it's what Stacy wants to do to you.
[02:01:56.380 --> 02:02:02.460]   Hey, maybe I should just do that. Yeah. I should just do that. Anyway,
[02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:09.900]   now I'm just jealous because now Shake Shack has... That's brand new.
[02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:18.060]   Hot ones, four menu items. So, you can hurt yourself. Shake Shack hot ones.
[02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:21.100]   Can you handle the heat?
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:29.020]   I swear to God, if you just told me that I had to hurt people, I would have, you know,
[02:02:29.020 --> 02:02:31.500]   I would have done something about it. I could have done that.
[02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:35.980]   Imagine what you could have done with the Vorac, the torture.
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:40.780]   People would have loved that. Yeah, exactly. Love that.
[02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:46.220]   You know, it's just impossible these days to get into fashion week parties
[02:02:46.220 --> 02:02:53.500]   because of Tiktakers. They just crowding the whole place. I hate it.
[02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:57.500]   It's all various story where they're going on about, "Why is this so crowded? It took me
[02:02:57.500 --> 02:03:02.060]   two hours to try to get in. Isn't there a mistake being made? I'm on the list."
[02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:08.780]   But the truth is what's really happening, and I thought Stacy was here,
[02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:16.780]   we were talking fashion. That's why I put these in here, was that Vogue is not the
[02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:22.060]   determiner of style anymore. Tiktakers. The people are the determiner of style now,
[02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:26.540]   which I think is way cool, but boy did the old people hit it. He said Vogue then through a
[02:03:27.180 --> 02:03:32.620]   whole event to try to be cooler than cool and make downtown on the meat market,
[02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:38.940]   meatpacking district in New York, they're all trying to be Tiktok cool now
[02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:43.020]   because they've lost their cool to Tiktok. Isn't that amazing? Got to embrace it.
[02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:46.060]   Yeah, and I can't get too unhappy about it.
[02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:51.900]   Hey, speaking of menus, Chipotle, guess who added this story?
[02:03:54.060 --> 02:04:01.740]   Chipotle has added a new dish inspired by Tiktok. Oh, that's the wrong link.
[02:04:01.740 --> 02:04:06.380]   Yeah, you gave me the wrong link. This is Shaq Shuka. I guarantee you, Chipotle is not selling
[02:04:06.380 --> 02:04:09.820]   Shaq Shuka. Sorry about that.
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:14.780]   Judge allows McFlurry Machine Repair lawsuit to proceed.
[02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:18.460]   This is a great Dr. O'Kaws.
[02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:24.700]   Kitch KYTCH was a company that reverse engineered the McFlurry Machine
[02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:31.420]   so that they could be easier to maintain and break down less. The company that makes the McFlurry
[02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:37.100]   Machine, Taylor, has been engaged in a long running legal dispute about whether Taylor could
[02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:41.500]   prevent Kitch devices. It's not the whole machine. It's just a device you put on the machine
[02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:47.500]   to keep it from breaking. Could be used. The conspiracy theory is Taylor makes a lot of money
[02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:51.980]   on these repairs, but if you've ever tried to get a McFlurry, you know that the machines are broken
[02:04:51.980 --> 02:04:57.420]   a lot. Before Kitch KYTCH came along, Taylor had a repair monopoly on the McFlurry Machine.
[02:04:57.420 --> 02:05:02.620]   If you didn't clean it just right, the machine had shut down an old--
[02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:03.180]   An old Taylor--
[02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:05.900]   A certified Taylor technician could get going again.
[02:05:05.900 --> 02:05:12.700]   So Kitch figured out how to create a device that allows McDonald franchise owners to do
[02:05:12.700 --> 02:05:16.620]   basic repairs on the machine and get them running. Taylor didn't like that,
[02:05:16.620 --> 02:05:19.100]   saying, "Well, you could hurt yourself."
[02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:31.660]   Ironically, it was Kitch that claimed Taylor stole Kitch's trade secrets because Taylor began
[02:05:31.660 --> 02:05:39.260]   selling a device very similar. So the court granted a restraining order against Taylor.
[02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:47.980]   Then Kitch went further filed a complaint, a first amend complaint, whatever that is. Taylor
[02:05:47.980 --> 02:05:54.940]   filed a demurrer, and then the FISTI cuffs began. In the court document filed a couple of weeks
[02:05:54.940 --> 02:06:01.100]   ago, a judge allowed Kitch's restraining order to proceed. Kitch alleged 10 different claims against
[02:06:01.100 --> 02:06:06.220]   Taylor, including that it had falsely advertised his product and engaged it on fair competition.
[02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:11.180]   So the shoes on the other foot now, Kitch has the upper hand. The judge agreed with Kitch on seven
[02:06:11.180 --> 02:06:18.860]   counts. Which is all good for the repair movement. Yeah. Right to repair.
[02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:26.220]   A story I didn't put in the rundown, or I just actually just did, which I didn't know. John Deere
[02:06:26.220 --> 02:06:30.220]   is also at the center of all this because they put out these tractors and then the farmers can't
[02:06:30.220 --> 02:06:35.900]   repair the McFlurry Machine. Same thing. So they, 10% of their revenue by 2030
[02:06:35.900 --> 02:06:43.180]   come from software fees. And the margin on those software fees, I want to ask for this 85% versus
[02:06:43.180 --> 02:06:50.140]   25% for equipment sales. So they're not going to be let loose of locking down your tractor
[02:06:50.140 --> 02:07:00.220]   or your softie machine. I like your stories this week, Jeff. Here's from ION design at AIGA.org.
[02:07:00.220 --> 02:07:06.700]   We spoke with the last person standing in the floppy disk business. There is somebody still
[02:07:06.700 --> 02:07:15.100]   selling floppy disks. His name is Tom Perski. He's the founder of floppy disk.com, a US company
[02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:20.780]   that sells and recycles floppy disks. They will also, by the way, transfer your data off of a floppy
[02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:28.940]   disk if you need that. Because you have no means to do that. Yeah. Right. Here he is with his little
[02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:34.620]   floppy disk factory. Wild. We actually buys them. He buys them very sourcing because they've stopped
[02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:39.260]   selling and making them. So it's a diminishing resource that he has. Yeah.
[02:07:39.260 --> 02:07:48.620]   He was in these. Yeah. He says 20 years ago I was actually in the floppy disk duplication business.
[02:07:48.620 --> 02:07:56.300]   Not in a million years that I think I would ever sell blank floppy disks. Duplicating disks in the
[02:07:56.300 --> 02:08:01.340]   1980s and early 1990s was as good as printing money. It was unbelievably profitable.
[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:11.900]   Who knew? Again, hot sauce to celebrities or duplicating disks. My paths were many, but I failed
[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:17.180]   in every case to follow them. He was a tax lawyer in Washington, D.C.
[02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:24.540]   Left his practice with Price Waterhouse, moved to California's turn to a floppy disk duplication.
[02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:29.100]   And there they are. There's the duplication machines. They're kind of radish for the
[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:38.700]   wearer. They are getting all ratty. So AIGAS. So where does this focus on floppy disks come from?
[02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:46.220]   Why not work with another medium? Well, anyway, it's just like the last,
[02:08:46.220 --> 02:08:52.140]   the story is about the last typewriter repairman. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, and there are
[02:08:52.140 --> 02:08:58.940]   probably places with brand new floppy disks. He says the most in demand is the standard 1.44 megabyte
[02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:03.900]   three and a half inch blank floppy. I would say the most valuable are currently the 720 kilobyte
[02:09:03.900 --> 02:09:09.420]   double density disks. Of course, there are especially eight inch disks for which there's a very small
[02:09:09.420 --> 02:09:14.780]   demand and of which we have only a small inventory. They're absolutely irreplaceable. The same could
[02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:20.860]   be said about quad density. I threw out boxes of these things. Oh, yeah. So it didn't. I wonder if the
[02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:28.300]   same thing like 78 records went through the same kind of, you know, long tail, long, long tail.
[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:37.340]   Just a book from the 40s or from the 60s, the view from the 40s floor by Theodore White,
[02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:42.060]   who became famous for having written later the making of the president 1960. Oh, yeah. This is a
[02:09:42.060 --> 02:09:48.860]   Romano clay about the folding of the Collier's magazine. You would say, "Coulier," but I'll say
[02:09:48.860 --> 02:09:57.020]   Collier. I would say Mullen would say, "Coulier." Yes, exactly. So at the at the at the end,
[02:09:57.020 --> 02:10:02.460]   a spoiler alert, as you're never going to read it, the magazine is full. And the newsroom does
[02:10:02.460 --> 02:10:09.740]   black bunting in the newsroom using typewriter ribbons. You can get those are inky though. You
[02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:16.220]   get your ink on your hands. Well, you know, they're leaving the place. Let's see. I think if I can
[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:20.300]   I mention one story here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm looking at your list. You have a picture. Oh,
[02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:28.060]   Amy, Amy, Amy. Yeah. So her bill, which was a protectionist bill for the middle part of the
[02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:32.300]   newspaper industry to give them money to force the platforms rather, to give them money,
[02:10:32.300 --> 02:10:40.620]   to force them to carry their content, not allow them to leave news, which is First Amendment
[02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:47.980]   nightmare. It was headed for it was in hearings, and then Ted Cruz, and as usual,
[02:10:47.980 --> 02:10:53.260]   it's Republicans and conservatives ganging up on the internet companies, then Ted Cruz put in
[02:10:53.260 --> 02:10:59.340]   an amendment that kind of made no sense. But basically was, if any of you are going to try to
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:04.060]   moderate our content and take our content off, then all the games off. And Klobuchar said,
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:09.180]   "Well, that ruined the bill." So then the bill stopped. And then it's supposed to go to markup
[02:11:09.180 --> 02:11:15.340]   tomorrow, but probably will not. And so it's almost dead, but it's not dead. It's going to come back,
[02:11:15.340 --> 02:11:23.340]   and it's terrible, terrible legislation. And it aims to give, to force the platforms to enter
[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:31.740]   into negotiation. You will negotiate to make offers. They have to make at least two offers for content,
[02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:37.180]   which they say, "We don't want, and we don't need, and we shouldn't pay for, and they can't use
[02:11:37.180 --> 02:11:42.460]   their own value that they bring to this equation in terms of audience in those negotiations,
[02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:46.540]   and they must carry the content," which I think again is a violation of the First Amendment,
[02:11:46.540 --> 02:11:53.340]   Mike Crazy. And any business that has more than 1,500 employees is out, so it's not the New York
[02:11:53.340 --> 02:11:57.500]   Times. But the fear is what's going to happen is these hedge funds will just cut employees down
[02:11:57.500 --> 02:12:02.700]   in every newspaper to below 1,500, and there you go. And unless you have 100,000 revenue, you can't
[02:12:02.700 --> 02:12:10.140]   get in the deal. So small, local weekly newspapers and sites can't get in it. And so it's this horrible,
[02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:18.140]   horrible piece of legislation that's just her trying to punish the platforms for the protection
[02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:26.060]   of sake of the newspaper lobbyists. So I ding-donged a dance on the grave for now, but I'm afraid it's
[02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:29.820]   going to come back. So I think it's worth mentioning. It's just nuts. It is.
[02:12:32.300 --> 02:12:36.060]   Let's do the Benito, if you would, the Google change log.
[02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:39.180]   The Google change log.
[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:48.700]   Ah, some nice new additions to Google photos, some collage editing. Look at these cute collages.
[02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:52.620]   I really like them. Collage or collage?
[02:12:52.620 --> 02:12:58.060]   I don't know. Collier, collier. Collage.
[02:12:59.820 --> 02:13:04.300]   Am I saying it wrong, collage? You say collage. I say collage.
[02:13:04.300 --> 02:13:10.860]   But your friends are southern. Let me just look it up in the dictionary.
[02:13:10.860 --> 02:13:16.060]   Pronounce, just say pronounce collage. Collage. Collage. You ready?
[02:13:16.060 --> 02:13:22.540]   Collage. Collage. Oh, but wait a minute. Alternate pronunciation. Collage.
[02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:26.860]   Oh, all right. For alternative people. So both are correct.
[02:13:27.980 --> 02:13:42.460]   Collage. I said both are correct. Google is rolling out a collage editor. This looks kind of cool.
[02:13:42.460 --> 02:13:46.540]   They're look more like cards, right? These are updates to memories.
[02:13:49.420 --> 02:13:59.100]   Advanced collage editor. And you can also make more videos.
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:06.300]   With you can trim long ones to the most meaningful moments. Still images will feed you a subtle zoom
[02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:15.100]   in and out. Kind of like a new, you know, can burn. Can burns effect. Yeah, looks at zooming in.
[02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:20.220]   That's nice. It really does make it still kind of come alive. So the zooming in and out and zooming in.
[02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:28.300]   They had. Wasn't like to create a visual cliche that gets named after you.
[02:14:28.300 --> 02:14:34.140]   Ken Burns. So it be, you know, the Ken Burns effect, which we first saw in the Civil War, right?
[02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:38.460]   And it really solved a problem because there's no video from the Civil War. There's no movies.
[02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:44.700]   So he had a lot of still pictures. So he said, we'll pan and zoom on these. So you zoom in,
[02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:49.340]   but you're pan across them. And so they come to life. But then Apple said, oh, we're going to
[02:14:49.340 --> 02:14:53.980]   build. Oh, that's neat. We'll build that into iMovie. And they called it the Ken Burns effect
[02:14:53.980 --> 02:15:00.300]   without asking him. Oh, really? Yes. Didn't know that very famously. And he called. They said,
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:07.180]   what the hell, Apple? That's my name. You can't just name something that Ken Burns effect.
[02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:11.260]   So they negotiated. I think he got a bunch of free max or something. But eventually he was
[02:15:11.260 --> 02:15:16.540]   satisfied with it. But yeah, I don't think he was that happy about it. It's really called Pan and
[02:15:16.540 --> 02:15:21.580]   Scan is the technical term for it. So yeah, I don't think he was that happy that he became so
[02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:27.740]   associated with this. So funny. It's cliche. Now when when he did Civil War, it was pretty cool,
[02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:32.860]   right? Yeah. And he also, I never liked that. You got David McCullough to not narrate it.
[02:15:33.740 --> 02:15:37.340]   You know, Shelby Foote and Peep. I thought it was pretty good. All right.
[02:15:37.340 --> 02:15:43.660]   Let's see. Here is a cinematic memories are rolling out that transform multiple still photos
[02:15:43.660 --> 02:15:49.020]   into an end to end. Oh, we just saw this. This is a cinema. No, this is a different one.
[02:15:49.020 --> 02:15:53.500]   Spotlight on Anna. Well, they're even doing like perspective. Yeah.
[02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:57.660]   I don't think what you call that when the one thing stays still, the thing is otherwise move.
[02:15:57.660 --> 02:16:00.860]   What's that called? What's happening? I don't know.
[02:16:03.020 --> 02:16:08.380]   Call that rotoscoping? No, perspective. It's a perspective shift. Yeah. But I don't know.
[02:16:08.380 --> 02:16:13.500]   I'm sure Alex Lindsey would have a name. I don't know what the technical name is for. Yeah.
[02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:19.020]   Chatham. What do you call that when the foreground moves different speed in the back?
[02:16:19.020 --> 02:16:26.140]   It's kind of like parallax shift. Yeah. Relax. No. Yeah. But that's hard. I mean,
[02:16:26.140 --> 02:16:31.580]   they obviously doing it computationally because this is a still photo. So that's, I don't know how
[02:16:31.580 --> 02:16:37.340]   they're doing that. That's cool. I'm enjoying the little memories. Oh, I love them.
[02:16:37.340 --> 02:16:41.580]   And these little bikes are from Google. It's not necessarily you share them out or anything like
[02:16:41.580 --> 02:16:46.220]   that. But it's a nice one. I get the little reminders. Oh, look at this from seven years ago and the
[02:16:46.220 --> 02:16:52.460]   stuff that I've totally forgotten about. And it just takes you away from us. It's funny because
[02:16:52.460 --> 02:16:59.020]   Apple, as usual with Apple, oh, iOS 16, we're going to have this great new thing that lets you
[02:16:59.020 --> 02:17:02.780]   share a photo album with other people and then they can add to it and you can add to it.
[02:17:02.780 --> 02:17:06.060]   It's going to be so great. We'll call it, I think, shared memories.
[02:17:06.060 --> 02:17:10.380]   Something Google photos has been doing for as long as I can remember.
[02:17:10.380 --> 02:17:16.300]   And then now they announced, oh, you know, it's so hard to do. We're going to put that off. It
[02:17:16.300 --> 02:17:20.300]   won't be coming out with the new iOS 16. We'll do that. You'll get that later this year.
[02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:27.900]   It's like, dude, Google's been doing this since 2015. What are you smoking over there?
[02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:35.500]   Cupertino. All right. Let's see. What else? I'm back to Shaq Shuka somehow. Why were we?
[02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:40.300]   Oh, this is like he's using Robin's eggs to make Shaq Shuka or something.
[02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:46.460]   So this guy, that would be, this is this is salt hank with a posh accent.
[02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:51.180]   And I see his name is Julius, oh, look at his little grill.
[02:17:51.180 --> 02:17:54.620]   Oh, yeah. No, it's quite posh. It's quite. It's quite. It's too precious.
[02:17:55.260 --> 02:17:59.820]   No, I think salt hank with the fast set. It's the fast cuts, the chopped, the loud noise.
[02:17:59.820 --> 02:18:05.580]   That's what the accent is very, very. Well, our turn is. You can hear his oxbridge is received
[02:18:05.580 --> 02:18:13.900]   pronunciation. Couple of clothes, a garlic, get in a smash. No, he's just like salt hank. Yeah.
[02:18:13.900 --> 02:18:19.900]   Yeah, it's a young, good looking gentleman cooking, exactly, which drives the ladies crazy because
[02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:29.500]   they don't have to get any more Google has jumped on the iOS 16 bandwagon with their own widgets
[02:18:29.500 --> 02:18:37.020]   for Gmail, Maps and more iOS, you know, just got this feature on the lock screen. So Google,
[02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:42.780]   you know, being being Google, not laughing like Samsung would do not mocking them as
[02:18:42.780 --> 02:18:49.820]   decided to make some, make some stuff. That's nice. I actually love these new lock screens.
[02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:52.700]   You want to see what I'm doing now with the lock screen? You have the over the shoulder,
[02:18:52.700 --> 02:19:00.220]   Benino, do you? Let me find it. Here it is. So one of the things you can do with the lock screen
[02:19:00.220 --> 02:19:06.380]   is you can have every time you unlock it, it gives you a new picture. So I put an album of,
[02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:10.700]   you know, I said all the pictures I have of Lisa. So every time I, you can't, you can't see it,
[02:19:10.700 --> 02:19:14.780]   but it's all right. You can see it this way. Every time it locks, I get a new picture of my wife,
[02:19:14.780 --> 02:19:19.180]   which I think is, you know, I think that's really, and it's random. It's just a pretty cool
[02:19:19.180 --> 02:19:23.980]   my photo album. So that's kind of cool. You could put pets in there or you could put pets and your
[02:19:23.980 --> 02:19:30.860]   wife or you could be flashing thing. I just need a sensor. Wow. The cameras pick that up,
[02:19:30.860 --> 02:19:34.860]   don't they? I don't see it in real life. Wow. Now you want to see it with cameras? That's the depth
[02:19:34.860 --> 02:19:40.300]   sensor. It's saying really? Oh, that's fascinating. Where's your face? Where's your face? If you put
[02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:46.380]   your phone up to your camera, Mr. Jarvis, you'll see it too. Wow, that's cool. Wow. Yeah. And see,
[02:19:46.380 --> 02:19:49.820]   every picture is different. So that's even, even cool. Yeah.
[02:19:49.820 --> 02:19:55.580]   Yeah, it's as Andrew have a depth sensor, LiDAR, whatever they call it.
[02:19:55.580 --> 02:19:59.580]   Get more done. Yeah, they have a black screen though, sir.
[02:19:59.580 --> 02:20:07.180]   There's no, I don't like that. And show us that. So it's a screen again. That's interesting. So
[02:20:07.180 --> 02:20:11.820]   you have a whole punch on there. Is it like a dynamic island? Does it grow and shrink?
[02:20:12.620 --> 02:20:18.860]   Does it? Does it do anything? Just sits there like a hole. Just like a hole. Okay. Get more done.
[02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:27.580]   With new Android features. What's this? This is the key word. Where can I shock Leo?
[02:20:27.580 --> 02:20:35.100]   All right. Just sits there like a hole. Okay. Gosh, that's an interesting choice.
[02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:42.140]   Nearby share. We've been promised this forever. I think it's using Bluetooth,
[02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:46.460]   Ellie. I don't know. But somehow it's, Apple would do it with a UWV chip. I don't know
[02:20:46.460 --> 02:20:52.460]   if Google has something similar, but you can share somebody nearby transfer. Oh, I guess it's
[02:20:52.460 --> 02:20:59.900]   just airdrop. Airdrop. Google workspace apps, updated Google Drive widgets,
[02:21:01.980 --> 02:21:07.180]   new emojis. There's a whole bunch of stuff. Gboard lets you emojify your messages,
[02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:12.300]   type your message that hit the emojify button and actual words are replaced by
[02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:18.060]   inscrutable pictures. It's emojify a verb that you have used in the past. Never, ever before. But
[02:21:18.060 --> 02:21:27.260]   notice how trippingly it flowed off my tongue. Unlike collage. Collage. You can do the emoji
[02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:32.940]   kitchen, lets you make mashed potatoes out of your emojis. Actually, that was cool. They took the
[02:21:32.940 --> 02:21:40.460]   100 and the Canadian Maple Leaf smooshed them together to make a Maple Leaf 100.
[02:21:40.460 --> 02:21:49.820]   Okay. Okay. You can instantly co-watch YouTube videos and play classic games together
[02:21:49.820 --> 02:21:55.100]   with up to 100 friends and family members at a time in Google Meet. I think we mentioned this
[02:21:55.100 --> 02:22:00.380]   before, new features in Google Meet. Google, I think they did this right at the Apple event.
[02:22:00.380 --> 02:22:05.820]   I think they're just trying to say, "Hey, we can do stuff too." This might be a value to deaf people.
[02:22:05.820 --> 02:22:11.660]   Design and partnership with deaf and harden to hear in community. Sound notifications
[02:22:11.660 --> 02:22:17.340]   within live transcribe and notifications can detect critical household sounds like fire alarms,
[02:22:17.340 --> 02:22:23.580]   running water door knocks, and it will tell you on your phone or watch in text when they occur.
[02:22:23.580 --> 02:22:28.300]   Sound notifications on Android. You can train your device to recognize, detect, and label specific
[02:22:28.300 --> 02:22:33.740]   household sounds. It's easy to miss an alert because you didn't hear it. That's why Google
[02:22:33.740 --> 02:22:38.780]   Research partnered with Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities to detect and label custom sounds.
[02:22:38.780 --> 02:22:43.740]   You'll automatically receive alerts for options in your home, like when the doorbell rings.
[02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:49.420]   If the baby starts crying. And if there's a siren on your street. But you can also train
[02:22:49.420 --> 02:22:53.500]   your device to recognize specifics. Just tap and hold to start recording.
[02:22:53.500 --> 02:23:00.860]   Add a label and edit anytime. And you can even personalize how you want to be notified.
[02:23:00.860 --> 02:23:05.340]   So you can see a flash when I'm knocking at the door. So see, it's okay if Google's always
[02:23:05.340 --> 02:23:12.460]   listening to you. It's for your own good. It's exactly what Deaf and hard you say.
[02:23:12.460 --> 02:23:17.260]   I'm sure it's all done. Like in a situation where you can miss a sound. So you can get a
[02:23:17.260 --> 02:23:21.660]   notification when you're wearing noise canceling headphones. Or even when your phone is in the
[02:23:21.660 --> 02:23:25.580]   other room. So now you can access your alerts on time and on your own terms.
[02:23:25.580 --> 02:23:27.500]   I think that's a nice feature.
[02:23:27.500 --> 02:23:27.660]   I think that's a nice feature.
[02:23:27.660 --> 02:23:28.300]   On Android.
[02:23:28.300 --> 02:23:28.940]   Yeah.
[02:23:28.940 --> 02:23:38.860]   They should say, "I'm going to assume it's done all on device."
[02:23:38.860 --> 02:23:43.180]   Because otherwise you would literally be sending everything going on all around you
[02:23:43.180 --> 02:23:48.220]   back to the Google servers. And nobody going to want to do that. But that's a great idea.
[02:23:48.220 --> 02:23:52.860]   Now if they can only give me a new name for, "Hey, you know who I would really be happy."
[02:23:52.860 --> 02:23:59.260]   There's some new features for Wear OS. That actually is a feature that you can use on the watch.
[02:23:59.260 --> 02:24:04.300]   Google, as you know, October 6th is expected to announce their new Pixel watch, which looks
[02:24:04.300 --> 02:24:11.580]   pretty sweet. You can use a Keep tile to dictate a note or checklist on the watch
[02:24:11.580 --> 02:24:14.140]   and send it to the phone.
[02:24:14.140 --> 02:24:21.260]   Okay, good. Bitmoji is coming to Wear OS. Oh, Alaluya.
[02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:21.900]   Oh boy.
[02:24:21.900 --> 02:24:28.540]   So yeah, it says if Google had, you know, this is kind of like the Apple event,
[02:24:28.540 --> 02:24:32.780]   but in the blog post, it's very cool. September 8th.
[02:24:33.340 --> 02:24:40.780]   Uh, Android 13, QPR1, beta1 is out. There's a whole list of new features.
[02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:43.660]   Thank you. 9 to 5. Google, if you want to check it out.
[02:24:43.660 --> 02:24:50.380]   Spatial audio, interesting for Google. Honestly, it's a back and forth thing.
[02:24:50.380 --> 02:24:53.260]   Apple steals from Google's to Google's steals from Apple.
[02:24:53.260 --> 02:24:56.140]   Well, remember, I was thinking about this the other day. Remember when they were
[02:24:56.140 --> 02:24:58.780]   suing the Bejesus out of each other? Yeah, that was stupid.
[02:24:58.780 --> 02:25:01.340]   Or any little thing. Oh, you can't have a round button.
[02:25:01.340 --> 02:25:04.780]   We invented the round button. That's all gone now because they just, there's
[02:25:04.780 --> 02:25:10.860]   is cross-pawnization and everybody knows that's how flowers grow. So it's good.
[02:25:10.860 --> 02:25:16.620]   There's actually some interest, um, interesting things going on, I think,
[02:25:16.620 --> 02:25:24.780]   with hearing aids on both platforms. As you know, next month, the FCC or FTC FDA.
[02:25:24.780 --> 02:25:30.940]   Yeah. FDA is scheduled to announce, uh, over the counter hearing aids that you won't have
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:35.500]   to go to an audiologist to buy expensive hearing aids. You'll be able to buy them over the counter.
[02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:41.100]   And I think both Apple and Google are watching with great interest. Google has some hearing aid
[02:25:41.100 --> 02:25:49.020]   features in its new, um, phone, including the ability to amplify sounds coming into the microphone
[02:25:49.020 --> 02:25:55.580]   of the phone via your headphones. Apple's expected to do that also with their new AirPods 2. In fact,
[02:25:55.580 --> 02:25:58.620]   it's thought they may have some hearing aid features in the AirPods 2. They didn't want to
[02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:03.740]   announce until next month because they are hearing aid style features. Certainly.
[02:26:03.740 --> 02:26:07.740]   What would a hearing aid like feature be? Uh, well, one of the things, uh, you know,
[02:26:07.740 --> 02:26:11.580]   I use hearing aids sometimes. One of the problems with the normal hearing aids is they're not full
[02:26:11.580 --> 02:26:19.500]   fidelity. They're designed to improve voices. Uh, of course, AirPod 2 is full fidelity. So one of
[02:26:19.500 --> 02:26:24.220]   the things, for instance, you can already do with the AirPods is you can, if you have an audiologist
[02:26:24.220 --> 02:26:29.740]   test or you take it to an audio test on your iPhone, drag it into the profile on your hearing,
[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:35.660]   on your AirPods. And that will now adjust the AirPods frequency response for your hearing.
[02:26:35.660 --> 02:26:41.180]   You can also, yeah, with the iPhone, use the iPhone camera to actually map the inside of your ear
[02:26:41.180 --> 02:26:46.860]   and send that to the AirPods, which, uh, aids in the creation of spatial sound.
[02:26:46.860 --> 02:26:51.420]   Wow. Yeah. You can. That's pretty cool. There's some speculation. You know, there's a speaker
[02:26:51.420 --> 02:26:56.380]   now in the AirPods charger. There's some speculation that many of us be a microphone,
[02:26:56.380 --> 02:27:00.140]   but they haven't announced it because that will be the kind of thing you would, let's say, put on a
[02:27:00.140 --> 02:27:03.740]   podium while Jeff is lecturing and you're sitting in the back. You can't really hear them and you
[02:27:03.740 --> 02:27:08.220]   could hear them. Well, or, or in my father's old folks home. Yes, exactly. Um, you put on the
[02:27:08.220 --> 02:27:12.940]   table. It's like a television coil, uh, that you put it in. You see, you can hear the TV,
[02:27:12.940 --> 02:27:18.140]   or you put it on the table during dinner. Um, so there are a lot of new features that, uh,
[02:27:18.140 --> 02:27:25.260]   just confuses my father. It doesn't work. Well, this is an interesting one. Uh, the AirPods also can,
[02:27:25.260 --> 02:27:32.300]   uh, automatically improve speech so they can change the curve to hear speech. Wow. But they
[02:27:32.300 --> 02:27:37.180]   also announced this. It can, if you go buy something that's very loud, like they showed a Jackhammer or
[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:41.900]   a siren, it will, it will, it will, the noise cancellation will adjust to cancel out those very
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:46.700]   loud noises to protect your hearing. So there, I really believe both Google and Apple are moving
[02:27:46.700 --> 02:27:51.740]   towards this idea that their, the earbuds are going to be kind of hearing aids without having
[02:27:51.740 --> 02:27:55.340]   a stick. Well, it sounds like also there'll be so many features that even if you're not hard of
[02:27:55.340 --> 02:27:59.660]   hearing, we'll all benefit, we'll see people wearing them all the time, even more than that.
[02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:04.700]   Yep. You bet. I think that's the intent. And they showed, uh, at the apple event, a woman
[02:28:04.700 --> 02:28:09.340]   in a subway and it's, you know, tuning out the subway noise and going, getting out of the subway.
[02:28:09.340 --> 02:28:14.540]   There's a Jackhammer tuning that out, going into a cafe. It's, it is the impression you get is,
[02:28:14.540 --> 02:28:19.500]   yeah. Oh, and they also announced, I think, I can't remember the length, but much longer battery life,
[02:28:19.500 --> 02:28:23.660]   still not full day, which you'd need for a hearing aid, but much longer. I hope it doesn't tune out
[02:28:23.660 --> 02:28:30.540]   the honking bus that's about to hit you. Yeah, let's hope not. I don't think it would. No. Okay.
[02:28:30.540 --> 02:28:32.940]   Pixel six, a September update is coming out with
[02:28:32.940 --> 02:28:42.700]   same old, same old fingerprint sensor improvements. Geez, this still can't get it right. Oh, Lord.
[02:28:43.340 --> 02:28:50.940]   That update we mentioned last week with the battery life. Yeah. Yeah. Do a thing. Do a different thing.
[02:28:50.940 --> 02:28:54.540]   Not get any better. Unfortunately, how fast is your fingerprint reader now?
[02:28:54.540 --> 02:29:00.540]   Oh, it's fine. Loyal listeners will know that, you know, Ant finally gave up on his Pixel six XL,
[02:29:00.540 --> 02:29:06.220]   traded in and his new one is fine, including the speed of the fingerprint reader. That's good.
[02:29:06.220 --> 02:29:10.060]   Glad to hear that. Totally fine. Yeah. I never had trouble. And so I thought maybe that was
[02:29:10.060 --> 02:29:17.420]   a specific to the phone. Google is also previewing Android's new emoji ahead of the December launch,
[02:29:17.420 --> 02:29:24.700]   including an animated collection that looks like a ghostly happy face. You want to see some
[02:29:24.700 --> 02:29:31.900]   new emoji on their way. There's a hair pick. There's a hand saying talk to the hand. There's maracas.
[02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:42.700]   There's ginger root, peas, chocolate chip cookies, donkeys, fans. We talked, I think about these before,
[02:29:42.700 --> 02:29:51.740]   but they're coming into December and dancing emotes. Emotes. Emotes. They're calling these not
[02:29:51.740 --> 02:29:57.820]   emotes. You're a modify or you're a bodegify. The first, I'll say hello to our first set of
[02:29:57.820 --> 02:30:04.540]   animations. Scan the collection, download in your preferred file format and watch them dance like
[02:30:04.540 --> 02:30:11.260]   this little guy here. John Dravolt. It looks very apolytating. Yeah. Color font support. Oh, look.
[02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:15.500]   You can really make your duck be very colorful.
[02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:26.220]   Customize demotes. No lime emoji, no problem. Bring the green heart and the yellow lemon
[02:30:26.220 --> 02:30:31.580]   together and you'll get a yellow, a green lime. Make it a yellow rose with a yellow heart,
[02:30:31.580 --> 02:30:37.420]   feeling goth. Put some black heart on your lipstick. Go Cardinals, turn the Twitter bird
[02:30:37.420 --> 02:30:44.460]   from blue to red. Why not just give me those? Yeah. Instead of making me make them. Because we
[02:30:44.460 --> 02:30:51.020]   watch in the kitchen. That's where you belong. And that's the change long.
[02:30:51.020 --> 02:30:58.460]   Mama, my oh my, oh my, we had it. This was fun. It was so great to meet.
[02:30:58.460 --> 02:31:03.580]   And talking that my one way. What a great. What a great. I'm so happy you did that.
[02:31:03.580 --> 02:31:09.260]   Thank you, Matt. Let's finish up though with our picks of the week. No Stacy this week. So we'll
[02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:17.020]   start with you and pro it. All right. For mine. I just want to say thank you to Google.
[02:31:17.020 --> 02:31:25.100]   Because I got an alert yesterday. Oh, yes. Here at my desk. And I got to tell you,
[02:31:25.100 --> 02:31:31.340]   this Southern man, that was some weird stuff. Was that your first quake? That was my first earthquake.
[02:31:31.340 --> 02:31:37.180]   It was a very mild quake, I must say. That's what's funny is people was like, that was nothing.
[02:31:37.180 --> 02:31:41.500]   And I'm thinking, dang, what does a bad one feel like? Here's what it looked like on my phone.
[02:31:41.500 --> 02:31:46.780]   We were in a restaurant and the whole restaurant came alive with a boop boop.
[02:31:46.780 --> 02:31:50.780]   And this is the emergency alert that popped up on her phone's earthquake detected drop cover.
[02:31:50.780 --> 02:31:57.980]   Hold on. Protect yourself. USGS shake alert. And I didn't feel it, but Lisa felt that she said it
[02:31:57.980 --> 02:32:03.500]   was about a second or two. So it wasn't before the earthquake. It was a little bit earlier than
[02:32:03.500 --> 02:32:08.940]   the earthquake, but we were right on the epicenter. So it happened right. My alert went off like
[02:32:08.940 --> 02:32:15.100]   right as the house started shaking. It was like simultaneously. Yeah. And I think do we have the
[02:32:15.100 --> 02:32:20.220]   video from all about Android? Because they were in studio. What happened? Yeah, they were doing
[02:32:20.220 --> 02:32:25.980]   the show. Yeah, they felt it though, right? I think that I believe Jason said he did. I think
[02:32:25.980 --> 02:32:30.300]   you could see it even. I don't know where I could find that. It's pretty crazy. Yeah. I was like,
[02:32:30.300 --> 02:32:35.820]   wow, this is and this isn't the bad one. It's funny. Oh, this is nothing. Oh, no.
[02:32:35.820 --> 02:32:37.340]   Or dude.
[02:32:37.340 --> 02:32:46.460]   Quay Perut was rehearsing as usual. And so I thought it was her just sort of coming down the hall
[02:32:46.460 --> 02:32:50.140]   because we were both upstairs. I thought it was just her walking down the hallways stomping and
[02:32:50.140 --> 02:32:57.740]   dancing. And it got louder. And my all of my gear in here started shaking. And then she was like,
[02:32:57.740 --> 02:33:03.260]   oh, when I said earthquake, so she stopped and the phone was screaming and whatnot is just
[02:33:03.260 --> 02:33:09.340]   very, very weird. I'm glad that Google at least put that alert out there. I never thought I'd see
[02:33:09.340 --> 02:33:13.900]   it, but here's the good only good news. Here's the all about Android video right after your
[02:33:13.900 --> 02:33:19.180]   plug to subscribe to hands on photography. Thank you.
[02:33:21.980 --> 02:33:27.740]   Oh, wait a minute. No, no, you gave me the oh, is it on the bloopers? Yeah, you can hear it.
[02:33:27.740 --> 02:33:35.660]   Uh, drop or cover hold on protect yourself. I'm getting the alert. There's the sound.
[02:33:35.660 --> 02:33:38.460]   Is it the first time I had earthquake live on the show?
[02:33:38.460 --> 02:33:43.660]   Earthquake detected drop cover hold on. Protect yourself.
[02:33:43.660 --> 02:33:48.380]   Uh, do I drop cover hold on? I don't know. What do I do?
[02:33:50.860 --> 02:33:54.220]   Yeah, that was that was a little bit of a shake there. I didn't feel it at all.
[02:33:54.220 --> 02:33:59.500]   Did you? Why did you guys stay on the wall? I'm on a I'm on a platform. Sorry.
[02:33:59.500 --> 02:34:02.540]   Yeah. Okay. So we couldn't see it.
[02:34:02.540 --> 02:34:07.340]   You should be a little bit. Yeah. I mean, I think so. I mean, it was it was. Oh, there it is.
[02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:10.940]   Wait, nothing is even rocking at all. It's still going. Did you see it? There's a little
[02:34:10.940 --> 02:34:16.060]   camera with the shock. Look at the monitor. Yeah. Yeah. That was there. We can kind of see it on
[02:34:16.060 --> 02:34:21.020]   the zoom. So it wasn't bad. It really was very mild. Wait till you get a real earthquake.
[02:34:21.020 --> 02:34:26.060]   You will then enjoy that. That's what really freaked me out. I was I was a bit beside myself.
[02:34:26.060 --> 02:34:32.540]   Yeah. It's like, wow, the world is moving and I'm sitting here. Oh, waiting to get a real one.
[02:34:32.540 --> 02:34:36.780]   Then it really is it is very much like that. Like this should not this earth should not
[02:34:36.780 --> 02:34:40.940]   move like this. This is not in all my time in San Francisco. I had only one and I was on a
[02:34:40.940 --> 02:34:45.740]   Muni bus at the time and there was no way to feel it. Yeah. Muni bus earthquakes more than the city.
[02:34:46.140 --> 02:34:50.940]   Yeah. It's pretty. Yeah. Yeah. I was at the dogs freaked out. They started barking.
[02:34:50.940 --> 02:34:57.260]   Oh, did they all the 89 quake? They're really bad when they were the bridge fell and we had fires
[02:34:57.260 --> 02:35:01.180]   in the Marina district and everything. I was at Candlestick Park for the World Series game.
[02:35:01.180 --> 02:35:04.940]   Right. They were there. Yeah. It was it was really scary because the
[02:35:04.940 --> 02:35:12.380]   light standards we were. I mean, they were moving 15, 20 feet like this back and forth.
[02:35:13.180 --> 02:35:20.060]   And the whole crowd, I mean, it's like freaking. But the best part is the players ran out of the
[02:35:20.060 --> 02:35:24.380]   dugout, grabbed their kids from the stands and ran into the middle of the field and just stood
[02:35:24.380 --> 02:35:30.220]   there looking around while the rest of us are going, Oh, what should we do? Right. So we sat there for
[02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:36.220]   a while. It was a really good example of how rumors spread because some people had radios and TVs.
[02:35:36.220 --> 02:35:42.220]   And by the time the story got to us, the bridge had fallen down. The city was sunk into the water.
[02:35:42.220 --> 02:35:47.740]   You know, all just horrific stuff. My friend, the guy I was with was a San Francisco native. He said,
[02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:52.620]   let's go. The lights were all out. The street lights were out. The traffic lights were out. But
[02:35:52.620 --> 02:35:57.820]   he knew his way around town. He was able to get me back to the radio station. And we were there.
[02:35:57.820 --> 02:36:04.140]   But it was, yeah, it was you when you get a real one, you will know. And honestly, there's two
[02:36:04.140 --> 02:36:10.220]   ways to think about these. This is the second small temblor in the area. There was one in the
[02:36:10.220 --> 02:36:17.100]   Waldo grade a couple of days before. It's either the fault letting pressure off. So that's good.
[02:36:17.100 --> 02:36:26.220]   Or it's building up to the big one. So let's go with a. So let's go. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:36:26.220 --> 02:36:35.420]   Yeah, the studio, we're not on a slab, are we? Do you know? I don't know if we're on a
[02:36:35.420 --> 02:36:40.140]   think you'd be. I don't know what we're on. What's the problem if you're on a slab? That's good.
[02:36:40.140 --> 02:36:45.340]   We were on a slab at a restaurant. So I hardly felt it. But if you're a wooden structure,
[02:36:45.340 --> 02:36:50.220]   you know, on wooden walls, yeah, you're going to definitely feel it more, especially if you're
[02:36:50.220 --> 02:36:54.540]   not a bedrock, if you're on. Right. My neighbor was like, you're upstairs. So it definitely
[02:36:54.540 --> 02:36:58.540]   feels worse upstairs. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That makes sense. Okay. Well, that makes sense.
[02:36:58.540 --> 02:37:02.700]   Yeah, this building is just slab. Burke says it's a tilt up. So I don't know how much we feel
[02:37:02.700 --> 02:37:09.580]   unless it was really not. Was I supposed to go and stand in up under a door? No, or that is the old,
[02:37:09.580 --> 02:37:14.860]   the old news. You are not supposed to get under a doorway. Turns out those are worse.
[02:37:14.860 --> 02:37:21.420]   Not bad. So don't go stand under a doorway. Jason should have. I literally just sat here.
[02:37:21.420 --> 02:37:25.660]   I'd be a good idea just in case, you know, here probably under the desk could be very good. I
[02:37:25.660 --> 02:37:30.300]   get because of the lights, stuff falling off the ceiling. If the building falls down,
[02:37:30.300 --> 02:37:36.700]   I looked up. The first thing I did was look up. Like what's going on. I'm not going to move.
[02:37:36.700 --> 02:37:40.540]   And Queen Prue is she just sort of stood over there in the door. Because she was,
[02:37:40.540 --> 02:37:44.700]   like I said, I thought she was just sort of goofing off at dancing in the hallway.
[02:37:44.700 --> 02:37:51.020]   And oh, that's just Queen Prue rehearsal. That's what she does. She's singing those
[02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:55.420]   DAGUM songs every other minute and it's just, you know, whatever, but it got worse.
[02:37:55.420 --> 02:38:00.620]   You're supposed to draw. This is what the advice was. Drop under your hands and knees.
[02:38:00.620 --> 02:38:06.700]   Before the earthquake knocks you down, it protects you from falling. This is from the CDC, but
[02:38:06.700 --> 02:38:12.540]   allows you to still move necessary. Then cover your head and neck. If you can under a sturdy table
[02:38:12.540 --> 02:38:21.020]   or desk. Yeah. Okay. But it says, do not go into a doorway. How many years was that the advice?
[02:38:21.020 --> 02:38:26.220]   Forever. It was all my childhood. For a guy out in the country in the south.
[02:38:26.220 --> 02:38:29.740]   That's what we were told. But yeah, for years, that's where we were told. Yeah.
[02:38:29.740 --> 02:38:34.220]   That is, you know, the CDC changes things all the time.
[02:38:34.220 --> 02:38:40.380]   But thank you, Google, for that alert. I thought that was.
[02:38:40.380 --> 02:38:44.860]   Was that interesting? That's along with your amber alerts and your tornado warnings and all that.
[02:38:44.860 --> 02:38:49.180]   It's the first time I've ever seen an earthquake alert, but it works. And because we were in a
[02:38:49.180 --> 02:38:54.300]   restaurant, a lot of people, I mean, you really knew everybody's looking around.
[02:38:54.300 --> 02:38:56.300]   Right. Yeah. That's good.
[02:38:56.300 --> 02:39:02.620]   An enduring image of California and an earthquake is a collapsed Adobe home with the door frame is
[02:39:02.620 --> 02:39:07.340]   the only standing part. From this came our belief that a doorway is the safest place to be in an
[02:39:07.340 --> 02:39:13.500]   earthquake. Oh, true. If you live in an old unreinforced Adobe house, in other words, if your house is
[02:39:13.500 --> 02:39:18.780]   made of clay, sure, get in the doorway. Or some older wood frame houses and modern houses,
[02:39:18.780 --> 02:39:23.260]   doorways are no stronger than any other part of the house. And the doorways is not protected from
[02:39:23.260 --> 02:39:30.060]   the most likely source of injury, falling or flying objects. So you're safer under a table.
[02:39:30.060 --> 02:39:33.660]   See, I don't think people were meant to live in California. I think they were meant to go and
[02:39:33.660 --> 02:39:39.660]   see and say, isn't this pretty? It's so pretty. And then Lee. So pretty. But you got tornadoes,
[02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:46.460]   dude, hurricanes and Donald Trump. Yeah. You've got Ben Boster. I got Donald Trump nearby. Yeah.
[02:39:48.700 --> 02:39:56.460]   Uh, what else? You got one more thing, eh? Oh, I forgot about my other thing. We sing his praises
[02:39:56.460 --> 02:40:02.460]   every dad gum Wednesday as we start the show. And this was a great article on PC mag featuring
[02:40:02.460 --> 02:40:06.780]   Mr. Craig Newmark. Oh, and the title of it is just.
[02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:15.660]   I love the title of it. And but if you read it, it's just a great read. He's just being
[02:40:15.660 --> 02:40:21.500]   himself in genuine and is the person interviewing. There was even a point in there where they were
[02:40:21.500 --> 02:40:27.740]   like, you know what? I don't even know if I can continue to take these these answers seriously,
[02:40:27.740 --> 02:40:32.940]   because they're just so frank and straightforward. But it was all a candid. It's just a good read.
[02:40:32.940 --> 02:40:38.300]   We love him. Such a good read. Remember, he is studying stand-up comedy. So maybe
[02:40:38.300 --> 02:40:45.420]   you shouldn't take him too seriously. You got to get him on. It was an I enjoyed having him on.
[02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:49.420]   That was fun. Yeah, it'd be great. We did him while we needed we needed to the Dave Weiner thing.
[02:40:49.420 --> 02:40:54.780]   You're so I love I love talking to the pioneers, the guys who started the internet. You know,
[02:40:54.780 --> 02:40:59.900]   those are that's always my my favorite thing. Thank you, and don't forget,
[02:40:59.900 --> 02:41:05.900]   underscore Pruitt on Twitter, Instagram and Vero. What the hell? Why not? That's not
[02:41:05.900 --> 02:41:13.020]   in Vero. Yeah, I'm there right now and Vero. And don't forget, of course, he is the master
[02:41:13.020 --> 02:41:18.220]   ceremonies in our club, Twit Discord. Did we decide on a book for Stacy's book club?
[02:41:18.220 --> 02:41:24.940]   We did. The book is a long way to a small to the small angry planet. Oh, good. Okay. That's
[02:41:24.940 --> 02:41:31.820]   good. Right. And we just got the agenda, the schedule for our next meeting is October 27th,
[02:41:31.820 --> 02:41:37.820]   9 a.m. Pacific for the book club. Nice. But before that, the 22nd of September,
[02:41:37.820 --> 02:41:43.740]   going to be chatting with some club Twit members in a fireside chat. Very good. So that's just
[02:41:43.740 --> 02:41:47.260]   some of the things that go on in club Twit. Of course, there's great conversations in the
[02:41:47.260 --> 02:41:53.420]   discord all the time, but all kinds of topics, not just the shows that are on now, but anime and
[02:41:53.420 --> 02:41:58.780]   autos and beer and books and coding and comics and current affairs. And that's just the bees and
[02:41:58.780 --> 02:42:06.780]   the seas. It goes on and on and on. There's even a TikTok corner for you, Jeff Jarvis. Oh, what?
[02:42:06.780 --> 02:42:14.140]   No, that I've had that in there for weeks. Yes. And I put more in there than you have.
[02:42:14.140 --> 02:42:18.460]   Get in there, Jeff. You need to. Well, that's not well, you know, we it's turned out to be one of
[02:42:18.460 --> 02:42:22.780]   the great benefits of club Twit. But really the main reason we started it is because people say
[02:42:22.780 --> 02:42:27.260]   we want to add free versions of the show. So for seven bucks a month, you get ad free versions of
[02:42:27.260 --> 02:42:32.060]   all of our shows. You get the discord, you get the Twit Plus feed and your subsidizing shows that
[02:42:32.060 --> 02:42:38.060]   don't have enough support enough advertising support for us to do otherwise things like hands-on Mac
[02:42:38.060 --> 02:42:42.540]   with Mike as Sergeant hands-on windows with Paul Therrot, the untitled Linux show with Jonathan Bennett
[02:42:42.540 --> 02:42:48.860]   the Giz Fizz with Dick D. Bartolo Stacy's book club. This weekend space started in the club.
[02:42:48.860 --> 02:42:55.900]   So it really is a way and it really helps us. Lisa just told me 25% of our revenue now comes
[02:42:55.900 --> 02:43:02.380]   in the club. So it's especially as advertising starts to get a little slower during recession.
[02:43:02.380 --> 02:43:06.300]   Thank you, people. Thank you. It really helps us. You can also get shows individually for
[02:43:06.300 --> 02:43:13.660]   $2.99 a month if you just want one show ad free. But all of that is at club twit.tv or just go to
[02:43:13.660 --> 02:43:19.340]   twit.tv/clubtwit either one will work. So we'll propose the Gutenberg club. Yeah, sure.
[02:43:19.340 --> 02:43:23.580]   It'll just be a drinker. It's basically a drinker club. Everybody just take a shot.
[02:43:23.580 --> 02:43:25.660]   That's what it's saying. We'll all be in there like that.
[02:43:25.660 --> 02:43:30.380]   Thank you and for doing that. And of course, Anne hosts hands-on
[02:43:30.380 --> 02:43:37.900]   photography twit.tv/hop every week. What have you got for us, Mr. Jay? I'll do this one.
[02:43:37.900 --> 02:43:44.780]   YouTube is bragging, for good reason, that they paid $6 billion to the music industry
[02:43:44.780 --> 02:43:53.260]   the last 12 months. Wow. 50%. Wow. 4 billion in 2021. Now $6 billion.
[02:43:53.260 --> 02:43:59.660]   We want our twin engines of ads and subscriptions to be the number one contributor of revenue to
[02:43:59.660 --> 02:44:05.660]   the industry by 2025. Now, this is interesting because I would have thought, oh, that's YouTube
[02:44:05.660 --> 02:44:15.900]   music's royalties. But it's mostly from creatives who are using music in their videos. They say,
[02:44:15.900 --> 02:44:22.940]   we also pioneered the monetization of user-generated content. 30% of the payouts for artists,
[02:44:22.940 --> 02:44:29.100]   songwriters, and red holders for the second year in the row came from videos using real music
[02:44:29.100 --> 02:44:35.180]   where there was a payout. So that's interesting. That's, you know, maybe an unintended,
[02:44:35.180 --> 02:44:40.060]   remember they tried to shut that down for a long time. Can you explain how that works?
[02:44:40.060 --> 02:44:47.500]   Can you explain to me how that works? I don't even know how that works. If I were to do a video
[02:44:47.500 --> 02:44:53.900]   and get a song from, I don't know, Mariah Carey and put it as the music bed,
[02:44:53.900 --> 02:44:58.140]   I'm going to get a notice of copyright, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and it goes away. They'll
[02:44:58.140 --> 02:45:04.140]   make me put another song in there. Or, or no. That doesn't necessarily mean Mariah Carey got paid,
[02:45:04.140 --> 02:45:08.700]   right? No, I think, tell me if I wrote it earlier, isn't it, that you can keep it up there, but
[02:45:08.700 --> 02:45:12.940]   whatever money came to you was going to go to Mariah. So there's a couple of things.
[02:45:12.940 --> 02:45:17.420]   Oh, very YouTube has made deals and I'm sure more will come just as TikTok has done.
[02:45:17.420 --> 02:45:22.460]   I know there's with the record labels. So there is music you can just use and you won't risk a
[02:45:22.460 --> 02:45:30.060]   copyright strike. But if you just use music, there are three things that the label, the
[02:45:30.060 --> 02:45:33.740]   a copyright holder, actually it's a publisher, the music is a copyright holder. There are three
[02:45:33.740 --> 02:45:38.780]   things a copyright holder can do. One is take you down and give you a copyright strike.
[02:45:38.780 --> 02:45:46.060]   That's what we always get for something. Another would be to demonetize you, say,
[02:45:46.060 --> 02:45:49.100]   you're not going to make any money off of this. Yeah, I've seen that notice.
[02:45:49.100 --> 02:45:53.980]   And then the third one, and apparently this is a popular one, is, oh, fine, but we will get all
[02:45:53.980 --> 02:45:59.100]   the money from your monetization as royalties. That's the third one. The third one. Yeah.
[02:45:59.100 --> 02:46:04.460]   Yeah. Which is okay. Interesting. This 30% you're using it. This is what the newspaper industry
[02:46:04.460 --> 02:46:10.060]   looks at. This is, hey, where's our six billion? Except that a headline is not a unique song by
[02:46:10.060 --> 02:46:16.700]   Mariah Carey. It's just a piece of information. Right. I think if you use shorts, you can license.
[02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:20.940]   I think there's way, as a creator, you can use licensed music, which would be, of course,
[02:46:20.940 --> 02:46:28.300]   the better way to do it. And then the money would go to the creator, the publisher.
[02:46:28.300 --> 02:46:34.300]   Well, this is another long story, but it goes to the publisher, which isn't necessarily the label
[02:46:34.300 --> 02:46:41.420]   or the artist. Yeah. True. That's why you always want to write your own music. And you want,
[02:46:41.420 --> 02:46:46.060]   and just as Molly Crue did, you want to keep the rights to your music. Yeah.
[02:46:46.060 --> 02:46:56.460]   Six billion. Spotify's numbers are close to that, I think. Really? Let me see.
[02:46:57.100 --> 02:47:03.260]   Let me see what the music industry payout was. Seven billion. A little bit more.
[02:47:03.260 --> 02:47:09.660]   Geez. A little bit more. That's in 2021. That's to labels, publishers, and others.
[02:47:09.660 --> 02:47:16.620]   Yeah. That's more than anybody else. But still, yeah. And importantly here,
[02:47:16.620 --> 02:47:21.340]   it's the music industry is the one medium that was hit first by the snowball that became an
[02:47:21.340 --> 02:47:26.700]   avalanche down the mountain that is the internet. And it screwed up. And I was teaching this
[02:47:26.700 --> 02:47:32.460]   class last week. But it was the first one and the only one I think to date to really figure out
[02:47:32.460 --> 02:47:37.500]   how to do this. Will Page, the former chief economist at Spotify, has a great piece he did in the
[02:47:37.500 --> 02:47:44.220]   FT about two years ago, taking us through the numbers where the explosion of creativity
[02:47:44.220 --> 02:47:51.020]   that now exists is amazing without the gatekeepers that existed before. So that I think this
[02:47:51.020 --> 02:47:57.820]   similar, an equivalent number of songs are released every day as the UK used to release albums in a
[02:47:57.820 --> 02:48:07.340]   year. And the number of genres goes from hundreds to thousands that exist. And so the music industry
[02:48:07.340 --> 02:48:10.620]   still has a blockbuster economy, still wants to have a moraic here, still wants to have the big
[02:48:10.620 --> 02:48:18.140]   guys, but they learned how to make money on the long tales we used to say. Nobody else has really
[02:48:18.140 --> 02:48:22.140]   done that yet. I mean, books haven't really though you have what pad you have that kind of stuff
[02:48:22.140 --> 02:48:25.580]   happening, which is kind of interesting. Magazine certainly haven't figured out newspapers haven't
[02:48:25.580 --> 02:48:29.260]   figured out because they're not they're not for a whole bunch of creators. They don't have the
[02:48:29.260 --> 02:48:34.140]   Matt Mullen wig view of many canvases and many paint brushes. It's our canvases. It's our paint
[02:48:34.140 --> 02:48:39.420]   brush. Yeah. So music, you know, finally finally figured it out is about to get back to where it was.
[02:48:39.420 --> 02:48:42.620]   And it's going to succeed from here. It's good to see.
[02:48:44.300 --> 02:48:49.500]   If you would like to it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people were going to London right
[02:48:49.500 --> 02:48:59.980]   now to view the Queen's Casket in state. There is currently a two mile long line. If you want to
[02:48:59.980 --> 02:49:06.860]   watch it, it's being streamed live by this is a live video from the chapel from the BBC.
[02:49:06.860 --> 02:49:12.380]   The Francisco Franco stream. She's still dead. Yeah, no, that's mean. That's just mean.
[02:49:12.940 --> 02:49:15.900]   Oh, it's an old us at Elle joke. I know. I know. Okay. Yeah.
[02:49:15.900 --> 02:49:24.380]   So the the funeral is on Monday. So she will be lying in state and people, you know, I'll never
[02:49:24.380 --> 02:49:29.580]   forget one of the things I did when we were in Beijing is went to see Mao's tune because he's,
[02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:34.700]   I don't know if it's a wax effigy or whatever, but or he's just well involved, but he's lying there.
[02:49:35.580 --> 02:49:43.420]   And you can see him. He sees his face and there is a constant mile long line of people from all
[02:49:43.420 --> 02:49:48.140]   over the country from all over China going to see now all these years later. This was 2009 or 10
[02:49:48.140 --> 02:49:54.300]   all these years after his death. And really some years after he was somewhat discredited,
[02:49:54.300 --> 02:49:59.900]   but there's still a lot of reverence for Chairman Mao and people bring flowers and I'll never
[02:49:59.900 --> 02:50:06.140]   forget seeing this. So they come, they lay flowers on the cask. Well, it's not a casky. He's in a
[02:50:06.140 --> 02:50:12.620]   he's in a glat like Lenin is he's in a glass jar, you know, bell jar kind of thing. And they put
[02:50:12.620 --> 02:50:16.860]   flowers down. And of course, there's so many people going by these flowers pile up. So they
[02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:21.580]   gather all the flowers up. And then I noticed they're bringing them out back and then reselling
[02:50:21.580 --> 02:50:25.340]   them. No, next, next bunch of people.
[02:50:27.980 --> 02:50:32.460]   This is not happening for the Queen. I don't believe there are any flowers. It's actually a very
[02:50:32.460 --> 02:50:39.020]   solemn, we're getting audio. I guess we are, but there's not much, not much to hear. It's the
[02:50:39.020 --> 02:50:44.220]   echo, you could leave that on Benita. Oh, we're taking down for the sound of the
[02:50:44.220 --> 02:50:48.140]   night. I think we're all right on this one. And you can see it's interesting to see the
[02:50:48.140 --> 02:50:55.260]   the guards with the big fur hats with their heads bowed and then the beef eaters around
[02:50:56.140 --> 02:51:02.860]   with their heads bowed and then the babbies at the corners standing there with their heads bowed.
[02:51:02.860 --> 02:51:11.420]   It's yeah, it's quite quite a touching. Wow. Yeah. So that's live at the BBC.com.
[02:51:11.420 --> 02:51:18.380]   If you want to watch it, I don't think they stream chairman house, bell jar.
[02:51:18.380 --> 02:51:23.100]   I don't know, it might be wrong. It could be wrong. How about lemons?
[02:51:24.060 --> 02:51:29.180]   Lens to me. I've not seen that. I actually would love to go, you know, get the whole
[02:51:29.180 --> 02:51:36.860]   collect all the whole set. I know who else is this Stalin's body there somewhere. Yeah.
[02:51:36.860 --> 02:51:39.740]   Ho Chi Minh is. Yeah.
[02:51:39.740 --> 02:51:44.060]   Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this.
[02:51:44.060 --> 02:51:50.860]   Duh-duh again of this week in Google catch and prude on hands on photography.
[02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:56.860]   When is a Queen Pruitt's big day? Is it coming up? It's in November. Okay.
[02:51:56.860 --> 02:52:00.940]   I think it starts. We're all going. There's something like that. I don't know if you know this next
