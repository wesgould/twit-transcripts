[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, Jeff, Stacey, and Ant are all ready to go.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.800]   We're talking about lots of stuff, including Facebook's new privacy tool and why it's not all that private.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.600]   Why Google's ads look like search results, why the Ring Doorbell is spying on you,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.800]   and why the US Interior Department doesn't want to use Chinese-made drones anymore.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.800]   This week in Google has brought to you from Twits LastPass Studios.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.200]   Securing every access point in your company doesn't have to be a challenge.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200]   LastPass unifies access and authentication.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.000]   To make securing your employees simple and secure, check out laspass.com/twit to learn more.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Podcasts you love from people you trust.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   This is Twig.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   This is Twig. This week in Google, episode 544, recorded Wednesday, January 29th, 2020.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Impermeable.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Hey everybody, it's time for Twig.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   This week in Google, shall we cover the Google verse, the Facebook verse, the Twitter verse,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   and the advertising verse.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   That's it.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Through it.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Adverse verse.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Adverse verse.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Yeah, just in time for superb owl, right?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Superb owl time coming up.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   What does your T-shirt say?
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Create and dominate.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Of course.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   That's your tagline.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   That's right, baby.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Did you get that from somebody or is that you?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   That's all me.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   So somebody made this shirt for you.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   That is all me.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   That's my design if I can move from mine.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Create, dominate, and it's got like a little camera, a shutter, and a camera inside.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   That's nice.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Create and dominate.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   That's right.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   How you doing, sir?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I didn't make you sick.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   You did not make me sick.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Nothing can make me sick.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I'm impermeable.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Is here from Stacey and IRT.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I do not think it means what you think it is.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Impermeable.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Gems cannot penetrate my membrane.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Are you perhaps impervious?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I am impervious.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Okay, that's even better.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   That's a better word.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   An impermeable.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I like that.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I mean, if you're talking about membranes, then sure, but I don't know.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Osmosis.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   That's not how we get sick.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And my erstwhile colleague, Jeff Jarvis, is also here.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Oh, I just had to use that.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Jeff Jarvis Buzz Machine, Professor of Journalism.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.200]   Apparently, Diane Feinstein was talking to Julia Yoffe, introducing Julia Yoffe to another
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   member of Congress.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.000]   She said, "She's an erstwhile journalist."
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And Julia said, "I do not think that word means what you think it means.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I am still a journalist."
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Did I ever tell you that I love San Francisco because of Diane Feinstein?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   No.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Do tell.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   No.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I was columnist on the examiner when I was still in his paper.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And I covered the Nook Moscone assassinations.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And was there when Feinstein became mayor.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And I was very positive on Feinstein as a role.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   But once in a while, I would criticize something.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Well, Diane Feinstein, if you criticize her once, you are the enemy.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Oh.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   What a troubling.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And she and her husband, Dick Bloom, made my life completely miserable with the publisher,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Reg Murphy.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And I finally just said, "I can't do this anymore."
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.240]   And I found a job in New York and I had my farewell party on a Friday and that Monday,
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.000]   Reg Murphy announced his retirement.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   A resignation.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And a wag on the city desk said, "Well, thanks, Jarvis.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   You got rid of them.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Now I ain't thought they could leave."
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   "I'm afraid of you."
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   "I'm afraid of you."
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So yesterday there was a report in the LA Times that Diane Feinstein was going to vote.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   It was ticking about.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   That's where this all came up.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Right.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Quittle.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And then suddenly she sent out to me and goes, "No, no, no.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   The LA Times misinterpreted me.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I don't know how they misinterpreted her, butâ€¦"
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Rachel Maddow, who claims that she was the journalist Feinstein was talking to, she said,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   "Yeah, the LA Times got it wrong.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   That's not what Feinstein said to me."
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Ah, okay.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   So confirming Feinstein's story.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Okay, good.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   It was misreported.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Sometimes people do make mistakes.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Errors happen.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Errors happen.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   But none of that has to do with Google or the Googleverse.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Hey, we got a date for Google I/O.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   You're going to come on out, Jeff, for that?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   As of now, I was supposed to go to Germany on that day.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Oh.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   What's going on in Germany?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Yeah, what's going on in Germany?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   A media conference in Leipzig.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Oh, I was thinking to go into Germany in three weeks, Jeff, but for a totally different conference.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   For an I-I-O-T conference in Berlin.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Ooh.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   What's I-I-O?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It's in Berlin.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   The industrial Internet.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Oh, who knew?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   That would be fascinating.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   I-I-I-O-T.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Have you done Berlin yet?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I have.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I've been to-I went to this conference a couple of years ago and then I feel like I was in
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Berlin another time.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   But this one's in February and Berlin in February is pretty cold.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Chili.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Well, it's always gray, but that's why you have coffee there.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I did have lovely coffee and something else.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It all kind of blurs, though.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   May I have a Berlin parenthesis?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Berlin, France.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Berlin, France.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   May 12th through 14th.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Shoreline and Theatre.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Google I-O.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   We already talked to Jason how he'll be going.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   We'll do the usual.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I stay here while Jason goes forth.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Hey, maybe you should go.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Actually, why don't you-would you like to?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Sure.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Uh, Shoreline-
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Get out of here.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Well, I stay here in anchor while we do the keynote, but we'd like to send people out.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Because there's lots to see at Google I-O.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   It's always a fun event.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.760]   I've not been to an I-O event for maybe four years, four or five years, but even then I
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.280]   went to the extended because the whole media press lottery just goes so quickly, at least
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   back then it did.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.200]   So the way that Google does this traditionally, they do a puzzle, right?
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.720]   And the puzzle was solved this week.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.720]   That's how we know the dates.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.720]   Right.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   This is the puzzle.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.720]   It almost is fascinating.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.720]   It's just a quick-ass.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.720]   What am I supposed to do?
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.720]   Let me click it.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.720]   Does something happen?
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.720]   Are you supposed to solve this?
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.920]   I am hip no time.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.880]   That looks exactly like May 12th through 14th when I look at it.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.000]   I just love the ingenuity of engineers.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.320]   Google loves to put these little-and then people go, "Oh, I mean something."
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.320]   But what?
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.320]   And they solve it.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.720]   It's events.google.com/io/mission if you want to solve it.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.400]   Apparently, it looks like space world.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.400]   Maybe it is.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.360]   Maybe we need Mr.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.040]   Odegras Tyson to help solve this.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.040]   I know.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.840]   I'm trying all the keystrokes.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.200]   Anyway, thank goodness somebody solved it.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.200]   We now know Google.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.080]   I always made 12th through 14th.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.280]   Appreciate it.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.360]   We figured it out.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.040]   Thank you very much.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:59.520]   Big story of the week, probably this week, is Facebook yesterday publishing a way to
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.720]   control off Facebook activity.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.600]   The off Facebook activity tool, which I would go to, but when I go there, of course, it
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.240]   says you got to log in and I don't have a Facebook account.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.240]   Right.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.880]   I can't really show that.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.960]   I -- a number of people have complained about this.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:23.240]   In fact, there was a Gizmo article that says it doesn't do profanity squat.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:30.280]   What it does do is it decouples your Facebook account to third party.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.640]   I get -- I don't know.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.760]   Collection tools.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.240]   It was clear history, which was announced or introduced two years ago.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.840]   The tool shows you, I'm told, a list of apps, websites, and businesses.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.400]   Facebook knows you visited through things like the Facebook login, the Facebook lichen,
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.040]   the tracking pixels and other less visible features for developers.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.000]   That gives you the option to disconnect the identifiable information.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.240]   It neither deletes the information on Facebook side nor on the third party side.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.160]   It just, I guess, stops the flow.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.160]   Good thing.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.160]   I'm trying to go to what's out.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.920]   It's a good thing that is now going back to the third party instead of them just saying,
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.520]   "Hey, we're wiping our hands of it on our side of things when you delete your account."
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:23.760]   But you still have that stuff out there from those old apps that you use to sign in with
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.840]   your old Facebook account that could still monetize off of that data some kind of way.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.840]   Go down there for cleaning that up.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.960]   EFF says, "Well, first of all, nobody's going to do it.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:39.040]   In fact, in the US, for example, three quarters of adults don't even know that Facebook hasn't
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.560]   had preferences page."
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.080]   People will listen to the show know, maybe, because we talk about it.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.000]   They also say, "And this tool doesn't even come close to covering all the ways Facebook
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.720]   collects and monetizes data about you.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.760]   For instance, it doesn't give you a way to opt out of custom audiences."
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:01.720]   That's their targeted advertising service that is fantastic for advertisers.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:07.040]   As long as the burden EFF writes is on users to carefully manage multiple sets of labyrinthine
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.200]   privacy settings, that's a good word to describe Facebook's privacy.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.720]   The privacy invasive norms of targeted advertising will remain, but Facebook and other companies
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.600]   whose business model relies on harvesting your data know that most users are uncomfortable
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.280]   with a status quo and likely would not choose to have ads targeted at them if given a real
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.280]   option.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.680]   EFF says, "That's why we need strong federal privacy safety laws in the US."
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:39.480]   My concern is for someone like you or me that don't have Facebook accounts but may have
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.480]   previously used apps.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.720]   Yeah, I can't go to it.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.160]   I can't do anything about it so that data is still dangling out there.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:50.240]   Granted, I've never logged in with Facebook on any of those services or whatever.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.320]   So I have an either, but I went to look at mine because I have an account, but I don't
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.960]   log into it ever and I don't use it.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.960]   And holy moly.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.520]   There's a lot of stuff.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:06.240]   I've got 462 apps and websites checking on my stuff most recently as last Wednesday.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.160]   That is the thing that's most eye-opening is how much of this is going on.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.360]   I mean, tons of journalism sites, right?
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.480]   Tons of, huh.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.640]   Oh, I know why.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.720]   I was like, "Why is so?
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.040]   Why is it you say Laurent?"
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.040]   But it's the Google backpack.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.040]   I was like, "What is this happening?"
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.040]   I don't buy things from YSL.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.040]   Oh, I do.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.040]   Nevermind.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:36.080]   Yeah, so some of them, I'm like, "Did I really go to zertag.com?"
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.840]   Jeff, do you want to hit the moral panic button yet?
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.840]   No.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:46.840]   I think that as with the entirety of cookies and everything, we were not transparent enough
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.960]   about it in these industries, in technology industry and advertising industry and media
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.960]   industry, all of us.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   I put us all in that same bucket.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.480]   And so more transparency about what we're doing, why we're doing it, what benefit you
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.200]   get out of it, and so on.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.960]   It's like Google getting rid of third party cookies, which started up last week.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.960]   Everybody's, "Ya haa luya!"
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.400]   But then media companies are going to be hurt badly and journalism is going to be hurt
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.400]   as a result.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.400]   More revenue is going to go away and Google is going to benefit.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.960]   And it's not as simple as it seems.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.160]   It's not a clear cut, good or evil.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.400]   There are reasons some of these things exist and there are benefits to people we like that
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.400]   will go away.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.480]   And you've pointed out before that this isn't even new to the internet.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.480]   I mean, the internet is kind of weaponized it, but I remember interviewing people 30 years
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.600]   ago from Clara Toss talking about how you give me your zip, I could tell you what magazines
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.600]   you subscribe to and probably what cars in your driveway.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.280]   And so they've been collecting this for decades.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.960]   There's just a lot more data than ever before.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.800]   Is that something to be concerned about?
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.320]   So let me give you something that'll freak out just because it'll be fun to freak out.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320]   Maybe you knew this.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.320]   I didn't know this.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.280]   I was at a salon this week.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.280]   I was waiting.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.520]   I meant because there was no dinner, there was just cheese on it.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.080]   Oh, is that what that means?
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.080]   That's what it means.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.080]   Yeah, cheese on it.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.080]   I thought you were getting your hair done.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.080]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.080]   Thank you, Anne.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.080]   Yes.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.080]   Okay.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.520]   Intellectual literary salon, not a beautiful salon.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.520]   Okay.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.800]   So I was at the salon and a chat about so I shouldn't say who was there aware.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.080]   But a big ad guy said, I did not know this.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.960]   And one of my students this week in our new leadership program confirmed this when I
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.960]   talked about it in class, that Amazon is taking to guessing what you want and sending
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.240]   it to you, even though you don't ask.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.240]   What?
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.880]   No, they are not.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.880]   Yes.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.880]   Not on my students said.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.880]   Like it said.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.320]   Yeah, there's if you don't want it, you said it back and that's that.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.280]   No, it's in the back, but it's free.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.720]   You know, I'm just saying, I think I've got to post a lot.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.200]   It's just, yeah, you can take anything you want.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.440]   But is this for review purposes?
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.920]   Like they say, would you review it or are they just trying to anticipate your
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.920]   needs?
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.240]   So one of my students said we have this new one, one magnificent, just a great, great
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.400]   week program in news innovation, leadership and management degree.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.160]   And one of the students said, yeah, she was, she was thinking, oh, about time to get my
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.640]   new laundry pods.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.640]   I haven't gotten those in a while.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.720]   And boom, they were there.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:22.560]   And she, in fact, did need them and did keep them and went ahead and paid for them.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.760]   Is it like there's a subscription service?
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.560]   Like, are they saying like, Hey, you usually like, there's a couple of things that I usually
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.800]   buy, but I don't have the subscription for her.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.200]   So I can see Amazon being like, wait a second.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.520]   I bet she's going to want these down.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:42.720]   This is an article from last year, actually two years ago from Business Insider, more
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.760]   people are getting sent mysterious Amazon packages two years ago.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.360]   They didn't order and no one knows exactly what's going on.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.400]   They talked to a, actually, Daily Beast talked to a person named Nikki that unwrapped a package
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.040]   only to find a $25 sex toy inside.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.640]   She's continued to receive that would be insulting.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.680]   She's continued to see for things she didn't order, including junk like a charging cable
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.600]   for a Bluetooth device.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.480]   Amazon, that doesn't sound like that.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.320]   I've seen says they're investigating.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.320]   This must be something else.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.320]   I've seen this as something that we're going to be.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.320]   PR.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:20.880]   PR have sent things to me in the past and that comes in a prime box that I know I didn't
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.120]   order.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.520]   And when you open it up, it would have just, you know, some random product that they're
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.520]   hoping that you would review.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.160]   Yeah, that's why I asked about reviews because I think that that does happen, that Amazon
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.000]   sellers and products will sometimes arrive unsolicited because they want to review,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   right?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.280]   I've seen that happen, but just the idea of Amazon saying, "Hey, yeah, I know you ordered
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.920]   these, which is actually due now.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.160]   My dog probiotics once a month, I'm going to go ahead and send that out to you."
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.160]   They can't do that.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.600]   But I don't want them to do that because I don't want them to just automatically build
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.600]   me without knowing.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.600]   They have to be against the law.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.600]   There's got to be a law.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:59.120]   Well, not if they maybe if they don't charge you, like maybe if you're supposed to say,
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.920]   "Click, I accept this, but if you don't, don't you?"
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.920]   Then that's fine.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:03.920]   That's fine.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.680]   But again, give me some type of warning.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.560]   Shoot me an email to say, "Hey, we're trying not to service."
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.520]   You know, we think this may help you out.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.200]   Well, what if they sent it to you though with the note that said, "Surprise," as one
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.600]   of our favorite customers, we're sending this ahead of you, like in trying to get data
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.600]   from this?
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.600]   I'm fine with that because that's communication.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.600]   It's so common place.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.080]   There's a term for it.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.600]   It's called brushing.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.600]   Brushing.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.600]   Brushing.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.400]   It's a scam.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.000]   The brushings, this is from last October.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Okay.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.600]   Oh, this is, but this is not what we're talking about.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:41.840]   Well, we might be though because do they know that they're being not random?
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.280]   Jeff is talking about Amazon using its data to proactively send you things it thinks
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.280]   she wants.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.560]   Brushing apparently is some random third party sending you packages for it.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:56.480]   Or a fraud purpose is to boost something to game Amazon system.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.360]   But how do we know that that's not what's happening with these students?
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.600]   Because it was Amazon itself and there was a little note inside saying, "We think you
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.600]   need this, do you want this?
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.600]   If not, you can sell it back."
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.600]   Oh, that's the communication.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.600]   It was what it was.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.240]   It was what it, if you communicate it, I'm fine with that.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.240]   But yeah, it wasn't just really negative.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.840]   But I don't want to have to sense the fact that's a pain in the ass.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.840]   Yeah, true.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.840]   That's the thing.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.400]   Because postal law, I believe, says if something is sent to you unsolicited, it is yours.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.400]   You can keep it.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.720]   I've always thought that was the rule.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:31.080]   There was a company I worked with some time ago that did plaques.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.720]   Twit is named one of the top 25 businesses.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.160]   This is like the old who's who's who's who?
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.160]   Exactly.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.320]   So what they did was they would make a plaque of this and send it to you.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:48.040]   And you really should get the book that this where this is announced for $50.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.840]   But you get the plaque and then you're not, you could keep it.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.760]   But most people who didn't want to actually send it back.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.760]   It was prepaid.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.760]   You didn't lose it.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.440]   You just had to get the hassle of going to drop it off somewhere or the hassle of putting
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.640]   it out front.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:10.320]   So at this salon, this major ad executive, he's a big deal ad executive, said he's been
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.320]   arguing that advertising will die.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.320]   It's a process of dying.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.600]   And he said, "What's going to happen here is we're going to send a forcing upon you
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.080]   things you don't want.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.560]   We're going to know what you want and give you what you want."
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.280]   And said that way, that's not a bad thing.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.480]   But he also said, "This will freak you out.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.480]   Trying to freak you out here."
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:30.760]   Then he said, "We'll know 18 months before you know that you're going to buy a house."
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.760]   Right.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.760]   Okay.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.360]   This is like, this is Shoshana Zuboff's contention in surveillance capitalism.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.720]   Who went, who just went, "Preserk full moral panic in the New York Times this week."
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   Jesus.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.720]   I haven't even dreamed of it.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.720]   I'll have to read that.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:52.520]   Her fear is not, she says that's the end stage is where they start predicting your behavior
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:56.040]   and influencing your behavior because they know so much.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.240]   It gives me what I want.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.240]   I'm okay with it.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.240]   Somebody gets me out of the trouble.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.120]   I guess if I got batteries in the mail and saying, "We think you've used enough AAA batteries,
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.120]   you probably need some more.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   Here's some more."
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.120]   I'm fine with that.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.760]   If it's something that they know I use all the time, but again, just...
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:10.760]   And you have...
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.760]   What if they send you...
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.080]   Well wait, wait, what if they send you Amazon basic batteries as opposed to Durace all
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.080]   batteries?
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.080]   Then I got a problem.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.080]   I like Amazon basic batteries.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.080]   I'm just saying that Durace sold my...
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.080]   This is a great article.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:26.840]   I can't remember where I made it was the Times about where Amazon basic batteries come from.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.840]   Where do they come?
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.840]   Oh, I did it, Daddy.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.320]   Yeah, it was an interesting story.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.920]   Well, the question is, are these good batteries?
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:39.160]   It's pretty much made by the same people in China that make all the other batteries.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.880]   So yeah, I mean, but you could just send it back.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.880]   I don't know.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.240]   I don't like the idea of stuff being sent to me.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.240]   It even feels...
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.720]   And by the way, yes, that's what Zuboff is talking about in this opinion piece in The
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.720]   Times.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.720]   You are now remotely controlled.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.720]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:58.160]   Surveillance capitalist control the science and the scientists, the secrets and the truth.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.160]   I don't know if she's...
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.920]   I will say that if I see enough ads for something, it's highly likely that I will investigate
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.920]   it and buy it.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.920]   I'll be like, "Oh."
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.920]   You'll at least look at it.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.000]   Oh, thank God I'm retizing works.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   I'll at least look.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   I'll give you that.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   I'm not going to give you that.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Like those Instagram style ads for like, you know...
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Oh, they went too well.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Yeah, they're really...
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   I'm just fine.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.240]   And you know, those work well because why?
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.720]   Because they send you ads that they know are going to work.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.720]   Target it.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.720]   They're targeting.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   Well, it's about relevance.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   So I saw...
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.720]   I got into a Twitter test yesterday.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.720]   I just...
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.720]   I just responded to a tweet disagreeing with it.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.520]   We're going to say, "You're what?
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.680]   What would it be great if all the platforms agree they would not or would they recommend
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.680]   anything?"
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.800]   And I said, "Then you're back to mass media.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.120]   It means you have no relevance.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.360]   You're going to get bombarded with messages that don't mean anything."
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.920]   And you're going to be more desperate screaming at you.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.640]   You're going to get more click bait.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.640]   And it's going to be worse.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.640]   It's what we escaped from mass media.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.080]   I hate mass media.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.520]   We're not a mass.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.520]   And that's what we've escaped.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.040]   Now, is it done stupidly?
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.360]   The boots you look at follow you around for two months after you've friggin bought them?
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.360]   That's stupid advertising.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.880]   It's not surveillance advertising.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.560]   It's dumb advertising.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.920]   And they've got to improve that.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.400]   Are people using it badly?
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.400]   Sure they are.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:16.680]   But in the long run, knowing me as an individual rather than presuming them in mass can yield
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.480]   better things for me.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.320]   Just depends on whether you're smart or stupid about how you're a better manager.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.040]   But to allow it is that's moral panic.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:30.160]   To say, "All algorithms are bad and should be outlawed."
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.080]   You've got to agree with me here.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.840]   That's an example of moral panic.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:35.840]   You talked about...
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.280]   You don't think anyone's saying that though.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.480]   I could show you the tweet.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.480]   You talk about...
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.280]   All algorithmic recommendations should be banned.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.760]   What's that?
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.480]   All algorithmic recommendations should be banned.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.480]   Sorry, Ian.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.280]   But there's an answer to the challenge.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.280]   That's what was said.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.280]   Go ahead.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.280]   Sorry.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:03.800]   No, I was just thinking about what the big game is coming up this Sunday, they're trying
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.080]   to put more ads in to the game.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.080]   Did you hear that?
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.080]   Are they really?
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.080]   There's like $2 million for Superboy.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.080]   What game is that?
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.760]   What is your game Sunday?
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:19.480]   There's some Superboy football game with a little local team playing in it.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.480]   I just...
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.280]   I happen to dance.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.480]   I heard they played somewhere down the road from here.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.080]   I'll be wearing gold and silver.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.480]   I saw your outfit.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.480]   You want to put that picture up?
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.480]   I saw your outfit.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.480]   I don't know what picture you're talking about.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.480]   So it's the 49ers versus the...
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.480]   Kansas City Chiefs.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.480]   Oh.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.280]   Oh, bless you, Stacey.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.280]   Bless you.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.280]   Bless your...
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.480]   But most of our audience doesn't know Hand Egg very well.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.080]   They don't care for it.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.080]   I am looking forward to the commercials, by the way.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.080]   I can't wait.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.080]   I didn't say it about the...
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.480]   Bill Murray's going to be back with Groundhog Day.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.480]   Oh.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.480]   Oh, really?
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.480]   Yeah, Google's commercial is up on the rundown.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.480]   Do you want to look at it?
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.480]   I hate to show them because I feel like it's a spoiler.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.480]   It's a three-hand key.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.480]   It's a three-hand key.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.480]   It really is.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.480]   No, we can't show it.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.480]   You too, Google would not take us down on YouTube for showing a Google ad.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.480]   They sure would.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.480]   Really?
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.480]   Ha!
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.480]   Ha!
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.480]   Ha!
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.480]   I do like those Google ads, but I'm starting to feel like they're a little manipulative.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.480]   They also have a Black History Month on which is very good.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.480]   I put both of them up on the rundown.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:31.480]   Have you noticed I saw this article in The Verge by John Porter last week.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.480]   Google's ads are indistinguishable from the search results.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.480]   Look at that word.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.480]   Look at that word.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.480]   What is this?
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.480]   Okay, that's a tough stuff, Jeff.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.480]   It's funny here.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.480]   I've been begging them to just use the word "add" and there it is.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.480]   "Add."
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.480]   It could be clear.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:52.480]   When I am searching, I am searching, I'm on a mission.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.480]   I'm a woman on a mission.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.480]   I put my search term in and I want to click the top result.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.480]   And that is default what people do.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:04.480]   That word is even small.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.080]   I know it says "add" right there when you're looking, but when you're just like, "I need
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.480]   the recipe for corn dogs."
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.480]   It actually does say "add."
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.480]   It does say "add."
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.480]   It does.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.480]   Why am I not getting any ads?
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.480]   Because they put you back to the other one.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.480]   Maybe I'm on a break.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.480]   The search for "mecylo-themiumia."
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.480]   Oh, there it is.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.480]   It says that.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.480]   Google also wants to know where I am so they can show me my shoes.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.480]   Oh, look at that.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.480]   The second word of the ad.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.480]   When it found out where I am, as they said, "Oh, no, let's go to these stores instead."
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.480]   But these aren't labeled as an ad.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.480]   That's just map data.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.480]   You can actually buy spots on the map now.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   So those are ads?
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:51.480]   Not all of these are ads, but they have on the maps now, they do have ads.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.480]   True, but does that show open search that you can buy?
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.480]   I don't know if it shows up in search.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.480]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.480]   I know it shows up.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:05.480]   I do a lot of restaurants near me when I'm traveling, and I notice that I do now get ads for things.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.480]   They are maps.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.480]   I can't get ads as you save my wife.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.480]   I want ads.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.480]   Okay.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.480]   You're not searching for things like...
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.480]   Give me a second more on a phone check.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.480]   Phone charger.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.480]   That's a good one.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.480]   No ads.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.480]   Unless the Amazon result is in it.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.480]   No, it's not.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.480]   No, it's the most popular search for...
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.480]   I'm getting more...
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.480]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.480]   Android Full Locker.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.480]   I think the ad blocker is doing it.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.480]   Are you using Brave for Chrome?
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.480]   Brave.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.480]   Then don't use Brave.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.480]   I'm in Chrome trying to...
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.480]   This is...
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.480]   Brave's going to block that.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.480]   That's why I love Brave.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.480]   Brave blocked it, but I'm trying Chrome and I'm not getting it on Chrome right now.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:50.480]   So the point of this article was that typography now on Google Search results is designed so
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.480]   the headlines...
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.480]   These used to be different, right?
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.480]   They used to be blue or purple or something.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.480]   Very vibrant.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.480]   There's some a color color thing.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.480]   Whoa.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480]   Excuse me.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.480]   Sorry.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.480]   I know, I'm sorry.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.480]   I'm sorry, you guys.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.480]   It's raining.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.480]   That just shows how relaxed you are with us and I appreciate that.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.480]   This is coffee.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.480]   I may need a second cup.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.480]   It's raining in Seattle.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.480]   How long has it been since it rained last?
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.480]   Ten minutes.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.480]   This morning.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.480]   The snow melt...
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.480]   It was only like two days ago.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.480]   Did the snow all melt?
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.480]   Yes, the snow did melt.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.480]   It was only there for like three days.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.480]   Hey, congratulations.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.480]   Google has announced its 10th messaging service.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.480]   Happy birthday to you.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.480]   It's going to...
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.480]   Oh, no.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.480]   It's double digits, baby.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:44.480]   It's going to unify Gmail, G Drive, Hangouts chats.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.480]   This will be for the G Suite folk.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.480]   Wait, so, but weren't non G Suite people supposed to lose Hangouts, but people still have Hangouts?
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:56.480]   They have Hangouts meet and Hangouts chat.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.480]   That's what they did.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.480]   They split it out.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.480]   So the new mobile app, this comes from Kevin McLaughlin writing in the information.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:07.480]   The new mobile app, which is currently being tested internally at Google, includes Gmail,
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:12.480]   Drive, Hangouts meet, Hangouts chat.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.480]   It sounds to me like a Slack clone, but Google already has its own.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.480]   It's their second Slack clone.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.480]   10th messaging service, their second Slack clone.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:30.480]   God, the Lord.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.480]   That's so diplomatic.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.480]   For years, Google has had one of the more confusing collections.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.480]   It's a little confusing.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:44.480]   We don't have G Suite at the Pruitt home, but we use Hangouts and been waiting on it to die
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.480]   and it hasn't gone away.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.480]   I use it because I'm on Google Fi.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.480]   I think it's not going to die on Fi.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.480]   I hope not because it's my message.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.480]   It's the message.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.480]   I could use Android messages, but I don't because I want it to work on iPhone.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:03.480]   It's the only one that works across platform.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.480]   The unified communications app for business.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.480]   What does it mean to put different apps within one app?
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:13.480]   Do I get into the app and then say I want to do this for that?
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:18.480]   If you're in Slack right now, synergy.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.480]   The idea is it becomes the hub of all your business activity.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.480]   When you're in Slack, if you put a Google Drive link in there, the document's there.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:30.480]   You can open the document if you want to chat with somebody by voice or video.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   You click them and it can do that.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.480]   The idea is to merge it all into one tool that's always running.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:41.480]   My Gmail, when I'm in Gmail, I get all of my chats down one side.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.480]   I have all my drive.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.480]   Isn't that already?
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.480]   Some of that's extensions that you might have added.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.480]   I can't remember.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.480]   Okay.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.480]   Which are native and which are extensions, but it's a very common extension to add.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:28:01.480]   I'm just like, I feel like my email is my center or my unified communication platform.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.480]   Yeah, but now they'll have an app.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.480]   Wouldn't that be better?
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:15.480]   No, it's too much.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.480]   Oh, I was going to say, okay, I'm going to backtrack just a minute to the privacy conversation.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.480]   Dude, because I'm moving along at a rapid clip.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.480]   So please.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.480]   No, don't.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.480]   I don't try to get rid of this.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.480]   This is going to come up with our ring discussion.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.480]   It's going to come up again.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.480]   So we might as well just hit it.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.480]   Just keep privacy is the thread here.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:38.480]   Private, this idea about Facebook with ring with all of these things telling us more.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:44.480]   I'm a huge fan of transparency, but at CES, I did a conversation with Colin Engel, who is
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.480]   the CEO of iRobot.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.480]   And he pointed out to me, he was like, that sounds good.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:54.480]   But whenever we talk about our privacy features on our marketing or on the box, our sales go
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.480]   down.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.480]   He's like, consumers don't want to think about that at all.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.480]   Just pretend it's private.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:04.480]   So it's not so well, in their case, I think he's actually trying.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.480]   We had a big discussion about their time.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   Well, he's selling kitty taxis in home kitty taxis and nobody wants.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:16.480]   If you're buying an in-home kitty taxi, you don't assume that there's any privacy implications.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.480]   So raising that specter by putting it on the box, people go, well, what do you mean?
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.480]   My iRobot is watching me.
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.480]   And in fact, it does map your house, right?
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.480]   So that the kitty doesn't have to push off underneath of so far.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.480]   So when it maps your house and it shares that data with, I shouldn't say it shares that data.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:39.480]   When you connect it with Google or an Amazon device to say, hey, go clean the kitchen,
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.480]   he actually explained to me.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.480]   He's like, we don't actually share the maps with them.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.480]   We just take that instruction set and then tell the device where to go.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.480]   So they're not giving it two ways.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:57.480]   So that's what they have to do what Apple does, which is, you know, Apple says, when we do face recognition,
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:03.480]   we only store a digital representation of your face, which by the way is the only thing a computer can store.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.480]   Yeah, I'm kidding.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.480]   Thank you.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.480]   Thank you.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.480]   Oh, really?
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.480]   You don't actually take my face and put it in the phone?
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.480]   Okay.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.480]   Appreciate it.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.480]   Yeah, thank you, Apple.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.480]   So that's what Apple does.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.480]   Apple says, we only store a digital representation of your face.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:22.480]   They also say, and this is another very powerful phrase on device.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.480]   I don't know if it's a powerful phrase to normal people, but to people like us,
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.480]   on device face recognition as opposed to in the cloud.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.480]   That's important for us.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.480]   And that's, by the way, what I wrote about saying, but it sounds like he doesn't want to even say,
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.480]   "Hey," because you know why?
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.480]   Does it?
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:41.480]   He doesn't want to put his claim on the box saying, "All the home mapping data we collect is stored on device."
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.480]   That scares the hell out of people.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.480]   I don't think about it.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.480]   I don't think we're doing that.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   I don't think about it.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.480]   Okay.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.480]   That's fair.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.480]   But I mean, that's a lot of people do.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.480]   That's because it's a vacuum cleaner.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.480]   Possibly, but I think also people don't want, it's a hard thing to think about privacy.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.480]   You're like, "Ah, I know I want this cool feature."
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.480]   And then you're like, "Mm, do I want to get out?"
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.480]   Never mind.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.480]   We're going to the Ring Story yet.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   Let's do this one.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:13.480]   This is from privacyinternational.org, an open letter to Google, to Sundar Pachai.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   Do you, Mr. Pachai, will you, the underside agree with you?
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.480]   Privacy, see this is what they, this is the sneaky.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.480]   Mm, mm.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.480]   That's what my mom used to do.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.480]   Privacy cannot be a luxury.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.480]   Good editor right there.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.480]   Right.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.480]   Cannot be offered only to those people who afford it.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.480]   And yet, here comes the ripping.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.480]   Mm-hmm.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.480]   Android, this by the way, is kind of shameful.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:41.480]   Android partners, these are people who use Android to make devices.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:48.480]   Even phones that are branded at Google Play protect are installing apps that cannot be deleted
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.480]   which can leave users vulnerable to their data being collected, shared, and exposed with
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.480]   that their knowledge.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.480]   Or consent, these pre-installed apps can have privileged custom permissions that let them
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   operate outside the Android security model.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.480]   I always wonder when I see Facebook on my Samsung phone, I can't delete it.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.480]   I can only disable it.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   Right.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.480]   You know, what is, what, I don't, is Facebook getting any information from that presence on
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.480]   my phone, even if I disable it?
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.480]   Even if it's disabled, it makes you wonder if there's still a call for home on there.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:21.480]   So, permissions can be defined by the app, including access to the microphone, camera, and location
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.480]   without triggering the standard Android security prompts.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.480]   Users are therefore completely in the dark about these intrusions.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.480]   This comes from the problem of an open platform, isn't it, though?
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.480]   Hey, anybody can--
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.480]   Well, an Android phone.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.480]   Yes.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.480]   You can set their own rules on it.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:42.480]   But what they're asking Google to do is to not have Google say this is, you know, this,
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:46.480]   it should be an AOSP Android device, not a Google Android device.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.480]   It should be--
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.480]   Type of standardization.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.480]   It shouldn't have Google Play Protect branding.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.480]   It shouldn't have the Google Store on it.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.480]   It should just be an open source device.
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.480]   Well, speaking of things that consumers probably won't notice.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.480]   Right.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:09.480]   ACLU, the Afghanistan Journalists Center, Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain,
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:17.480]   because it really hits the Third World heavily, Amnesty International, and on and on and on,
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.480]   a long list of organizations--
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.480]   Dr. Go!
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.480]   --and EFF, signers to this.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:30.480]   It feels like Google probably should do something on those phones or make it--
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.480]   maybe just-- maybe they should say, hey, look, you're going to do Android.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.480]   You can't be bundling this crap on here.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.480]   That's--
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.480]   That is what they should do.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.480]   Then they'll get accused-- I agree with you.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.480]   Sorry, Stacey.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.480]   I didn't hear you.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.480]   Go ahead.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.480]   But-- you agree with me, but--
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.480]   I didn't hear what you because I was talking over you because I didn't hear you start talking.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.480]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.480]   I was just saying that's what they should do.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.480]   That was all I was going to say.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.480]   Oh, OK.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   Does it show?
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.480]   And I agree with you.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   Put it on the history books.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:06.480]   But I wonder, you know, in the unintended consequences world, will somebody then come after
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.480]   Google and say, Google's trying to control this open blood pressure?
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.480]   Is it not really open?
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.480]   It's not really open.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.480]   They're trying to lock it down.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.480]   They're breaking these rolls and knocking it down and they're preventing the competitive
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.480]   apps from going up there.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.480]   Have they gotten trouble for things like-- what was it?
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.480]   Treble?
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:25.480]   Because they have other, like, the patrolling of-- I'll call it-- patrolling of the Android
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:30.400]   Play Store or the Play Store rather, Google Play Store or things like Project Treble.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:36.040]   Those are all efforts to control and keep the platform stable enough to date for everybody.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.760]   And it's arguably for the health of consumers.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.440]   I think they're probably going to be OK.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.000]   But that's more-- yeah, I agree.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.040]   But that's more how the OS operates as opposed to what's allowed on it.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.040]   And so--
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.040]   OK.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.040]   Right.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.040]   So Google gets in trouble for trying to be God, because it is God.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.040]   To police the planet.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.040]   And I agree with you.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.040]   And I agree with Smart.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.040]   I agree with all of that.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:04.040]   But just seeing ahead, I'm going to bet that some-- why not-- somebody's going to come
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.040]   after it.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:10.840]   I think the same approach that Google took with-- was it called material design many years
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:15.840]   ago when they tried to standardize things and make it to where this is something a little
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.680]   more unified for every device out there.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:24.600]   Why not take that same approach and say, hey, we don't want this type of backdoor service
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.120]   running or bloatware, if you will.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.120]   Why not--
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:32.560]   What privacy international is asking is completely reasonable, which is Google should say, if
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:37.440]   you're going to do a Google branded official Google Play version of Android, you should
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.600]   not pre-install third party software.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.600]   Or allow--
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   Or else you're just your own--
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.600]   Allow others to be--
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.600]   --and others to be--
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.600]   Right.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:51.400]   Or-- well, and by the way, the research paper has a long list of companies that are doing
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.720]   this.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.640]   And it's everybody, including Google, by the way.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.640]   It's everybody.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.960]   It would be nice if Google could just say, hey, look, if you know--
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.000]   Maybe just say, hey, you should be able to uninstall it.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.920]   I would love on my Samsung phone to be able to uninstall Facebook.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.920]   So take me to--
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.320]   So take me down memory lane ramps here.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.520]   I don't have to deal with this at all anymore.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.520]   Because I have--
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.520]   Did you ever sit and lose your teeth?
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.520]   No, Davey.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.520]   No, it should be banked to get money.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.840]   So I have a Chromebook, and I don't have to deal with any of this stuff.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.760]   In the land of PCs, which I just don't know anymore, do you still have the problem there
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:32.200]   that we complained about loudly in years past uploadware?
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.040]   Yes, you still do.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.040]   In fact--
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.040]   And you--
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.040]   Orsels.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.800]   There's an even worse thing starting to happen in there in Windows 10.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.480]   They're putting ads on it.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.480]   So Wordpad now has an add.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.480]   Really?
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.360]   So then the ads are in the start menu and stuff like that.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.360]   You can remove it all.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.360]   There's a--
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.400]   There are a number of buttons you have to turn off to prevent it.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.400]   You've worked, Max.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.400]   I know.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.400]   Windows is not--
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.440]   A lot of the themed laptops out there, even like this device I have here, that's themed
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.440]   as a creator's workstation.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.440]   From MSI.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.440]   Right.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.440]   It put in their own little--
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.440]   Oh, they all do it.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.680]   Creative software, if you go to hell do that.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.640]   Oh, but to Microsoft's credit, they created a program called Microsoft Signature PC that
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:14.640]   has no crap where nobody signed up.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   I mean, there's like a small--
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.640]   It's four of them.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.640]   Signature PCs.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.600]   Among-- Microsoft's are among them.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.600]   But--
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.600]   Do you still hear?
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.600]   I don't hear that--
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.880]   I think on the show going way back, Gramps.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.080]   We used to scream about that.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.520]   I hear people here.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.080]   Do you still hear people complaining about it?
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.400]   Because you obviously don't listen to Windows weekly.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.920]   I have reviewed it.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:41.880]   I have a review unit right now in the host office that's got some bloatware on it right
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:42.880]   now.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.880]   Oh, it all comes--
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.880]   Is there like a bloatware score that you put on these things?
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.880]   No.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.880]   What's where?
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:51.560]   But they all come with antivirus demo versions and stuff like that.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.560]   I actually have--
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.560]   System Optimizer.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:38:01.600]   I have a script that I run on all new Windows PCs that gets rid of all the installed-- list
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.680]   the installed programs, removes them.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.360]   This is why all the nerds love you.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.360]   This is a PowerShell script.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.520]   Yeah, that gets rid of everything.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:14.960]   And because it's just not-- I run this before I will.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.080]   And they're used to even be-- I think there's still is.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.080]   Let me see.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.440]   A software program called PC Decrapifier.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.640]   Yeah, I remember that.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.640]   I remember that.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.800]   I think it's still around.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.880]   I doubt they're out of business.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.880]   I remember that.
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.880]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.880]   I said Decapifier.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.880]   That's a different thing.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.880]   If you do cap it, do your PC.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.520]   The PC Decrapifier.com.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.520]   So this just--
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.520]   More souls.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.520]   I've only forgotten about all this.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.120]   I've totally forgotten about this hassle.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.120]   Yeah, those were the days.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.320]   And do you still have a registry?
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.320]   Oh, yes.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.320]   Yes.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.320]   Oh, man.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.320]   Oh, you poor guys.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.320]   Oh.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.880]   Oh, but it's gotten better from a registry standpoint.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.880]   If it's still there, it's not better.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.200]   I'm not in there nowhere near as often as I had to be in there.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.400]   There are no XP days.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.440]   Oh, that was the scariest of the world, wasn't it?
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.000]   Going to the messing with the registry?
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Oh.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.040]   Change this value to zero and then your computer--
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:14.160]   I remember doing autoinject.bet and config.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.000]   That's hishfires.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Yes.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   And this config.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.640]   You mean config?
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.640]   Yep.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:21.640]   Yep.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.120]   Which those were the days.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.120]   Yep.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.560]   But it has gotten better, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.800]   Like I said, those last couple of review units that I received, they had the bloatware
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.800]   on there.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.080]   But it wasn't always obvious.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.760]   You just happened to check your tray and see it hiding down there.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:44.760]   Well, the other thing is we used to have to be peÃ±urious about storage space to get
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.760]   rid of stuff.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.000]   But now that's so cheap memory so cheap.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.040]   It doesn't affect us negatively in that realm of these.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.640]   $300 laptops have terabyte drives on them now.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:59.120]   By the way, I just want to point out--
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.480]   Mushar buying Apple stuff.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.520]   There is a certain ageism in these ads.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:08.800]   So Apple's holiday ad involved a poor grandpa who's lost his wife and the little kids made
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.800]   a little video.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.280]   And he cried at the end.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.280]   Of course, I cried at the end.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.440]   It's kind of like a good commercial.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.240]   That opening of up the movie up, which is the most tear-jerking.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:22.960]   Apparently, that's exactly the plan for Google's Super Bowl ad is to make you cry over low
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.960]   red.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.960]   Grandpa can't remember things.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.560]   He's the most remembered thing about his wife.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.360]   And he tells Google to remember this for him.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.360]   And Google does.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:33.640]   If I don't play the sound, Karsten, can I play the video?
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.120]   I can do a dramatization.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.120]   Yes, please.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.120]   Yes, please.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.120]   We have dramatization.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.120]   That would be one of those.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.160]   OK, so let me play it.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.200]   And then you do-- how are you going to-- yeah, you play it.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.200]   And then you--
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.200]   I wanted it.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.200]   OK.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.200]   Show me photos of your vibrato.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.200]   Oh, yes.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.200]   Oh, she hated that bus stop.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.200]   Hey, she--
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.200]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.200]   That was when Loretta was seeing that other guy.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.200]   Remember that, Google?
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.200]   Oh, Google.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.200]   They looked terrible.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.200]   We were at a little town.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.200]   We went to Alaska, Loretta.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.200]   We came to that place.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.200]   It was so freaking cold.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.200]   Oh, I used to love to go to Sitka and hold dead fish.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.200]   Any--
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.200]   She loved that.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.200]   OK, Google, remember that, please.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   So when you tell Google to remember it, what happened?
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.200]   Don't you remember it.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.200]   What happens?
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.200]   Don't you see pictures of me and Loretta?
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.200]   Will you please?
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.200]   She wish.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   Oh, I wish I--
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.200]   That is the script, actually.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.200]   That's what he's saying.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.200]   I watched it earlier.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.200]   Somehow, Loretta turns into Ingrid Bergman from Casablanca.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.200]   Oh, show me our favorite movie, Google.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.200]   Oh, OK.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   And then--
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.200]   Here's what you told me.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:36.200]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, and then it lists all the things you tell me to remember.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.200]   Yes.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:41.200]   Oh, and so you just have to say, remember this about Loretta.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.200]   Because right now I've asked G to remember to--
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.200]   To tell me to take out the trash today.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.200]   So in 20 years, can I be like, how much day did I take out the trash?
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.200]   Can I remember that?
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.200]   I love taking out the trash.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.200]   Now my IOT's thing, do it all for me.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:02.200]   They burn everything and we have no trash.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.200]   The world is better.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.200]   I hope this episode doesn't cause anyone to drive off the road.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.200]   So it happens as--
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.200]   So diplomatic, and--
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:18.200]   So was that the commercial world where they drove off the road?
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.200]   Well, I did the--
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.200]   No, that's the Mr. Peanut, that's Mr. Peanut.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:31.200]   Which, by the way, because of Kobe Bryant's untimely death, they had to pull all of the social media prep for this ad.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:41.200]   They spent huge amounts of money, not just for the ad, which involves Wesley Snipes and Mr. Peanut saves him from death, but dies himself in this horrible fiery wreck.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:46.200]   Which, by the way, seems like a very bad idea in general, but for an ad campaign--
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.200]   Marketing, marketing.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:55.200]   But they had this huge social media lead up to it, which they've now suspended because it was deemed in poor taste after Kobe's untimely death.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.200]   Kobe and all of the other eight others on that.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.200]   Yeah, yeah, which who never gets--
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   It's nice.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.200]   --Kobe and his daughter get remembered, and they were remembered, but there were six other people.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.200]   Mm-hmm.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.200]   The New York Times did a nice thing about their videos.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.200]   Oh good.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.200]   Thank you, New York Times.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.200]   Anyway, that Mr. Peanut thing looks dopey.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:14.200]   But I will be watching the Super Bowl for the ads, because I like the ads.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:19.200]   I was excited about the Sonata, the car pack ad.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.200]   Yes!
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.200]   That'll be fun.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.200]   Those are all--
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.200]   That made me very happy.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.200]   So they're going to do--
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.200]   --all of my friends in Boston.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.200]   See, I don't want to watch these or show them.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.200]   You didn't watch it?
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.200]   Oh, it's so--
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.200]   No, because I'm waiting for the big game.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.200]   I don't want to watch it now.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.200]   I'm not going to watch the Super Bowl.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.200]   I'm going hiking.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.200]   He's a little fashion.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.200]   He's a little fash--
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.200]   --we get a head of things.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.200]   It's OK.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.200]   It's a smack cat.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.200]   It's a smack cat.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.200]   It's a smack cat.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   It's a smack cat.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:53.200]   So they list on iSpot.tv all the advertisers in their ads.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:58.200]   And there's going to be Bill Murray, Groundhog Day, Reprise.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.200]   There's going to be--
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.200]   Is there Bloomberg and Trump?
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.200]   The list?
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.200]   Yes, Bloomberg and Trump are both on the list.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.200]   Well, who's doing the pack the car?
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.200]   I can't remember.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.200]   Hyundai Sonata.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.200]   Hyundai, that's right.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.720]   Hyundai, to make you think that they are not a Korean car company, is going to do a whole
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.920]   thing celebrating the Boston accent.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:19.920]   Featuring Chris Evans--
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.920]   --not an accent.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.200]   Most people want celebrated, but sure.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.200]   Chris Evans will be a--
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.200]   --Hey.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.200]   --John Krasinski from The Office and Rachel Dratch.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:34.480]   Rachel Dratch and David Ortiz, who actually probably doesn't either have a Boston accent,
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.200]   but he didn't play for the Red Sox.
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   The Smat Pack.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.200]   They're going to be talking about the Smat Pack feature in the Hyundai--
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.200]   --David Ortiz.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.200]   --David Ortiz.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.200]   Big Poppy with an accent.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.200]   --Big Poppy.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.200]   --Boston accent.
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.200]   --Yeah, those actors are all from the area.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.200]   I don't know if they're all from--
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.200]   Are they?
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.200]   Yeah, they're all from places--
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.200]   --Oh, yeah, four famous New Englanders.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.200]   There you go.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.200]   Oh, there you go.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.200]   Yep.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.200]   Yep.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.200]   [Sighs]
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.200]   It's funny, mostly because--
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.200]   --because the people in it.
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.200]   But yes.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:10.200]   --I think they're going to use Bill Murray, and they're going to do a shining reprise as well.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.200]   Mm-hmm.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.200]   Mm-hmm.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:16.200]   I cannot believe everyone in the chat room is discussing about ad spoilers.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.200]   You guys, they're advertising.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.200]   No!
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.200]   I do not want to see any ads before their time.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.200]   The big game is all about the ads.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.200]   They're old-fashioned.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.200]   No, the big game is all about the big game.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.200]   No, it's not.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   It's about the halftime.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.200]   You know, there's a fun fact.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:38.200]   There is 11 minutes of actual action in a three-hour NFL game, 11 minutes.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.200]   You know what the rest of it is?
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.200]   Ads.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.200]   It's not 11.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.200]   It's more like 15.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.200]   [Laughs]
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   Well, baseball has about 30 seconds, so--
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   [Laughs]
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.200]   Well, there's a lot of action, but there's only 30 seconds of interesting action.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.200]   Who is the halftime show person?
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.200]   It's J.Lo.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.200]   I don't recall.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.200]   It's J.Lo and I forgot the other person.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.200]   Somebody else never watched--
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.200]   We don't want to give you a spoiler leave.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.200]   It's not Billy Eilish.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:08.200]   No, it's okay to know who's going to play, but you wouldn't want to watch the concert beforehand.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.200]   All right.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.200]   Oh, Shakira!
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.200]   Shakira?
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.200]   Shakira?
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.200]   Shakira?
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.200]   Shakira?
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.200]   That's right.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.200]   That's right.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.200]   I love it when Stacy gets excited.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.200]   She gets all--
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.200]   [Laughs]
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.200]   I watched that.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.200]   Yeah, no, it's going to be good.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   Hips don't lie, that's right.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.200]   [Laughs]
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:28.200]   Umm, professional darts.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.200]   So, the red doorbell.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.200]   Yes?
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.200]   Yeah, we should talk about that.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:40.200]   So, the expose of that, which I take seriously, but I saw-- I see this and this happens in Europe with GDPR.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.200]   There's a leakage of this definition of privacy.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.200]   So, they share your IP address.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.200]   Okay.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.200]   Well, they say more than that.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.200]   They also--
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.200]   I know.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.200]   PII in the GDPR.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.200]   PII.
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.200]   Personally, I identify more information.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.200]   IP address is counted as that.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:00.200]   I know, and I'm saying that's absurd.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:05.200]   And then EFF picks it up, and in this list of things they shouldn't share is your IP address, and they know better.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.200]   Okay.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:11.200]   So, they're not complaining about your IP address in and of itself.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:17.200]   They're complaining about the fact that you combine your IP address with your device, your device identifying aspects--
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.200]   Your name!
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.200]   Your name!
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.200]   Your email address.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.200]   In one case, yeah.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:33.200]   And if you share certain geolocation and sensor data from your phone, the idea-- and this is something that I've talked about forever since, like, 2012--
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:44.200]   PII has been-- it is such an obsolete definition in this era of being able to piece together people just from bits of data.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:51.200]   So, if you cannot-- any sort of data when grouped with other data can become PII.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:55.200]   And we have to update our legal definitions for that.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:05.200]   Like, if you think about when the New York Times did their thing about, "Hey, this is where Donald Trump-- we wandered around Florida based on his phone's geolocation."
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:12.200]   Those are the things like you take geolocation from a set of phones, you take publicly available information, suddenly you have PII.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:19.200]   And that's the point that our laws haven't-- they haven't adapted to that.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   And we need to get them to that place.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.200]   So--
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.200]   I will say.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:31.200]   I agree with Jeff that by itself the IP address is basically public information, because you are using it as you browse around.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.200]   Every site you go to knows it.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:39.200]   But when you pair it with other stuff, it suddenly becomes an important marker of everything you do.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.200]   So, that's the problem.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   But it still needs-- Stacy makes an excellent point.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.200]   Put that in the history books too, then I said that.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:56.200]   But even then the problem is that if you say, "Okay, IP with anything else can be dangerous, then let us get rid of everything."
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.200]   This is the practicality of a website has to know your IP address.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:07.200]   Now, why Ring is sharing with a company in a financial relationship, I believe that should be transparent.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:11.200]   I believe they should be thinking about the benefit to the user, and so on and so on and so on.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:16.200]   I think the point is right, but the risk here is just that there's been a creeping--
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:23.200]   because Stacy's right, the definition is limited, it's now crept into anything could be bad and anything could go wrong.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.200]   And there's no more nuanced discussion in these countries.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:32.200]   So, I would say that the issue here isn't necessarily--
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.200]   I mean, PII is important.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:38.200]   I would say this-- I feel that EFF or EFF-- hold on.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:43.200]   EFF was a little disingenuous by tackling some of these,
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:54.200]   because some of these third parties that are-- the data is being shared with are things to make sure your app or your content is rendering correctly on a certain type of device.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:59.200]   They called out like Crashlytics, they called out Mixpanel, branch.io.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:02.200]   Those are not-- I would say they're not nefarious.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   What they are is they are trackers, and they are pulling in a lot of data
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.200]   that can be used to track people individually.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:15.200]   What I think is really the issue though, and I think they glommed on to ring.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.200]   Everybody does this.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:19.200]   I have Crashlytics running on my site.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:25.200]   They got it on a ring because it was already in the news and people have it and blah, blah, blah.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:33.200]   But the real issue is we've built an entire ecosystem around tracking people to serve them ads.
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:41.200]   I know we talk about this all the time with the way the web is built, but this is a good time to say,
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:50.200]   "Hey, we built a whole web based on tracking? As we put more computers in more places, do we want to maybe figure out some other way to do this?"
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.200]   What's we're doing?
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.200]   What we're doing, isn't it?
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.200]   It's saying it's doing that.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.200]   I don't know how well it's doing.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.200]   How are they doing it?
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:02.200]   Other than cutting off third party?
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.200]   Other than that, how are they doing it?
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:09.200]   Well, actually, actually, they're cutting off other mechanisms of doing this.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.200]   Okay.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:17.200]   Well, so is the unique user any worse than having your IP if your IP really changes?
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.200]   No, what they're saying is that unique user, it's more than just your IP.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:24.200]   It's both you, it sends her data from your phone.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.200]   So it's like where you might be in time and space.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.200]   Well, I'll give you a really nasty example.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.200]   I quit Facebook, right?
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.200]   Because I don't want to Facebook to track me.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:38.200]   But if I had a ring doorbell, it doesn't matter if I have a Facebook account, they still send all that information to Facebook.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:46.200]   So this is part of those, what do they call them, dark dossier that Facebook collects of people who are not Facebook members.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:52.200]   I don't know what Facebook would want to do with that information, but the fact that they're getting it is kind of bothering me.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.200]   This is fine.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.200]   Thank you.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:59.200]   This is the graph API.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:12.200]   This is really the real problem is that this data is being collated by a variety of companies being shared with multiple companies and ultimately builds quite a significant dossier on you.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:24.200]   It's that that is being built, shared and aggregated across so many places and ultimately it is being used to try to get you to either engage or to get you to buy things.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:33.200]   But that's, I mean, how do you respond to Jeff saying, well, yeah, but when you rather have appropriate ads than meaningless ads?
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:43.200]   I would rather have appropriate ads when I need to have an ad, but I'm not sure I need to have an ad every place.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.200]   Like I certainly don't want to have an ad.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:59.200]   But that's what I'm saying is we have lost sight of other business models that could work and maybe trained us to respond only to advertising, I guess.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:04.200]   I am going to tell you what, I'm not going to have an ad in this show.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.200]   That's it.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:10.200]   We're doing this one for free folks.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.200]   No, no paywalls going up right now.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.200]   Pay up.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:15.200]   We're going to go on here.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.200]   That's it.
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:17.200]   Pay wall.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.200]   No ads on this show.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.200]   None.
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:20.200]   Zero.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:25.200]   Well, there might be a little bit of mention of the last past studio thing, but that no other ads.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:30.200]   No, just that.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:34.200]   I did that for very long.
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.200]   I wouldn't have much of it.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:39.200]   I'm not saying that you shouldn't have your media content.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.200]   You're different.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:46.200]   No, in the sense that we wrote an article about a world where there were ads on every surface.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.200]   Right.
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.200]   And we were rapidly approaching that.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:54.200]   You can't go anywhere on the table, on the chair, inside the car, everywhere.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.200]   There's ads.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.200]   And that's not.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.200]   Well, and they're also to serve what they feel would be better ads.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:07.200]   They're pulling more and more data about people to more finely slice and dice their wants and needs.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:18.200]   And that is a problem because the flip side of that, the darker side of having that those kind of dark dossies or digital dossies about people is they can be misused for surveillance.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.200]   Or to do things that are maybe a little bit more nefarious.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:39.200]   But as a consumer, that's just a regular everyday consumer, does this not put us back into position of spray and pray ads that are coming to us as we use services that we don't pay for, whether it's television, radio or whatever.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:43.200]   And all of a sudden you're hearing ads about a smoking patch.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.200]   I don't smoke.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.200]   I think there will.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:49.200]   I still get ads for stuff.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:51.200]   I don't want to see drug ads at all.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.200]   I see them on the news channels constantly.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.200]   I feel like they're old.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.200]   I don't want to see it.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.200]   I was going to say it's because you're a man of a certain age I imagine.
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.200]   No, no, it's the news.
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:01.200]   It's broadcast.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.200]   I wouldn't be seeing them over here.
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:03.200]   It's stuff.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.200]   Right.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:09.200]   What's the price we're going to pay as a consumer if we want to use these free services?
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:12.200]   I don't see those drug ads on as I surf the net.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:16.360]   I don't think we're going to give up free services altogether.
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.520]   And I think there's going to be a mix of these models.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:24.320]   But I am concerned about the level of detail that companies are allowed to collect and
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.520]   trade on people.
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:34.440]   And I'm concerned when they go beyond advertising to get to things like, "Hey, now let's use
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.640]   this to price our products a little bit more competitive."
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:37.960]   Are you saying regulation?
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.280]   Why would that be bad?
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:41.280]   That's a good thing.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.320]   The precious price pressure to lower the price.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:44.320]   Oh, no.
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:50.200]   I'm talking about pressure on consumers in terms of like, "Oh, they're here.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:53.280]   I mean, it's kind of like selling you a $20 umbrella when it's raining, right?
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.920]   Oh, you mean surge pricing.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.920]   Yes.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.920]   It goes both ways.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:04.240]   And I will tell you in the smart parking kind of examples and congestion things, on average,
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.920]   prices do go down.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.520]   But when they go up, they go up real fast.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:15.880]   Isn't though that Adam Smith's invisible hand working perfectly, supply and demand?
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.920]   Do you really want the invisible hand working perfectly?
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:22.640]   That assumes everyone starts out with the same situation.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:27.200]   I felt so money-python-esque.
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:32.200]   For those listening, there wasn't an invisible hand, but it wasn't so invisible.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.200]   It was visible.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.200]   For the listening, it wasn't visible.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:36.600]   Oh, that was quick.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.840]   That was Howard Stern's show speed.
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:46.360]   I honestly feel like we are in late stage capitalism.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:51.840]   And you have the head of LinkedIn declaring capitalism dead as he goes to his bank and
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:53.600]   accounts his billions.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.640]   He's pulling up the ladder.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:57.640]   That's all.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:58.640]   Exactly.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.640]   Bingo.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.040]   Stacey, can I ask you two questions?
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.040]   Sure.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:06.520]   And in this order, please.
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:14.240]   First, what is the possible use that anybody could make good or bad of sensor data?
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:19.160]   And then second, thus, is what's your fear about what can be done with it?
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.240]   So sensor data can include things like--
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.240]   Why is it being collected?
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.800]   What do they want to do with it?
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.160]   And then what could they do with it that's bad?
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.800]   I guess that's maybe the better way to put it.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:29.880]   So sensor data can include things like, hey, is my phone in my pocket?
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:31.880]   Is it gyroscopic data, for example?
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:33.680]   It can be geolocation data.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:37.120]   So where am I in the world?
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.120]   What am I doing?
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:39.120]   Am I walking?
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.120]   Am I running?
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:41.120]   Am I sitting on the couch all day?
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:42.880]   Where am I getting as a problem?
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:45.240]   But am I sitting?
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:46.240]   Is that a problem?
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.240]   Are we all set?
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:53.200]   If you're sitting for 18 hours a day, your insurance company is going to say, yeah, that's
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.200]   probably not good.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.200]   All right.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.200]   That's fair.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:58:03.480]   So granted, you know, there-- again, I don't have problems with--
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:09.080]   I just-- this data can be used very invisibly.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:14.240]   Like, people are not necessarily aware of the decisions that are being made about the
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.680]   data that is being collected about them.
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:22.520]   And that's a problem because they can't counteract any misassumptions or not misassumptions.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:23.520]   What's the word I'm looking for?
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:24.520]   What's the word?
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:25.520]   Geez.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.520]   Pause positives.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:27.520]   Misassumptions.
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.320]   Yeah, the conclusions that may not be--
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.320]   Impermeable.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:35.960]   It's definitely not a problem.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:37.640]   I'm like, it's a great word.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.920]   It's not what I'm after.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:44.640]   So they don't know what they don't know, but they're being judged on these things.
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:49.520]   It's kind of like when you don't understand how your credit score was developed.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:57.160]   And even some of the outrage against your social media profiles being used for that
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:58.160]   sort of thing.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.880]   And you're like, well, hey, is that right?
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:00.880]   Should we be doing that?
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:06.320]   Do we have any outside correlation studies to say, yeah, this actually matters?
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:12.520]   Or is this just somebody's bias that is coming into play and negatively affecting people?
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:17.320]   These are the things I'm worried about.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:25.440]   Vice.com leaked documents expose the secretive market for your web browsing data.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:32.840]   This actually is a disappointing story about a company called Avast, which is a free antivirus.
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:34.800]   Lots of people used.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.560]   I hope they don't use it anymore.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:39.480]   Avast people got it pre-installed, I believe.
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:43.920]   It required a company called Jump Shot.
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:50.160]   Avast, when this free antivirus is installed on your system, tracked everything you did.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:54.040]   Every program you ran, not just the websites you visited.
[00:59:54.040 --> 01:00:01.400]   Everything you did, Google searches, locups of locations, GPS coordinates, LinkedIn pages,
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.120]   YouTube videos, porn sites.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.680]   It's possible to determine from the collected data what date and time the anonymized user
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.800]   visited you porn and porn hub.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:14.880]   In some cases, which search terms they entered into the porn site, which video they watched.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:20.200]   It doesn't include your name, but as we well know, anonymized data can often be de-anonymized
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:24.000]   if there's enough data there.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.280]   Jump Shot shared this data, or some of the data it knows, with Expedia IBM, Intuit,
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:35.080]   L'Oreal, and Home Depot.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.160]   There's a vast market for this kind of data.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.160]   I know that.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.120]   Well, once again, there's a bit of a vast market for that before the internet.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.200]   I'm not saying that's like either of these.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.200]   But we've got it so good now.
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.160]   It's an issue going on.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.120]   Well, and that's more of your data being collected.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:58.880]   So you get a better picture, a more higher resolution, and it's cheaper to crunch it.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.960]   So for to develop a high resolution profile, if anyone would take a lot of time.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.760]   And you couldn't really do it because you just didn't have the data points.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.760]   You have to be like...
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:11.120]   If I gave you the zip, they could say, "Well, you probably subscribed to these magazines
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:16.560]   and have this kind of car, but it's only probable with a 40 or 50 or 60% probability."
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:19.720]   Now they can say exactly what car, they know what car.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.520]   They know exactly what I subscribed to.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.480]   They know where I am, what I'm doing.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.280]   But I guess the real fundamental question is, what are the harms of this?
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.000]   Were we upset when Jay Edgar Hoover, like, weaponized the...
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   Was it the FBI?
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   Yes.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   For his own political ends?
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   I mean, he told Martin Luther King would kill himself.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   That's what he can do with this data.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:48.960]   You get that level of detail with many more people, much less effort, much less money.
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:54.160]   And it's available not just to one crazy dude in power, but to anybody.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:59.360]   Well, but the reason that that was bad was because he was in power.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:05.120]   If he's just a marketer, big deal, but it's because he could use the power of the federal
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.120]   government.
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.840]   You don't think the government can't call a vast and say, "Hey, I really want this data
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.680]   on this person."
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.080]   Google's charging for it now.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.080]   Come on.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.080]   Yeah, Google stopped giving it away.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.080]   Google's not going to make money on it.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.080]   Let's be clear of that.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.080]   Google's charging.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.400]   What do you so many people are asking for it?
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.400]   They have.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.520]   They're charging a fee to try to create some friction for people asking.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.520]   Right.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.960]   $45 fee is not going to make it a little more.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:34.680]   And for some jurisdictions that may cost a little bit of money, for some folks.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.680]   Not everywhere.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.120]   I wonder if this will stand.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:42.920]   I would imagine there might be some court that has something to say about this.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:47.160]   They're charging law enforcement for responding to search warrants in subpoenas.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.080]   It seems to me you can.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.160]   If a cops came to my door and said, "We have a search warrant to search your apartment,"
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.160]   I said, "That would be $45."
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.840]   They might say, "No, it won't."
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:01.320]   Well, but if they came to your landlord and made them change the lock on your apartment,
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.320]   then yeah.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.160]   Well, I think if it's a legal subpoena, I'll leave it.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:11.400]   When I ran local news sites, it was costly.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:18.000]   The worst we got was police departments would constantly file search warrants in subpoenas
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.080]   and all kinds of stuff like frivolous ones.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:24.240]   Somebody, no, no, no, what was happening was somebody on the force was complaining about
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.720]   a bad captain in our forums.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.200]   And so the captain would come and use all of his legal authority to come after and try
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:36.120]   to get whoever the miscreant who did the shortened lunch hour.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.960]   And we would get tons and tons and tons of them.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.960]   But it was expensive because we had to do with lawyers every time and all that.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.920]   So I think what Google's trying to do is put a little friction up.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.960]   Yeah, that's the speculation.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:53.960]   It apparently is legal if you sustain costs to pass those costs back along.
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.840]   Google says, "We're not going to ask for reimbursement and life-threatening emergencies
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.840]   or child safety investigations."
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:00.840]   Right.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.840]   But I know I'm going to hear the stories.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.840]   I'm going to hear the stories.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.840]   Google's making money off giving government automation.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:08.920]   Honestly, while a lot of companies refuse to do it, they don't want that impression.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.920]   Right.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:10.920]   Right.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:16.680]   But it is something like other companies, the telecommunications companies, they charge
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.920]   unless it's in the case of missing children.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.920]   Right.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:20.920]   I mean.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:25.240]   Deputy Police Chief of Minnesota said we don't see it impacting us too much.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.000]   We're only using these warrants on major crimes.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.280]   And the fees seem reasonable.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.040]   Unlike when you go as a journalist, you try to get a FOIA request and they're like, "It's
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.040]   going to charge you a...
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.040]   We're going to charge you a...
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:41.040]   To print out these pages."
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.320]   Facebook does not charge.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.280]   Microsoft and Twitter say they're legally allowed to request reimbursement but declined
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.200]   to explicitly address whether they charge law enforcement for such requests.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:54.920]   Cox and Verizon have done so for several years, according to the New York Times.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:58.360]   So yeah, that's a kind of a non-story story.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:04:59.360]   Makes sense.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.360]   The only...
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:05.160]   But I brought it up because Jeff wanted to understand why it matters that these companies
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:11.080]   have this sort of level of detail about people because there is interest from law enforcement
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.840]   and the powers that be in the case.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.840]   I always say government is not your protector of privacy.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.600]   Government is the worst enemy of your privacy.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.640]   Didn't government can do something with it?
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:26.160]   Didn't we learn from the Cambridge Analytica scandal how powerful this data is and how it
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.920]   could be weaponized?
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.400]   Actually, Ant, the opposite.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.480]   Every single person I know in this field has long made fun of Cambridge Analytica.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.800]   They were snake oil salesman.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.800]   They were nothing.
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:41.840]   Bases posted on Facebook two weeks ago just said Cambridge Analytica didn't have any
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:42.840]   secret sauce.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.440]   They didn't know diddly.
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.040]   And so the...
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.880]   But the media narrative is, "Oh my God, Cambridge Analytica alone got Trump elected."
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:56.760]   No, it was a sales pitch from Kushner and company and they're full of junk.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:57.760]   But that's the media narrative.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.720]   But didn't they still get just...
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:06.240]   I guess it is pretty common analytics though just to see what the temperature or the mood
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.640]   of a particular demographic is during a certain period.
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.640]   Well, yeah.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:19.680]   And this is the two-edged sword here that the platforms were getting a lot of crap for
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.680]   an all-out damn data.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:24.160]   And people loved the fact they had a platform.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.200]   Everybody saw that at the time as a good thing.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.200]   It was a wonderful thing.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:31.240]   "Oh, I can go use this platform and we want to free academics."
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.600]   "Oh, it's Cambridge University for God's sakes."
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.000]   Academics, fine.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.720]   And the unintended consequence.
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:43.880]   My favorite example of late, this is a Benedict Evans point that he made in his newsletter
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.040]   which I highly recommend.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.920]   I think Ben's brilliant at this stuff.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:53.760]   When the LinkedIn decision came out what a year ago saying that LinkedIn tried to stop
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:54.760]   scraping of LinkedIn.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.800]   Oh yeah, I remember that.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.400]   And the court case said no.
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.880]   It's basically been made public to this extent that it's there.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.760]   And however I get it, I can get it and I can scrape it.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.360]   Everybody said, "Hallelujah, freedom of the net.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.360]   Wonderful thing."
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:11.680]   Well, then when the New York Times did its expose of, "Oh my God, they're scraping your
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.920]   photos and using them."
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.840]   Well, LinkedIn decision enables that, right?
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.760]   So there's always going to be an equal reaction in these cases.
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.800]   And people are going to find things to exploit.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.800]   And so the problem I have is the...
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:29.400]   If we only did this one thing, we'd solve the problem is always simplistic and dumb.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:33.600]   It doesn't deal with the potential misuse that continues, the unintended consequences,
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:39.080]   the intended consequences and all that.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:42.840]   I got a moral panic for you.
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.600]   The Interior Department...
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.520]   Of course, Macy's really worried.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.560]   Macy's worried for us.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:56.240]   The US Department of Interior is adopting a no-fly rule aimed at drones made in China or with
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.400]   Chinese parts.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:01.400]   I defy you to find a drone that is not made in China.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.400]   Not a one.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.400]   This is period.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.400]   Now, that's...
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.280]   I mean, you can't fly it.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:11.680]   It means though that the government will stop flying drones for the most part.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:17.160]   And that could be a big problem because drones save lives.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.760]   And now they actually help get work done.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:20.760]   Yeah, they save money.
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.760]   Not just cinematic stuff.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:22.760]   They just help get work done.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:27.680]   Interior officials recorded 10,000 drone flights in 2018, Alaska, Hawaii, Oregon, and California.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.040]   That was double the number the year before.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:35.280]   It saved at least $14 million by using drones instead of helicopters or airplanes.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:38.400]   Not to mention safety.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:42.800]   People die, as we know, die in helicopters and airplanes.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:48.520]   The US Forest Service firefighter died in March in a helicopter crash in Texas.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:52.200]   Now we're going to be putting people back in harm's way, said an Interior Department
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:53.680]   firefighter based in Alaska.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.840]   It's a real step back for us.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:01.760]   Oh, but thank goodness the Chinese won't be able to see our forests.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:08.320]   I guess the theories Chinese made drones are somehow spying on us.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:11.320]   The worry is of spying our back doors.
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:17.960]   I will say that a lot of people use drones for running for oil pipelines and tracking for
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:21.560]   leaks and such like that, a long valuable infrastructure.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.080]   So is it secret exactly that those things are there?
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:26.480]   I don't think so.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:31.840]   But having a more detailed view, I think we're a little paranoid.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:35.080]   But I also think the data is out there.
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:40.400]   Chinese manufacturer DJI makes the most popular top of the line drones.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.400]   The matrices, the drones.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.400]   The matrices.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:43.400]   The matrices.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:44.400]   The matrices really big.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.400]   The phantoms.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.040]   And all those are things.
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.040]   I use Autel.
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.040]   They're another Chinese company.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.040]   There you go.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.680]   DJI said it's disappointed that the new Interior Policy quote inappropriately treats
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:05.720]   a technology's country of origin as a litmus test for its performance security and reliability.
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:10.160]   They say it's a politically motivated agenda to reduce market competition and support
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:12.240]   domestically produced drone technology.
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.240]   Regardless of where it is domestically.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.960]   We're going to have to create a domestic drone industry.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.520]   Shoot us an email here at Twitch.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.640]   Is parrot in the?
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.200]   I thought parrot was Chinese also.
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:30.960]   They were the first drones, you know, quadcopters I saw.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.760]   But yeah, I bet they are.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:41.160]   But this seems to me like I understand the security issue, but it just feels like it's
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.880]   more about politics than anything.
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:43.880]   It's very very much.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:44.880]   100%.
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.880]   It's a harassment.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:49.520]   By doing this, I hope it does.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.360]   The problem is the policy isn't based on policy.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:58.640]   When policy is based on self-interest, whether national or personal, it's French.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.640]   That's the problem.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.640]   That's the problem.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.640]   Parrot is French.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.280]   That's the policy based on personal.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:08.920]   I do not want any French drones flying over our oil pipelines.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:13.560]   That's like you cheese recipe from the sector.
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.560]   I want Liberty drones.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.560]   Liberty drones.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.600]   No, these French drones.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.760]   I love the flag Mr. Kim is putting on.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:28.600]   I bet though many of the parts are made in China, which didn't make them all so.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.600]   Yes, there will be Chinese.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.600]   Yeah, there's still big things.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.360]   We're back to that again.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:38.720]   Even with this whole banning, if you will, one would say, "Hey, well, maybe this will
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:48.360]   spark an interest of getting something here homegrown and whatnot," but I doubt it.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:54.680]   Interesting story about ransomware and Bitcoin.
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:12:01.200]   There apparently was a ransomware case.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.680]   A company fell victim.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:09.120]   Actually, no, I'm sorry.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:15.080]   The none of it government, that's a province in Canada, was crippled by Bitcoin ransomware
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.280]   in November.
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:23.000]   Fortunately, they were insured by a UK insurer, which paid one point.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.360]   Actually, they negotiated down to $900,000.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:29.240]   They were asking for 1.2 million in Bitcoin.
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:35.640]   They ended up paying a 96 Bitcoin ransom.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.440]   They didn't sit right with them.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.240]   They followed the Bitcoins.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.680]   This is a problem with Bitcoin.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:47.920]   They're traceable to Bitfinex, a major Bitcoin exchange.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:51.760]   They say, "We now want to know," actually, this happened in November, the court documents
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:52.760]   have just become public.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:59.880]   We want to know who owns those coins and we want them back.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:05.400]   The document, unfortunately, the document trail ends December 13th.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.640]   Maybe we'll find out more.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:12.080]   It's interesting because it doesn't necessarily mean the holder of those Bitcoins is the person
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.680]   who committed the ransomware crime.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.240]   In fact, I bet it's unlikely.
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:20.040]   They probably sold it to somebody who brought it to Bitfinex and tried to turn it into
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:22.440]   cash or is holding it there.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:28.080]   It's an important point, just for you, ransomware fellas out there that Bitcoin is completely
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.080]   traceable.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:32.680]   You've got to be a little bit careful about using Bitcoin.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.080]   Monero, apparently, is not.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:40.960]   I once sat with somebody from the Federal Reserve at a, I think, it was a Qualcomm event,
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:45.400]   and they talked about how they love Bitcoin because it is traceable.
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:46.880]   They're like, "Yes, it's wonderful for us.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:50.960]   I don't know why people keep thinking that it's super special and that we can't track
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:51.960]   it.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.360]   None of it is not a province.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.360]   It's a territory.
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.360]   Oh, okay.
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.760]   It's in the far north of that.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.760]   Oh, yes.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.760]   It's in the Arctic Circle.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:05.440]   It's one of the provinces we don't know.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.920]   Everybody gets to catch one.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.320]   Here's also an interesting story.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.320]   I said this to you in Thompson.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.880]   Hey, there's some good news about Brexit.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:21.480]   The UK, which will be exiting Britain momentarily, has said they will not adopt the new EU
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.480]   copyright law, including artists.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:26.520]   I think it's actually Article 15, but anyway.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.520]   Well, there's two articles.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.520]   There's 15 and 17.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.520]   It used to be 13 and 15.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.520]   That's right.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.520]   They moved them around.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:41.120]   The UK was one of the 19 nations who initially supported the copyright directive, but universities
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:48.280]   and science minister Chris Skidmore has now said it will not be implemented in the UK.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:49.280]   So...
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:50.520]   I'm for one happy.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.520]   It's a horrible law.
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:53.520]   Yeah.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:57.400]   It's the one that says you can't have a meme that's more than 120 pixels across.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:58.800]   That's the German...
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:02.240]   No, that's the German localization of it.
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:05.480]   That's the new Leistung Schutzrecht.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:09.320]   120 pixels across for a meme.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.400]   And what was the other limitation?
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:13.240]   How many is set like three seconds for video?
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.960]   Three seconds for video.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:15.960]   Wow.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:22.920]   And the French version of it is telling Google you have to pay to print a snippet in your
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:23.920]   Leistung Schutzrecht.
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:24.920]   Oh, that's right.
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:25.920]   I remember to sniff it.
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:26.920]   Which Google's going to say, we're going to take out the snippets.
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.920]   We'll put the link in.
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:28.920]   We'll sniff it.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:29.920]   We'll sniff it.
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.760]   Eric Duckman on our chat room says, "I, for one, welcome a meme ban."
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:33.760]   That's a good point.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:37.680]   There's something I know is, do your kids do this?
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.920]   This is a thing now.
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.160]   And I find it really disturbing.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:45.680]   Instead of conversation at the dinner table, kids will show each other meme pictures.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:46.680]   No.
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.240]   I don't sit there like that and then go.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.280]   Oh my god, that's my daughter's life.
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:55.160]   They sit there and, well, they trade memes back and forth.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.560]   And then they say them.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:02.400]   Like their conversations aren't, they devolve into meme speak.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400]   It's something weird.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.320]   Away from the dinner table maybe, but not at the dinner table.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.880]   C. Leo, this is the return to oral culture.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.240]   It's not text.
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.240]   It's images.
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.240]   Audibles.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:19.800]   Is that a polary award?
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.720]   It's one your editor might cut out.
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:26.640]   It's not a word you can say.
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.400]   Thank you, Mr. Bundy.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.840]   It's fun.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:31.840]   It's very cute.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.560]   Like not the word, the meme exchanges.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.560]   I am permeable.
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.760]   Imperviable too.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:49.840]   Buzzfeed news editor Ben Smith going to the New York Times.
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:55.440]   It's been snapping up all the best people in the blogosphere.
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.600]   They have all the money.
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.600]   Good for dudes.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.600]   That's where all the money is.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.320]   Ben is brilliant.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:04.200]   So Dave, the car used to write it a wonderful call on media equation.
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.200]   He passed away.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.840]   God, it's hard to believe five years ago now.
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:09.840]   Somebody else is writing it.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.640]   We don't know who he is because somebody reads it.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.640]   Great.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:14.640]   So nice guy, but nobody reads it.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:15.640]   John Herriman?
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:16.640]   No, no, no, no.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:17.880]   That's the tech version.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.400]   It's what's his name.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.400]   It says it there, I think.
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.400]   Yes, says it.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:22.400]   I can't believe that.
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.400]   He's forgotten.
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.400]   You believe that what he knows.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.200]   I feel so bad for this.
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:27.200]   Jim Ruttberg.
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:30.280]   I feel bad for you, Jim.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.160]   He has moved to a position called writer at large.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.440]   That means we don't know what to do with you.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:39.880]   You got it.
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:40.880]   You cover stuff.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:43.640]   Actually, it could be a great job.
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:45.880]   Ben Smith will be the new media college.
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:52.080]   So Ben took the land of lists and cats and added onto it.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:57.320]   And added onto it a very serious news organization, excellent news organization.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.560]   It's so confusing.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.560]   As always, Ben.
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:00.560]   Yes, isn't it?
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.560]   It doesn't make me money.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.720]   Because I still think of it as the land of memes and cats.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.760]   I'm always like, dang, this is a good story.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:08.760]   I'm always surprised.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:11.320]   And I've been doing this for years.
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.800]   I've been quoting BuzzFeed news.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.240]   And I feel like an idiot.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.160]   But in fact, he's just a bit broader.
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.160]   It has some good stuff in there.
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.880]   The good news is a respectability.
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:24.360]   Bad news is there's still no business in serious news.
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:28.000]   And so I worry about Ben leaving for the future of BuzzFeed news.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   We'll see.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000]   We'll see what John Purdy does.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:36.360]   But Ben himself is a wonderful writer, ex-politico, wonderful thinker about media.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:40.000]   And I'm really happy he's made this move.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   I think it'll be great.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   Could be bad as very media walkish inside.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   Well, no, that's us.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.040]   Media walkish or us.
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.680]   It is good news for times.
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:51.000]   It's kind of bad news for BuzzFeed.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000]   Maybe.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   I don't know.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   Maybe there's somebody.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.560]   Back to memes and cats.
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:56.560]   Back to memes and cats.
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.880]   No, they still have like Matt Honan and some other people, don't they?
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:00.880]   Well, they have really good.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.880]   They have good news.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.880]   They have good news.
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:06.760]   BuzzFeed news is quite separate from the listicles.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.880]   The listicles look at it this way.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:13.240]   The listicles are the bridge column and sports section that subsidize the news.
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.240]   Okay, guys.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:18.320]   As long as Jonah Purdy, the founder, can see it that way and convinces shareholders of
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.320]   that.
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.480]   Hallelujah.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:24.240]   But if he ever gets bought by private equity or the open market, they're going to say
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.040]   that new stuff doesn't make any money.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:28.960]   Yeah, maybe it makes everybody a little happier.
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:31.040]   But they don't even like news anyway.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:36.840]   I mean, I at the salon where I was this week, the media people.
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.840]   Sorry.
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.840]   They're calling from the salon.
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:40.840]   What was that?
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:41.840]   It was buzzer has news.
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:42.840]   We told you.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:43.840]   We told you.
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:44.840]   We talked about how we.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:45.840]   We had him house rules.
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:46.840]   Because he's buzz machine.
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:47.840]   Oh, hey, no, rule.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:48.840]   No, rule.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:49.840]   Has he had a mess?
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:50.840]   It's only one rule.
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:51.840]   Let's see.
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.840]   Show off as letting people know that.
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:57.440]   So there were people in the room, major advertisers and major agencies in the room who
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:00.320]   said, well, we just don't want to advertise it.
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:04.760]   Number one, they don't want to advertise on news because it's dangerous, which is really
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:05.760]   dangerous for the democracy.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:10.760]   If they do advertise on news, they say, we don't want to advertise on opinion.
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:18.800]   So opinion becomes lethal for advertising support, which is why we have no ads today
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.280]   because we have opinions.
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:26.800]   Normally, here I would take a break.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.440]   I've decided.
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:31.440]   No more ads.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:36.440]   As somebody said on Twitter, just watch us go down the tubes.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:37.440]   Tech in 2020.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:42.240]   Finally, the moment you've all been waiting for, how many slides in Benedict Evans annual
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:44.600]   slide deck?
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:46.640]   It's not as many as very Mieker.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.160]   Not nearly as many numbers.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.080]   It's more strategic thinking.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.080]   But you think this is better than Mary's because it has--
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.120]   Well, because it's more thought provoking, I think.
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:58.080]   Mary Mieker gives you ammunition for the strategy you want to sell.
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:01.480]   This pushes you to think about strategies you haven't thought of.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:03.360]   So he's going for the next S curve.
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.280]   And what he's arguing is the next S curve is going to be regulation.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:07.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.720]   Well, a lot of people think that, including--
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.520]   That's going to be a giant structural regulation here.
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:15.440]   But he says that we really have connected almost everyone now.
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:20.080]   Of 5 and 1/2 billion adults on Earth, 5 billion have a phone, 4 billion have a smartphone.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:25.960]   Actually, I just read an article singing the praises of Elon Musk's new Starlink enterprise
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:31.880]   to put gigabit internet within every reach of every person on Earth who said only half
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:34.120]   the population is on the internet.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.360]   And I think that's probably accurate.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.360]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:40.960]   But really, that other half onto the internet will be a game changer.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:41.960]   So we'll grant you.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:44.880]   We might debate when that happened.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.680]   But fully online, about three years.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.560]   Can you go dashing through some of the slides?
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.240]   New technologies come in S curves.
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.240]   You can dash through somebody's eyes.
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.840]   Stupid, exciting, boring.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.600]   Smartphones have now reached boring.
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:57.960]   They started as stupid.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.000]   Then they were exciting, but now they're boring.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.360]   But they're all the same.
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:04.760]   What becomes possible now that smartphones are mature and widely deployed?
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:09.080]   What is the next generational change?
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:17.800]   Because you get these S curves as like sub-cycles of a larger graph, mainframes, PCs, webs,
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:18.800]   smartphones.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.720]   What's next after smartphones?
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.480]   What happens when everyone's online?
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.520]   What are the next S curves?
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:28.320]   He says, oh, dear, regulation and policy.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:29.920]   That's all we talk about, really.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:30.920]   That is.
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:33.520]   What happens when everyone's online?
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:38.000]   Standing on the shoulders or giants, new possibilities at scale.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.720]   Every failed idea from the .com bubble would work now, said Mark Andreessen.
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.400]   pets.com, would that work now?
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:46.680]   Yeah, that's where we get our-- it got bought by everyone.
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.680]   I wonder if I do it online.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:48.680]   See?
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:49.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:50.680]   Do you get your kitty liner online?
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:51.960]   I get my food online.
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:58.200]   Bill Gross, Bill Gross, who started pets.com was a good friend of mine, found the key point
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:01.640]   in timing in success of a business is timing.
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.800]   And he did pets.com and it was too early.
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.000]   But yeah, now it works.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.920]   Yeah, look at podcasts.
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:12.120]   He said bitterly.
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:15.560]   "Front of mind e-commerce."
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:16.760]   E-commerce is big.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:19.800]   Now over half a trillion dollars.
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:23.400]   Wow, in e-commerce sales in the US.
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:32.680]   However, only 15% of addressable retail-- because addressable retail in the US is 3.6 trillion-- globally,
[01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:33.960]   the US is in the middle of the pack.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:34.960]   China is number one.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.960]   That's right.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:36.960]   UK is way ahead of us.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:43.960]   UK and Singapore way ahead were then France, Japan, Germany, Russia, Brazil, India.
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.520]   Originally, e-commerce is books.
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:47.520]   Now it's everything.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.280]   Originally, there was one model Amazon.
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.160]   Now there's many models.
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.560]   Originally, I don't know, capital now platforms.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:55.560]   I don't know what that means.
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.480]   I'm not that smart.
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:03.760]   Powering the D2C explosion, direct to consumers.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:08.920]   All our advertisers are direct to-- or many of our advertisers direct-- those that aren't
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:12.800]   business to business, like Casper, that's direct to consumers, right?
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:17.800]   All the shaving brands that we've advertised direct to consumers.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.280]   So that's an absolute-- you see that here for sure.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:29.120]   Huge new, comer e-commerce platform, Shopify market cap 46 billion, striped 35 billion.
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.120]   Shopify has--
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.400]   I didn't realize how big Shopify is.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.040]   I had no idea either.
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.040]   I don't know either.
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.040]   Shopify.
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:36.040]   Well--
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:37.040]   You probably do.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:40.040]   You just don't realize that when you buy random stuff online, that's the back end.
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.040]   Right, right, right.
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.040]   So it's behind it.
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:43.040]   Shopify inside, yes.
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.040]   That's the thing.
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.040]   It's the--
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.600]   But I don't know that I'm using the platform.
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:50.600]   I mean, I imagine Amazon really is the big competition, right?
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:51.600]   Yes.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.080]   Meanwhile-- oh, speaking of which?
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:57.240]   Amazon, its revenue grows 30% a year.
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:58.640]   Only half is direct e-commerce.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:24:59.640]   Yes.
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.880]   But it's more than just plain e-commerce.
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:06.160]   Platforms for others are now a third of Amazon revenue.
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:07.320]   AWS marketplace.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:12.320]   We know marketplace is almost half of Amazon.
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.920]   Ads.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.560]   Amazon is a platform.
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.400]   Ten billion dollar search ad business.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.440]   New retailing, new taxes.
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:22.440]   Oh, boy.
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.960]   That tax thing still bugs me, though.
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:25.960]   Why?
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:28.200]   I mean, you have to have taxes to pay for services.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:31.600]   I'm not sure I paid more in taxes than Amazon did.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:32.600]   Oh, that tax.
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.600]   I thought we were talking about taxes on Amazon.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.600]   No, this is not--
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:39.400]   Just saying that Amazon is charging you now.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.920]   It's like the grocery store charges you for end cap.
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:42.920]   All right.
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:43.920]   Amazon is charging for that.
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:46.160]   They can now put on because they own the marketplace.
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.160]   Right.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.160]   On--
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:49.160]   Yes.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:50.160]   Sorry.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.160]   I was like, wait a minute.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.160]   Yeah, I'm--
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.160]   So instead of tax, use the word VIG.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.160]   Yeah, there we go.
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.160]   The VIG.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.160]   The VIG.
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:58.000]   If you're not-- this is interesting.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.280]   A new route to awareness.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:03.200]   If you're not paying rent for a store or anyone, how do people hear about you?
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.880]   Amazon sells placement.
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.880]   Booking an Expedia Pay Google.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.360]   Ten billion dollars.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:09.880]   But Macy's and Walmart does too.
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:13.880]   Meanwhile, there's Kylie Jenner's makeup business, which is worth 1.2 billion.
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:14.880]   Based on what?
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:15.880]   Instagram, right?
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:16.880]   Instagram.
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.760]   And then Instagram is not getting a cut.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:20.760]   Oh, this is good.
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:21.760]   All about Casper.
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:22.760]   Get it wrong.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:23.760]   Go to the mattress.
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:24.760]   It's a vacuum-packed mattress.
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:26.720]   It was a brilliant idea until everyone did it.
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:28.560]   There are now--
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:32.600]   Casper started it, but there are now 175 online mattress companies.
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:33.600]   Yikes.
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:34.600]   You know, it's funny.
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:39.560]   When they went and did their valuation, their IPO, they're looking now at-- instead of a
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:43.600]   billion dollars being a unicorn, they're at like 750 million.
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.600]   Oh, I love you, Casper.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.600]   Or big buzz.
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:47.600]   I love you.
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:50.120]   There's been a couple of times I'd hear in a mattress ad.
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:55.120]   I don't necessarily know if it was Casper or not, but the ad started out with, yes,
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.880]   we are on a podcast and yes, we are a mattress company.
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:58.880]   Oh, boy.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.880]   Oh, boy.
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:00.880]   It's all by--
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:04.240]   So it's clearly watering down, you know.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:09.440]   Is Casper a tech company or is it a mattress company with a website?
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:13.520]   The Internet is not the first time retail has had a new format, department stores, warehouse
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:17.080]   clubs and super stores, now e-commerce.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:21.400]   Half our store sales involve an online journey, says Eric Nordstrom, and over a third of our
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.720]   online sales involve a store experience.
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:24.720]   That's interesting.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:29.120]   So they go hand in hand, right?
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:35.880]   Retail is in as binary as online or offline.
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.680]   Front of mind TV.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:40.120]   Oh my God.
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.160]   Annual change in US pay TV subscriptions.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:46.200]   Boy, if I'm Comcast, I'm looking at this thinking, oh, yay, yay.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:51.160]   It was zero, close to zero for 2011, 2012, 2013, and then it went negative.
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:55.160]   It is now negative 7% annually.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:56.160]   That's a draw.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.160]   Comcast, is it worried?
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:59.360]   That's why they bought NBC way back in the day.
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.960]   They bought their content company now.
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:03.680]   And an internet company and you still need to get the internet.
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:04.680]   Right.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.440]   That's the thing and they still have the pipes.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.160]   And that was the big thing.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:14.840]   When we started looking at pricing way back in the day for like the broadband caps, which
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:15.840]   are a thing still.
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:16.840]   Unfortunately.
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:20.640]   When you looked at their pricing, they were basically trying to reach the pricing of the
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:21.640]   triple place.
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:25.400]   So keeping it and they've done a good job actually maintaining it about 120 bucks a
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.400]   month.
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:27.920]   I tell the court cutters that all the time.
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:29.920]   You can cut the court, but it ain't going to save you money.
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:30.920]   No.
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:31.920]   Because they've been preparing for this.
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.160]   How about this one?
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:39.440]   Pay TV share of US teen viewing hours is down half in the last three years.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.680]   Netflix and YouTube, particularly YouTube going up.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:44.880]   Netflix actually trailing down a little bit.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.040]   The TV looks the worst.
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:48.320]   That's pay TV.
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:50.200]   The content wars have begun.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:54.680]   A third of US content spending last year came from streaming companies.
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:55.680]   Shocking.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:56.680]   Look at Netflix.
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:00.560]   Almost $15 billion.
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.160]   Shocking is a third of US television production.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:13.800]   You know, I will say it's kind of heartening to see old shows come back.
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:19.440]   Like, you know, things feel a little, I mean, I'm trying to think of shows.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.480]   You start to sound like an old timer.
[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:25.200]   No, I just, I'm so glad friends is back on TV.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:28.920]   No, but my daughter and I are watching 30 Rock.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:31.000]   And, you know, man, that's back.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000]   No, it's not back.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000]   It's just watching reruns.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.960]   Oh, we're just watching the reruns on, you know, but shit.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:39.800]   David Schwimmer just proposed an all black or all Asian friends.
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:43.320]   Yeah, because, you know, you can't really have friends with mixed race.
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:44.960]   That would just be a part of it.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:45.960]   Oh, gotcha.
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:47.920]   Stay on Twitch for a second.
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:48.920]   I do that.
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:49.920]   Ridley.
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:52.280]   That's called a imagination.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.280]   Twitch is already.
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.280]   Twitch.
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:55.280]   Well, that's an interesting story.
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:58.880]   Talking about new kinds of television production.
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:29:59.880]   Right.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.680]   New forms of video emerging.
[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:02.680]   Twitch.
[01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:07.440]   90% of live game viewing hit 1 billion monthly hours in the third quarter of last year.
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:08.840]   But guess what?
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:12.400]   It's only about the size of a UK TV channel.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:15.800]   Nowhere near Netflix or even total UK TV.
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:16.800]   Look at global.
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:17.800]   No, but it also changes the form.
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:19.800]   I mean, it's, and I don't watch Twitch, but it's not a bit rough.
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.640]   Have you seen the reality shows on Twitch?
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:23.120]   No, what do they look like?
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.120]   Weird.
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:27.000]   They're just people who have another people over there.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.640]   They're like Google that show.
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:29.640]   They're real reality.
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:31.200]   Art of vlogs is what you're saying.
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.440]   They're real reality.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.240]   Not this phony reality.
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:35.720]   I think they're sort of scripted.
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:38.520]   I think I'm going to do a Twitch feed.
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.280]   It's just me reading Twitter.
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:41.880]   Can I just point out?
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:43.200]   That's how Twitch began.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.840]   Twitch was originally Justin TV.
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:49.440]   Justin TV started with Justin Khan who wore a camera on his head.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.440]   I loved it.
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.280]   Walked around all the time.
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.280]   Backpack.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:56.320]   My justine followed because it was Justin TV.
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:57.920]   She did it too.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:00.760]   And that drove a lot of traffic.
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.240]   That was the original reality.
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:03.240]   Real reality.
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:05.280]   It's interesting it's coming back to Twitch.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.280]   We're, you know what?
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:07.280]   Humans are voyeurs.
[01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:09.960]   We like to look at other people and see what they're doing.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:10.960]   Sometimes.
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:11.960]   I think we do you.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:12.960]   Okay, admit it, aunt.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.600]   You're walking down the street nighttime.
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.520]   Windows open, curtains open, lit up.
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.520]   You look in the house.
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:19.520]   You see what they're doing.
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.520]   You see what they're watching.
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.520]   You watch.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.240]   No, I normally just smelled it because I'm wondering what you're cooking.
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:26.520]   Can you smell what the neighbors cooking?
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:27.960]   What are they cooking?
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:29.480]   I smell before I load it.
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:30.480]   True.
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:31.480]   I do that too.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:32.480]   He doesn't snoop.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.480]   He snips.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:34.480]   Right.
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:39.600]   Global effects from US streaming where budgets were always bigger, but they showed sold shows
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:40.600]   abroad.
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:41.600]   Netflix goes direct.
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:42.600]   I don't know.
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:46.800]   This is just showing the Netflix is the UK's biggest TV channel.
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.800]   Is he in the UK?
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:50.440]   Is that why he keeps talking about the UK?
[01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:54.360]   The life of Netflix space and most of the user growth is now outside the US.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:57.800]   That's only because they reach saturation in the US.
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:00.680]   There's a point beyond which you can't grow.
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:03.160]   In business, there are two ways to make money says Jim Barksdale.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:06.200]   You can bundle or you can unbundle.
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:11.600]   That is, I mean, that's one of the other.
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:12.600]   So it's interesting.
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:16.080]   And actually Ben Thompson's talked about this a little bit too, where we were a long time.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:19.600]   We wanted to unbundle everything and disaggregate everything.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:22.480]   And then it just kind of turns around again and you start rebunding.
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:27.680]   I would argue we never really unbundled because real unbundling, I would be able to say, I
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:30.920]   want to watch that show, that show and that movie.
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:32.240]   And you still have to buy it.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:37.160]   Well, we did music we did, but then we rebunded and it's been great for listeners.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:38.160]   Did it?
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:39.160]   Albums aren't back.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:42.760]   No, not albums, but you got to subscribe to a service.
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:43.760]   Right.
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:45.760]   You don't buy a nine-cent record.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.960]   What makes you say albums aren't back?
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:52.600]   That's because of the physical form or Steve Jobs, when he told the record companies, we
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:55.320]   are going to sell singles for 99 cents.
[01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:59.560]   The record companies hit the roof because artists and record companies wanted you to
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.360]   buy the whole album.
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:02.360]   Right.
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:04.560]   You didn't want to sell singles of every single song.
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:08.840]   They picked the hit single maybe, but they didn't, they wanted to sell the album and they
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:10.040]   thought we're going to die.
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:11.040]   Maybe they have.
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:14.240]   It certainly impacted revenue, but Steve said I'm doing it anyway.
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:16.040]   And under there's actively unbundled music.
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:17.040]   Yeah.
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.040]   You still get albums.
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:22.720]   I mean, look at, in albums, I would argue have gotten way more interesting.
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:25.520]   You can get like what they had to do with Lemonade.
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.520]   Look at that.
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:28.200]   Well, I know, but that's, that's kind of good.
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:30.640]   In my era, an album was two or three hits.
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:31.640]   Yeah.
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:32.640]   Much of a crack.
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:33.640]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:34.640]   And you had to buy it.
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:35.640]   Now you get more stories.
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:39.680]   The on-site said, look, we got to make, yeah, we got to make this worth people's while.
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:40.680]   We got to sell the whole thing.
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:44.400]   And I think Lemonade's a very good example.
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.520]   Now the great unbundling is coming.
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.040]   Next the great rebundling.
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:49.040]   Mm-hmm.
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.840]   The great Mandela.
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:54.360]   It's like the Big Bang, you know, it just, it's a cycle.
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:57.280]   Is that a tech company or TV company using a new channel?
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.280]   Okay, commerce, commerce.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:00.280]   So stay on that for a second if you would.
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.280]   Stay on that for a second.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.280]   Okay.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:05.160]   This is, this is my argument that the internet is not a medium.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:09.440]   That media become part of the internet, along with every other sector, that the internet
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:14.360]   as a, as a connecting machine and data machine becomes encompassing.
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:18.600]   So then, then the, the joke that everybody wants to be a tech company, because they
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:19.960]   thought they had some software.
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:25.240]   I, I, I, I was wrong, you know, in, in my conceptualization of that argument, or in
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.720]   the argument was wrong.
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:30.000]   But now every company is a tech company because we're all tech.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000]   Yes.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000]   Right.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000]   Right.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.800]   So what, this week at Google is thus about everything.
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:38.800]   Well, and-
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:41.000]   Does that mean we should talk about Google again?
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.400]   What we're trying to get back to.
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:46.400]   I'm just sad.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:48.240]   I'm just asking for a friend.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:51.080]   I'm just asking a friend in the chat room.
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.880]   A lot of friends in the chat room.
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:54.880]   Nope.
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:59.440]   I think you wouldn't enjoy this show if all we talked about was Google.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:01.480]   Um, would you?
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:02.480]   Probably not.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:03.480]   No.
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:04.480]   Okay.
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:05.480]   All right.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.480]   Right.
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:07.480]   I'm like, I, I'm getting a headache.
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.480]   So I'm like, I don't know if I enjoy the show, right?
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.480]   All right.
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:10.480]   This one, but that's just me.
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:12.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:13.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:14.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:15.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:16.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:17.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:18.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:19.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:21.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:22.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:23.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:24.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:25.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:26.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:27.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:28.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:31.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:32.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:33.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:34.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:36.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:37.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:38.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:39.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:40.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:41.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:42.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:44.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:45.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:46.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:47.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:48.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:49.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:50.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:51.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:52.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:53.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:54.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:55.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:56.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:57.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:35:59.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:00.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:01.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:02.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:03.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:04.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:05.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:06.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:07.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:08.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:09.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:10.480]   I'm just going to talk about it.
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:16.480]   This is good for Chromebooks, which is why Google's all in on this.
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:21.480]   It's also handy for anybody who wants to work offline in Drive.
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:28.480]   Apps like Docs and Sheets still open up unfortunately in the browser, so they're going to have to get those two into WAs.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.480]   Nothing burger.
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:31.480]   No, the Drive is there though.
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:35.480]   But every time I click on anything on that, I have it open right now.
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.480]   It has to go to the web because you're not storing the data yet.
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:39.480]   Nothing burger.
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:40.480]   Nothing burger.
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:41.480]   Nothing burger.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:42.480]   Well, here's a good example.
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:44.480]   YouTube music is now a PWA.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:48.480]   It doesn't mean the entire library of songs is downloaded.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.480]   But the app itself is.
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:55.480]   And if you have cached songs, well, if you have cached material, it's offline.
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:56.480]   Performings.
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:59.480]   But I can do that without PWA on Drive.
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:01.480]   Almost all of these offline.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:03.480]   Well, that's the first PWA.
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:05.480]   I have no registry.
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:07.480]   I have all my stuff.
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:08.480]   I have.
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:09.480]   Oh boy.
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:10.480]   Just rub it in, Ridge.
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:11.480]   Get it?
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:12.480]   Rub it in.
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:16.480]   Well, I have a coupon to our local ice cream store that just sent me on my Apple Watch.
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:18.480]   So I'll see you all later.
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:19.480]   All right.
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:21.480]   Stadia is a PWA.
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:22.480]   Photos is a PWA.
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:23.480]   Messages is.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.480]   Why do I like PWA's?
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:26.480]   But I love PWA's.
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:27.480]   I love the notion.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.480]   I love the notion.
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:30.480]   All right.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:31.480]   Yeah.
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:33.480]   I mean, well, it's kind of silly to have something that requires online access to be a PWA.
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:35.480]   You could in theory have cached many of it.
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:39.480]   I actually download all my Google Drive docs so that they're on my hard drive.
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.480]   Most power users do.
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:41.480]   Yeah.
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:42.480]   It's faster that way.
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:47.480]   You nailed on the head on the handle of the thing.
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:49.480]   Where's the rest of the change?
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:50.480]   Oh, here it is.
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:52.480]   Google is killing.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:55.480]   What's next on the block?
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:56.480]   Google won today.
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:57.480]   I don't even know.
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:59.480]   No one knew it.
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:00.480]   Yeah.
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:02.480]   I saw this and I was like, what?
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:06.480]   It's an app-based donation system you've probably never heard of.
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.480]   Haven't used and won't miss.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:09.480]   Like Act Blue?
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:10.480]   Yeah, I guess.
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:15.480]   It's an easy way to support nonprofit causes showing how money that was donated would
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:16.480]   have actually going to be used.
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:17.480]   Oh, this is a great idea.
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:20.480]   I remember it being announced, but they didn't necessarily push it.
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:23.480]   You've probably spent an hour on another show saying this is perfect and the wonderful.
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:27.480]   I think I remember actually it was a pick of the week at one point.
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:30.480]   The problem is Google did nothing to promote it.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:31.480]   Exactly.
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:32.480]   What?
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:36.480]   Google just threw a new service over the wall and didn't talk to anybody about it?
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.480]   What?
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:38.480]   No.
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:44.480]   So if you're technically brilliant or useful solution that they don't help people learn
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:45.480]   how to use this.
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:48.480]   But we do have our tenth messaging app ready to roll.
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:49.480]   Oh, little bit.
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:50.480]   There's that.
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:53.480]   It's all written in Wave.
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:58.480]   Google is rolling out a new media view for the Nest Hub.
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:00.480]   Smart, just because I love my Nest Hub.
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:01.880]   I have an Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max.
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.480]   I love them.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:04.480]   Yeah.
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:09.200]   You know, just the slideshow of pictures is good.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:12.080]   But now you can control playing music across a whole speaker group.
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:13.480]   Oh, who does that?
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:14.480]   Oh, yes, Sonos.
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:17.480]   Oh, we didn't discuss your big break.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:18.880]   What was the problem with Sonos?
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:20.480]   It wasn't a big victory.
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:24.480]   They didn't offer anything anyway.
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:27.480]   Sonos kind of soared a back down, but not really.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:31.480]   They basically said, look, we realize you're upset about this.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:33.480]   It'll work until it doesn't.
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.480]   Right.
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:37.480]   We're going to be nicer about how we phrase this for you.
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:38.480]   Wow.
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.480]   Until it doesn't.
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:45.480]   The new Nest Hub media view can control music across a speaker group or an individual device.
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:47.480]   You can see which devices are playing.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:51.480]   The room it's in, the content provider, the song, the show title, the artist's name.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:52.480]   This is great.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:57.480]   This is an interface to a Sonos-like multi-room experience.
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:39:58.480]   Sure.
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:01.480]   I'm going to get more Nest Hub devices.
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:02.480]   Although--
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:04.480]   Uh-oh, that jums a little bit.
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:06.480]   The speakers aren't great.
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.480]   I think it's pretty good.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:16.680]   It's not bad for the size, but I would like maybe some interface to a better stereo or
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:17.680]   something like that.
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:21.480]   That's one of the things Sonos did that I liked that Sonos connects.
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:24.480]   I'm not throwing out the Sonos.
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:26.480]   I'm just going to wait until it dies.
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:30.480]   So with Sonos, do you have double speakers in rooms or a single--
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:31.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:36.480]   Why, in some rooms, Jeff Jarvis, I have five speakers.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:37.480]   So we have a--
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:38.480]   A phytoponic?
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:39.480]   Four rich sound.
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:41.480]   I have a sound bar.
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:43.480]   I have surround sounds.
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:44.480]   I have a subwoofer.
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:45.480]   A woofer?
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:46.480]   Yeah.
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:48.480]   You have a woofer, just a subwoofer.
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:50.480]   A subwoofer.
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:56.480]   I have, in many rooms, I have, like the kitchen, I have a left and right play-five, but I also
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:02.480]   have the little portable Sonos moves because of Ant and his family.
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:06.480]   When they came over to dinner, I had to unplug the Sonos play-five to bring them outside and
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:07.480]   hope it didn't rain.
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:09.480]   But now I have waterproof Sonos moves.
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:10.480]   Oh, yeah, you go there.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:14.480]   I make them over music in everywhere, in the hot tub and everywhere.
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:15.480]   Sweet.
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:16.480]   I'll be there tonight.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:18.480]   Come on over.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:21.480]   You're shutting down.
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:22.480]   Crickets.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:23.480]   No, that's OK.
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:25.480]   I'm sad about Brad Fitz.
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:26.480]   We love Brad Fitz.
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.480]   He's leaving.
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:32.480]   He, his last project, 10 years working on the Go language.
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:38.480]   But Brad Fitzpatrick's been a big part of Google for many, many years.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:39.480]   Look at all the things.
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:45.480]   He joined Google in 2007, worked on the Social Graph API, webified the Google open source
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:50.480]   CLA process, worked on Gmail's back end for a bit, integrated personal address, book search
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:56.480]   into Google's main search, rewrote Memcache, which is a critical tool, not just for Google,
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:58.480]   but for everybody.
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:03.480]   The Google Memcache server continues to be used by many teams, fixed a bunch of performance
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:07.480]   bugs, and Android, when it first came out, worked on the Android framework team, added
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:09.480]   Android strict mode.
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:11.480]   Oh, God, it goes on and on.
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:18.480]   He started Go for various Android analysis tasks 10 years ago, worked on the Go team
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:21.720]   for a long time.
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:30.080]   He is moving on after 12 years, five months at Google, 25 desks, 53 offices, three CEOs,
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:33.880]   one stock split, one company split, eight managers.
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:35.760]   He met his wife at Google.
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:41.080]   He has five and a half hours of unused massage credits he'll never use.
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:48.080]   He has many Google internal change lists, 3,000 Android change lists, 10,000 Go change lists,
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:51.080]   15 Go releases.
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:53.480]   Man, brag much, Mr. Fitzs.
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:54.480]   Why is he leaving?
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:55.480]   He's not bragging.
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:57.480]   This man has a CV longer than your arm.
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:58.480]   No, no, no.
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:02.680]   He is a little bored, he says, not learning as much as I used to, but doing the same things
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:04.080]   too long and I need to change.
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.080]   I feel you on the road.
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:07.080]   Also, I'm filthy rich.
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.780]   That's awesome.
[01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:11.480]   I am quitting to spend more time with my money.
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:12.480]   That's right.
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:13.480]   He didn't say that.
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.480]   That's right.
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:17.180]   When he first joined Google, it was a chaotic first couple of years while I learned Google's
[01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:21.000]   internal code base build system, a bunch of new languages.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.760]   I don't want to get stuck in a comfortable rut and Google certainly is comfortable except
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:26.680]   for the open floor plans.
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:28.480]   What's next?
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:30.080]   Nobody likes open floor plans.
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:31.880]   No, bless you.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:35.400]   He has not announced what's next, but he's building something new.
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:37.480]   That's an engineer talking right there.
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:38.480]   Fitz.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:40.380]   Open floor plans.
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:43.780]   That's a change log, right?
[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:44.780]   Good on you.
[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:46.980]   His Brad Fitzpatrick.
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:49.980]   He was a neat guy too, just a nice guy.
[01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:50.980]   He's not dead.
[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:51.980]   He's not dead.
[01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.180]   He is a neat guy.
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:56.140]   He does have five and a half hours of massage credits left.
[01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:58.980]   Can I have those, Mr. Fitz?
[01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:01.060]   Just take one long with Siles.
[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:03.220]   Google Translate is getting a transcribe mode.
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:05.300]   I love the transcribe mode in the recorder.
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:06.780]   I use it all just the other day.
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:09.640]   I was listening to a book and I thought that's a great pass again.
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:10.640]   I want to write that down.
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:11.640]   And I thought, oh, I don't have to.
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:12.640]   I'll just record it in Google Translate.
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:13.640]   Google recorder.
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:14.640]   And I got it.
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:15.640]   And then where do you do?
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:16.740]   What do you do with it then?
[01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:20.080]   I pasted into my new thing.
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:21.080]   What's your name?
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:22.080]   Rome Research.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.080]   You know about Rome?
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:28.080]   A note taking tool for network thought.
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:29.080]   Interesting.
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:30.680]   I am not going to go.
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:32.880]   No, spelled R-O-A-M.
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:36.980]   I'm not going to go all in on it because it's cloud based.
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:37.980]   It's brand new.
[01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:39.660]   It just got released.
[01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:42.140]   But it's really interesting because you can enter in.
[01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:45.300]   It's like a wiki, but it does back linking automatically.
[01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:47.380]   It's more free flowing than a wiki.
[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:51.180]   And the idea is that somewhere you would take notes, keep track of things.
[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:53.540]   Is this like Dave Weiner's outlining?
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:54.780]   Sort is.
[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:57.100]   But much more free form.
[01:44:57.100 --> 01:45:00.140]   Not very unstructured.
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:03.000]   And so you can add structures you want.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.040]   I think it's really an interesting tool.
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:08.760]   So anyway, that's what I've been spending some time.
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:12.040]   I won't show you my-- because it's almost like a journal for me.
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:14.080]   What's the URL?
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:15.480]   RomeResearch.com.
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:21.120]   Anyway, one of the things I've been putting in there is one of the articles I read, a
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:22.880]   guy uses it to take notes while he's writing books.
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:25.640]   You probably get great value out of this Jeff Jarvis.
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:26.840]   Because I never actively read--
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:27.840]   I'm organized.
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:30.040]   Well, I read, but I don't actively read.
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:31.040]   I don't underline.
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:32.040]   I don't do marginalia.
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.040]   I don't do notes.
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:36.400]   But I read some articles that talked about doing this as a way to remember what you read
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:38.500]   and engage with it more.
[01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:39.740]   And so I was listening to a book.
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:41.460]   I thought, I like that quote.
[01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:42.980]   I want to save that quote.
[01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:44.820]   And that's the easiest thing to do.
[01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:48.020]   Transcribe it and then cut and paste it into my Rome diary.
[01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:49.020]   So you got it.
[01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:50.020]   Yeah.
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:53.820]   Give yourself a digital entry in one book.
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:54.820]   Let me see.
[01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:56.700]   Let me see Jeff's picture.
[01:45:56.700 --> 01:45:57.700]   You underline?
[01:45:57.700 --> 01:45:58.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:00.460]   You don't even use a highlighter.
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:02.020]   You just underline with a pen?
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:03.020]   Or not.
[01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:04.020]   I don't like it.
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:05.020]   It went all white, yes.
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:07.500]   I just don't read physical books.
[01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:09.000]   I do the audio books.
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.660]   That's why I wanted this recorder.
[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:14.660]   I never get any value like that.
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:18.600]   Every now and then I'll get a book like I have Mr. Rick Salmon's book.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:23.140]   And I have that on iPad or Kindle, whatever you want to call it.
[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:24.140]   So here's the transcript.
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:25.140]   But that's it.
[01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:26.140]   Right there.
[01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:39.860]   "Is run by one billion evil men, 10 million stupid men, and 100 million cowards.
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:43.140]   The evil men are the power or I didn't do a perfect job.
[01:46:43.140 --> 01:46:47.620]   The power rich men and the politicians and the fanatics of religion whose decisions rule
[01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:51.100]   the world and set it on its horse and greed and destruction."
[01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:52.100]   It's not a perfect transcript.
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:56.580]   But see, I have the audio so I can listen to it and fix it.
[01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:57.580]   Interesting quotes.
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:46:58.580]   I like the quote.
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:00.540]   That's from Shanta Ram, which is a wonderful book.
[01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:02.700]   Interesting quote.
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:04.660]   I read it, but they said, "Chadam House rules."
[01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:10.180]   So I can't tell you who wrote it.
[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:11.420]   That's how it works, right?
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:13.260]   I feel like that's our new Gutenberg.
[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:14.260]   Chadam House rule.
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:15.260]   Chadam House rule.
[01:47:15.260 --> 01:47:16.260]   Rule one.
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:17.260]   There's a rule.
[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:20.620]   One rule is you can report the information, not just not who said it.
[01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:21.620]   That's right.
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:22.620]   So funny.
[01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:29.700]   So they're going to put the transcription in the translate, but they're also going to put
[01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:33.140]   it in their new call recording feature, possibly.
[01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:37.900]   I don't know if that's changed, because it's not officially it.
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:41.580]   Add to playlist button appears in Google Podcasts for some, but it doesn't work yet.
[01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:43.820]   That's kind of dopey.
[01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:52.180]   Rule is making a short form video sharing app for DIY tutorials.
[01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:56.340]   Tangy, which stands for Teach and Give.
[01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:58.060]   Oh, why with that name?
[01:47:58.060 --> 01:47:59.060]   That's terrible.
[01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:00.060]   Tangy goodness.
[01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:02.140]   And don't you have YouTube already?
[01:48:02.140 --> 01:48:04.380]   So here, you want to know how to make a five minute ponytail?
[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:06.020]   I know you do.
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:07.580]   This is not going to end well.
[01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:08.580]   Five minutes?
[01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:10.420]   Five minutes seems a long time to make a ponytail.
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:11.420]   Yeah, it does.
[01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:15.460]   And especially in a 50.
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:18.820]   It's got loud music.
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:20.540]   I think she's drawing it out.
[01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:22.540]   Kataranya Tonska.
[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:25.620]   Wait, she's that's not this is a fancy ponytail.
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:27.180]   Well, that's why it's.
[01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:28.660]   I guess for five minutes.
[01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:31.260]   Yeah, but that's why you still have TikTok.
[01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:38.140]   You still have this is a little like to you have all these other alternatives out there.
[01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:41.740]   This is just something else Google's throwing up against the wall to see if it sticks and
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:42.740]   it's not going to.
[01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:46.540]   Here is how you would doodle on a wallet.
[01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:50.380]   Yeah, because that's useful.
[01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:53.580]   What can you get everyone?
[01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:55.020]   I'm not sure I caught that.
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:56.020]   Can you rewind that?
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:59.460]   It's a tiny touch to a lovely gift for someone special.
[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:03.660]   Oh, that's just don't doodle on my wallet.
[01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:04.660]   Please.
[01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:05.660]   Tangy.
[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:06.660]   Can you make a bite of this?
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:11.220]   I might need this because it is Lisa's birthday in our anniversary today and I don't have a
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:12.220]   gift yet.
[01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:13.220]   It's very Pinteresty, isn't it?
[01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:14.220]   Oh, happy birthday, Lisa.
[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:15.220]   Happy anniversary, guys.
[01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:17.380]   I don't have a gift for her.
[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:18.380]   So maybe I could quickly.
[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:19.380]   You have no ads.
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:20.380]   You're poor.
[01:49:20.380 --> 01:49:23.660]   I could quickly make a key to my heart cake.
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:25.540]   47 seconds.
[01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:26.780]   Three layers.
[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:27.940]   Hi, Paola.
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:28.940]   Yee.
[01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:30.940]   Look, you ice three layers.
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:32.180]   You cannot make a cake that way.
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:33.500]   With pink buttercream.
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:38.340]   You fold fondant over to ruin its flavor and taste and texture.
[01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:46.860]   Then make more fondant with a gold and silver edible glitter, color mist shimmering pearl.
[01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:48.660]   And there you have it.
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:50.020]   Oh, there's a key.
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:52.220]   So I'm not getting anything out of that.
[01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:53.500]   Well, I'm telling you one thing.
[01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:54.820]   I ate in this cake.
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:57.580]   That's got all sorts of heavy metals.
[01:49:57.580 --> 01:49:58.580]   Yeah.
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:00.780]   That's not teaching anybody anything.
[01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:05.980]   It's actually glitter as micro plastics, which people want to abolish.
[01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:07.860]   They're poisoning our planet.
[01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:08.860]   Yes.
[01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:14.220]   When the archaeologists buy Paola, when the archaeologists come along and say, what happened
[01:50:14.220 --> 01:50:18.460]   to the civilization, they're going to say, wait, I want that ruffle cake.
[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:19.700]   That is interesting.
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:22.420]   All right, let's make a buttercream ruffle cake.
[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:25.300]   This is just torture.
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:27.220]   This is friggin torture.
[01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:29.860]   We are giving tangy all of its views.
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:33.020]   This is all the views tangy we'll have for the month.
[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:35.620]   Wait, what kind of hyper is that?
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:36.620]   That's what I know.
[01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:37.620]   Oh, it's the fat one.
[01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:38.620]   The fat one.
[01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:39.620]   Look at that.
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:43.460]   Now you know, you know everything you need to know to make a ruffle cake.
[01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:46.100]   It's a life hack or a cake hack, if you will.
[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:48.460]   And all of this is on Pinterest, I'm sure.
[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:49.460]   All right.
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:50.460]   This is Pinterest.
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:51.460]   I don't understand.
[01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:54.260]   Yeah, can you do video with Pinterest?
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:56.100]   Oh, I can't stop tangy.
[01:50:56.100 --> 01:50:58.100]   It's going to play in the background.
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:50:59.420]   Oh, it's so interesting.
[01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:00.420]   T-A-N-G-I.
[01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:04.060]   For what it's worth, I did appreciate learning how to do that.
[01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:05.980]   I think we've all learned something today.
[01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:08.140]   I'm glad you're happy.
[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:12.140]   Nest baking is very important to me.
[01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:18.020]   Nest is testing a feature to give you an alert if you're heating or air conditioning
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:20.020]   goes down.
[01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:27.060]   And then booking repair person from Handy.
[01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:32.580]   So broad picture, this is kind of a big deal because Honeywell and a lot of the other companies,
[01:51:32.580 --> 01:51:38.580]   so Residia, which now owns the Honeywell Home brand, they have been working with their
[01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:41.460]   they have their own HVAC gear and their own distributors.
[01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:46.460]   And they've been saying forever that they're going to create this link.
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:49.900]   And this is Nest basically saying, oh, we can do this too.
[01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:52.460]   You guys don't have like a lock on this ability.
[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:57.020]   And so it's just, it's another way that we're still having competition in this area.
[01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:58.020]   Good.
[01:51:58.020 --> 01:51:59.220]   I have to say I was a little disappointed.
[01:51:59.220 --> 01:52:02.100]   I read this article in Gizmodo, but I didn't read the whole headline.
[01:52:02.100 --> 01:52:03.700]   I just read it, read the first part.
[01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:06.740]   Massive leak reveals pretty much everything.
[01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:12.700]   And I thought, wow, finally, we're going to know about Area 51 and the Kennedy assassination.
[01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:16.300]   And it turns out it's just about the next Samsung phone.
[01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:17.300]   Who cares?
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:19.540]   February 11th, we'll all find out together.
[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:22.300]   In fact, we're going to do a live stream of that Samsung.
[01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:25.660]   Have any of you seen a person with a phone in the wire?
[01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:26.660]   Yes.
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:27.660]   We saw quite a few.
[01:52:27.660 --> 01:52:30.220]   Well, wasn't that's not the wild?
[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:31.220]   That's not the wild.
[01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:33.180]   Oh, it is the wild.
[01:52:33.180 --> 01:52:34.180]   You didn't go to see.
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:35.180]   Yes, Jeff.
[01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:36.180]   That was wild.
[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:37.180]   It was the wild.
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:41.260]   No, he was part of the Twit Army and he had the yellow C-fold.
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:42.820]   So if he had it, yeah.
[01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:43.820]   He was a civilian.
[01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:46.620]   No, he was in the Twit Army.
[01:52:46.620 --> 01:52:47.620]   Yes.
[01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:50.860]   He was a civilian in the Twit Army.
[01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:56.500]   Because as it turns out, if you're in the Twit Army, you're not actually in the Army.
[01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:57.500]   Right, right, right.
[01:52:57.500 --> 01:53:00.180]   Imagine if the chat room were armed.
[01:53:00.180 --> 01:53:01.180]   Yes.
[01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:04.220]   Actually, I'm a little skeptical about folding phones.
[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:10.620]   Nokia put out a video on their new flip phone with the bending screen.
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:13.980]   I don't have a copy of the video, sorry.
[01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:19.660]   But in the video, it said it's completely normal to have bumps and bumps in the screen.
[01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:20.660]   Oh, no.
[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:22.420]   Don't feel bad.
[01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:23.420]   That's normal.
[01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:24.420]   Nope.
[01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:25.420]   Nope.
[01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:28.020]   I got a guy on the streets that after he tinted my windows.
[01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:29.020]   Tint it.
[01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:30.020]   Yes.
[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:32.460]   You got some guy on the street to tint your windows.
[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:36.380]   No, I'm just-- I mean, that's who I would expect to be like.
[01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:39.620]   Tint your windows 15 bucks, lady.
[01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:42.020]   You used to have squeegee men, but in Seattle.
[01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:43.020]   In Texas.
[01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:48.700]   I was going to do it while you pump your gas.
[01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:54.620]   Murdock Rupert C. Murdock.
[01:53:54.620 --> 01:53:58.380]   I have to wait 15 seconds while Friday shows me a blank screen because I have an edit.
[01:53:58.380 --> 01:54:01.140]   We didn't officially close out the change log, sir.
[01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:04.860]   That's the Google change log.
[01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:07.460]   Now it's close.
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:08.460]   I feel better now.
[01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:09.460]   Perfect timing.
[01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:11.460]   Now I can see the variety article.
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:16.980]   News Corp has launched something new called News, K-N-E-W-Z.
[01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:18.940]   No.
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:25.300]   It's stories from 400 publishers promising no clickbait or narrow minded nonsense.
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:28.020]   What is the definition of narrow minded nonsense?
[01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:29.020]   Oh boy.
[01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:30.420]   So I went through it.
[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:31.420]   I put that up.
[01:54:31.420 --> 01:54:33.820]   I went through the very long homepage.
[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:38.500]   And they do have links to the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, Guardian, the nation.
[01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:45.060]   But that's all in my view a cloak for them to have links to Daily Caller, Breitbart, the
[01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:50.460]   Exxon, Washington Examiner, Newsmax, the Blaze, Fox, of course, and Washington Times.
[01:54:50.460 --> 01:54:51.620]   Are those all Murdoch properties?
[01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:54.700]   No, they're not Murdoch properties, but they're...
[01:54:54.700 --> 01:54:55.700]   Murdoch will be far...
[01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:57.100]   Yes, thank you very much.
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:54:58.100]   That's a thousand.
[01:54:58.100 --> 01:54:59.100]   Well said.
[01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:00.100]   Well said.
[01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:01.100]   So is this crypto far right?
[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:03.780]   Yeah, in a way.
[01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:07.180]   It's hiding behind the skirt of the links to the New York Times and stuff.
[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:11.100]   And Murdoch's war on Google as well saying, "We don't want your sticking sight.
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:12.100]   We don't want your stealing stuff.
[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:14.580]   We're going to have this and on and on."
[01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:16.660]   But it's also a way to say, "Oh, you want to see balance?
[01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:19.740]   Then you ought to include the Blaze."
[01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:20.900]   Not so much in my view.
[01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:21.900]   So Breitbart.
[01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:25.500]   And for what it's worth, I think some of these titles are Linkbait.
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:30.940]   For instance, watch this man find out his $346 Rolex Daytona is now worth 700,000.
[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:33.060]   Actually, it's kind of a cool story.
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:35.260]   Oh, Linkbait.
[01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:39.700]   Meryl Streep sells her posh New York City penthouse for $15.8 million.
[01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:40.700]   Yeah, Linkbait.
[01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:41.700]   Talk to TMZ up here.
[01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:42.700]   That's Linkbait.
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:43.700]   Lots.
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:47.940]   It's Harry and Megan Markle shocked about losing Commonwealth roles.
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:48.940]   Linkbait.
[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:49.940]   Linkbait.
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:54.820]   That's pretty much you can't not do Linkbait in the world, this world, right?
[01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:59.740]   I don't have a lot of people on my site, but I don't do Linkbait.
[01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:00.820]   The maybe there's a correlation.
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:02.820]   Is there a correlation here?
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:04.980]   There's a correlation between those things.
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:06.260]   No, no, no.
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:09.220]   Your version of Linkbait is, "Oh my God, do it, Gelchap."
[01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:10.220]   Yes.
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:12.220]   Okay, but that's legit.
[01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:19.740]   Michael Bloomberg shakes a dog's mouth, gets teased online.
[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:23.900]   No, she got all the mouth.
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:25.940]   I don't think it's too slanted.
[01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:27.580]   No, no, no, no.
[01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:31.780]   This is all a very clever and rather nuanced way to say, "We got an NPR here, but we're
[01:56:31.780 --> 01:56:34.500]   going to sneak in the Washington Times, and we're going to sneak in."
[01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:36.780]   Honestly, the layout is awful.
[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:38.820]   Yes, it's terrible.
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:41.540]   It's just a bunch of rich.
[01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:43.060]   It's ugly as sin.
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:47.340]   The highlight color is a mustard yellow.
[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:51.940]   Every single headline has a mustard yellow tag above it.
[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:54.140]   Maybe call that Golden Rod.
[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:55.140]   Golden Rod.
[01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:56.340]   I call it Muston Yellow.
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:57.900]   I saw a baby.
[01:56:57.900 --> 01:56:59.660]   I saw a baby couldn't help a yellow.
[01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:01.180]   There are baby couldn't help a yellow.
[01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:06.060]   There are very few pictures, like none, so that's not very attractive.
[01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:09.380]   I think that's because they probably don't want everybody to take their pictures.
[01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:11.020]   It looks like dredge report.
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:12.020]   Yeah.
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:15.060]   How's that kind of text-forward look?
[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:16.060]   Without the life.
[01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:17.060]   Without the life.
[01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:19.700]   Without the vim and the vigor.
[01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:23.380]   Maybe if I go to politics, I'll see more.
[01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:26.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:26.820 --> 01:57:29.820]   This is Link Bay from Breitbart.
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:34.460]   Joe Biden suggests making Michelle Obama running made a pointing Barack to the Supreme
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:35.460]   Court.
[01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:37.460]   That's Breitbart.
[01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:44.780]   Is it whole cloth or is there a little truth in it?
[01:57:44.780 --> 01:57:45.780]   Who knows?
[01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:47.700]   With Joe, you just don't know.
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:50.620]   You just don't know what Joe's going to say.
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:53.580]   Oh, he said, "I would, but I don't think he'd do it."
[01:57:53.580 --> 01:57:54.580]   Okay, fine.
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:58.260]   Well, I sure would like Michelle to be the vice president.
[01:57:58.260 --> 01:58:00.500]   There's such decent and honorable people.
[01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.300]   He said to laughter from the crowd.
[01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:05.420]   So yeah, he didn't really suggest it.
[01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:07.420]   And he didn't say no.
[01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:08.860]   This thing looks really bad.
[01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:09.860]   Yeah.
[01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:11.420]   Gosh, it's hard to look at.
[01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:12.420]   It's interesting.
[01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:18.700]   Didn't Murdoch spend millions of dollars building something specifically for iOS called, what
[01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:19.700]   was it, the news?
[01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:20.700]   What was the tabby?
[01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:22.860]   Yeah, it was the daily, the daily tablet.
[01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:23.860]   Yeah.
[01:58:23.860 --> 01:58:27.220]   Yeah, I think it was about $25 million he went through.
[01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:28.940]   And it just went nowhere.
[01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:29.940]   Oh, boy.
[01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:30.940]   Yeah.
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:31.940]   Fast.
[01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:32.940]   That's part of the number.
[01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:37.420]   You know, he or his people or Lachlan or somebody, you know, they're trying stuff.
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:38.900]   You got to try stuff.
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:40.060]   You got to try stuff.
[01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:41.620]   This has an agenda.
[01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:43.900]   This is the new fair and balanced.
[01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:48.020]   This is a, you know, Facebook, you better have bright brought up on yours.
[01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:49.380]   Your news tab, because we have it on ours.
[01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:50.380]   You better have daily color on yours.
[01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:51.380]   We have it on ours.
[01:58:51.380 --> 01:58:52.380]   Right.
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:53.380]   Okay.
[01:58:53.380 --> 01:58:54.380]   And we also have the New York Times.
[01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:55.380]   Hey, what's wrong?
[01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:56.380]   Hey, we got the New York Times.
[01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:57.380]   The liberals come.
[01:58:57.380 --> 01:59:02.380]   I think there's a lot of room for this.
[01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:09.020]   That, you know, why be far left or far right?
[01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:10.260]   Why be so obvious about it?
[01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:11.660]   There's a lot of room for that.
[01:59:11.660 --> 01:59:14.220]   I'm going to give this a try for a week.
[01:59:14.220 --> 01:59:15.380]   I'd the mustard yellow.
[01:59:15.380 --> 01:59:17.260]   But it's hard to look at this.
[01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:19.140]   Just it's just hard to look at it.
[01:59:19.140 --> 01:59:20.780]   Literally yellow news.
[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:21.780]   Literally.
[01:59:21.780 --> 01:59:22.780]   Literally.
[01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:29.780]   I think we may have to deprogram you after that week.
[01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:30.780]   Oh, man.
[01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:31.780]   It's not that.
[01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:37.300]   Yeah, I mean, you probably should never consider Breitbart a legitimate news source.
[01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:38.700]   You're so much of your stuff.
[01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:39.700]   That's really cool.
[01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:40.700]   Yeah.
[01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:41.700]   And the Daily Mail.
[01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:43.700]   The Daily Mail's bad too.
[01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:44.700]   Yeah.
[01:59:44.700 --> 01:59:45.700]   But that's a Murdoch property.
[01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:46.700]   No, no, no.
[01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:47.700]   It's not.
[01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:48.700]   The Sun is.
[01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:49.700]   The Sun is.
[01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:50.700]   That's right.
[01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:53.980]   Oh, he's showing how open-minded he is.
[01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:57.900]   I can't see where Murdoch anymore without seeing succession.
[01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:01.580]   I know succession is not based on them.
[02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:04.820]   I just feel like it gave us an insight into how.
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:05.820]   Show was really good.
[02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:06.820]   Yeah, you liked it.
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:07.820]   It was really good.
[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:08.820]   I did not like it.
[02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:12.220]   I struggled to watch it at first because you're so awful.
[02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:15.140]   Well, they were so dang-gun rich.
[02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:16.140]   I couldn't relate.
[02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:17.140]   But they're rich and awful.
[02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:18.140]   You know, you're in that.
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:19.620]   And it just shows you could be rich.
[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:23.940]   Stacey, I agree with you at the beginning, but I'm going back to it under what I did.
[02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:26.020]   I struggled for the first two episodes.
[02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:27.020]   So they got better.
[02:00:27.020 --> 02:00:28.020]   Yup.
[02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:30.820]   I stayed until I stayed for four or five episodes.
[02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:32.260]   And I was like, no.
[02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:34.260]   It's my favorite team, Nisha.
[02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:35.260]   We like billions.
[02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:36.260]   Billions is good.
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:38.700]   I think succession is better than billions.
[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:39.700]   I love billions.
[02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:40.700]   I love billions.
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:41.700]   Six episodes.
[02:00:41.700 --> 02:00:42.700]   No.
[02:00:42.700 --> 02:00:46.460]   And I wasn't willing to give it any more of my time.
[02:00:46.460 --> 02:00:49.820]   So tomorrow is the end of my late discovery.
[02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:51.900]   One of my favorite shows.
[02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:52.900]   Wait a minute.
[02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:53.900]   The Witcher?
[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:54.900]   No.
[02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:55.900]   Which one?
[02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:59.900]   I can't see Jeff going for Geralt and Pervilla.
[02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:00.900]   I got it.
[02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:01.900]   One of these favorite shows.
[02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:03.460]   We don't even know what that is.
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:04.460]   The Witcher.
[02:01:04.460 --> 02:01:05.460]   Oh, it's a good show.
[02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:06.460]   It's a good place.
[02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:07.460]   It's terrible.
[02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:08.460]   The good place.
[02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:09.460]   The end is a good place.
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:10.460]   Oh, but I haven't seen it.
[02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:11.460]   We're waiting for the whole thing, but I love the good place to go.
[02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:12.460]   Shut the behind door.
[02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:13.460]   I have to watch that.
[02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:14.460]   You cannot skip through.
[02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:15.460]   You've got to watch from the very beginning or else it's ruined.
[02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:16.460]   And you don't know.
[02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:17.460]   Oh, no.
[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:18.460]   We've watched it.
[02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:19.460]   Ever watched it.
[02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:20.460]   Episode is one, two, and three.
[02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:21.460]   Yeah.
[02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:22.460]   And we're just waiting for four.
[02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:23.460]   I'm exactly the same.
[02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:24.460]   Yeah.
[02:01:24.460 --> 02:01:25.460]   I thought.
[02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:28.460]   Here are all the forking fake swears.
[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:32.260]   Oh, yeah, we talked about this last week, but I thought we did.
[02:01:32.260 --> 02:01:33.260]   I'll never mind.
[02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:34.260]   Okay.
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:35.980]   Jeff, didn't you say you hadn't watched it?
[02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:36.980]   I didn't watch it.
[02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:39.020]   And then Craig Newmark was in love with it.
[02:01:39.020 --> 02:01:42.060]   He kept on quoting his favorite philosopher, Chitty.
[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:43.060]   So I should cue this up.
[02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:44.060]   Yes.
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:45.060]   That's what you're saying.
[02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:46.060]   Chitty is my daughter.
[02:01:46.060 --> 02:01:48.660]   Chitty, what's his last name?
[02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:49.660]   Gee, Abandai.
[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:50.660]   I don't know.
[02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:51.660]   I don't know.
[02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:52.660]   I've gone there.
[02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:57.060]   And so Craig would kind of test people.
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:02:00.100]   I hope he doesn't matter if he's saying this, but I think it was hilarious.
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:05.300]   He'd say he's my favorite philosopher, Chitty Otter Gage says, and he would just straight
[02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:06.980]   face quote a lie.
[02:02:06.980 --> 02:02:12.260]   It was a smart line and waiting for anybody to understand that he just quoted the sitcom.
[02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:13.500]   Oh, my God.
[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:15.140]   We would have gotten in a heartbeat.
[02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:16.140]   It was wonderful.
[02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:17.140]   Very fun.
[02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:18.220]   But the show, so Craig was right.
[02:02:18.220 --> 02:02:19.220]   I watched it.
[02:02:19.220 --> 02:02:20.220]   I love it.
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:21.220]   I absolutely loved it.
[02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:23.820]   It's a good place.
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:26.260]   There's like five, four, five, six, right?
[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:28.700]   But you probably got to watch the very beginning.
[02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:32.060]   My daughter and I, like my daughter loves the show.
[02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:33.060]   She's 13.
[02:02:33.060 --> 02:02:34.060]   Loves.
[02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:35.060]   Yeah.
[02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:36.060]   I love it.
[02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:37.060]   Look at those around.
[02:02:37.060 --> 02:02:38.060]   I love her.
[02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:39.060]   I love her.
[02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:40.060]   Wow.
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:41.060]   Yeah.
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:42.060]   I think she's great.
[02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:43.060]   I'm telling you.
[02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:44.060]   Okay.
[02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:45.060]   I mean, all right.
[02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:46.060]   Isn't she great?
[02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:47.060]   I love her.
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:50.060]   Oh, heartthrob.
[02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:53.340]   I would do an ad right here that I have a promise to you.
[02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:54.620]   But in protest.
[02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:56.220]   Like rock, more talk.
[02:02:56.220 --> 02:02:57.660]   That's right.
[02:02:57.660 --> 02:03:01.700]   I have an exciting and totally nutso pick.
[02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:08.140]   Coming to you from the Twit Last Pass Studios, it's now time for Stacey Higg and Bathams.
[02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:09.140]   Pick of the week.
[02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:10.780]   Oh, and I didn't put it in the rundown.
[02:03:10.780 --> 02:03:11.780]   I'm sorry.
[02:03:11.780 --> 02:03:12.780]   I'm sorry.
[02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:13.780]   Sorry.
[02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:14.780]   It's a surprise to all of us.
[02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:15.780]   It's a surprise to everyone.
[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:18.260]   We don't want any rundown spoilers.
[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:21.820]   I this is crazy.
[02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:22.820]   Pick spoilers.
[02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:28.940]   I saw an article about something that not only have I watched with my daughter, but something
[02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:31.140]   I've actually created with my child.
[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:32.140]   Oh boy.
[02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:34.220]   And I was like, Oh my God, it's an internet trend.
[02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:39.580]   So Slate did an article about American Girl Doll Stop Motion videos, which.
[02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:40.580]   Oh man.
[02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:41.580]   Oh wow.
[02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:44.820]   These are awesome.
[02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:51.220]   And the article is about how she starts off watching it ironically, but then realizes
[02:03:51.220 --> 02:03:54.580]   that these are like girls who my daughter's too old for it now.
[02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:56.220]   They put hours of work into this.
[02:03:56.220 --> 02:03:57.220]   They do.
[02:03:57.220 --> 02:03:59.100]   And this is like a thing.
[02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:01.580]   And we used to set up.
[02:04:01.580 --> 02:04:03.660]   We did not do stop motion.
[02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:06.020]   We did.
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:09.100]   We took pictures and created like storyboards.
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:10.100]   Oh, storyboard.
[02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:11.100]   Okay.
[02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:16.660]   So, you know, same concept, we just didn't have the hours of time.
[02:04:16.660 --> 02:04:21.660]   And I actually have in my office, Taylor and I can't remember the other Wednesday and
[02:04:21.660 --> 02:04:25.580]   right now, the other American girl, but we would set up stuff and my daughter thought
[02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:26.580]   it was so fun.
[02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:28.980]   And if you look at these videos, there's just.
[02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:30.540]   Here's the true meaning of Christmas.
[02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:34.260]   For some reason, I'm looking for Pennywise to jump out or something.
[02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:35.460]   They're not creepy.
[02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:39.260]   Well, some of them are creepy or weird, but most of them are just like.
[02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:40.260]   Oh, sweet.
[02:04:40.260 --> 02:04:41.260]   It's girls.
[02:04:41.260 --> 02:04:42.260]   Yeah.
[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:44.780]   My daughter loved the American girl doll.
[02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:45.780]   You have sons, right?
[02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:46.780]   Yes, I do, sir.
[02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:47.780]   Yeah, he doesn't know that.
[02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:50.620]   You didn't have this experience of going to the American girl store.
[02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:52.460]   Oh, we went to Chicago.
[02:04:52.460 --> 02:04:54.260]   We went to everywhere else though.
[02:04:54.260 --> 02:04:59.020]   Oh, have we had cut the hair off for American girl doll and we brought it to the hospital
[02:04:59.020 --> 02:05:00.420]   and they put the hair back on?
[02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:01.420]   Oh, wow.
[02:05:01.420 --> 02:05:02.420]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:02.420 --> 02:05:03.420]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:03.420 --> 02:05:04.420]   The the the cafe.
[02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:05.420]   The cafe, we just there.
[02:05:05.420 --> 02:05:07.420]   There's a spot for your doll.
[02:05:07.420 --> 02:05:08.420]   Oh, man.
[02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:12.740]   It's a whole bunch of dads with two and a half for high people.
[02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:13.740]   It's so pretty.
[02:05:13.740 --> 02:05:14.740]   Right around.
[02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:15.740]   Very excited.
[02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:16.740]   I want my best friend.
[02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:19.700]   Daisy, did you do a American girl store?
[02:05:19.700 --> 02:05:22.180]   We have three American girls in our house.
[02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:23.180]   Four.
[02:05:23.180 --> 02:05:24.180]   You do the store.
[02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:25.180]   But you got to go to Chicago.
[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:26.180]   Yeah.
[02:05:26.180 --> 02:05:27.180]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:27.180 --> 02:05:31.540]   We didn't go to the Chicago store, but there was a store in Houston that we went to and it
[02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:35.060]   was almost cruel because we went the day before my daughter's birthday and we were giving
[02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:36.060]   her a doll for her birthday.
[02:05:36.060 --> 02:05:38.300]   Oh, you couldn't get anything.
[02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:42.940]   Well, we we finally got something because it was just the set like because she's very
[02:05:42.940 --> 02:05:47.940]   sweet and at the time she was younger and even sweeter and she just was like, we're
[02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:49.780]   like, oh, my God, you're terrible parents.
[02:05:49.780 --> 02:05:51.020]   I can't believe we did this.
[02:05:51.020 --> 02:05:55.500]   So the American girl dolls are, you know, full-sized dolls.
[02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:59.460]   We're going to go show you one that each of them has a story.
[02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:04.300]   Usually the history of your daughter, their books, they have the clothes and the accessories
[02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:05.460]   appropriate.
[02:06:05.460 --> 02:06:12.780]   They have dolls of all ethnicities and it's a really wonderful kind of for history.
[02:06:12.780 --> 02:06:16.620]   And then so Stacy has which doll is this?
[02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:19.980]   This is a truly me doll or whatever the heck it is.
[02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:21.980]   Oh, you customize it to make it your own.
[02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:22.980]   Oh, man.
[02:06:22.980 --> 02:06:23.980]   Yes.
[02:06:23.980 --> 02:06:27.180]   So that came after my daughter got out of it because she only had the choice of these
[02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:28.180]   systems.
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:29.180]   I remember seeing this stuff.
[02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:30.180]   Yeah.
[02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:32.420]   We used to have Rebecca, but she she's.
[02:06:32.420 --> 02:06:37.100]   I am ashamed to admit I was a I was a slave to consumerism.
[02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:41.500]   Not only did she have several of the big dolls, but I found my I think when my first eBay
[02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:44.620]   purchase, somebody was selling a giant trunk.
[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:46.660]   They made little ones too at one point.
[02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:47.660]   Yes.
[02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:50.100]   And what are the videos they were playing the these dolls?
[02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:51.100]   Yeah.
[02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:52.100]   We're playing with the little dolls.
[02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:53.540]   Yeah, their own dolls.
[02:06:53.540 --> 02:06:58.580]   And they had one that had everyone up to up to the point of that release.
[02:06:58.580 --> 02:07:03.580]   So it was like 30 American girl dolls in a trunk with clothes and stuff.
[02:07:03.580 --> 02:07:04.580]   And I bought it for Abby.
[02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:05.580]   I was this.
[02:07:05.580 --> 02:07:06.580]   It wasn't.
[02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:08.380]   Do you remember the American girl social network?
[02:07:08.380 --> 02:07:09.380]   No.
[02:07:09.380 --> 02:07:13.420]   Oh, they had a social network, a safe social network for little girls and it really was
[02:07:13.420 --> 02:07:14.420]   safe.
[02:07:14.420 --> 02:07:15.420]   It was wonderful.
[02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:17.740]   And you'd make friends were most of the real names, right?
[02:07:17.740 --> 02:07:20.540]   But you would make a friend you could reconnect with that same person.
[02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:24.860]   And it was it was monitored like crazy, but obviously it was expensive to run and and
[02:07:24.860 --> 02:07:26.020]   they killed it.
[02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:30.660]   It heartbroken little girls, somebody separated from all their friends.
[02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:31.660]   It was awful.
[02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:32.660]   Interesting.
[02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:33.660]   Oh my God.
[02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:35.580]   It's like how everyone would Google plus.
[02:07:35.580 --> 02:07:42.420]   By the way, your tip your tip has also pointed me to a new thing that I'm going to read more
[02:07:42.420 --> 02:07:46.780]   of, which is a feature on slate called rabbit holes.
[02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:50.580]   This was an article in rabbit holes while I waste hours losing myself and the American
[02:07:50.580 --> 02:07:53.540]   girl stop motion cinematic universe.
[02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:59.340]   But there's a lot more and they look very funny and interesting and poignant and sad.
[02:07:59.340 --> 02:08:01.020]   You're wedding Instagram.
[02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:02.020]   Yeah.
[02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:03.020]   Isn't that a funny one?
[02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:05.860]   Searching craze list for where was that when I missed them.
[02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:08.140]   They're very strange.
[02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:10.100]   A rabbit hole.
[02:08:10.100 --> 02:08:11.540]   So rabbit holes.
[02:08:11.540 --> 02:08:16.500]   Why spend waste time searching for the fake questions in advice columns?
[02:08:16.500 --> 02:08:23.380]   Why I spent my early writing career chasing rarefied words like impermeable.
[02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:27.300]   Well, I should have tied on there.
[02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:29.980]   Why I spend hours searching for impermeable.
[02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:35.900]   Oh, look, this is about the social media network that my daughter was into.
[02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:37.460]   Neopets.
[02:08:37.460 --> 02:08:40.260]   Abby was all into Neopets.
[02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:46.180]   The raw and flinching honesty in Neopets chat rooms offer me solace and company.
[02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:47.180]   Nice.
[02:08:47.180 --> 02:08:50.460]   So thank you, Stacey, for an excellent pick of the week.
[02:08:50.460 --> 02:08:54.380]   Now would be a good time for Jeff Jarvis to give us a number of the week.
[02:08:54.380 --> 02:08:57.980]   I'm just asking my daughter what the other social network she was in on.
[02:08:57.980 --> 02:08:58.980]   Probably pink.
[02:08:58.980 --> 02:09:01.820]   So I've got a few here.
[02:09:01.820 --> 02:09:03.620]   I'm going down.
[02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:06.100]   I like the Bezos story.
[02:09:06.100 --> 02:09:07.100]   You do.
[02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:08.100]   OK, fun.
[02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:12.660]   Mackenzie Bezos just dumped $370 million of her Amazon stock.
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:15.740]   That was less than 1% of the holding.
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:18.540]   She has more than just $3.7 billion.
[02:09:18.540 --> 02:09:19.540]   Nice.
[02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:21.940]   And probably $370 million.
[02:09:21.940 --> 02:09:24.340]   I could probably live on that for some time.
[02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:25.340]   Insane.
[02:09:25.340 --> 02:09:26.340]   Isn't that great?
[02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:27.900]   She's getting into her.
[02:09:27.900 --> 02:09:28.900]   Good for her.
[02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:29.900]   Yeah.
[02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:30.900]   Philanthropy.
[02:09:30.900 --> 02:09:31.900]   Oh, Circle of Friends by daughter says.
[02:09:31.900 --> 02:09:32.900]   Circle of Friends.
[02:09:32.900 --> 02:09:34.980]   It was another one that was shut down.
[02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:35.980]   So unusual.
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:39.780]   Honestly, she kind of got ripped off because Bezos still is the richest guy in the world.
[02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:42.500]   She only got 4%.
[02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:45.580]   Vamazan's total shares, 19.7 million shares.
[02:09:45.580 --> 02:09:47.620]   Yeah, but she's still smiling and all of those images.
[02:09:47.620 --> 02:09:48.780]   That's enough money.
[02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:53.860]   But credit to Mackenzie Bezos, she was very active in the founding of Amazon.
[02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:54.860]   Absolutely.
[02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:55.860]   She did a virtual business plan.
[02:09:55.860 --> 02:09:56.860]   Yeah.
[02:09:56.860 --> 02:09:57.860]   So support.
[02:09:57.860 --> 02:09:58.860]   Big time.
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:09:59.860]   Yeah.
[02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:05.580]   Let us mention that Paris Musee is putting up 100,000 free use images up online for your
[02:10:05.580 --> 02:10:07.300]   next blog post when you put something.
[02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:08.300]   Nice.
[02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:09.300]   That's awesome.
[02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:12.020]   What kind of images on Paris Musee?
[02:10:12.020 --> 02:10:13.020]   Art and--
[02:10:13.020 --> 02:10:14.020]   Oh, their museum.
[02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:15.020]   Museum.
[02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:16.020]   Old story.
[02:10:16.020 --> 02:10:17.020]   Hold on.
[02:10:17.020 --> 02:10:18.020]   What does it matter?
[02:10:18.020 --> 02:10:19.020]   No, January 13, 2020.
[02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:20.020]   It's new to me.
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:21.020]   That's awesome.
[02:10:21.020 --> 02:10:22.020]   Yeah.
[02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:23.020]   Oh, I love that.
[02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:25.020]   That's going on in the next blog post.
[02:10:25.020 --> 02:10:26.020]   Absolutely.
[02:10:26.020 --> 02:10:27.860]   The photos too were just amazing.
[02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:29.420]   I tend to do that.
[02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:30.420]   14.
[02:10:30.420 --> 02:10:31.820]   And then I can't resist this one.
[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:35.220]   And it's a number because it's three.
[02:10:35.220 --> 02:10:37.100]   There's a protest going on in the UK.
[02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:40.220]   There is a Brexit coin and it doesn't have the Oxford comma.
[02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:42.500]   So there's a move to boycott.
[02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:49.140]   The Brexit 50-pence coin over the missing Oxford comma in the phrase "peace, prosperity,
[02:10:49.140 --> 02:10:53.100]   comma, and friendship with all nations."
[02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:58.220]   I would think that on a coin, given the logic of AP style not giving the Oxford comma because
[02:10:58.220 --> 02:11:03.900]   of like type setting rules and the pain of actually dealing with more type, I feel that
[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:06.420]   imprinting a coin kind of follows the same rules.
[02:11:06.420 --> 02:11:08.580]   So it's kind of justifiable.
[02:11:08.580 --> 02:11:09.580]   Stacey.
[02:11:09.580 --> 02:11:10.580]   Stacey.
[02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:11.580]   I don't care about the Oxford comma.
[02:11:11.580 --> 02:11:13.900]   No excuse for the Oxford comma.
[02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:16.860]   No, I think she's right, Jeff.
[02:11:16.860 --> 02:11:17.860]   It's a...
[02:11:17.860 --> 02:11:18.860]   Stacey.
[02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:19.860]   It's a medallion.
[02:11:19.860 --> 02:11:22.860]   It's a different standard.
[02:11:22.860 --> 02:11:23.860]   It applies.
[02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:24.860]   Hold on.
[02:11:24.860 --> 02:11:26.860]   I'm just right back.
[02:11:26.860 --> 02:11:29.060]   He's getting a book.
[02:11:29.060 --> 02:11:30.060]   Look at this.
[02:11:30.060 --> 02:11:31.060]   Look at this.
[02:11:31.060 --> 02:11:33.100]   Watch Jeff Jarvis get a book out of his massive library.
[02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:34.260]   Goes to the library.
[02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:37.380]   I know he's going to get eats, shoots, and leaves.
[02:11:37.380 --> 02:11:38.380]   And leaves.
[02:11:38.380 --> 02:11:39.380]   I have that book.
[02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:40.380]   No, he's not.
[02:11:40.380 --> 02:11:41.380]   It's not.
[02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:42.380]   He's a Gutenberg.
[02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:43.380]   Pause and effect.
[02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:45.900]   Punctuation in the west.
[02:11:45.900 --> 02:11:47.540]   That actually looks good.
[02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:48.820]   I just read an entire book.
[02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:49.820]   It's out.
[02:11:49.820 --> 02:11:50.820]   No, it's fresh.
[02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:51.820]   It's new.
[02:11:51.820 --> 02:11:52.820]   Entire book about the semicolon.
[02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:53.820]   Oh no.
[02:11:53.820 --> 02:11:54.820]   It's on Amazon.
[02:11:54.820 --> 02:11:57.980]   It's a popular book.
[02:11:57.980 --> 02:11:58.980]   I believe that.
[02:11:58.980 --> 02:11:59.980]   I have a...
[02:11:59.980 --> 02:12:00.980]   Nevermind.
[02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:01.980]   What?
[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:04.540]   Are you going to be heretical again about the Oxford comma?
[02:12:04.540 --> 02:12:05.540]   No, I just...
[02:12:05.540 --> 02:12:06.540]   I have...
[02:12:06.540 --> 02:12:07.540]   I have...
[02:12:07.540 --> 02:12:11.340]   Like if someone in my job interview says, "Hey, what's your biggest week?
[02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:13.620]   I will straight up say commas.
[02:12:13.620 --> 02:12:15.740]   Commas are my biggest weakness."
[02:12:15.740 --> 02:12:19.380]   All of my endeavors remark about...
[02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:27.420]   My eighth-grade English teacher Everett Leonard said, " Comma Blunder is one of the worst."
[02:12:27.420 --> 02:12:28.940]   You can do in your writing.
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:29.940]   Comma Blunder.
[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:30.940]   Did we discuss this?
[02:12:30.940 --> 02:12:35.900]   Did you know that from the first century until the seventh to 12th century, scriptura
[02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:38.340]   continues on where there was no space in writing?
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:39.340]   I know.
[02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:40.340]   It's all...
[02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:41.340]   No splishing.
[02:12:41.340 --> 02:12:42.340]   Yes, right.
[02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:45.340]   And we talked about kids learning to read and I talked about my daughter learning to write.
[02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:48.980]   This show just doesn't stop does it for a moment?
[02:12:48.980 --> 02:12:51.740]   Just all the grammar, minutiae you could ask.
[02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:54.660]   Alright, so one more, one more, one more because it's because we got no ads.
[02:12:54.660 --> 02:12:55.660]   We got lots of...
[02:12:55.660 --> 02:12:56.660]   Who knows?
[02:12:56.660 --> 02:12:58.660]   A mess in the matter.
[02:12:58.660 --> 02:13:03.460]   So what font do you like?
[02:13:03.460 --> 02:13:06.740]   Author Sam Richardson had asked the internet to reveal the deepest part of yourself.
[02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:09.180]   Which font and which size do you write in?
[02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:12.140]   Babis, new in Futura are my two favorites.
[02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:13.700]   Oh, I'm in Futura, that's a good one.
[02:13:13.700 --> 02:13:14.700]   I don't know, Mavis.
[02:13:14.700 --> 02:13:15.700]   Babis, new.
[02:13:15.700 --> 02:13:16.700]   Babis.
[02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:17.700]   Times New Roman 11.
[02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:20.060]   Oh, that's all fashioned.
[02:13:20.060 --> 02:13:22.060]   I'm Times New Roman 12 because I'm old.
[02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:23.940]   Yeah, that could be 12.
[02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:27.980]   I can do Times New 12 but Babis, new in Futura.
[02:13:27.980 --> 02:13:29.580]   Babis, how do you spell Babis?
[02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:30.580]   That's what I don't know.
[02:13:30.580 --> 02:13:31.580]   You got me.
[02:13:31.580 --> 02:13:32.580]   B-E-B-A-S-N-E-U.
[02:13:32.580 --> 02:13:33.580]   Noia.
[02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:34.580]   Yes.
[02:13:34.580 --> 02:13:35.580]   Babis, noia from font.
[02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:40.580]   Noia.
[02:13:40.580 --> 02:13:42.580]   Noia, sorry.
[02:13:42.580 --> 02:13:46.700]   He speaks German so it's always.
[02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:47.940]   Try to look for a sample of it.
[02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:49.100]   Oh, that's very nice.
[02:13:49.100 --> 02:13:50.340]   It's a nice sans font.
[02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:51.340]   Oh yeah.
[02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:53.060]   I agree with you.
[02:13:53.060 --> 02:13:55.140]   So we now have learned something about Aunt Prud.
[02:13:55.140 --> 02:13:56.140]   He's a sans guy.
[02:13:56.140 --> 02:13:57.140]   Yes, I am.
[02:13:57.140 --> 02:13:58.140]   I just think.
[02:13:58.140 --> 02:13:59.140]   I don't like sis.
[02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:00.140]   I don't like sis.
[02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:02.140]   What's the Harvard Boys' favorite font?
[02:14:02.140 --> 02:14:03.140]   Verdana.
[02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:04.980]   Verdana is good.
[02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:06.980]   That was designed for screens.
[02:14:06.980 --> 02:14:07.980]   So there is something.
[02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:10.980]   I was figuring you were going for Gothic, Carsten.
[02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:11.980]   No, no, no.
[02:14:11.980 --> 02:14:12.980]   German Gothic script.
[02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:13.980]   Serifs are bad.
[02:14:13.980 --> 02:14:15.340]   He loves black leather.
[02:14:15.340 --> 02:14:16.980]   I don't like serifs myself.
[02:14:16.980 --> 02:14:22.780]   Well, I like Adobe's myriad and minion because there are two fonts designed again for the
[02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:23.780]   screen.
[02:14:23.780 --> 02:14:26.460]   One serif, one sans serif so you get to choose.
[02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:28.420]   I will often choose those as my default.
[02:14:28.420 --> 02:14:31.620]   But if I were writing, I'm not sure what I would use for writing.
[02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:36.420]   I really like my babies with video content or thumbnails.
[02:14:36.420 --> 02:14:37.420]   They just stand out.
[02:14:37.420 --> 02:14:38.420]   Paint is beautiful.
[02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:41.140]   Especially if you got a heavy one, it would really be beautiful.
[02:14:41.140 --> 02:14:42.140]   Yeah.
[02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:43.140]   Very nice.
[02:14:43.140 --> 02:14:44.140]   I wouldn't have guessed you were a font.
[02:14:44.140 --> 02:14:45.140]   A font key.
[02:14:45.140 --> 02:14:46.140]   It's a font key.
[02:14:46.140 --> 02:14:47.140]   And a font key.
[02:14:47.140 --> 02:14:48.140]   And a font key.
[02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:49.140]   And a font.
[02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:50.140]   That's true.
[02:14:50.140 --> 02:14:51.140]   I love fonts.
[02:14:51.140 --> 02:14:52.140]   Oh, yeah, me too.
[02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:54.580]   Did I ever tell you the story of Entertainment Weekly and Caslon?
[02:14:54.580 --> 02:14:55.580]   No, sir.
[02:14:55.580 --> 02:14:56.580]   Yes.
[02:14:56.580 --> 02:14:57.580]   I don't remember.
[02:14:57.580 --> 02:14:58.580]   She told that story.
[02:14:58.580 --> 02:14:59.580]   I told a story.
[02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:00.740]   I can.
[02:15:00.740 --> 02:15:01.740]   I don't remember.
[02:15:01.740 --> 02:15:02.740]   Go ahead.
[02:15:02.740 --> 02:15:03.740]   I probably didn't.
[02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:04.740]   But Stacey's just said, no, I'm not going to do another story.
[02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:05.740]   I'm not going to do another story.
[02:15:05.740 --> 02:15:06.740]   I'm going to have a horture.
[02:15:06.740 --> 02:15:07.740]   I don't want to hear it.
[02:15:07.740 --> 02:15:08.740]   No.
[02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:09.740]   No, she has done it.
[02:15:09.740 --> 02:15:10.740]   I think she's going to.
[02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:11.740]   I think I'm going to.
[02:15:11.740 --> 02:15:15.740]   I think, like, I, like, I, because I know what Caslon is because of this story.
[02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:16.740]   Oh, wow.
[02:15:16.740 --> 02:15:18.740]   No, that's not.
[02:15:18.740 --> 02:15:22.980]   Oh, magazine and print geeks would really care about fonts quite a bit.
[02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:24.780]   Oh, get them talking about curning.
[02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:25.780]   Good Lord.
[02:15:25.780 --> 02:15:28.660]   Well, I love the movie Helvetica.
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:30.540]   I really did.
[02:15:30.540 --> 02:15:35.700]   And my favorite book about fonts is Stop Stealing Sheep.
[02:15:35.700 --> 02:15:38.140]   And it comes from, I don't know if it's in print anymore.
[02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:39.140]   It was really a great book.
[02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:44.820]   It comes from some famous fontographer who said anyone who would Kern Black Letter would
[02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:46.300]   steal sheep.
[02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:49.620]   That's a fun joke.
[02:15:49.620 --> 02:15:51.620]   Go on.
[02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:53.340]   All right, give us your pick of the week.
[02:15:53.340 --> 02:15:54.820]   I just fixed the rundown.
[02:15:54.820 --> 02:15:56.460]   Oh, my God.
[02:15:56.460 --> 02:15:58.380]   He made it all be some sort of weird serif.
[02:15:58.380 --> 02:16:00.100]   No, I hate you so much.
[02:16:00.100 --> 02:16:01.100]   Oh, dude.
[02:16:01.100 --> 02:16:02.100]   That's ugly.
[02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:03.100]   What is that font?
[02:16:03.100 --> 02:16:05.100]   It's all time to know, man.
[02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:07.380]   That's the worst font.
[02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:09.300]   Helvetica is a good movie.
[02:16:09.300 --> 02:16:14.220]   If you haven't seen Helvetica, it will give you a kind of an interest in fonts.
[02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:17.380]   Oh, God.
[02:16:17.380 --> 02:16:19.100]   I pissed off Christian money.
[02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:20.180]   I could shake his back.
[02:16:20.180 --> 02:16:21.860]   I'm going to make it all trebuchet.
[02:16:21.860 --> 02:16:24.300]   My blood pressure just spiked.
[02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:26.900]   How about, let's see, what could be, how about ultra?
[02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:27.900]   Here you go.
[02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:28.900]   Now it's good.
[02:16:28.900 --> 02:16:29.900]   Hey, man.
[02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:30.900]   Hey, man.
[02:16:30.900 --> 02:16:31.900]   Oh, boy.
[02:16:31.900 --> 02:16:32.900]   We're all west here.
[02:16:32.900 --> 02:16:33.900]   I've heard.
[02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:35.900]   All right, Ant, do your pick, man.
[02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:36.900]   Do your pick.
[02:16:36.900 --> 02:16:40.900]   My pick, I have two things.
[02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:47.540]   Filmic Pro, they are an application that I've used in the past for recording video, for
[02:16:47.540 --> 02:16:49.220]   little projects I've done.
[02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:54.020]   And their video app has a lot more controls in it where you can control frame rate and
[02:16:54.020 --> 02:16:56.660]   focus peaking and things of that nature.
[02:16:56.660 --> 02:17:04.060]   It's not just firing up your smartphones regular video app, but they just updated a new service
[02:17:04.060 --> 02:17:07.940]   for the folks using iPhone 11 or 10s.
[02:17:07.940 --> 02:17:13.900]   10s are greater and it's called Double Take and it allows you to do multi-cam video.
[02:17:13.900 --> 02:17:14.900]   It's so cool.
[02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:20.940]   And it's really, really slick and intuitive and I don't have multi-cam, of course, but
[02:17:20.940 --> 02:17:26.100]   I like the idea of them putting yet another tool at your fingertips for a really good
[02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:27.100]   price.
[02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:28.780]   It's also cool because the free is great.
[02:17:28.780 --> 02:17:34.300]   Although I paid for the pro version of Filmic hoping to get this feature and they put it
[02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:35.300]   in the free.
[02:17:35.300 --> 02:17:38.180]   And I think they're going to put it in the pro and maybe get some features.
[02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:42.860]   So what's cool is the iPhone, in this case the iPhone 11 Pro Max has three cameras in
[02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:43.860]   the back and one in the front.
[02:17:43.860 --> 02:17:47.380]   So you get to pick, if you could show the front of my screen, you get to pick from whichever
[02:17:47.380 --> 02:17:50.500]   two of those you want.
[02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:55.700]   And then once you've done that, so I'm going to have a rear picture and a forward looking
[02:17:55.700 --> 02:18:00.580]   picture and I record and if I'm interviewing you, I could say I'm talking to Aunt Pruitt,
[02:18:00.580 --> 02:18:02.100]   I wish we'd had this for CES.
[02:18:02.100 --> 02:18:04.420]   Right, and we were waiting for this.
[02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:05.420]   We were hoping.
[02:18:05.420 --> 02:18:09.660]   And you can put it in post as two different images and it makes post-process in us so much
[02:18:09.660 --> 02:18:10.660]   easy.
[02:18:10.660 --> 02:18:12.820]   Yeah, I really, really dig that.
[02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:18.540]   So you get to choose, you get a picture in picture side by side or if you want.
[02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:22.620]   And you can control focus for either camera independently.
[02:18:22.620 --> 02:18:25.540]   This shows really how much horsepower is in the iPhone actually.
[02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:26.540]   It's impressive.
[02:18:26.540 --> 02:18:29.180]   Filmic Pro, what's it called?
[02:18:29.180 --> 02:18:30.180]   Double take.
[02:18:30.180 --> 02:18:31.180]   Double take.
[02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:36.340]   If you have an iPhone XS or higher, you're good to go.
[02:18:36.340 --> 02:18:42.220]   And my second thing was basically just something that was in my brain when I got up this morning
[02:18:42.220 --> 02:18:49.020]   and I sent out a tweet and it's just, did the words baby drifting just come in your
[02:18:49.020 --> 02:18:50.020]   head?
[02:18:50.020 --> 02:18:55.500]   Well, no, but it's just, we have so much dad gum hate and stuff going on.
[02:18:55.500 --> 02:19:02.860]   Nowadays, just do your best today to leave your positive mark on this planet.
[02:19:02.860 --> 02:19:08.500]   I don't care if it's just a skid mark or pushing on your sibling around like that on
[02:19:08.500 --> 02:19:09.500]   the floor.
[02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:14.740]   Just do something and just leave a positive mark people because we got so much crap going
[02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:19.620]   on out here in this world and we need every little bit of positivity that we can get.
[02:19:19.620 --> 02:19:21.420]   And it can start with something like that.
[02:19:21.420 --> 02:19:25.220]   It could start with just sending a selfie to your mom saying, Hey, mom.
[02:19:25.220 --> 02:19:26.220]   Oh, I need to do that.
[02:19:26.220 --> 02:19:27.220]   That's good.
[02:19:27.220 --> 02:19:28.220]   Anything.
[02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:30.900]   Hey, mom, but that's it.
[02:19:30.900 --> 02:19:35.900]   I'll show you a little way that you can.
[02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:39.100]   I dropped something nice in the show to her in the live chat.
[02:19:39.100 --> 02:19:42.100]   It is a postcard set for font lovers.
[02:19:42.100 --> 02:19:43.100]   Wow.
[02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:46.380]   Since all of y'all are so excited about fun.
[02:19:46.380 --> 02:19:47.380]   So fond there.
[02:19:47.380 --> 02:19:48.380]   I appreciate you.
[02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:51.060]   This is paper dash hammer.com.
[02:19:51.060 --> 02:19:54.220]   You get avant guards to see you at your style future.
[02:19:54.220 --> 02:19:55.820]   Mrs. Eaves for 24 bucks.
[02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:58.420]   You get 12 fonts.
[02:19:58.420 --> 02:20:00.460]   The little phrases on them are hilarious.
[02:20:00.460 --> 02:20:01.460]   Yes.
[02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:03.420]   Mrs. Eaves was my babysitter.
[02:20:03.420 --> 02:20:04.820]   I can be a little strange.
[02:20:04.820 --> 02:20:05.820]   Not trash.
[02:20:05.820 --> 02:20:06.820]   You're a style.
[02:20:06.820 --> 02:20:08.340]   It's keeping up with.
[02:20:08.340 --> 02:20:10.540]   I'd go to Helvetica and back for you.
[02:20:10.540 --> 02:20:12.580]   Oh, that's cute.
[02:20:12.580 --> 02:20:13.580]   I collect.
[02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:14.580]   I'm not old fashioned.
[02:20:14.580 --> 02:20:16.300]   I'm old English.
[02:20:16.300 --> 02:20:17.300]   This is awesome.
[02:20:17.300 --> 02:20:18.300]   All right.
[02:20:18.300 --> 02:20:19.300]   All right.
[02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:20.300]   What's the fun on the rundown now?
[02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:21.300]   Oh, you put it back.
[02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:22.940]   Oh, they changed it back.
[02:20:22.940 --> 02:20:26.020]   This guy has nice kill joys.
[02:20:26.020 --> 02:20:27.020]   Felt marker.
[02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:28.020]   It was really.
[02:20:28.020 --> 02:20:29.020]   That's what it was.
[02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:30.020]   I was trying to order what it was.
[02:20:30.020 --> 02:20:31.500]   It was very annoying.
[02:20:31.500 --> 02:20:32.500]   Thank you for fixing it.
[02:20:32.500 --> 02:20:35.180]   Oh, you guys are so fun.
[02:20:35.180 --> 02:20:36.660]   Control Z, man.
[02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:37.660]   Control Z.
[02:20:37.660 --> 02:20:43.020]   Oh, well, I can't read it now on the plus side.
[02:20:43.020 --> 02:20:46.380]   Oh, oh, you guys, we have to hurry or I have to go whichever.
[02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:47.380]   All right.
[02:20:47.380 --> 02:20:48.380]   We're done.
[02:20:48.380 --> 02:20:49.380]   All right.
[02:20:49.380 --> 02:20:50.380]   We are?
[02:20:50.380 --> 02:20:51.380]   No.
[02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:52.380]   Leave me.
[02:20:52.380 --> 02:20:53.380]   Don't do it.
[02:20:53.380 --> 02:20:54.900]   Do your product on thing.
[02:20:54.900 --> 02:20:55.900]   All right.
[02:20:55.900 --> 02:20:59.620]   Product on is released a new website called Your Stack a Site that I will probably use
[02:20:59.620 --> 02:21:02.620]   for about five minutes and then stop using the idea.
[02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:04.460]   Just like Facebook.
[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:05.460]   I'm sorry.
[02:21:05.460 --> 02:21:06.460]   I'm sorry.
[02:21:06.460 --> 02:21:08.380]   I didn't realize we were doing this under duress.
[02:21:08.380 --> 02:21:09.380]   Good Lord.
[02:21:09.380 --> 02:21:15.900]   The idea is so product on which I like, but also don't use is where people go to say,
[02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:19.460]   hey, something new just came out or I just put something out and they people vote on it.
[02:21:19.460 --> 02:21:22.340]   This is just a place where it's kind of a nice idea for a social network.
[02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:25.540]   You just go in there and say, hey, here's something I like.
[02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:34.220]   A book, an app, a picture, whatever you want to put there.
[02:21:34.220 --> 02:21:35.220]   I think is really cool.
[02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:37.100]   Now, this is a lot of what we do on our shows.
[02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:40.220]   I should probably put rum in there, although somebody probably already has.
[02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:42.140]   So there you go.
[02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:48.460]   Just a stack of and this is again, this is a replacement for Twitter or Facebook stuff
[02:21:48.460 --> 02:21:49.460]   that's good.
[02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:50.460]   Yeah.
[02:21:50.460 --> 02:21:53.620]   I'm sure about 30 seconds.
[02:21:53.620 --> 02:21:55.100]   Yeah, that's one of those.
[02:21:55.100 --> 02:21:56.860]   One of those things.
[02:21:56.860 --> 02:21:59.420]   That's why I didn't really care if I didn't get to share it with you.
[02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:00.900]   I'm sure somebody's minding it.
[02:22:00.900 --> 02:22:02.700]   Stacy Higginbotham has to go.
[02:22:02.700 --> 02:22:03.700]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:06.020]   Always a pleasure.
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:09.260]   Stacy on IOT's or website.com.
[02:22:09.260 --> 02:22:10.340]   Get the newsletter there.
[02:22:10.340 --> 02:22:11.620]   That's free and it must get.
[02:22:11.620 --> 02:22:15.140]   You can also get her a great podcast she does with Kevin Tofol, the IOT.
[02:22:15.140 --> 02:22:16.140]   It is.
[02:22:16.140 --> 02:22:17.140]   It is.
[02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:18.140]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:22:18.140 --> 02:22:21.780]   She and her American girl doll are going to go now.
[02:22:21.780 --> 02:22:23.420]   That's this week's thumbnail.
[02:22:23.420 --> 02:22:24.980]   Cup of tea.
[02:22:24.980 --> 02:22:27.220]   We found the soft side of Stacey.
[02:22:27.220 --> 02:22:31.620]   Hey, I still have my American girl typewriter right through my desk.
[02:22:31.620 --> 02:22:32.620]   What?
[02:22:32.620 --> 02:22:34.100]   Oh my God.
[02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:36.100]   Look at that.
[02:22:36.100 --> 02:22:37.100]   Check it.
[02:22:37.100 --> 02:22:39.180]   It's a working typewriter that makes really.
[02:22:39.180 --> 02:22:40.860]   Is that an underwood?
[02:22:40.860 --> 02:22:43.860]   It's not quite as good as it is.
[02:22:43.860 --> 02:22:45.740]   It only does one letter, but that's still.
[02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:47.540]   And the paper actually goes through.
[02:22:47.540 --> 02:22:49.980]   Wow, that's so cute.
[02:22:49.980 --> 02:22:55.980]   Jeff Jarvis joins us each week to share his wisdom about Gutenberg, his blog, his buzzmachine.com.
[02:22:55.980 --> 02:23:02.020]   He's a professor of journalism at CUNY and we love having you on.
[02:23:02.020 --> 02:23:04.140]   You're working on your graduate school of Germany?
[02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:06.340]   Yeah, I don't have that paper in front of me.
[02:23:06.340 --> 02:23:07.340]   Okay.
[02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:08.340]   You don't need to be sure.
[02:23:08.340 --> 02:23:09.340]   You can't read the whole thing.
[02:23:09.340 --> 02:23:11.340]   I quoted Craig today as someone on the show.
[02:23:11.340 --> 02:23:12.340]   We had ads on the show today.
[02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:15.140]   I would have read it, but I don't know what this is for free.
[02:23:15.140 --> 02:23:16.140]   Kevin, do you have any questions?
[02:23:16.140 --> 02:23:17.140]   Anything your stack?
[02:23:17.140 --> 02:23:18.140]   Guess who's there?
[02:23:18.140 --> 02:23:19.140]   There we go.
[02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:20.140]   Who?
[02:23:20.140 --> 02:23:21.140]   Scoble.
[02:23:21.140 --> 02:23:23.580]   Yes, Scoble is one of the first people to post on it.

[02:23:41.340 --> 02:23:43.340]   He does hands-on photography.
[02:23:43.340 --> 02:23:46.340]   He's put that TV/hop.

[02:23:48.140 --> 02:23:50.140]   I don't want to say what it's good.
[02:23:50.140 --> 02:23:51.140]   I can't wait to hear.
[02:23:51.140 --> 02:23:52.140]   We're still working on it.
[02:23:52.140 --> 02:23:53.140]   It's good.
[02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:54.140]   I like it.
[02:23:54.140 --> 02:23:55.140]   It's going to be a good show.
[02:23:55.140 --> 02:23:56.640]   I'm excited about it.
[02:23:56.640 --> 02:24:01.980]   Me, I'm just the guy who sits in his chair all the time.
[02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:03.740]   If you enjoy the show, come back again.
[02:24:03.740 --> 02:24:08.500]   We do it every Wednesday, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2130 UTC.

[02:24:16.660 --> 02:24:19.700]   In this case, it's twit.tv/twig.
[02:24:19.700 --> 02:24:21.540]   There's the snowstorm from last week.
[02:24:21.540 --> 02:24:23.540]   Stay seats all melted away.
[02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:25.100]   Oh, that was like two weeks ago, I think.
[02:24:25.100 --> 02:24:26.100]   Two weeks ago.
[02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:27.100]   And don't forget the survey.
[02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:28.100]   Oh, yeah.
[02:24:28.100 --> 02:24:29.100]   Survey.
[02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:30.100]   Survey.
[02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:31.100]   Survey.
[02:24:31.100 --> 02:24:32.100]   Take the survey, twit.to/survey20.
[02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:36.540]   Maybe we can find somebody buying that on this show.
[02:24:36.540 --> 02:24:37.540]   Oh, Lord.
[02:24:37.540 --> 02:24:38.540]   Okay.
[02:24:38.540 --> 02:24:41.140]   Well, I'm going to leave y'all in that depressing note.
[02:24:41.140 --> 02:24:42.140]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:43.140]   Thank you, Jeffrey.
[02:24:43.140 --> 02:24:44.140]   Thank you.
