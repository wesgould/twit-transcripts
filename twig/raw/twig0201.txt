[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google Jeff Jarvis has the day off,
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.380]   Kevin Marks is here along with Gina Trappana.
[00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.380]   With Trappani, we'll talk about the issue of complete-ism and how to avoid it.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.880]   Infinite music loops generated automatically,
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.200]   and the latest for the HTC One. It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.060]   Netcast, you love.

[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.820]   It's time for this week in Google. Twig is on the air.
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.540]   Gina Trippani is here from SmarterWare.org.
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.540]   She is also the programmer of ThinkUp, the fabulous ThinkUp app.

[00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.980]   Yes, hello.
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.980]   All of which are important.
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.420]   Oh, and host of All About Android.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.260]   It's nice to see you.
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.900]   Yeah, we had a bunch of us.
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.900]   It's great to be here.
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.180]   Favorite Hour of the Week.
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.420]   Because you had the guy who does Swiftkey on, and that's awesome.
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.860]   We did.
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.420]   Somebody from Swiftkey.
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.420]   Yeah.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.940]   I love Swiftkey.
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.660]   I can no longer say this is my favorite hour of the week.
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.220]   It's my second.
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.500]   I have two favorite hours of the week.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.100]   There's a lot of do-all about Android and then Twig the next time.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.620]   I'm loving Android so more and more all the time.
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.220]   Now, my biggest problem is whether I should use the GS4 or the HTC One.
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.220]   I go back and forth.
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.540]   They're both great phones.
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.420]   Yeah, they really are.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.220]   Neither is perfect.
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.420]   And both have its pros and cons on both.
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.100]   So it's a difficult choice.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.540]   Currently carrying the HTC One.
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.900]   And I'm going to talk about that actually a little bit later on.
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.140]   Also, with this, Jeff Jarvis is on his way to Thailand, as he mentioned last week.
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.380]   So with us, very graciously filling in from his bird cage, Kevin Marks.
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.380]   Hi, Dan.
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.260]   It's good to see you.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.740]   Tom will vision.tv and salesforce.com.
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.260]   And former Googler, former Appler, former B tier.
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.500]   Great to have you, Kevin.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   Nice to see you.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   That's a con-keeper job.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.260]   You're just in demand.
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.060]   You're trying to serve everyone.
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.060]   There we go.
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.620]   I'll take you that, though.
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.900]   I didn't realize this, but I was just looking at your title at Salesforce.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.900]   What is what?
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.500]   Vice President of Open Cloud Standards.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.740]   I like that.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.740]   Open standards.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.820]   And that's kind of what you've really promoted all along, hasn't you?
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.780]   That's what I've been involved with, certainly for the last 10 years.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.780]   Yeah.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.700]   And it depends how you define QuickTime.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.220]   I suppose 10 years before that, I was spending a lot of time on QuickTime, which was...
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.420]   It was from one company, and I wouldn't fully define it as open.
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.980]   But the file format was a de facto standard at the time.
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.620]   And Apple had kind of dropped the ball on that.
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.540]   Didn't you tell us that you lobbied within Apple to keep it open?
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.380]   I tried to get more open-source codecs and things, and I was trying to get vorbus and
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.260]   things like that, and build it into it.
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.980]   And there were two frightened patterns at the time to do that.
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.060]   And also, Apple made a fatal mistake of patenting some piece of the file format, and therefore
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.380]   it was then tainted, and people wouldn't use it.
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.060]   So we've lost a lot of the value of the QuickTime had.
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.100]   But I was having this conversation at SF Music Tech last week, where we're now trying to
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.420]   come up again with multi... just for audio, multi-track standards for audio.
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.100]   And the problem is that every standardization that's been done in the last 10 years has
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.860]   been for playback only, not really for mastering.
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:38.220]   And so we're able to use the RFF, but there isn't a good way to interchange the raw multi-track
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.220]   between different programs.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.220]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.220]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.780]   So it's not about compression, it's just about the format.
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.620]   But isn't AIFF, the Apple Center, just pretty much close to here's the bits?
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.140]   Yes, but the problem is that even though AIFF can train an arbitrary number of tracks,
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.940]   most of the programs will intake too.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.300]   And so if you're trying to take an entire mix back and forth, it's a lot more fiddly.
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.420]   So one of the guys from Beatport, they're trying to distribute the raw stems for the
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.740]   people creating music so that they can be remixed.
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.700]   And he was saying that they've got a big problem with this because they can distribute
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.660]   them as a giant AIFF with all the tracks in.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.660]   And that works.
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.180]   But when you try and import it to other programs, they only take the first two.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.300]   So they have to do some jiggery pokery to separate their own individual files and then
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.940]   line them up again, which is a bit backwards.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.940]   It doesn't take much to understand the value of this.
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:39.140]   A few bands have, I think, Nine-inch Nails distributed the garage band of the tracks,
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.140]   the raw tracks.
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.140]   Yes.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.980]   And it's so amazing to hear the individual tracks.
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.740]   There is a bootleg, which I've heard, of tracks from the Beatles' original Fort track
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.660]   recordings at Abbey Road, where you can hear the vocal, you can hear each individual instrument,
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.500]   and it's mind boggling.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.500]   Right.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.500]   Now, this is the thing.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.340]   So what's happening with, especially with the electronic dance music scene, is that there's
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.020]   a lot of value in remixes and DJs remaking stuff.
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.660]   So what the Beatles guys are trying to do is make it possible to distribute these.
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.940]   And so there's only out raw audio files.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:20.500]   But the way they have to do it is if you have a sample that's only used in the fourth minute,
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.980]   you have to pad it with silence up to the fourth minute, put the sample in and then pad
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:24.980]   it out.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.300]   And distribute the track like that, which is a little crazy.
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.620]   I mean, it's not the end of the world, but it means that you're throwing gigantic files
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.820]   around for no real reason.
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.660]   Whereas what we had with QuickTime was the ability to edit arbitrary files together in
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.180]   time sequence from any source.
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.940]   So you could say, just take this bit and put it at this time and have it sample accurately
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.340]   drop in and mix.
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.900]   And that's the piece that we've kind of lost.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.780]   We haven't got a good format for that, I mean.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.780]   It's amazing.
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:52.780]   Imagine buying an album.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.780]   You buy the regular album, or you could buy the unmixed album, or the pre...
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.500]   The unmixed it yourself version.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.540]   Here I found on studio multitrex.com, here is come together in individual tracks.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.180]   There's guitar, there's bass, there's vocals, there's drums.
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.620]   Let me just play the vocals.
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.620]   Can you...
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.220]   I don't know if you're getting audio from my EMA in my blocked it.
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.220]   Okay.
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.620]   I've got one.
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.620]   That's nice.
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.620]   Let me...
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.620]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.620]   No, wait a minute.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.620]   Here it is.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.620]   Here it is.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.620]   It is on YouTube.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.620]   They just blocked it on the remote site.
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.620]   Maybe Chad, you can't hear me.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.820]   I don't know.
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.620]   We're having trouble with getting this laptop.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:42.700]   I saw one yesterday that was the ISO voice track for under pressure.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.540]   Oh, I love that.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.900]   I just love that when you can do that.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.900]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.900]   So that's the thing.
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.900]   But this is...
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.900]   If you're DJing, this is what you need.
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.460]   You need individual pieces.
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.460]   And there's lots of...
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.460]   Right.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.860]   ...to have a software now that will sit there and try and extract them through frequency
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:07:59.860]   filtering and stuff.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.900]   But obviously it's much better if you can distribute them raw and in pieces.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.900]   Right.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.900]   That was a...
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:06.900]   And we have no format.
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.900]   That's very interesting.
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.900]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:09.900]   And we haven't got a good format for it.
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.900]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.900]   So the problem is that each app has their own.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.900]   Right.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.900]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.860]   I mean, you kind of have the de facto garage band, you know, or Logic, which so many people
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.940]   use that you could use it, but of course it's not an open standard.
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:21.940]   Yeah.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:22.940]   Yeah.
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.780]   And there's different ones that use by different people.
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.780]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.980]   Well, enough of that, although that's frankly very interesting.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.220]   And I will...
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.220]   Maybe Chad could find...
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.180]   It's on YouTube.
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.100]   Come together vocals on YouTube, Chad.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.660]   Maybe you can play it for us because it's come together isolated vocals.
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.940]   I don't know where these came from.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.140]   Pretty interesting.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.620]   And I'm sure that we'll get pulled down immediately for explaining them.
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.220]   So that's the click track.
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.500]   There we go.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.260]   That's a vocal, which I never knew.
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.260]   Wow.
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:10.740]   Isn't it great to hear that?
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.740]   Wow.
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.620]   You just feel more intimate.
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.060]   Down to his knee.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.140]   Got to be a joker.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.140]   He just do what he pleads.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.140]   All right, we can stop.
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.340]   But that's John Lennon, obviously, that we're all vocal from "Come Together."
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.500]   Unbelievable.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.660]   I would lie to you.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.020]   The music industry should solve this because wouldn't you buy albums this way?
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.020]   Right.
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.020]   Well, this was...
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.100]   And the other conversation we had was this was...
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.620]   There's the Neil Young thing, which is, "Oh, we should create high quality.
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.620]   Because according to...
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.620]   Oh no."
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.860]   But the argument we were having there was it's the solving the wrong problem.
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.860]   I mean, there's...
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:53.860]   Right.
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.860]   That's a play back.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:55.860]   That's a play back.
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.860]   And with the distributing high quality mix.
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.860]   Right.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:58.860]   But actually 44 kilohertz stereo is plenty good enough for that.
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.020]   I mean, you can send that uncompressed, or you can send that with 320 P3s and it's still
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.620]   for sound transparent.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.820]   The difficulty is that everyone's been mixing for headphones, for, you know, in earbuds,
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.140]   instead of for proper equipment.
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:17.100]   So the right answer might be to distribute a track with four different studio engineered
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.100]   mixes.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.100]   Right.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.100]   So you've got one for...
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.020]   I'm wearing headphones and one for I'm in the car and one for I'm using my fancy high-fry
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.940]   equipment and one that's around or something like that.
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.820]   And set it up so that you bundle those together and sell that and then you play back the one
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.500]   that makes sense at the time.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:38.980]   So you get the very highly compressed one that's really loud if you're in that situation
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:43.620]   where you need the extra bass, but if you've actually got the big over the ear can transparent
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.180]   headphones, then you use the good mix instead.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.980]   That was the ball.
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:53.380]   The other fascinating thing for me is that gigantic headphones are back.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.340]   Yeah, they are, aren't they?
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.340]   Yeah.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:01.060]   And the monster guys were sponsoring SF Music Tech and were pitching theirs.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:06.580]   But the fact that, you know, my son's gone off on holiday with his girlfriend and they've
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:11.420]   taken two gigantic over the ear cans and a little...
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:15.060]   I fear it's more for style than it is for audio fidelity however.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.060]   It's a bit about...
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.700]   But at least, you know, the point is the availability is there.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.580]   You can actually tell the difference between, you know, these things and proper headphones
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.820]   if you're trying to.
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.820]   And there's a...
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.860]   Oh, there's more bass in the big ones, which is obviously true because physics.
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.060]   But also there's more dynamic range and that gets really important.
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.780]   So the fact that you can have good acoustic isolation and then listen to dynamic range
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.340]   means we may get better mixes back.
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.060]   That's my hope.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.420]   So that was my music geekery last week.
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.420]   Fun!
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.420]   Yeah.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.820]   Kind of a completely different topic from what we were going to talk about.
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.580]   But you know, the truth is there's not any major breaking news anyway after Google I/O.
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.340]   We're kind of in the lull now.
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.140]   Well, the time back to the web is the web audio stuff.
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.500]   So I don't know how much of that you've seen.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.940]   But the HTML5 web audio is actually really impressive now.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.660]   They've built an expression language that lets you do multi-channel mixers and synthesizers.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.660]   Really?
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.220]   And voice recognition, all kinds of stuff.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.420]   So Chris Wilson from Google was showing that off at SF Music Tech.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.420]   He's...
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.820]   They had Chris on, you should get Chris on sometimes.
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.820]   No, sounds wonderful.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.820]   Yeah.
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.020]   He used to work for Microsoft that IE, he now works for Google on Chromavangelism.
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.620]   And you should get him on sometimes to talk about web audio.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.780]   That would be a fun...
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.780]   So what would be...
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:34.740]   Give me a scenario, I'm using Chrome, I'm browsing around and suddenly I get to a site
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.740]   that supports this.
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.500]   What would it look like?
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.500]   What would it happen?
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.740]   Well, it can do anything you can do with audio.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.860]   So it could be a synthesizer, it could let you remix things.
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.180]   There's the infinite songs, if you've seen that.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.700]   I probably shouldn't get you to play them on air because then you get the show taken down.
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.580]   But if you search for infinite jukebox, basically you can put a song in, it analyzes
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.380]   the song for beats, it looks to see which beats are similar and then it will play the
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:04.020]   song and runs when you come up between ones that are similar so the song lasts forever.
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.020]   Love it.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.660]   Infinite jukebox has come.
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.660]   Infinite jukebox.
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.100]   It's great fun.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.940]   You can upload all three songs to it.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.740]   But I think everyone hits it probably fall over.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:19.300]   It's fascinating to see that you can actually do that on the web using web software.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.060]   And that's the stage that the web audio has got.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.100]   So far it's only Chrome and Firefox I think.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.340]   I'm not sure if it works fully in Safari yet.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.380]   I think some of it's in Safari because it was in WebKit.
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:34.100]   So I just gave it, call me maybe, which I don't think anybody would argue is not long
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.500]   enough.
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.140]   But it analyzed it.
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.300]   And so it's going to just play this song forever.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.300]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.140]   So if you hit the top and hit play.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.140]   Well, I'm not going to do that.
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.060]   But there's a visual of what's happening.
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.780]   Are these the, oh, you don't see it.
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.340]   Oh, it's generating it.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.580]   You're doing yours.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.220]   Do you not see mine at all?
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.340]   I see yours fine, but just the audio.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.340]   Yeah, I just wanted to see it.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.340]   So what happens after it generates it?
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.940]   These are the loopbacks, right?
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.940]   Yeah.
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:05.740]   This is where it's, so these long curves in the middle are where it connects one piece
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.740]   to the other piece.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.340]   These are similar enough we could do the jump.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.820]   And if you hit the top and hit play, it'll play around and sometimes it'll jump across.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.820]   Oh, go ahead, Chad.
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.820]   What the hell?
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.820]   Okay.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.820]   Here we go.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.460]   Well, then we have to listen to this.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.220]   Because do where there's a loop.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.220]   Oh my God.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.220]   I'm listening to it.
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.220]   It's incredible.
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.700]   I love it.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.500]   So does it jump back here or will it jump forward here?
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.060]   Yes, it would jump forward or back.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.060]   It'll do either.
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.460]   So it basically, it decides that two bars are similar enough that it can do the transition
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.460]   that you're noticing.
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.460]   And then it starts doing it.
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.460]   Here comes one.
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.460]   Listen.
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.460]   It may or may not.
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.460]   You can just go and play.
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.460]   Hey.
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.460]   It just shows you that it could if it wanted to.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.940]   Then it takes it and then we take it back again.
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.140]   I love it.
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.140]   So those are the loops.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.140]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.380]   You can't force it to take that.
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.620]   I guess it'll do it at some random.
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.620]   There it goes.
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.620]   Oh, no.
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.780]   And we're back again.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:02.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.780]   And we're back again.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.780]   Yeah.
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.780]   So we're this one.
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.780]   Yeah.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.220]   Those two choruses probably are the same.
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.220]   Yeah.
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.220]   So we're playing that another part.
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.100]   We jumped ahead with no evidence.
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:21.220]   Boy, you know, as somebody who spent a lot of years cutting music with razor blades.
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.340]   Playing that by hand is quite fun.
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.340]   That's pretty.
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.140]   I mean, I know exactly what they're doing, but that's impressive.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.180]   But you know, but it's, you know, obviously with, you know, a song like that is really
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.380]   easy because everything was.
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.380]   Yeah, it's correct.
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.980]   No, no, because everything was edited with tight bar boundaries and it's a drum machine.
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:37.980]   It's not sufficient.
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.980]   Yeah.
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.060]   But I if I've done it with Pink Floyd's time and that actually would be hard to do or a
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.460]   Mozart symphony that.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.460]   Okay, good.
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.460]   That's impressive.
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.380]   So that's the, you know, that's an example of the kind of thing you can do with this.
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.300]   You can actually play audio samples with enough precision to do sample accurate edits like
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.300]   that.
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.300]   And these things are.
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.300]   And there's synthesizers.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.540]   There's Chris Bull of vocoder.
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:03.260]   So you can actually give yourself a daft punk thing in the browser as you stick into a mic
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.260]   and things like that.
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.020]   So there's, there's basically it's all the power of stuff you can do with digital audio,
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.700]   but now move to the web layer.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.020]   So that's one of these fun standards for me.
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.220]   It's like, oh, we can do great things with this.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:21.980]   So the HTML5 support in that, in like that example is the player is like in the markup
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:28.140]   you're saying, play this audio from, from this point on like what's that?
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.780]   What's happening in the browser there?
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:35.500]   So you've got, you've got an API to play audio in different sequences and you've got
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.980]   a set of filter chain that you can set up.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.340]   So you, you can write JavaScript, you can say play this and play this next or you can
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.980]   write JavaScript, the triggers and changes it.
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.420]   But you can also set up a whole filter chain that is just managed for you.
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.580]   So you don't try to, you can filter samples in JavaScript by hand.
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.580]   You know, there is an API that lets you get the buffers and do that.
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.580]   Right, right.
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.580]   What song is that?
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.580]   Check.
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.580]   Not the name.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.580]   Nyan Cat.
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:02.580]   All right.
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.580]   Let's see that.
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.780]   Apparently it's quite a few jump points.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:11.580]   Actually whoever made Nyan Cat figured out how to do that.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.380]   Is that the song?
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.420]   Now it's back to the front.
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.900]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.940]   You can see how little progress you're making.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.700]   Oh yeah, this one ever end.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.700]   Oh, now we're in the middle.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:31.300]   But also you can also all the same color because they're all pretty much the same sound.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.300]   Right.
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:39.980]   So it's a visualizer and it's a sequencer.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:40.980]   So here's the thing.
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:45.820]   I mean, when I look at stuff like this, like, oh gosh, technology's really swell.
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.780]   And we live in wonderful times.
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:53.260]   And then I think in some ways this is tougher for a creator because there's rapidly converging
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.940]   on infinite choice.
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.860]   And almost in a way, you know, don't don't don't don't people really want to limit themselves.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.780]   And also they make up sonnets, right?
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.100]   Or haiku.
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.660]   They want the rules and then create within the rules.
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:12.020]   And as things as almost anything as possible, I almost feel like that's bad.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.620]   I mean, I'm not I'm not advocating that we should we should get rid of all this stuff.
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.620]   I don't know.
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.180]   I think I feel bad for kids today though.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.460]   They're limitless choices in front of them.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.020]   But that's how it makes sense.
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.020]   It makes sense.
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.660]   I've had I've had this old person like I just can't keep up.
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.660]   There's so much.
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.140]   I gotta take some time like 20% time where I just learn new things.
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.020]   I just like there's so much new stuff to play with.
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.140]   There is a skill that I think people are learning.
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.380]   I I learned it myself.
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.660]   And I think people are learning where you can say I don't have to do it all.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.420]   I don't have to read it started with me reading it all.
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.420]   Right.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.420]   Dave Warner's talked a little bit about this.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.820]   I don't have to read every article in my RSS feed.
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:54.860]   I can now dip into the river and dip out and not feel like they're used to it for those
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.980]   of us Kevin and in my vintage maybe not you Gina.
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:04.660]   But first yeah and when we first encountered the Internet your first reaction is all great
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.740]   and you I want to read it all.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.740]   Yeah I play Catholic school.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.740]   Yeah.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:14.860]   And then you and then you realize okay hey it's impossible and be the is this this this
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:22.180]   this a nervousness that comes out of it like a completionism is that the word that describes
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.180]   it that makes sense.
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:27.940]   But it's it is but but there's also the other way of thing is that you see me everyone's
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.900]   seen the same things that you have which which often isn't true and that the the the
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.940]   production that there is a there is a shared context can be quite hard and that's valuable
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.660]   shared culture we were just talking about Game of Thrones and the fact that the three
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.780]   of us knew what we were talking about was very much a part of the conversation and important.
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:44.780]   Right.
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.060]   And that's so that cultural common ground is really important.
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.620]   But but but you know but the other half of that is you can now at least get it.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.260]   So the so you're talking about new kids in music.
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:00.500]   I've got you know I've got teenagers who are 18 and I my son's birthday I got him able
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.100]   to know that I launch pads so he can do all this makes a connection.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.540]   That's what I got from my son too.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:11.220]   But you know I'm looking back you know when I was their age I was you know I wanted to
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.500]   do synthetic music I had to build my own synthesizer out of components right because I couldn't
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.100]   afford to buy one because they were too expensive.
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.540]   Isn't that good in somewhere and I and I never got to the point where I had the mastery
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.540]   to actually be good at it.
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:24.540]   So you know I was sitting there trying to play with this thing going okay I understand
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:28.020]   what I want to do but I don't actually have the musical mastery of rhythm to get this
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.020]   in the right place.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.860]   Yeah but Kevin the skill tool the skill thing you learn now has has informed your career
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.780]   for the remaining 30 years.
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:41.140]   So maybe I found a little bit of a glitch and I wanted to point out why okay the final
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.660]   countdown by Europe.
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:49.940]   It's an infinite loop.
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.740]   I can't believe you even tried the final countdown.
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.780]   Oh yeah okay and it'll move but yeah that's true.
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:01.540]   If you click somewhere else it'll it'll start again.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.900]   The rest of development you know.
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.900]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:07.900]   See another cultural.
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:08.900]   Yeah yeah.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:14.500]   And what's funny is I had never watched the rest of development and so in order to keep
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:20.300]   up with the cultural thing I have been mass consuming the earlier seasons so that I could
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.780]   be in this conversation.
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.300]   Well that's I had neither.
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:27.100]   I only saw that through Netflix because my son said this is funny you should watch this
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.620]   one last year so now I haven't watched the new ones yet.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:30.620]   It's marvelous.
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:37.220]   So that's the other point the other point is all this stuff is available so if I mention
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:42.420]   any musician my son can go away and listen to their entire oeuvre and then decide what
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.180]   they like them which best they like whereas before we were stuck with it's on the radio
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.780]   or it's in the record shop.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.540]   So this is the anti-Yaron Lanier.
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:55.660]   Yaron Lanier says you can no longer hear a decayed in music because the music is now touching
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.780]   the whole of history and I think that's a wonderful thing then.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.420]   The fact that I'm not stuck with whatever happens to be fashionable at the moment is
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:05.020]   great I didn't have to listen to what this stuff is I can dig into other things.
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.020]   Yeah I've done that.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:12.220]   I started an audio lecture on the history of music and I was able to go back and listen
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:17.300]   to Jaskand to pray and discover that and go from that and then I put it into Pandora
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.260]   and then Pandora discovered more.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:25.420]   So you're right I mean it can inform you as well and it can lead you if you have that
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:30.020]   point of view I guess that's the skill that people have to learn is to choose because
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.820]   other places it's like yeah.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:35.580]   It's an choice yeah now it is that an adventure is like where to go where to go next I just
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.420]   give me the next thing but yeah.
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:43.660]   So forget completism no more anxiety over that and then you choose and I look at my daughter
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.860]   who has not yet learned to choose and the amount of anxiety she has from all the options
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:52.100]   available to her is debilitating.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.940]   It stops her.
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:59.980]   The trickiness and the place where there is a potential problem here is that and I've
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:04.860]   heard this from people who teach literature is that it used to be the library was the
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.100]   place you went and everything in the library was you know vetted in a sense both by the
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.660]   publisher and by the librarian and so even though you had a you know you couldn't post
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.620]   that was the can library of books there was a canon there and there was a sense everything
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:21.140]   was there whereas now if you just dip into the net and follow threads on the net you are
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:27.660]   reading you can very easily go into a spiral of you know like Chad just had of like following
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:32.340]   links from people who reinforce each other and find that you are trapped in a corner where
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:37.780]   you think that you know Wi-Fi will kill your children and things like that.
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:42.580]   You never get anywhere or you go down a rabbit hole.
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:43.580]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:44.580]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.420]   I don't know I mean I can you know first of all it doesn't matter.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.980]   Jared Lanier can argue against it all he wants it's happening.
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.500]   Yes.
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:57.860]   So probably the best thing would be to learn how to deal with it because you can't stop
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.860]   it.
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.460]   No that's it and that's the point and then what you need to do now is teach you know critical
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.860]   reading and there's and you know all the things that you had to teach anyway.
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:05.860]   Right.
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.580]   You couldn't actually trust everything that was in the library.
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.060]   Right but you just thought you could.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.260]   But you had a full set or everything's in the newspaper.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:17.140]   Everything's on TV obviously not but you had this full sense of of oh well I've obviously
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.860]   that's right because that's that's the canon and then there's this assumption that people
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.980]   believe everything there we people now do believe generally do bring a more critical
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:28.940]   sense of of what they read to the internet especially if they've grown up there and it
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:35.100]   can be that the the older people who haven't had this as their formative reading experience
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.900]   who therefore think anything in print must be true that can get lit in the straight by
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.300]   this sometimes.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.300]   Right.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.260]   What a world it's very interesting and those of us you you haven't experienced this yet
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.860]   Jan but those of us with kids who have grown up as internet you know digital natives are
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:55.980]   watching with great interest to see what the hell's gonna happen.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:02.780]   Oh oh and I can't imagine any more digitally native than your kids and my kids Kevin Marks.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:03.780]   Wow.
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:08.740]   Samistan yeah I mean that's true I mean Andrew was doing software testing when he was two.
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:13.020]   Okay I rest my case.
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:17.340]   The funniest thing was when they were sort of seven or eight they assumed that I knew
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:20.780]   everyone who made every program because they did.
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:25.780]   They you know they they'd intuited from the fact that I gave them a bunch of things where
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.900]   I did know the people who'd made them right and then they was like there's a park in this
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.900]   you need to go and tell the guy.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.900]   That's so great.
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:35.900]   Dad.
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.900]   It's like well okay.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:46.860]   We're gonna take a break change lot coming up Kevin Marks is here Jean and Trapani we'll
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:50.380]   talk about the news yeah sure there's some news sure.
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.860]   Frankly that's what the thing I love most about this show is it doesn't have to be about
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:59.780]   anything it's a show about whatever we feel like talking about.
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:07.100]   Before we go on though to our change log and some good news if you are looking for a Google
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:12.660]   experience phone another one in the mix but first a word from our friends at Ting which
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:18.580]   is another example of a way the internet is changing everything and if there is anything
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:23.300]   that needed to be changed more than the cell phone industry I don't know what it is if you
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:29.820]   go to twig.ting.com you can take a look at this new company that is designed from the
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:35.740]   ground up to improve the experience of buying and using a cell phone.
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:40.660]   They are an MVNO that's a mobile virtual network operator they sit on top of sprint so if you
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:46.620]   have good spring coverage where you are Ting is a very very good choice.
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:51.020]   Whether you are month to month there is no contract there is no early termination fee
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:59.100]   and best of all there is no hidden bills no strange expenses no mysterious line items
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:06.060]   you pay for what you use no more no less go to the Ting plans section and you can actually
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:10.020]   design your plan you start with how many devices you want one of the things Ting is great for
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:14.220]   is shared plans whether it's for your family or business let's say a family of four Chad
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:19.300]   that $6 a month for the phone so that's the base and then we choose how many minutes now
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.900]   I think a family of four nowadays people don't talk on the phone much let's make it a thousand
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:27.860]   minutes here's why it doesn't matter if you get it exactly right 2000 text messages though
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:32.420]   that's make it four make it 4000 we're going to talk a lot and absolutely 3 gigabytes of
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.820]   data that's just the starting point now look if you look at the pricing that's 100 what
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:44.180]   is it not $113 what does that say Chad $113 not each for the family of four.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:49.820]   That's the entire cost but better yet let's say you got the minutes wrong they use more
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:54.060]   they just goes up to the next tier there's no penalty let's say you use fewer messages
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:59.300]   they refund you the difference more data less data you pay for what you use no more no less
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:06.460]   without any penalties no big ding no big bill just just cell phone service the way it ought to
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:12.380]   be if you go to twig.ting.com will give you a $25 credit to get started choose your device
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:17.300]   actually you can apply it to the monthly service to and ting does have a bring your own plans
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.940]   so if you already have a sprint phone you should investigate that on the ting website
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:29.260]   they have nice illustrations they it says shop around for a sprint device or grab one
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:36.380]   from a desk drawer so pick your device in android device they have blackberry they have a variety
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:41.340]   I you know you galaxy has four be a good starting point but you can get inexpensive devices
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:45.220]   they also have my five devices they have used devices so there's a lot of price points you're
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.380]   going to there's the HTC one that's kind of my favorite.
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.460]   Twenty five bucks off gives you a great starting point now these are not subsidized prices
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.980]   so understand that you may want to shop around a little bit to get a better price for bringing
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:00.900]   your own phone but here then you get the phone and you then you go on to the website and you
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.860]   activate it you've got a great dashboard so you always know exactly what's happening

[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:09.340]   change log.
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:14.900]   Gina tapani with what's new at the Google and Google announced that it's adding nutrition
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:20.580]   information for over a thousand foods to search results it looks like this is going to be
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.740]   work for voice search only and it's rolling out over over the next few weeks a couple
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.340]   of examples you could say to voice search either on your mobile device or in chrome
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:34.140]   voice search and your desktop how many calories are in an apple and Google read the answer
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:39.260]   back to you or you can ask a question about what about ingredients how what nutrients
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.660]   are in breadfruit I didn't even know what breadfruit was until I read this blog post
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:49.220]   I've seen every mutiny on the bounty yeah I know I did all about breadfruit baby it's
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:55.620]   all about breadfruit okay you can ask how many carbs are in corn so yeah this feature is
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:59.860]   only going to launch for English users and be rolling out to the US over the next 10
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.740]   days and over time they'll be adding more features and foods so you tap the microphone
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:08.780]   and say you know how many calories in a banana and I'll let you know yeah very cool they
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:12.180]   said it was a it was a tough challenge I haven't actually gotten this yet so it's rolling out
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:16.140]   of the next 10 days so I didn't get a chance to test it yet but it looks looks like a really
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:21.100]   nice way to say you know hey what am I about to stuff in my mouth which I need to ask more
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:31.620]   often actually actually ask Google that what am I about to stuff into my mouth gmail for
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:36.540]   iOS and Android are both getting the update that Google announced I think it was last week
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:41.300]   during this show this is the update that reorganizes your inbox into categories it's
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:47.100]   five categories primary your primary inbox or primary category social promotions updates
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:52.260]   and forums so the mobile apps are getting this right now so you can you can opt into this
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:57.340]   you can turn it off if you don't if you don't want it gmail for iOS is available in the
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:01.220]   app store now and actually I believe the Verge just reported is the Verge or oh sorry
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:06.700]   and gadgets reported that it's rolling out for it's showing up in the play store for
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:13.020]   Android as well so the iOS version also gets a new notification options you can get notified
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:17.860]   for all messages only important messages are not at all on a per account basis and you
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:23.020]   can do you can figure those in the end up settings and the Android version is also is
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:28.060]   getting a sliding drawer with labels and an account switcher for phones and tablets and
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:34.020]   also getting swiped down to refresh what do you think of the new gmail so I I was talking
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.460]   about this in all that Android last night I gave the old college try I turned it on last
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.300]   week during the show and I tried to use it I use it all week I use it for about six days
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:47.500]   but I'll tell you the truth I didn't I missed stuff I had I had mail land and other tabs
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:51.940]   other than primary I found that I just got lazy and only was looking at primary because
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.420]   that was kind of became my habit with because I had priority inbox turned on so became my
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:33:00.260]   habit that I sort of focused on priority inbox and then occasionally kind of prune the rest
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.100]   I only looked at primary and I missed stuff like I'm on a lot of mailing lists from my
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:09.660]   open source projects and I was missing those and forums and updates I was missing like Twitter
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.140]   DMs and notifications of Facebook messages and social because I just stopped looking at
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:18.220]   those other tabs so it just didn't it didn't work for me I can see how it would work for
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.860]   a lot of people just didn't quite work for me and I was just so used to my priority inbox
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.220]   workflow that I went back to it and I was like oh thank goodness yeah back to it back
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:31.420]   to a familiar place so you can turn it off you can turn it off yeah can you turn it off
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:36.180]   and I'm looking at the app I don't I think the app has to be this way I turn off in the
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:40.420]   app I'm not sure about that I mean this is this is I think that if it's turned off on
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.700]   the web it's got to be turned off in the app right because these are these are categories
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:49.060]   they're not labels which is a different yeah I mean they're doing a lot of sorting right
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:57.260]   yeah yeah um managed labels I don't know is that the that's the you got the update there
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:02.340]   do you have yeah it seems like it's just there I would have to where do I go settings
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:11.660]   email account and then inbox type settings email account and then you should get default
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:16.100]   inbox priority box type I see it could be priority or default well wait a minute no that's what
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:25.100]   we had before that's what we had that doesn't change the tab thing did not mine I still get
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:32.780]   the primary social promotions all right so Jason has an exes for so maybe oh so you're
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:43.060]   not getting you're not getting the so show me show me okay let's let's do it here menu settings
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:52.340]   the specific account yeah okay inbox type default inbox or priority inbox okay so priority
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:59.620]   is the new is the old way got it I still get all these tabs are you in the right email
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:06.060]   well you selected before you still got a choice of labels I think so they've made now
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:11.620]   social promotions updates and forms but it's still not filtering is that the idea and I
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:20.860]   have that new funny touch the picture Jason's baffled baffled I think it depends yeah in
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:25.940]   box categories what yeah that's that they're basically they are still labels they just create
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:30.140]   labels for you and auto filter certain types of things into those labels so they're basically
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:34.780]   setting up a bunch of filters for you and righting things so I think we're doing archive
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.980]   first so the kind of filters you've already built they're they're automatically more
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.260]   likely normal people yeah I think we've tracked it down Jason says he did not activate the
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:49.020]   new feature on his debt on his gmail desktop right so because it's not activated on the
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:54.940]   email he had the choice still on the mobile app but as soon as you I think because I've
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:36:01.820]   activated on my desktop as soon as I activate on the desktop then I'm done I deactivated
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:07.180]   it in in the desktop and I do not have it in on my mobile app okay so that's the way to
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:12.140]   do it I didn't get the update or because it turns it off yeah I think it probably matches
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:16.500]   one with you it's it's a little draconian I mean at least you can turn it off I hope they
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:21.700]   keep that feature yeah yeah it's I'm a little worried about gmail I'll be honest gmail is
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.900]   one of my favorite Google Google products and it just feels like it's getting a lot
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.500]   of stuff it's just a lot of features and now there's a lot of different ways to look
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:33.620]   your inbox right there's the regular way there's priority inbox now there's categories
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:38.580]   you got categories and labels we've got some plus integration we've got the hangouts integration
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:44.180]   like it just feels like it's you know getting maybe just a little too heavy and complicated
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:47.660]   and config and maybe a little too many settings I'm a little I'm a little worried about it
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:51.620]   I hope that I hope that gmail I mean I don't want this forced upon everyone because I don't
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:55.300]   want it I like having the choice of priority inbox but it also makes me concerned that you
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.780]   know so many people having such different gmail experiences because there's it's so it's so
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:06.140]   configurable I think that's I mean we just changed at work from exchange to gmail by default
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:10.580]   though not everyone switched over yet and there's there's a huge amount of sort of confusion
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:16.020]   by people because they've built a workflow that they understand and suddenly they've
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.940]   they're trying to reconstruct that workflow in gmail and decide your philosophy and so
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:23.420]   you know suddenly like I thought I did all those emails why are they still here it's like
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.940]   well you don't delete them in gmail you archive them it's it's and then you can search them
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:32.460]   again and don't worry about them you know and there's that there's that that sort of
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:37.820]   mental model of no no I want them gone that's quite changes when you get into gmail and
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:41.620]   that's you know and if you're used to exchange or used to oh no I'm always being nagged about
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:45.580]   my mail what's being full so you feel like if I would think you'd have a corporate policy
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:50.180]   that mail cannot be deleted anyway right I mean for legal reasons you have a corporate
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:54.260]   policy that mail has to be deleted has to be deleted okay yeah there's like a rolling
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.380]   deletion but there's yeah there's logging as well depending on what you're talking about
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:01.580]   sure I mean I've always admired about gmail that it's really required people to make mental
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:06.340]   leaps like conversations was a mental leap labels was a mental leap right archiving was
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.660]   a mental leap like you had to truly change the kind of the way that you think about email
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:18.180]   it's just that you know now I mean that was whatever 20,000 five originally was very good
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:22.260]   automatic spam filtering so the first thing that the value you got was there's no more
[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:26.420]   I don't spend half my day deleting rubbish and that's still true right and I think that's
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:31.220]   what this is doing yeah they're trying to say okay you've got a bunch of things and
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.660]   you don't have to read them all at the same time let's try and give you a bit of relief
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.140]   from that I suspect a lot of people will find that comforting but it's people like us who
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:43.060]   who've already like spent five years building mail filters to do that for us and have 35
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.380]   tabs down the left hand side for our things going like you just made some new tabs and
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:51.300]   things aware but I think that the ordinary users may find this easier I'm assuming they've
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.500]   done you know Google is fairly good at you testing this stuff I imagine you know they've
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:59.220]   they've actually sat down with people and watched the music and trying to understand them
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:04.620]   better now but it's yeah it is if email is a big part of your workflow it is very hard
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:08.820]   to have that transition force on you and it's and it's very hard to you know make or make
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.660]   the mental transition to maybe email it shouldn't be the center of my workflow maybe that should
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:16.860]   just be the archive the documents everything and I can use the other tools at feedstuff
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:21.020]   into email to be my workflow and that that's often a tricky thing to explain to people
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:25.860]   once they get it's like oh great and GMA is particularly good for that because GMAIL acts
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:30.700]   as a good archive so for me it's I'll have conversations in various places but I'll feed
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.820]   everything to Gmail into through a thought that goes archive first but then when I search
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:38.620]   I've got some more I can search for things yeah that is the biggest leap is not depending
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:42.380]   on email but just knowing that you have this archive and this living archive running all
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:48.620]   the time for sure finally Eric Schmidt doesn't use Gmail you know that what he's also uses
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:53.780]   a blackberry he would he would at this is at this dates back to Microsoft antitrust and
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:58.300]   the the reaction to that so he deletes everything because he doesn't want to be this to be subpoenaed
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:02.940]   later so he refuses to use Gmail only uses and doesn't mean his inbox so when he gets
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:07.300]   it in he's like I don't have that I can't recall and that's something about telling about
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:11.660]   that and you know there's bits of that in his new book is like oh we should be able to
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:17.020]   delete things so he's you know despite yeah he said there should be a right right to be
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:22.300]   forgotten this whole controversial nearly cruised of yeah thing he said no that's a good
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:30.020]   idea wait a minute oh now I'm confused I guess he doesn't really work there anymore so he
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:35.700]   could say whatever he wants finally yeah change to calendars yes we got to change the
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:40.300]   calendars I this is this is kind of nerdy I just I love this because I think about calendar
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:44.900]   UI maybe more than that and you need to but there's a good the Google Calendar app for
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:51.380]   Android has two new things a new date picker oh they need a new date picker desperately
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:57.260]   date pickers are the worst yes the hardest they're so fiddly those wheels rolling the
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:02.220]   wheels it's so annoying so it this is a really nice upgrade it's it's designed very
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:06.980]   nicely and it's visual so when you're choosing a date you get a scrolling calendar you can
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:11.300]   roll you know roll through and to and click on the date that you want when you choose a
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:15.620]   time you actually get a clock face like an old school clock with hands and you get to
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:20.700]   choose time on the clock now that's not going to work for anybody under 18 because they never
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:29.460]   learn how clock faces work and you can also set in the Google Calendar app for Android
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:36.300]   you can also set a sign colors oh yeah Chad is sorry Chad is choosing sorry to go back to
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:41.460]   the date pick again to to set an event to this is so much better yeah you can repeat
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:48.060]   every week look look you get Chad look look you get a calendar look look look you can choose
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:55.420]   a date from an actual calendar novel is that it's so much nicer looking and these these
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:42:00.540]   these Gobi OS widgets are they gmail no you have to download there's a generic Google
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:06.420]   calendar app which most my sense doesn't have you know this would be obviously lovely widgets
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:14.340]   for H the HTML5 date you I yeah that's for example they picker for you know core Android
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:19.940]   as well you can also assign colors to events on a per event basis so if you want to make
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.940]   an event tangerine or teal to make it stand out on your calendar you can do that there's
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:32.420]   a little oh yeah there's a there's a palette yeah yeah top right there yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:37.180]   yes say make me happy with the example screenshot there at same rissa Myers birthday that's so
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:43.980]   funny well you know that's so funny she wants everybody to know know want to miss that
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:53.980]   October 17 everybody does it really it does it says Marissa Myers birthday that's hysterical
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:43:00.380]   what color is it great green she should be blue that's hysterical that's Google operating
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:04.260]   system so it's not an official a Google blog but it's also it's them they're making fun
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:11.660]   okay yeah it's them it's not official oh it's not official that would be great it should
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:18.140]   be purple is what it should be yeah that would really be funny maybe you make it purple there
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:28.860]   you go yeah yeah that's all I got and that's the Google change song come on guys come on
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:40.180]   I just channeled job there oh come on fun stuff as always I like that change like I'm

[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.860]   still using that same LLC but sometimes as you're going through the questionnaire for
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:51.580]   instance I was trying to decide what state to create the LLC and I decided Delaware but

[00:45:52.100 --> 00:46:00.740]   week in Google HTC one will join the galaxy S4 Googleized at the place door the HTC one
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:07.620]   comes out June 26 was stock Android 4.2.2 599 instead of 649 that's what the galaxy
[00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:13.460]   is for price will be and I go back and forth and I really can't decide which I like better
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:18.300]   I have both I hope you decide this for me because I haven't bought it tough I want to
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:23.580]   get one of them neither is perfect battery life has been a problem on the one for me although
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:28.580]   I know I talked about this last week I found a XTA developers forum post that gave some
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:33.340]   really good tips I would recommend rooting it because and I did and one of the reasons
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:38.820]   is I was gonna get the next is very in a wide the rhythm so ha the problem with that is because
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.940]   I want an unlocked one that's the main reason yeah well you can unlock it easily in fact
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:47.820]   HTC on their dev site gives you a boot unloader a boot unlocker and then it's easy to root
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:54.820]   it unlocked that's another matter actually can you know I wouldn't unlock so that I can
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:59.740]   stick take it to the UK stick a st. AT&T unlocks it for anybody with a count good standing I
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:03.980]   think and also I'm on I'm on team over on a really system I've got so it's wrong I'm not
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.700]   going to find one without the thingy so the developer one seems like a good choice but
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:12.340]   but you're gonna miss out like on the camera which is one of the real reasons I like the
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:16.820]   HTC one you know it has a four megapixel camera but also it has some nice features in the camera
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:23.540]   app like the Zoe capability and the ability to make instant highlight films is kind of
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:29.820]   cool too that's in the gallery app and so that you won't get if you buy a Nexus so I don't
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:34.860]   know what the answer is to that one I'm not sure I can help you with that the galaxy
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:41.860]   has four I don't think I'd miss the Samsung crufts too much less so anyway but get the
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:47.780]   32 gigabyte do they offer will Google offer that I'll check yeah cuz the 16 there's nothing
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:53.460]   left I really okay yeah yeah they you know there's about eight gigs free and you can put
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:48:01.060]   an SD card in unlike the HTC one anyway I put they're starting to push out 422 ROMs
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:06.060]   in Europe internationally and I think that they will be coming to the US at 422 on here
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:09.620]   and they fixed some of the sense annoyances that people don't like there's a battery meter
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:15.860]   that shows your percent left now instead of having to adjust that they've got switches
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:22.060]   the 422 style toggle switches which I think you gotta have on a on an Android phone so
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:28.620]   it in many ways I think it is a better this is rooted but but and running a novel launcher
[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:33.660]   but still with HTC sense on it as a tough choice the Galaxy S4 has a lot to recommend
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:40.620]   it removal battery is an SD card that's that's big I think I never use a removal battery
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:44.180]   I've got that in this oh that's right you have a Nexus 4 right you don't care I've got
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:52.380]   the last Nexus Nexus Galaxy Nexus yeah I mean it's correct the issue with poor battery life
[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:57.220]   is that with you can it's ameliorated if you have more than one battery yeah on the one
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:01.660]   you know you gotta get to the right external battery so yeah I'm kind of used to that well
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:05.580]   that's what I'm saying yeah I carry around external batteries that's nice let me just
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:10.900]   I'll show you the highlight film I've showed these before this is this is my day today so
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:15.660]   far so does this all automatically I don't have to I don't have to do anything and I
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:22.980]   just tap it and then they have different choices of how to do it this is doing the French version
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:31.980]   so black and white sit and gives it a little kind of accordion music but then I can choose
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:36.460]   other ones they have they have more jazzy if you want something a little more jazzy remixes
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:46.820]   it with you this is all automatic I mean you won't get that in the generic one right well
[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:52.660]   I could write that but yes now I wonder if somebody HTC says they won't but if somebody
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:50:01.540]   at some point will extract the relevant right code and make it available should be do was
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:07.860]   like they did with the extracting them Facebook thingy so that I can run over here right I'm
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:17.900]   now having crows come out of my phone I don't know I must have accidentally recorded some
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:27.580]   of Kevin's audio what the hell is that that's excellent I actually need to do that because
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:32.580]   I've got a Twitter app that uses bird chirps to let me see if I was tweeting but I need
[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:37.500]   different sounds for at replies and direct messages I need some crowed noises for that
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:42.740]   I don't know what this is and that would be a good text message sound I'm gonna just
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:49.540]   reboot I can't I have no idea why my phone is making that sound I can't stop it now yeah
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:54.140]   I mean you kind of change my mind I don't know I still I like having the the kind of
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:58.740]   vanilla Android experience oh it's fine oh it's fine yeah that makes sense yeah that's
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:04.860]   why I was looping oh well one way to kill fine reboot your phone you know the good news
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:09.140]   is both the galaxy S4 and the HTC one are excellent they're neither perfect but both
[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:12.420]   are excellent and we're seeing and we're gonna see more we're not done yeah I can't wait
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:17.020]   to see this Motorola X phone this is this has the potential of really being something
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:22.260]   I think I think that's I mean that that is the transition that's fascinating is that
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:26.660]   Android is now the world's dominant operating system and that's that's a strange thing but
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:33.580]   it is true and that's that's the thing that is gonna drive a lot of thinking in in development
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:39.220]   over the next couple of years although a little depressing that according to the platform
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:46.460]   versions web page at Google 33% of Android users are using jelly bean 36% are still on
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:53.180]   gingerbread yeah that that is a significant difference but the but those numbers are moving
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:57.780]   in the right direction yeah yes yeah I mean that they're bigger they're bigger than ever
[00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:03.780]   yeah for oh and that's relevant to you as a developer I mean you have to pay attention
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:08.060]   to that because yeah absolutely and look at vine it just came out for Android it's for
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:14.100]   all and up yeah it has to be I think that's only fair I've actually tried Android vine
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:19.340]   yet you pouring yourself a cup of tea I'm putting some a cup of tea make a vine out
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:26.500]   of that that would be fabulous I have mixed feelings about this is much like when Instagram
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:32.500]   came to Android right and all the Instagram people said oh no oh the vine people are doing
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:35.620]   kind of the same thing the last thing about Instagram on the Android is that least you
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:39.660]   can see the photos if you try and write on an iPad you get like this little tiny thing
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:47.340]   in the middle looks like that right right so yeah I got you know 750 million dollars
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:51.140]   and they still can't make an iPad version of the app it's pretty weak there I don't buy
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:55.740]   into the fragmentation issues with Android but there it is fragment it is really all
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:53:01.220]   over the map it's fragmenting but the but the glau engine is better iOS is fragmented now
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:07.820]   iOS has six different screen sizes it has two you can't tell apart the tool because you
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:13.980]   can't tell the mini from the right to right and but they have you know when you download
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:19.300]   an iPhone app on an iPad it just feels wrong it feels like you're doing it wrong right
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:23.300]   because they they give you the doesn't scale what yeah giving the black borders of death
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:28.940]   or they give you the everything's in looking ugly but also it's the mental model of the
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:34.620]   two is very different so with with I with with iOS you've got a little tiny thing in your
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:39.220]   hand that you is really small when you operate with what with your thumb or you've got this
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:43.780]   gigantic thing that you sit down to use because it's too heavy to hold up for more than 15
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:49.300]   minutes and they've only just now come up with the intermediate this size one that is
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:56.540]   actually the good form factor and they haven't made that fluid yet so you're still running
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.340]   apps that were designed for something that's twice the size and the buttons are a little
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:05.420]   bit small on that or you're running the iPhone ones and the buttons are too big it hasn't
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:09.260]   they haven't got the fluidity whereas Android because they were all multiple different sizes
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:13.340]   to begin with the app developers had to deal with it and and the layout engine was designed
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:16.460]   to deal with it whereas iOS everyone said oh there's only one size there was only two
[00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:21.300]   sizes and now there's you know six sizes and and that and 12 if you count them rotated
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.780]   to portray a landscape and the app developers you know banging their heads against the wall
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:30.620]   and the tooling isn't there but also there's this more pernicious thing was the design
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:36.700]   sense that you build a mobile version it has to affect the web as well you build a mobile
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:40.460]   version of the app or you build a desktop version of the app and the iPad gets a desktop
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:45.500]   version and the phone gets the mobile version which makes sense on iOS didn't make sense
[00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:51.460]   on Android and we had to suffer for a long time with you know using a decent size Android
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:54.620]   but you go to the Guardian and you get this like narrow column of type in the middle because
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:58.140]   they assume if you're on a mobile you must be on an iPhone and therefore you can't read
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:03.220]   it you know more than eight words a line of things so there's been this sort of weird
[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:10.580]   dichotomy that is because everyone who does design uses Apple stuff their world view of
[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:14.260]   mobile was through that filter of that they're a little tiny things they're gigantic great
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:19.300]   big things and nothing in between and it's it's taking a long time for the actual reality
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:24.260]   of Android to work its way through to the you know the design community and the way they
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:27.380]   use and that's that's happening now we're starting to see it now but with there's still
[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:33.500]   this sort of weirdness of the presumption is you've either got something really really
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:38.540]   small or something you know that's that that's got a really big screen and not this fluidity
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:44.140]   between two and really the way it's becoming in the in the Android world is there's every
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:50.220]   half inch there's there's this device that yeah you know but also that for the G4 mini
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:54.260]   to you know all the way up to tablets but the thing is you know if you've got something
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:59.660]   this big the difference between holding it here and holding it here is quite significant
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:03.780]   into in design terms in visual design terms closer versus far and that depends a lot on
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:07.500]   whether you know on what your eyesight's like if you've got Presbyterian you cannot focus
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:13.460]   closer than here right and you have to hold it that far away so using an iPhone 5 if you've
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:18.500]   got if your near point is is you know the length of your arm is actually quite hard whereas
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:21.980]   with Android you've been able to buy something with a bigger screen and hold further away
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:25.740]   so they've missed a big chunk of affordance there for a lot of people I'm very interested
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:29.620]   what Apple's going to try to do with that well we'll find out presumably next I'm assuming
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:34.180]   next week that we'll get some you know they're not stupid they'll be working on this they'll
[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:38.060]   be thinking about this they'll have some new way of doing layouts and apps but it's definitely
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:44.340]   needed because certainly on the web this you know we've got responsive design methodologies
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:48.620]   that work for this now on Android we've had the app layout stuff and you know the ability
[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:53.140]   to add extra layouts so that you can do tablet-y things if you've got a tablet but at least
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:59.260]   the thing will scale up but at iOS it has been fixed layouts for each type and that and
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:04.580]   that's the develop and what a lot of developers have done have written their own layout code
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:09.580]   rather than using the build-in interface builder springy things because getting them to behave
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:11.780]   well was quite hard.
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:14.060]   That's always bad.
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:20.100]   By the way Sundar Pachai when he did announce the HTC One Nexus version at all things he
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:25.460]   also said but we're still going to make hardware so and I presume that's under the Motorola
[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:30.180]   brand and everybody does seem to agree that there is a Motorola X I think Motorola said
[00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:32.420]   there is one right.
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:39.820]   One came out as we mentioned for Android and that means now there are 13 million vine
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:42.980]   users on the two platforms.
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:46.860]   This is very similar to what happened with Instagram where they built it and built it
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:52.220]   and built it on iOS and then as soon as it got you know as big as it could get then they
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:56.060]   released an Android version and then it took it to the next level.
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:58:04.380]   Where has become the booster rocket?
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:07.820]   A million new users in 12 hours.
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:12.180]   Imagine vine we'll get the numbers you know this is only a few days ago but I imagine
[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:13.340]   vine had something similar.
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:14.460]   I know I downloaded it.
[00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:15.540]   Did you install it immediately?
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:16.540]   You did right.
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:17.860]   I did I did install it.
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:22.060]   Oh I have to say I lost a little bit of my you know when it first got released there was
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:23.060]   a novelty to it.
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:24.220]   I was seeing other people's vines.
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:27.860]   I was really kind of jazzed and excited and bummed that I didn't have it on Android.
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:32.220]   And now it's been so long and I was kind of like oh yeah this whatever.
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:33.380]   We are fickle aren't we?
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:34.380]   We are so fickle.
[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:42.180]   OMG Pop came out with draw something too and then Zinga by the way Zinga closed the office.
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:43.180]   They're done.
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:49.340]   They had 180 million dollars a year ago for draw something and OMG Pop out of business.
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:50.340]   Unbelievable.
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:53.320]   It's weird because they're saying they're focusing on mobile and that was what was that
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:54.320]   that was supposed to do for this.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.320]   It's a mobile hit.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:59.960]   Very strange.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:01.440]   Very very strange.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:06.580]   iOS will be getting Google Play music and all access streaming soon next couple of months
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:08.220]   or next few weeks I should say.
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:09.220]   That's interesting.
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:12.060]   It is interesting.
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:13.860]   There was no Google music.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:16.820]   No longer blocking them from doing that kind of thing is encouraging.
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:17.820]   That's good use.
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.120]   Yeah this is the kind of thing.
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:26.980]   I'm wondering I think that Apple probably would like to but you know they've been slapped
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:27.980]   around.
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.860]   What was it they blocked?
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:31.860]   It was latitude originally.
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:32.860]   Latitude.
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:33.860]   FDC judgment.
[00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:34.860]   Right.
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:35.860]   And possibly voice as well.
[00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:36.860]   Right.
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:37.860]   And what you.
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:38.860]   You get it now.
[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:40.460]   There's a third party client G music.
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:41.460]   Yeah it's okay.
[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:42.700]   It doesn't work very well.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:43.700]   It's not great.
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:46.900]   I want Google's I want I want Google music.
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:52.120]   Google now has a fairly solid iOS team who I'm sure delivers something nice.
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.120]   So that's good.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:58.320]   Yeah the iOS apps are the best apps on the market for both iOS and in some cases much
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.440]   better than the Android versions of the same apps.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:05.400]   They obviously like their iPhones.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:11.120]   Google put the kibosh you nailed it so to speak Gina.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:17.760]   The first person point of view sex sites shortly after Gina announced that this would
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.240]   happen.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.240]   My candy.
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.920]   I read a story from.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.880]   She wasn't shipping an app.
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:30.360]   I wasn't participating in any of this.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:36.160]   My candy created a mobile app store for adult content on Monday in which they encouraged
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.160]   people to upload.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.320]   I saw few people have glass.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:42.760]   I don't know if this is really going to work to upload their first person sex videos and
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:50.480]   pictures while wearing glass and Google wasted no time in banning it.
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:56.720]   They announced they announced that glasses terms of service do not allow a rautica.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.440]   No sexually explicit content.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:03.680]   Although any device that connects to the Internet and also it does live streaming and
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.280]   takes photos and video like there's plenty of sexually explicit content.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.280]   It's being communicated over glass.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.840]   They're just saying no to apps which are geared toward that.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.040]   But many have to enable that.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.040]   Right.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:22.440]   And violence bullying hate speech deceptive behavior gambling and outright illegal activities.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.440]   All in.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:30.920]   And they said we will never do facial or I'm sorry until protections are in place.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.440]   We will not do facial recognition or anything.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.400]   We're not doing facial.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.520]   But this is this is I don't understand this.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.120]   Facebook does face recognition.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.000]   The cars are just face recognition.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.520]   Google plus does face recognition.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.760]   The camera apps on our Android to face recognition.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.800]   That's how they can decide whether you're smiling or not.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.800]   Right.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.920]   Vic just gave us an hour on how wonderful it was last week before last.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.920]   So to say oh we're not doing a face recognition it's got to be a snow job in some sense.
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.400]   And I really don't get this.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.920]   So what have they actually banned?
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.320]   And you can't write a face recognition app with what they've released at the moment because
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.400]   you have to send things offline anyway.
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:11.320]   So they can't police what you've done once I send a photograph off to something else.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.640]   Facebook will just do it for me.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.640]   That's a very good point.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:19.600]   I think that they just are they want to dodge the bullet.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.240]   At least for as long as they can.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.360]   Well back in 2010 when they first did goggles.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.600]   Same thing they said we'll won't do face recognition.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.240]   So Tim O'Reilly got a version that had face recognition built in.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.680]   He was running an alpha of it for them and talked about this and then they that disappeared
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.680]   after he mentioned it.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.720]   I think they're terrified of.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:41.800]   And it's you know I remember Eric explicitly saying that crosses the creepy line but if
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.840]   that that is the useful that is a useful thing.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.960]   Maybe you and I are just the most forgetful people in the world but that's to me that's
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.560]   the number one reason I want class.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.560]   We're old.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.560]   That's Kevin Marks.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.560]   Ah thank you.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.920]   Ah hey Kevin how are you?
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:00.080]   This is why people wear name tags or conferences like oh that's great.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:06.120]   Well Scoble wrote an article saying it doesn't matter because the issue isn't so much the
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.120]   recognition.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:11.520]   The issue is you know I'll figure out who it is whether it's from a name tag or some
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:15.040]   other way the real thing is looking that person up and getting the facts about that
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.280]   person.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:19.640]   So be nice I would think it'd be nice to eliminate that initial step of how do I get
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:20.800]   that person's name.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.640]   But I can understand why from a privacy point of view they're worried about and I Gina
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.640]   you should speak.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.640]   What do you guys do?
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:31.640]   I'm not sure if you're a person.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.560]   But the so you know it's facial recognition it needs a pool of faces to look at.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:37.040]   So the way the facial recognition works well at the moment is is explicitly with Picasso
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:40.520]   and with Facebook which is like this is that person you already know.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.560]   Picasso works well because you take lots of photographs of the same person and it will
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.080]   go oh that's Kevin okay those are all Kevin.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.080]   Right.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.480]   And you go yeah they're mostly me except that was Andrew and we look too similar.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.680]   It still does that.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.560]   That one is donkey and I don't know why it's in the list.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.560]   Okay.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:01.080]   I got from G plus last week where it was saying this is you it's like no that's my son but
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.080]   well done.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.080]   That's good yeah.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.080]   Oh that's good.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:09.720]   Is the issue a liability thing like I remember when Twitter launched location attached to
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:13.120]   tweets I went I was at the chirp conference I feel like this back in like 2010 Ryan's
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:17.600]   I Ryan's on stage and he said that they basically they would fuzz the location after
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.440]   a certain amount of time they stopped doing that at some point.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:25.320]   But the issue was like if Twitter knows that someone is in a particular place at a certain
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:29.440]   time that they could potentially get subpoenaed or get a warrant for that.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.440]   So like so if you know so if I'm out and about in public and I'm not I'm not broadcasting
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:39.080]   that information but someone else has glass and recognizes me now Google has knowledge
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:44.440]   that I'm in a location right without me sharing that knowledge right it's like me as someone
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:45.440]   else.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.880]   I mean I guess that works with you know.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.880]   You're a public.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.880]   Right.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:49.880]   That's how.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.480]   But but maybe we're in private maybe I'm in a bathroom maybe we're in that would be
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.480]   issue right.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:59.200]   So that's already a problem here that that's how Paris Hilton and Goka you know make their
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:01.800]   living is by people taking photographs of famous people in public.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:07.240]   Dr. Mom in our chat room says well it raises issues what if you walk into a doctor's office.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:12.000]   Well right we're a therapist waiting room or I mean the glasses not are not just in public
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   places right.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.720]   I mean we're in sort of semi private or places where there's some sort of expectation of
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:21.320]   privacy like bathrooms or a doctor's waiting room or a few right now if you walk down the
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:26.480]   street there's no legal prohibition in place for me saying oh there's Gina I just saw
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:33.280]   Gina she's right outside that I mean they can't stop that it's not illegal and they're
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:37.160]   and I don't maybe now I have assumed you raise an interest in question because maybe
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.920]   there is an assumption of liability for me tweeting that and if something bad happens
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:45.400]   to you am I liable and maybe that's what Google wants to avoid I think you you might
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.400]   have.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.920]   I wonder if that's if that's part of it you know.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:53.960]   I mean when you know they're tracking down criminals they get out the easy path information
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:57.440]   credit card information public surveillance cameras information but if those Google knows
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:01.240]   that someone was in a certain place or like that had facial recognition in a certain place
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:02.680]   you know is that information.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.600]   Somebody on Twitter.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:08.800]   Well Bruce and I just wrote a good article on this and what the FBI is asking for it and
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:09.800]   if you saw that.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.640]   I love Bruce and I are whatever he says I agree with.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:16.760]   But he was he was he was saying the FBI are trying very hard to put in back doors into
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:21.360]   everything so that they can potentially run you know audio recognition image recognition
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.200]   text recognition over all the time.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.760]   Which is you know it's it's it's it's clipper all over again.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:31.400]   If you're you're old enough to remember what that is now it's a card I use on the train
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:36.760]   but in the in the 90s that was what got the EFF and the first place and that you know
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:41.040]   the notion is back that all the internet is taking away our ability to intercept things
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:46.280]   therefore we need to build in back doors and the answer is no you don't you need to we
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:51.120]   need to have some friction that stops you getting back doors but guess what if you get
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.880]   a subpoena you can probably get access to a lot of the stuff we have and then run facial
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.800]   recognition over it but you need that ability to get a warrant you don't we don't want to
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:03.280]   feed everything that anyone ever does into a giant database the NSA that that can then
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.280]   be compromised.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:10.000]   Well and that's the issue that Bruce raises is that any any compromised security system
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.480]   is vulnerable.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.480]   Yes.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:16.840]   Just because you know the FBI can't have it both ways you can't open it up to them and
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.520]   then say but it's secure for everything else.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.520]   Right.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:21.600]   He's writing it enough.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.320]   It's on his blog but he wrote it originally for the foreign policy magazine.
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.320]   For policy.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:29.880]   When it comes to for glass though I mean I think when it comes down to it is glass
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.240]   is a serious PR problem.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.240]   Right.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.240]   People think it's creepy people misunderstand how it works.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:36.240]   Thanks to rubber scovel.
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.240]   Right.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.240]   The whole partially means to the hopper scovel.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:45.240]   The cookies question.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:49.360]   Larry Page really wanted to blame him you could tell.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:54.240]   You know was the first to say like look like I you know they're not on all the time.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:57.840]   He's been trying to sort of debunk all the myths although yeah that shower photo didn't
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:58.840]   help.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:03.840]   This is Google banning sexual explicit content and saying that they're not running on facial
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.840]   recognition and even really not wanting to talk about the wink gesture.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:10.040]   They're trying to shield themselves from any you know saying you don't wear it while
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:13.600]   you're driving like the laws don't exist yet so just don't do it and you know until
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:17.600]   the laws catch up they're just being extremely protective and they don't want to they don't
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:22.280]   want glass to take any more things that's already taken in the in the creepy zone.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:27.480]   Yeah and I think they're probably right to be prudent although I would love to see them
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.480]   loaded up.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.480]   Let's let's get it all.
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.480]   Turn off facial recognition.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.280]   I would love that.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:35.480]   Yeah just just turn on just do the whole thing.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:40.760]   And finally you know this is we live in a real world where you have to compromise and
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:43.400]   there's and there's you know it's politics.
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.800]   That's what weight is weight is.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.040]   Hey let's take a break and come back.

[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:22.000]   I got 99designs and a T-shirt ain't one.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.800]   The T-shirt one.
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.080]   Jada Trapani, you got a tool for us?
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.080]   I got a tip.
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.320]   A tip brother, yes.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.520]   I've been suffering from a little bit of Twitter overload.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:39.040]   I'm following almost a thousand people.
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.440]   And I know I know I still have that complete thing.
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:46.000]   I don't try to read all my tweets but I find that I just sort of look at my all the tweets
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.160]   flying by and I go slack jawed and I don't get work done.
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:55.320]   But luckily Twitter just announced that they're expanding their list support.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:03.080]   It used to be limited to I think only 20 people per list and only have 500 lists per person.
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.520]   They've expanded that now.
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:09.960]   You can make up to a thousand lists and you can have up to 5,000 users on each list.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:16.040]   So lists are a really good way to keep to dip into a stream of people tweeting about
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.680]   a certain topic or related in a certain way without necessarily following them and have
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.920]   them clutter up your home timeline all the time.
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:27.720]   So I know lists is kind of an underrated feature that people don't really talk about very much
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.120]   but I really like lists.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.120]   I have several private lists.
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:35.040]   I have a couple of public lists and I think I'm going to break out some of my friends into
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.720]   lists or the people I don't really maybe know personally are just kind of want to dip into
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:40.720]   a list separately.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:41.720]   I think I'm going to do that.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:47.240]   So go ahead and go crazy, make some lists, print your follower list if you want like
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:49.240]   I am and you'll be able to do that now.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.960]   Yeah I think lists are really of a greater benefit to other people than they are to you.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.480]   You're giving a contribution.
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:59.920]   For instance if I want to get tech news instead of looking at my stream I'll go to Robert
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:00.920]   Scoble.
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:03.120]   He has a list of tech great big thinkers.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.440]   He has startup a bunch of lists.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.440]   He really made a lot of lists.
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:09.560]   And just click that button and now you're only seeing the people in that list and it's
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:13.440]   a great way to really customize Twitter as you said temporarily.
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:17.520]   So make lists because it's useful to your friends and family and followers.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:21.040]   Yeah I think the public is based right because if you have groups of people like we can make
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:27.080]   Googlers lists or yeah we can make hosting guest lists but yeah lists are really great.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.720]   It's true because there's a public signal public way of kind of categorizing other people
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.600]   but then it also helps people kind of check out who you're curation.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:36.840]   You're doing some really valuable curation for everybody else.
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:40.280]   You're envisioning for yourself.
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:43.280]   Mr. Kevin Marks our number of the week.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:49.840]   My number of the week is 62% which is the percentage of patent cases that were patent
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.640]   trolls in 2012.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:52.640]   What?
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.640]   62%?
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.640]   62%.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:01.480]   Now this is tied into this week's fascinating patent news.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:04.680]   So there's been a bunch of patent stuff going on this week.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:09.160]   There were both planet money in this American life.
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.960]   Did patent shows this weekend?
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:15.200]   They've done a great one of patent trolls a couple of years ago.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.200]   It was just one.
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.200]   Yeah so this American life was a follow up to that.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.880]   They did a follow up to that and they talked more about the case and about intellectual
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:26.400]   features and then because the case had actually settled and someone had defeated the patent.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.760]   And therefore not signed an NDA.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:30.640]   They would have disclosed the details of the thing they talked to the first one.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.280]   So the planet money won.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:35.600]   The American life one if you haven't heard that before let's do that again.
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.960]   But the planet money won was particularly fascinating people listening to watching this
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:44.560]   which is about the podcast patent which Leo tweeted out about the EFF helping to try and
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:47.920]   take this down last week and people don't have money into it and they've now got money
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:48.920]   and they're gathering.
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:49.920]   Huge amount of money.
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.400]   I'm so glad they did that.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:57.600]   Julie said they had 65,000 this morning they didn't hang out about this which is good.
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:05.280]   This Julie Samus who is the Mark Cuban chair for ending stupid patents.
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.680]   Thank you Mark Cuban for endowing that chair.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.880]   $67,000 donated from $1,165.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:12.280]   They were looking for $30,000.
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:15.080]   They made their goal in 10 hours.
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:20.040]   By the way when I saw it and it was just a few hours in I immediately gave them $2,500
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:24.440]   because this is going to this potentially could save us a lot of money in litigation.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.920]   But if you haven't missed the planet money one you should listen to that because they
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:32.640]   actually found the guys who filed the patent and interviewed them and talked through what
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.800]   they were doing and it was.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.360]   Were they justified in their mind?
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:42.480]   In their mind they were but the weird part so the thing is that the test for a patent
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:46.480]   is this obvious to someone who understands the field and what was completely clear with
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:48.840]   this interview was they didn't understand the field at all.
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:52.880]   They were making cassette tapes that they were mailing out to people that were recordings
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:57.100]   of things and they thought we should do this on a computer somehow and they wrote this
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:02.280]   like rambling spec that doesn't make any sense and then turned it into a patent rather
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:10.080]   than a product and then didn't touch the idea of remote audio for 15 years and then
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.240]   said we have a patent on this let's go and take everyone down.
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:18.520]   The patent is laughably defeatable I think.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:23.680]   So what EFF has decided to do at least with this particular podcast patent there's a number
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:28.920]   ways you can defend it of course you can go to court and that's a little risky and very
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:35.240]   expensive millions of dollars or you can do something called an inter partase appeal
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:39.440]   where you go to the patent office and you say hey look here's all this prior art or here's
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:47.320]   why it's obvious or trivial and then the patent office will reexamine and if you're proven
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:52.120]   to be accurate in your assessment we'll throw out the patent and that throws out all of
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.320]   the cases immediately.
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:17:00.560]   So if you go to EFF.org and look at this they have a link to the stack exchange ask
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:04.120]   patents where they're showing you what the patent in this particular patent we were talking
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.120]   about.
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:11.280]   And the particular claim that they're trying to claim 31 which is the key claim.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:17.160]   It is basically you know go for invalidate sit FTP invalidate it's you know there is
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:20.320]   a list of things on the internet and you can download some of them with a list may change
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:21.320]   over time.
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:25.920]   So this is kind of neat because they've got 65 people and I would encourage you if you
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:30.200]   have expertise in this area you know have some history it needs to be something that
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.400]   was done before 1996.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:39.280]   1996 add to the comments here and people lots of people showed up with prior art.
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:45.480]   So now it's up to EFF to spend that $65,000 to organize a challenge and bring it to the
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.120]   USPTO.
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:55.680]   The other part of this that is also fascinating is that the cultural storytelling is really
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.680]   important.
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:00.200]   This is why Planet Mollie and it's not really a life valuable.
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:06.760]   Because we've had this classic patent narrative for you know 100 years which is there's a
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:11.720]   loan inventor in his share who comes up with this brilliant idea and needs protection from
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:14.520]   malicious corporations who would steal it from it.
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:18.840]   And this is you know that that is the cultural narrative of invention that's what the patent
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:23.320]   system is designed to defend and we have movies and all kinds of things that show that world
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.320]   view.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:30.920]   And that stopped being true sort of 40 years ago because and it became massively obviously
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:34.560]   untrue in the last 10 years because if you invent something now what you do is you build
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.760]   it and you take it out there and show it to people and the corporations don't have the
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:42.360]   ability to stop you from showing to people anymore because we have the internet.
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:47.400]   But also you can share the primary purpose of the patent office was to get people to
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:50.960]   disclose inventions rather than keeping them secret so that other people could build on
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:52.600]   them.
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.680]   And no longer serves that primary purpose.
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.240]   So what about what the White House?
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:00.040]   So what about in software we think of looking in the patent database for an algorithm because
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:07.080]   we have a Google, we have Stack Exchange, we have the universe of the internet which was
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:13.600]   built for information sharing by physicists to share their data and is now used to share
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.000]   how we do things.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.400]   We've built the culture of open standards which the web is built on where you explicitly
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:23.880]   have to say there is no patent on this or you get thrown out of the W3C or you have to
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:27.320]   say I will license this reasonably we get thrown out of the ITF.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:31.800]   And we have the open source world where you're explicitly saying I am giving this code and
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.520]   you can reuse it.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:39.760]   So we've now built this disclosure model where every voluntary disclosure model that actually
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:43.440]   builds the infrastructure that everything that we use runs on.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:48.440]   And with Android being the dominant operating system that now means that we have a dominant
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.520]   operating system that is built on this culture.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.480]   Chrome is a dominant browser and the second place one is Firefox.
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.880]   So we have a plurality there.
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:03.240]   And the other one that's ranking there's IE which is still closed and then there's Safari
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:06.880]   which is bottom up which is all open source.
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:11.760]   We now have the proprietary one pleading with people to make sure they support the standards
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.040]   so that they work too.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:18.840]   So we've won in the web world completely and the computer world and all the stuff we use
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:26.040]   and talk about on this show is built on this shared culture of disclosure and competing
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:32.640]   with each other on what you're building not on how you build it or what your infrastructure
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.640]   is.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:38.720]   And the patent office is stuck in the 18th century, 19th century with this presumption
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:41.720]   that you've protected the government office and file it and that gives you a monopoly
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.120]   and that's the value.
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:47.800]   And so what's happened is the people who are doing this patent trolling tended to the
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.720]   people who weren't very good inventors.
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:53.480]   They didn't make something very smart or they didn't tap into this culture and instead
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:58.160]   they wrote down a patent and filed it and then didn't make a company and dissipate off
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.800]   and did something else.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:05.320]   So both the examples in the Planet Money Show and in the This American Life Show are inventors
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.880]   who fit that model.
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:10.800]   They came up with an idea, it wasn't particularly well thought through, they clearly didn't
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:15.280]   investigate what else was going on but they wrote a patent up.
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:21.040]   And then, you know, 15, 18 years later, they start, no, somebody else encouraged them to
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:26.680]   start a lawsuit because someone has had a similar idea and they think that their particular
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:31.880]   bad implementation of something is the same thing, which clearly isn't.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:38.400]   So that's, and the problem is that that previous cultural narrative of the lone inventor who's
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:44.640]   idea was stolen is still there but we now have a nice counter narrative of the rapacious
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:51.120]   patent troll who is now trying to steal innovation and take it over.
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:55.520]   And the irony is that that metaphor was invented by one of the guys who's now a VP at intellectual
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:56.520]   ventures.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:57.520]   That's in the American Life.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.520]   I'll have to listen.
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:04.440]   But the one that got me was the White House doing a, yeah, Jean's first time having an
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.720]   animated gift of a giant troll attacking people.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:11.000]   The White House has really taken this on and actually give a little credit to a lady
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.800]   Ada, Lee Moore Fried of Ada Fruit Industries because in a hangout with the president a
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:19.600]   few months ago, she asked him about this.
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:20.600]   Yes.
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.600]   And he talked a little bit about it.
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:29.040]   It was February and now just a couple of days ago, the White House issued, well, posted
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:34.760]   this article on WhiteHouse.gov released a study that documents the toll that patent trolls
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:37.840]   take on innovation, some executive actions.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.000]   I don't know how effective they are.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.080]   I'm not an expert on this stuff.
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:46.120]   And they're asking Congress to take some legislative action as well to protect innovation.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:49.360]   I think it's really good, at least the leadership coming out of the White House.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.560]   But I hope it's more than just words that it can make a difference in all this because
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:23:01.640]   according to this post by Gene Spierling on the WhiteHouse.gov site, $62 billion that would
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:07.240]   have otherwise been invested, I'm sorry, $29 billion that would have otherwise been invested
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.600]   in innovation was paid to patent trolls in 2011.
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:14.000]   And that's a 400% increase from 2005.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.880]   So that's a big cost.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:18.640]   And look at the number of patent troll cases.
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:19.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:21.080]   You know, the patent trolls will dispute it.
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.080]   They'll say, we're not trolls.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.080]   What are you talking about?
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.800]   We're just defending a little guy.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:29.560]   Now this is partly an effect of the American Events Act, which made it harder to do a giant
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:30.920]   class action.
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:35.520]   So you used to be able to say, I'm going to do a suit against everyone who infringes
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:36.520]   this patent.
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:37.520]   Now you get to see one by one.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:38.720]   So that's creating more cases.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:41.280]   And that's revealing this.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:43.080]   And it's starting to come up the court system.
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:46.560]   And so the judges are now getting crossed with these, it's a abusive process, which is
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:47.560]   good.
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:48.560]   And it's visible.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:51.320]   Well, let's hope, let's hope.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:56.920]   Because it does clearly take its toll on startups, on innovation, and invention.
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:57.920]   So much is done.
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:01.480]   I was talking to the SwiftKey guy yesterday.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:06.920]   And Samsung uses a SwiftKey keyboard on their Samsungs, but it doesn't have all the features
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:10.560]   of the downloadable SwiftKey because Samsung's afraid of getting sued.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.480]   And you see this over and over again.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:19.160]   And our companies just don't do the best they can because they're so afraid of these suits.
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:20.160]   That's a bummer.
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.160]   Isn't that sad?
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.160]   That's thanks.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.160]   Thank you, Kevin Marks.
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.160]   You're the greatest.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.160]   I really appreciate you being here.
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:33.360]   Jeff Jarvis will be back, I think, next week.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.560]   And if not, will you come back?
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.560]   I'll come back.
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:37.560]   It's great.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:38.560]   Love having you on.
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:39.560]   Thanks.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:43.080]   Yeah, with you and your crows, your black crows, bring them back.
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:47.680]   Thanks also to Gina Trapani, who was, of course, a regular on the show at smartawear.org.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.880]   That's her blog.
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:49.880]   Think up.com.
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:51.800]   That's her software.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.560]   To do text.com.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:54.720]   That's her other software.
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:55.720]   New update this week.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:57.720]   Go get Android at Play Store.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:24:59.720]   You widget.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.720]   Yeah.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:01.720]   All download.
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:02.720]   Excellent.
