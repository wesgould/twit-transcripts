[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   It's time for "Dwig" this week in Google.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Jeff Jarvis, Leo Leport, Gina Trapani, Jeff and I will fight over the Google Pixel.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   We'll talk about Babbled, the new chat service from Google, and Facebook Home.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   What we think of that new service from Facebook and why Google should really pay attention.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Netcast, you love.

[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   The show that covers Google the cloud, Google verse.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Gina Trapani is here from smarterware.org, the author of Think Up.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Great to have you Gina.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   She's an Android developer in the host of Wall About Android.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Great to be here.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Yay!
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Favorite show of the week.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Well, maybe I can't say it anymore.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   No, you better not.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   She's a really favorite show of the week.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Jason Howl's sitting right over there.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   He's wearing headphones but he's listening.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Also here, Jeff Jarvis, who's home after his travels around the world.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Oh, home in New York, yes.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Yes, home in New York.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   He is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   He's also the author of Public Parts and Other Books.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   He joins us every week.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   His blog is Buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Hello.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So I set the Pixel back.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I canceled my Pixel order.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And Jeff says, "I'm wrong, wrong, wrong."
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Well, I have a video showing how the Verge pops up on my Pixel.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And scrolls quite responsibly.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And scrolls just dandy.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I'm just enjoying YouTube.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I'm just going to enjoy this going back and forth.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   If there were more Pixel's, I could go see if there's a tiebreaker.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   But the next time I see somebody with a Pixel.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Well, it's actually a boy.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Look at that.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   There it goes.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Big phone.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   You're moving, I might say.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You moved very gently into that.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Oh, geez.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   You must have been a real pain in the ass on a playground argument.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   My only point is that, and I don't care how the Verge scrolls,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   my only point was that for that price--
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   For the week.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   No, no.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   For that, well, I was using as an example.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   For that price, it should be a much faster, more responsive computer.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   It is not particularly responsive.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   It's very fast, very fast.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And it works just dandy for me.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   After using it for a couple of days, I felt like, God, this is frustrating
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   because it's just kind of not responsive.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   It feels a little jerky, a little--
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Like, you got the wrong machine.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   That's what I'm telling you.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Last week, your entire complaint was the Verge went up slowly, and it did on the video.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And so I was--
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   You can't do it because you're in Skype.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I can't do it.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Right?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   So I got home.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I said, I'm going to record this for you.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I can sit down.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I go to the Word button.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I can't have it full screen, so you weren't really testing it.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Oh, she--
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Well, no, that's germane because what you want to do is fill the screen-- fill the pixels.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   The point is that my point was that the graphics card in that is insufficient
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   for the number of pixels on the screen, which is true.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   But if you're not going to see that, if you have a window, you have to go full screen on the Verge.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I don't want to be-- I don't want to be your roommate in the old folks' home.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   No, I'm--
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I might suggest-- I think we should just have a pixel throw down at Google I/O.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   We'll get those-- those kind of wrestler bouncy suits, you know?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And you guys can just kind of go at it in the middle of Moscone.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Well, I stand by-- I stand by review.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   It was not a broken pixel.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   It's a lot of pixels to push.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   It's not at all surprising with Intel motherboard HD 4000 graphics that that is too many pixels to push.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   You won't know until you put a very demanding full screen web page on there.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   But you will see it in day-to-day operations because it's a very high-res screen.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Now, that's the advantage of this.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I don't-- I've been using it for three weeks now, and I'm telling you, I don't.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   You're a perfect person to own the pixel then because you don't notice the difference.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:26.800]   [
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.800]   What do you think we can explore is why this is so polarizing?
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.800]   Well, I'll tell you why you guys have Stockholm syndrome.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.800]   You wasted your money on that, and now you have to justify why it's a good purchase.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.800]   No, I haven't received it yet. I'm still using the loaner machine.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.800]   It's not too late to cancel.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   Wait a minute, actually it is.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.800]   It's not too late.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.800]   It's not-- no, well, I was thrilled when I canceled it, like, was able to do so.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.800]   Look, there are some real advantages.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   I won't deny it to Chrome OS.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.800]   I don't know if you're going to have to go to the store.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.800]   If you're content to just run a browser and to do your email in the browser and everything
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   in the browser, it's fine.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800]   That's what I do.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.800]   But--
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   You know, it was a good thing to do.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.800]   It's an awful lot of money to pay for such a constrained machine when you could pay less for a full machine.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.800]   I can't-- fully.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.800]   See, that's the thing.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.800]   That's what Vance was saying, that there's this belief that the machine is the way they were
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   or is the machine is the way they should be, and that there's this belief that it's somehow limited.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.800]   I'm on the web, the web works fine, you know, and I was thinking today.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   Well, Jeff, I have to point out that you did install Linux on that and you had to to run
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   something that you're using right now.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   Or you only because of Microsoft, that's the only reason.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   And if you guys would get your act together and get WebRTC or Google Hangout, it would be fine,
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   which everybody says, "Why the heck is this show on Google Hangout?"
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.800]   Because it looks terrible.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   Just say it.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.800]   Because it looks terrible.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.800]   We could use Google Hangout, but it looks terrible.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.800]   And it sounds worse.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.800]   I should not really.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   So some people don't-- so my point is, some people-- it's like-- it's like--
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   it's like you telling me, "I love Chef Boyardee."
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.800]   That's fine.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.800]   Each Chef Boyardee, I'm not saying you shouldn't, but it isn't necessarily great food.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.800]   Yeah, well, I like Armani's suits, but I can tell you don't.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.800]   No, I don't.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   Based on what you're wearing today.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   In fact, Lisa's going to kill me because it's a Tennessee Titans shirt.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   Here's the other thing, Leo.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   I was thinking today, I cannot remember the last time that I thought, "Hmmm, I've got to go buy myself some software."
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.800]   I don't buy software.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   The only reason to own a full OS is to install software on it.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   I don't do that.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   I haven't done that in years.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   That's not true.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   For instance, I use the command line all the time on OS X.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   That doesn't mean I have to buy or install software, but I like to have the command line available to it.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   There's things that come on OS X for instance that I didn't buy, but that I use.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   Go ahead and try to edit a movie on your pixel.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.800]   I've got eye movie on my Macintosh.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   It was free.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   It does a very credible job.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.800]   Go ahead and try to do decent photo editing.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.800]   Anything more than red eye removal on your pixel.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.800]   You can't.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   So...
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   There's things on there.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   No, for photo editing...
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   Video, video, video, video, I will concede.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.800]   Video, audio, and serious photo editing, legroom style photo editing are not possible.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   But that's something a lot of people do.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.800]   It's not a weird thing that people do.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:20.800]   No, I'm not trying to say that everybody should buy the pixel, but I also was trying to say that you're wrong in trying to say that this isn't a machine.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.800]   This is the show about the cloud.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:29.800]   The point of my doing this for the sake of the show I might have was to live in the cloud, to really do it.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   LaVita Google.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.800]   Yeah, but you admit it's an experiment.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   It's not...
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.800]   No, it's not now.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   It's not a mistake.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   This is something you're going to keep doing.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.800]   I invested 1,500 bucks in it.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.800]   I bet.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.800]   That's a good point.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.800]   [laughter]
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   See, I can understand buying a Chromebook for a school, a $250 Chromebook for school.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   Chrome OS, I guess, if it's cheap, makes some sense.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   But you spent enough money on that laptop that you could have bought a really sophisticated tool.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   I think if Google sells a $500 better...
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   Admittedly, the Samsung is a netbook.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   It's kind of crappy, too.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   I would love to see better hardware.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   It's better price.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   But I think this keyboard is magnificent.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.800]   The screen is magnificent.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.800]   I'm happy with it.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   And I'm never going to buy a Windows machine.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.800]   It ain't going to happen.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.800]   It's not.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   I can't get my head around it.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   So the only thing to buy is do I buy another Mac?
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   And I go back to what Gina said when we first said the discussion.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.800]   My Macs have, you know, scruff on them.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   They slow down.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   They inevitably slow down.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   This thing doesn't.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.800]   This thing is just worry-free.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   I live in the cloud.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.800]   It's a high-end machine for that.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   If I want to live in Chrome, why should I be relegated to a bad machine?
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   You're right.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   You're right.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.800]   It does everything you want it to do.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.800]   It's an awful lot of money to pay for such a limited thing.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.800]   I'm not complaining about that, but I also think that's the best keyboard I've ever had.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.800]   It's the best screen I've ever had.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.800]   It was not crazy about the keyboard there.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   Oh, really?
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.800]   It's not a great keyboard.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.800]   It's an OK keyboard.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.800]   It's not a great track.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.800]   It's an OK track.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   I like the aluminum.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.800]   The screen is nice.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.800]   The aspect ratio of 3, 2 is a very strange choice.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.800]   And while Google and everybody says, "Oh, yes, because images are 3..."
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.800]   What they're really doing is we couldn't push more than that many pixels, so we had to make it a smaller display.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   Speakers rattle the keyboard.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.800]   I don't know if that's a good thing.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   And just rattle the keyboard on it.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.800]   Yeah, play it loud.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.800]   I stand by my recommendation.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.440]   But obviously, there are some people who should get this machine.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.800]   It's hard for me to think of a lot of them.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.800]   And you're maybe one.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.800]   No, the reason Google did this, when I say something or when Vance said something, the
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.800]   Googlers would come in.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:57.880]   Google wanted a proof of concept of the Chrome as an operating system you can really just
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.880]   use.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.400]   And that's what this machine is there to do, is they're a proof of point.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.400]   Not like glass.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.400]   Glass is going to be their proof of point.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:12.400]   I didn't put on the rundown, but this video of cops, the verge, which I went to.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.400]   You're right.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.400]   You're so wrong on that post, too, but go ahead.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.400]   And I'll explain why you're completely wrong.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   Which, the cops?
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:25.400]   You say, "Oh, the great thing about Google Glass is now cops will be taking pictures everywhere,
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.400]   which means they can no longer complain about you taking pictures."
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.400]   Well, I'm saying in theory, I know they're always fine with it.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.400]   They always fine with it.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.880]   No, of course they will.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.520]   You can't speed either, a cop can speed, just because a cop could do something gives them
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.120]   no thought in their mind at all that now others should be able to do it.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.440]   In fact, it means the police and government will have cameras and they'll make damn sure
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.440]   that we don't.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.920]   I don't think they can get away with that.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.760]   And who's going to stop them?
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.760]   Judges.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.200]   That'd be interesting.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   That will be interesting.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.320]   Have the judges said anything yet about the police who, you know, clearly, you'll be
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.920]   illegally take cameras from people and prevent them from taking pictures?
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   Yes.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.920]   Yes.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   Huge case in Baltimore, huge case in Maryland.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.920]   Good.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   And the good guy's one.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.920]   Good.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.320]   I'd like to say that's good because they really, I mean, that does give us a weapon against
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.320]   police, which is what they like.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:22.320]   I was at an event last night about publicness and privacy and the chief attorney at Hearst,
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.320]   you know, big deal attorney has been working with a lot of newspaper cases a lot of years.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.320]   Well, I didn't know this.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.320]   I didn't know about it.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.320]   Have you heard of this erasure statutes?
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.320]   No.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.800]   I make fun of the EU for talking about a right to be forgotten.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.720]   And these are state statutes.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.480]   I don't know how many states they're in, six or seven, and where if you were arrested
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.000]   for something and you're in the cases thrown out or you're acquitted, you know, if it's
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.040]   gone for any reason, you can then demand that it be erased, expunged, right?
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.320]   But not only that, but in some cases, they're coming back to the newspapers that have in
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.480]   the archives and telling them to have to erase it there.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.480]   Really?
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.880]   That's incredibly dangerous.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.280]   That goes to the notion that you can try to erase knowledge.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.600]   You're not allowed to know that anymore.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.600]   And that's-
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.560]   Well, especially since the newspapers, if they did their job properly, did not in any
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.280]   way say anything untrue.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.280]   Right.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.280]   Precisely.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.280]   It's a fact this person was arrested.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.320]   Now, the newspaper ideally should go back in and say, oh, and later on update this
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.320]   person with it.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.480]   Well, I would endorse that as an ethical way to behave.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.920]   So now go to these videos, right?
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.800]   The way that it's taser is selling these videos, that it was a video I think it's still on
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.320]   the verge, which by the way, ran really fast on my pixel.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.320]   Yeah, I noticed that also.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.200]   It was a flash issue.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   So lady, I had to-
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.480]   I noticed that too, and I don't know what that was.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.440]   I had the same problem.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.440]   It's a flash issue.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.440]   So no, I was choking.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.440]   He's mad.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.520]   He's mad people have no sense of humor, you know?
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.520]   No, I had that problem.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.520]   Do you understand?
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.520]   Flash video play back wrong.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.400]   No, flash video play back wrong.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.320]   It was just, they get a joke.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.320]   Jesus.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.320]   Yeah, wait, wait, wait.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.320]   So let Jeff finish.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.320]   So what about the words?
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.320]   Okay.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.320]   Okay.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.800]   So the purge had this thing about cop videos.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   It's a product from Taser.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.240]   And the cop wears the camera and it always records, it always has him buffer the last
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.400]   30 seconds.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.840]   Cop hits record and then it starts recording on.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.680]   And then at the end of it, they put it in the recharging station.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:27.160]   The entire video goes up to Taser headquarters where they say that you can't, the cop can't
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.600]   erase any part of it.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.560]   I don't fully getting this, squeeze around this.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.520]   But they're saying that the video as a whole is there.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.440]   Now they can then pull out parts and it's in their control, but then it's discoverable
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.560]   by defense, which I think is really interesting.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:49.560]   And I didn't mean to get off in this side thing.
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.560]   Poor Jean has been sitting there mute.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.360]   Well, there are several people in the chat room calling for me to sort of break the tie.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.360]   Here's the thing.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.360]   I haven't tried a pixel.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.160]   Yeah, I got to have one in order to review it.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.080]   I mean, I have to tell you, like Leo reviews tons of computers every day.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.360]   So it's hard for me not to trust his evaluation.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.120]   And Jeff, you know, is coming from a low powered, you know, the low power.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.640]   It's definitely better than the Samsung.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.640]   Give me that.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.640]   It's better than the Samsung.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.640]   I'm not sure if you're the best.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.640]   Yeah, right.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.640]   Right.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.640]   You had a max, but you sort of committed to living, you know, in Chrome OS.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.440]   So I think the pixel was a huge upgrade.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.640]   I mean, it looks like it looks like a nice computer, but I'm sort of, you know, I, I
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.640]   I can do it.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.280]   Well, you wouldn't spend, I can tell you right now, you wouldn't spend $1600 on that computer.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.440]   Well, I'm cheap too.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.440]   I mean, no, I'm not arguing with that.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.840]   Well, that's what I want to hope for more.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.080]   My job is to tell people whether or not to spend $1600 on that computer.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.080]   And my answer is no.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.240]   So my job is also to talk about theory.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.200]   You know, I mean, you have a different job than I do.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.120]   So when I'm reviewing a piece of hardware, fundamentally, what I'm saying is, is this
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.080]   worth the buying or not?
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.840]   And fundamentally, it's not.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.840]   Right.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.320]   But fundamentally in this show, we talk about whether, yeah, that's a different matter.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.320]   It's a different matter.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.240]   It's coming to age and whether it's, it's, it's, it's, you know, is this, is this just
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:06.000]   a Bitcoin-like trend and FAD or is this something real that people can really live in?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.760]   And that's, and that's what I think the point is.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.880]   And, and before the point of Vance's piece, before, if you wanted to live in the cloud,
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.320]   you were relegated to a tinny, cheap machine.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.320]   Right.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.320]   There are no reason.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.000]   If you're going to have the philosophical discussion about the cloud, there are other
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.040]   issues that I think are more important, such as what happens when you're offline, what
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.480]   happens if the cloud is down, you, you, it goes back to the old days, the battle days,
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.560]   in my opinion, of thin clients.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.200]   And your computer wasn't a computer, it was a terminal to somebody else's computer.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.960]   And I think the name is down, everyone's dead.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:45.160]   The real advantage of the personal computing revolution was one CPU per user.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:49.200]   And I think that that is something that I hate to see us backsliding on.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.720]   But I think, I think we, I think these companies like it because they can make more money that
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.720]   way.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.720]   Yeah, yeah, they can roll more.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.520]   But I, I have my docs and I have my Gmail on the plane.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.520]   That works fine.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.680]   And that's limited, I will bet, but I will admit.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:07.000]   But if you write more native apps for Chrome, that's the problem with, I ever notice, it's
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   not native.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.440]   So it didn't save locally, but it could be.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.040]   So more native apps written for Chrome will work fine offline.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.880]   So but you have to, so I was, I flew home from New York and I was, I was in JFK kind
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.800]   of, you know, everything plugged in and like quickly downloading it.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.800]   I had offline Gmail.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.400]   So you have to kind of launch offline Gmail, for example, and say, okay, sync all my stuff.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.880]   And I, and I had Google play music up on my Android phone and I was like, oh, let me
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.400]   pull down the music that I want to listen to while I was on the plane.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.200]   And they were, they were boarding and I was like, oh, you know, hurry up.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.840]   So you do have to kind of do that sync, right?
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.160]   Yeah, but again, that's, that's all very fixable.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.760]   And the truth is that I keep offline Gmail open all the time because I have two Gmail
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.560]   accounts and the damn Chrome gets confused between them.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.280]   So you use offline Gmail all the time, even when you're online.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.040]   For my second account for my university account.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.040]   Right.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.040]   So it's up anyway.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.320]   It's downloaded anyway.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.600]   I have a drive open anyway.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.600]   So pretty much.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.600]   I've screwed up once.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.600]   Right.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.360]   And the drive app works the same way, right?
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.400]   So as you use the offline drive app and it sinks similar to Gmail.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.400]   I love it.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.200]   That's, that's sinking down its own cost.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.200]   And it's no accident.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.120]   They give you 12 complimentary logons to go go internet.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.600]   Doesn't do me any good on the United.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.920]   You got fly virgin.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920]   You, you, you, Sarah have it as well.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.920]   Some others do.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.200]   But that, but there's a reason why they give you that, right?
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.800]   Cause really it works better when it's online.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.600]   Well, also that's the part of the point too that they're trying to make as so does the
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.600]   world.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:36.920]   Why are they doing, why are they doing gigabit internet and Kansas City and Austin damn
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.920]   them?
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.920]   Well, it's, yeah, we're going to talk about that.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:40.920]   It's an interesting point.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.360]   And actually is relevant to the other big announcement this week, which was Facebook
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.360]   home.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.040]   I mean, it's pretty clear that Google and Facebook kind of have the same goal, which is
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.520]   to get you to give them as much of your data as possible.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.000]   Living in the cloud is great for Google because it means everything you do transfers
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.840]   through Google servers.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.840]   Yep.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.840]   Yeah.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.960]   And so I would submit they have a very strong vested interest.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:12.120]   And I don't, I think that that kind of brings into question their motivation.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:17.000]   You know, they may say, oh no, it's just better when in fact it's better for our business.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.480]   Is it really better for users?
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.960]   I don't think so.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.880]   Eric Schmidt has said straight out the business model for Google is extremely simple.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.760]   The more we use the internet, the more they make.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.760]   Period.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.760]   So it's not just about being in the cloud.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.760]   It's just using the internet.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.760]   Well, yeah.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.760]   And the more data we give them, the better it is for them as well.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.760]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.760]   But it's also good for me.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.760]   Well, that's my question.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.760]   Is it good for you?
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.440]   And I think that it's good for you until a cloud goes down or you have some problem.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.640]   Now there are some real advantages.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.640]   It's more secure.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.000]   You can change computers and everything's still there.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.120]   I love it on Android because if I get a new Android phone, I don't have to worry about
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.120]   it.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.120]   I just log in and boom, it's all there.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.880]   The collaboration is the thing for me.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.400]   I mean, you can collaborate with other people.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.200]   I have hard drives full of old pictures and documents and things that I back up on my
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.200]   own.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.600]   But honestly, if my business partner and I have to get something done, we fire at Google
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.600]   Drive.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.600]   Right?
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.600]   I mean, it's just the, you know, it's the convenience versus security.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.120]   I just say it's nice to have the choice though, right?
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.120]   That's the point.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.120]   And what Google's saying is, no, you don't need a choice.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.120]   Just use our stuff.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.760]   I've got tons of choice.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.760]   I've got all kinds of stuff.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.760]   You don't.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:24.000]   May it matter, mind you, sir, you who denigrate the cloud, shall we remember the days of the
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   blue screen of death?
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.360]   No, I love the cloud.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.200]   I am not denigrating the cloud.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.200]   I love the cloud.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.120]   Just as Gina said, there's all of our, all of the work we do on these shows is done on
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.280]   Google Docs or rundowns ever.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.120]   As you know, we love the cloud.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.120]   There's nothing wrong with it.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.120]   I just want choice.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.920]   I don't want to be forced to use the cloud.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.520]   And we fought long and hard to get this choice.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.760]   I just want to point out.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:53.600]   I mean, well, I also fought long and hard to get away from the hegemony of hugely expensive
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.280]   software from Microsoft and Apple.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.480]   And I'm freed from that now.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.440]   That's an interesting way to put it.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.960]   I mean, that's interesting.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.400]   I mean, when I did my first book draft, you know, my editor was like, oh, we use Word.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.400]   And I was like, oh, I don't want to use that.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.400]   I don't have a light.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.640]   Well, something I didn't have a license.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.080]   And I was a freelance blogger making 12 bucks opposed.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.080]   I couldn't afford.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.600]   Microsoft Office, I had to find, you know, I had to go back.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.400]   Fortunately, you used open office, right?
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.000]   And then you could use open office.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.240]   Yeah, you could use open office.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.880]   But of course, my book publisher had these elaborate templates that didn't quite vision
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.640]   tracking and it didn't quite work with open office, you know, as well as it should have.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.240]   Anyway, but yeah, and obviously I just hated it because I'm a programmer.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.680]   So Word is the worst.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.720]   I just want to work in a text editor.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.880]   Every publisher still does this.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.880]   I understand why.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.880]   I know, I know.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.880]   I know.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.880]   I know it's hard.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.880]   This is why I don't write books anymore.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:57.400]   Steve Surt, who wrote "Numeracy" and the "Jeopardy" book said he used docs for his publisher.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.800]   I was a project of that.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.800]   Really?
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.800]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   I mean, this was years ago.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.720]   Now docs actually does have drive house pretty good.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.920]   We're a document somewhere you can connect to Word.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.640]   And I'm not sure how it does with templates.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.600]   But things are better.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.800]   That's the only issue I have left.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.160]   I've got to do a letter for one of my students.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.000]   I've got to do one of those immigration letters.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   So I have to do a letter.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.760]   Pain in the bot, you know, fine.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.760]   But it's...
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.040]   Do you have a regular computer?
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.040]   I mean...
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.960]   Sure, I've got a Mac next to me.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.960]   I have a Mac.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.960]   And do you ever use it?
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.800]   I mean, if you really wanted to do this right, you should get rid of that.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.960]   I basically don't.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.440]   I basically don't.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.560]   I use the Mac at home.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.040]   My Mac at home now is basically my Google Cloud Print machine.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.240]   Clap Print's great.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.240]   Love Cloud Print.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.240]   And that's it.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.240]   That's it.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:51.840]   One of the office, I took it out today for the first time out of my drawer in three weeks.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.520]   I accept the premise of what's the guy's name who commented in your blog?
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.520]   Vance McAllister.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:02.000]   I accept Vance's premise that for some people, simpler is better.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.400]   That generally though is an attitude that is espoused not by the people themselves, but
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.200]   by the people who administer them.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.240]   These professionals, school administrators who don't want to give kids any power at all.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.240]   That's the control.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.240]   They want to control it.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.360]   There's also an elegance argument.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.800]   And I think Vance is making more of the elegance argument.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.960]   That I don't need more.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.960]   I want this.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.760]   This works.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.320]   And why should I be relegated to the bad hardware?
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.320]   And why do you...
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.320]   Yeah, I know you shouldn't.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.880]   You're getting so emotional about this.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.680]   You shouldn't be relegated to bad hardware.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.280]   And part of my argument was it should be better hardware for that price, frankly.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.000]   There's a USB 2.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.560]   It's unaccountable.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.560]   That's ridiculous.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.560]   It's unaccountable.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.960]   I think we're also extremely early in the life.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.960]   But so Chrome is an O-Rass.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.600]   Is he a year and a half old?
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.760]   And so, I understand a negative review about a particular product is only about this snapshot
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.760]   in time.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.760]   It may get better.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.480]   It may be a better product coming down the road.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.480]   I'm not reviewing the prospects of Google OS.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.720]   I'm saying don't buy the Pixel.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.720]   No, I get that.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.720]   I get that, but I'm loving the machine.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.720]   I just pay it on the...
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   I like it.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   That's good.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:12.120]   You know, Leo, your point about having a choice though, I think is a good one.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.920]   How does that choice reconcile itself?
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:18.760]   Like what could Google do to make that choice actually viable?
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.800]   Well, Android is a really good example of huge amount of choice.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.720]   And I'm doing a very interesting experiment with my 80-year-old mother who's staying with
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.680]   me for the month.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:33.480]   And she had a feature phone, terrible feature phone, which she couldn't use.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:37.120]   So I gave her my Galaxy Note 2.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:41.000]   And now I know what's going to end up happening, which is she's going to end up with my iPhone.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.840]   But I'm giving it a shot.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:48.920]   And Samsung has a simple finder, which is considerably less complicated.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.040]   And she's going through, there's a lot of tutorials and pop-ups of how to do this and
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.040]   that.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.480]   And I'm watching with great interest to see.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.240]   Now, there's an example of a platform that gives you plenty of choice, much more so
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.480]   even than an iPad or an iPhone.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.560]   But it may be that that's going to throw her for a loop.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.520]   It's not easy to use.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.840]   So what phone are you using now?
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.880]   I'm stuck with an iPhone until my HTC One comes next week.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.880]   Ah!
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.880]   Ah!
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.640]   Are you going to install Facebook Home?
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.800]   Oh, of course.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.360]   Now I've learned a very sad thing.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.240]   And I'm disappointed to hear this.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.960]   And Renee Ritchie of iMore was telling me this, that the Facebook Home that comes with the
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:31.520]   HTC first and other phones, presumably that should come along, designed with a Facebook
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:37.280]   Home on top of it, have more capability than just downloading the launcher.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.520]   So when we download the launcher and put it on our Android phones, our galaxies or our
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.960]   HTCs, it will not be the full Facebook Home.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:50.520]   There was something about in their privacy statement, they said, there was a distinction
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.080]   between what was going to be installed on the first and what you get in the Playstarch.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.760]   I thought it was interesting.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.560]   I guess I think it was something about how the version installed on the first would be
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.840]   able to tell what apps were giving notifications.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.000]   That kind of tipped me off.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.440]   Like, oh, that's a different APK then.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.440]   Right.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.440]   This is going to be a different thing.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.600]   They're really doing, it's more like a modified HTC Sense.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.200]   They're really doing a carrier modification on top, not just a new launcher.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   Right.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.200]   And what are you missing exactly?
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:22.520]   I'm not sure what, from a user feature wise, I'm not sure what's missing.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.440]   I just, there was a, there was just a, you know, people ask questions about privacy, you
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.280]   know, what information is this Facebook Home transmitting back to Facebook.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.880]   And then there was a bit in the bullet point, we covered it last night all about Android,
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.880]   all about Android.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:38.480]   It said that the Facebook Home on the first is aware of the notifications that other apps
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.760]   are generating because, you know, part of Facebook Home is the redesigned notifications
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:47.240]   and it knows what apps are generating those notifications, but the one in the Playstarch
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.240]   does not.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.040]   So that made me go, hmm, this sounds like this is actually two different builds.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.640]   But I don't want the first, unfortunately, because it's kind of a crappy Android phone.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.280]   Yeah, I mean, it's the first, does it?
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.920]   Yeah, yeah, you definitely want the one.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.600]   Now it's conceivable HTC might offer a specialized version of Facebook Home on the one since
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.040]   it's an HTC product.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.040]   So we'll see.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.040]   This comes out April 12th.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.600]   I want to talk about Facebook Home.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.960]   We haven't had a chance to with you guys and I'm sure there's lots that you have to say
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.960]   about it.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.160]   So let's do that in just a second.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.160]   What do you say?
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:22.400]   We're talking about Google, the cloud, the pixel, the queue, Chrome OS and more.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.400]   You know what?
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.080]   We shouldn't all agree about everything all the time.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.560]   Oh, no, I mean, the audience loves a penny tee and Twitter just says that she loves watching
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.560]   us argue.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.560]   Actually, it makes more stuff.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.360]   It makes no, it makes a lot of people very uncomfortable.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.360]   Really?
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.360]   Mom and dad are dead in dad.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.360]   Don't argue.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.360]   Don't argue.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.080]   Jeff and I love each other.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.080]   It's okay.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.080]   It's sweet.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.080]   They love each other.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.080]   Everything's cool.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.080]   Everything's cool.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.200]   I'm simultaneously amused and made uncomfortable.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.200]   I can't think of more.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.360]   It's a little uncomfortable.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.800]   I don't want to disagree with Jeff.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.800]   You gave me pause, Leo.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.120]   I mean, I thought and I said, you know, it was Leo right there.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.400]   Am I crazy here?
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.400]   Should I cancel this order?
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.000]   And then I decided no, no, I don't want you to.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   I don't want you to.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.800]   I was very relieved.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.280]   I can put that $1,600 to such good use.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.200]   Maybe perhaps to a new phone from Ting.com.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.000]   Mm hmm.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   This is what I should have.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.400]   This is what I should have given mom.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.840]   Would have saved me some money.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.000]   Maybe I will.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.400]   I want you to visit twig.ting.com.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.440]   Ting is an MVNO.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.320]   Do you know what that is?
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:36.200]   It's a mobile virtual network reseller, mobile virtual network operator, I guess the O stands
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.200]   for.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.200]   They resell sprint.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.560]   Don't tell sprint, but they're a better phone company.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.720]   So for some reason, sprint doesn't seem to mind this.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.720]   And I'm not sure.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.920]   I guess they figure, hey, more customers, what could possibly go wrong.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.680]   But I got to tell you, Ting's got it right.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:56.480]   In fact, the whole idea was Ting wanted to create a no BS mobile service.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.480]   So there's no contract.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.480]   It's month to month.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.280]   I mean, T-Mobile is kind of making noises about doing this.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.840]   Ting's really doing it.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.800]   No early termination fees.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.480]   So your contract free.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.360]   There's no bundling or ride-along services.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.960]   You choose the service level you want.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.400]   If you use more, you pay at the standard rate.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.600]   You don't pay a penalty.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.000]   If you use less, they rebate the difference.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.560]   That is unheard of.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.000]   You get credits for unused service.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.240]   There are no add-on charges for voicemail, picture and video messaging, three-way calling,
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.240]   caller ID.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.400]   And here's the best part.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.480]   Tethering and hotspotting.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.800]   Not only encouraged, you pay nothing extra.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.040]   It's built in.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.960]   So go to twig.ting.com.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.440]   Take a look at the monthly plans.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.160]   And I'll show you how this works.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.320]   This is great for families or small businesses where you're going to have multiple phones.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.880]   You don't have to, but each phone is $6 a month.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.640]   So let's have a family of four.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.880]   In fact, I'll use my family as an example.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:56.200]   Four phones we currently have on AT&T, I think a 1,400 minute plan.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.200]   We don't use it.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.760]   I'll use 1,000 minutes.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:01.920]   We do have unlimited text messages, 2,000 is plenty.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.720]   And I'm going to use all the data I can afford.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:09.840]   So four phones, three gigabytes of data, 2,000 text messages and 1,000 shared minutes a
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.840]   month.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:18.040]   The whole thing for a family of four on AT&T is well over $300 on Ting, the whole thing,
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.640]   family of four, $110 a month.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:26.080]   $110 a month for four people, not each total.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.080]   You got to go here, do the savings calculator, just bring your phone bill and see how much
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.680]   you'd save for exactly the same kind of service.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.120]   Now there are some differences, for instance.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.120]   You buy the phone.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.360]   Now Ting, we're going to show you how you can get a little rebate on the phone, but Ting
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.680]   has all the great Android phones available, including the Galaxy Note 2, which I would
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.680]   recommend.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.840]   I happen to love that phone.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.080]   You also can choose from standard feature phones.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.880]   They even have data devices like the Sierra Overdrive Pro.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:31:00.080]   So that's like a Wi-Fi access spot powered by Sprint and their 4G through Ting.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.440]   So pick the phone you want.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.640]   They have a new phone marketplace, but also a used marketplace, which can save you considerable
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.040]   amount of money.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.720]   And when you buy, by the way, I want you to go to twig.ting.com and you'll save $25 on
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.840]   your first Ting device.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.080]   So you get the device, then you activate it through Ting.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:21.800]   They have a fantastic dashboard that tells you exactly what you've used, who's using
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.280]   what, I mean, the Ting dashboard, you've never seen anything so great.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.280]   This is data-driven.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.440]   It's just so fantastic.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:32.320]   There's never any mysterious line items on the phone.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:37.040]   You can have unlimited devices on a single plan sharing the data, sharing the text in
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.440]   the minutes.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.560]   Really can take control of your account.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.480]   I love the tech support.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.080]   This is -- Tucouse does this.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.080]   And they've really nailed support.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.480]   For instance, they empower their support representatives to handle your problem.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:55.400]   So if you call their support number, 1-855-TING-FTW, anytime between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.160]   Eastern time, you'll get a real person.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.400]   They won't put you on hold.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.400]   They can fix the problem.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.040]   They also have great help.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:05.440]   Active customer forms, a very simple help ticketing system video tutorials, startup
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.440]   guides.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.560]   This is the way to do it.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.600]   I want you to try it.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.600]   twig.ting.com.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:15.120]   Save $25 on your first device.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.840]   You're going to like it.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.840]   twig.ting.com.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.120]   All right.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.120]   Facebook home.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.080]   We saw the announcement on Thursday almost a week ago.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.400]   Now every show has a chance to talk about it, except this.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.080]   So I'm going to give you a chance.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.920]   You know what's interesting though, as time has gone by, people like to see MG Seagler,
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:41.520]   who is such an iPhone bigot, on tech crunch, say, "I actually like this."
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.520]   Wow.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.520]   You -- I look really nice.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.640]   Look, I have to say, just judging totally just some scene announcements.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.960]   I have not actually tried home yet.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.440]   In fact, I don't think I'm going to be able to.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.120]   This is not going to run on my Galaxy Nexus.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.640]   It only runs on certain phones.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.440]   The four -- it would run on the four, wouldn't it?
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.440]   The Nexus 4.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.440]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.440]   What?
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.440]   Or I thought it was --
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.680]   They said it was -- there was a version out, but only briefly, then they shut down the
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.680]   server.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.680]   Yeah, there was a prerelease.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.880]   But I think it'll run on the four when it comes out.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.880]   No?
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.880]   No.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.880]   Galaxy S3.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.880]   Yes, I think.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.880]   Galaxy Note.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.880]   Yes.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:19.400]   So the idea is it's basically, I think, Gina, it looks like a new launcher, right?
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.520]   It's a new launcher, exactly.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:29.160]   And I think that philosophy-wise and strategically, they're going in the right direction.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.200]   I liked the idea of putting people first, not apps.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.680]   That was one of the things that kept saying during the presentation.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.640]   The idea that your phone is a messaging device, you want to connect with people.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.640]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.480]   I'm really glad that they didn't go the Kindle Fire route, right?
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.400]   That they didn't fork Android, that they didn't issue a whole new device, that they
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.000]   didn't come up with their own app store, that they're not trying to lock everybody
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   into the Facebook ecosystem.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.960]   This is, they're playing nice with Google.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.680]   They're actually very complimentary toward Google, and Google's commitment to openness
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.680]   on Android.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.840]   I love that a company is Biggest Facebook.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.360]   That's so good at making web services.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.240]   I mean, regardless of how you feel about Facebook, the product, like Facebook makes
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.080]   a great service that a billion people use.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.560]   I love that they're developing something.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.280]   This interesting and forward thinking on Android first, right?
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.280]   We always kind of complain about how great apps come out.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.280]   Gina, can I ask you a question?
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.280]   I ask you a question.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.080]   I understand all of the vendors hurts Google because you don't get to search.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.440]   The search is still there.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.320]   Everything from Google is still there on the phone, right?
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.520]   As Danny Sullivan pointed it out, it's two clicks deep though now.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.920]   Instead of being on the front page, you know, on a stock Android phone, Google searches
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.640]   front and center on every page.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.640]   Right.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.760]   But if I want to search the web, I ain't using Facebook.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.760]   No, no, you won't be.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.760]   You'll use in Google.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.760]   But you have to click a couple of times.
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.200]   So I don't see the Google really hurts.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.200]   Right.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:50.640]   So I put Google, this is a thing, a Play Store, Maps, YouTube, all of Google sort of flagship,
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:54.120]   you know, all their, their great proprietary apps are on this phone, right?
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.560]   So this is, this is not a Facebook phone.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.640]   And you know, obviously when you get it from the Play Store, it's just a launcher app.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.600]   I'm just excited to see a big company like Facebook make a launcher, right?
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.240]   So far we've only seen kind of indie developers make launchers, some great launchers.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.800]   And we've also seen companies like HTC, you know, come up with new sort of UIs, like
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   the Sense UI, right?
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:18.040]   But I'm excited to see this like, and then we've seen Amazon do the Kindle, which is,
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.320]   you know, a completely separate thing, right?
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.240]   Which doesn't have the Play Store or, or the other Google Apps.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.280]   I'm excited to see Facebook go, you know what?
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.760]   We're not trying to take over Android.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.400]   We want to put a layer on top, on top of the phone, which Android allows and encourages.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.800]   And this has already been done by, by, by, by, you know, small indie developers.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.480]   But we're, we're going to make this, this brand new experience.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.680]   I think it's great for Android.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.680]   I'm excited.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.800]   I think it sets a precedent for other companies who want to do work on Android.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.280]   I think it's kind of a new way to work with Android.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:48.160]   That all said the, I have, I question the implementation.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.480]   I haven't tried it myself yet.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.440]   But there are some things that I'm not so thrilled about.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.680]   Cover feed, not so thrilled about.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.760]   Uh, you know, that's the lock screen, right?
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.160]   So whenever you look at your phone and they, you know, this is it right now.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:04.640]   If you're watching the video, you see full screen pictures of your friends.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.640]   You see the chat heads.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.640]   If you're chatting with somebody, their head is persistent.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.640]   We'll stay there.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.640]   You tap it to chat.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:10.640]   We like chat heads actually.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:11.640]   I do too.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.680]   Yeah, I think chat heads makes a lot of sense.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.720]   And I'm dying for unified messaging service.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.240]   I want Google Babel now.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:21.040]   I'm hoping that the Google voice team was watching the Zuck announcement.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.240]   Yeah, because Babel does not have voice in it, right?
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.200]   I know it doesn't, it doesn't, it sounds like.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.880]   Everything but they say it will.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.840]   They said it will hang out, talk message.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.000]   So here's the, if you just send a message to a person and it doesn't matter if it goes
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.800]   through their phone number, through their Facebook account, through their talk account,
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.320]   through the messenger account, whatever, I just want to talk to Leo.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.680]   However it needs to go, you take care of her for me.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.720]   And that's what chat heads does, right?
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.720]   Mm-hmm.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.480]   And it puts faces front and center, which is really nice.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.480]   That's good UI, right?
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.480]   This is about people.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.960]   Technology is about connecting people.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.120]   Zuck is absolutely right about that.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.200]   I think your phone is absolutely right about that.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.200]   So I really, I like that a lot.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:59.880]   I'm not, I mean, the whole adding, so the one thing about the presentation I didn't
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.520]   love is that, and I talked about this a little bit earlier, they, Zuck kind of set up this
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:08.680]   like false dichotomy of this grid of icons, you know, app icons that have little red badges,
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.160]   right, which is the iOS experience.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.040]   You know, here's the icons you can go into and you have to tap through these icons to
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.040]   get information.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.520]   And he's saying, this is a whole new experience on Android.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.280]   And you know, my home screen doesn't look like that.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.000]   I don't tap the wraps to get information.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.600]   I've got, now I'm a power user, but I've got widgets set up on my home screen and on
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.600]   my lock screen.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.960]   I look at my phone and I see data.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.240]   And there are plenty of widgets, social widgets that lots of companies come out who
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.440]   have been pretty crappy up until now.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.040]   But if I want to see my stream of Facebook updates or four square check ins or Twitter
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.880]   updates, I can do that in a widget on Android.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.680]   So, you know, of course, Zuck was making it sound like they were doing something so new
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:49.840]   and innovative, but he was sort of saying comparing iOS to Facebook home, which is,
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.440]   which, you know, kind of two different things.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.840]   I think Android allows this.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.640]   But the reality is that people don't change their default widgets, right?
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.360]   Like this phone's going to ship with Facebook home.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.680]   You can choose between, you know, home and your regular launcher.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.360]   You can turn it off at any time.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.080]   So this is, I think it looks like a nice experience so far.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.080]   How much do you use Facebook?
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.720]   I'm not so sure about Copper Feed.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.600]   I would say, you know, I syndicate my tweets to Facebook.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:20.720]   I interact with Twitter first and Facebook economy secondary check in place.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.680]   So I would say I'm a low to moderate user.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:28.000]   MG observed that he used Facebook a whole lot more just because it was very easy.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.600]   And of course, that's the point.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.000]   Here's the question.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.720]   I'm hoping that Google looks at this and says, well, we should do this with Babel and Google
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:38.720]   Plus.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.720]   Absolutely.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.720]   Absolutely.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.360]   And Google had started to this a little bit, right?
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.360]   When the Nexus 7 shipped, remember that the widget on the front page of the Nexus 7,
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.160]   which is clearly sort of a media consumption device.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.560]   I mean, the Nexus 7 is all about go to the play store, buy movies, music and books.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.160]   And do you remember the kind of it shipped with that?
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.600]   Wasn't the default Android home screen, right?
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.600]   I had the--
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:58.600]   I killed it immediately.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.440]   I killed it immediately too.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.760]   But most people aren't going to do that.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.520]   They're like, oh, this is the thing that's on my home screen, right?
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:10.720]   I would love to see Google sort of put out a Google Power user launcher app.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.600]   I mean, this is the thing that I'm excited about about home.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.080]   It's like, oh, cool.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:19.760]   Like I want to see more companies put out awesome launchers that are sort of service-centric.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.760]   I mean, the problem is I use lots of different services, though.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.760]   So I like to customize.
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.760]   And you can only use them on launcher.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.760]   That becomes an issue with that.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.760]   Right.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.760]   Yes, exactly.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.440]   Well, then-- but I would use-- you know, look, if Google you want us to use Google Plus
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.520]   more and I know you do, this is a way to do it.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.520]   And just steal it.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.520]   It's just--
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.520]   Oh, sure they will.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.520]   So they will.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.520]   Point by point, they did a beautiful design.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.520]   I mean, everybody agrees.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.520]   This is gorgeous looking.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.400]   Yeah, Facebook makes good product.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.560]   Point for point.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.120]   Steal this design.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.120]   Just hook it up with Google Plus.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.120]   And you know what?
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.720]   Make Facebook part of it.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.720]   Make Twitter part of it.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.360]   Make everything a part of it.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.920]   That would be the brilliant thing.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:55.920]   Exactly.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.320]   And then if you had the choice, you're going to use the Facebook only one and the Google
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   Plus one.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.880]   Well, would Twitter let them?
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:08.080]   I mean, Twitter cut them off from the hose for search.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.920]   But you can still post it, right?
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:14.480]   I mean, assume you have the Twitter app installed and it's checking Twitter every 15 minutes.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.920]   You hook into the Twitter app, right?
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.160]   Somehow I think Twitter is not going to play nice.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.240]   They're going to say that's a client.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.840]   Yeah, Twitter has been, well, that's true.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.840]   That is true.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.840]   Right.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.400]   Lucy, Lucy, Spain, Babel to me.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.520]   Yeah, no, I do notice that there's no mention of Twitter in any of this Facebook home collateral
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.320]   is there.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.320]   They want it to replace.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.320]   Well, you know what?
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.480]   This could, this could, this could eliminate Twitter.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.480]   Let's use Google Plus.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.800]   The only message of Twitter, it was at the, it was at the far right of the, of the graph,
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.440]   the comms car graph, like a graph of where people spend their social time on their phones.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:52.440]   Which I got to say, rang, totally untrue from my subjective experience.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.440]   No, but for real people.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.920]   It's kind of fishy to me.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.600]   No, look at, if you just look at Twitter, you can see it.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:03.320]   You can see, I mean, that's all the, you know, if you look at the main feed on Twitter,
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:07.360]   you can just tell us people spewing crap from their phones.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:12.520]   Constance and crap.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.000]   So let's, can we talk about Babel?
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.320]   Yeah, I'm excited about Babel.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.320]   The Babel team.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.600]   So chat heads is the thing about Facebook home that I was sort of like, yes, I like that.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:24.240]   I like the idea that, that, that, that, that someone's face, who's messaging me, pops
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.320]   up above in a layer above what I'm doing, right?
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.760]   Because the right now, the experience is someone sends me a message on Android.
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.800]   It pops up in the shade.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:36.320]   I can see the text of it sort of roll over, you know, in the notification bar and then
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.920]   I have to stop what I'm doing, pull down the shade, look at the notification and then maybe
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.760]   tap on the notification to launch the app and then respond, right?
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:47.080]   It's a lot of, a lot of tapping and pulling and interaction, right?
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.440]   With chat heads, it just pops up.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.440]   Love that.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.520]   And it's a, and it's a face and you don't have to know the details.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.520]   Am I going to Google voice?
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.520]   Am I going to messaging?
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.520]   Am I going to Google talk?
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:56.520]   I don't have to know.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.520]   I don't want to know about that.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:02.520]   I really like the people not apps approach first and I really hope that the Babel team
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.680]   was taking copious notes.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.360]   I hope we don't have to pronounce it Babel, by the way.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.600]   Yeah, that's, it's spelled Babel.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.600]   It is spelled Babel.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.600]   You're right.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.440]   It's like, what's the schedule for it?
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.440]   We know.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.400]   No, because Google said nothing about this.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.280]   Yeah, this is all sort of room or conjecture, isn't it?
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.280]   And leaks.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:26.720]   Uh, let's see, Droid Life had a, was it, there was a memo leaked?
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.720]   It appears.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:32.040]   Uh, there's screenshots, there's memo leaks.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:36.280]   Apparently, they launched Babel by accident on some people's machines and they pulled it
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.280]   back.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:43.160]   Um, you know, if you, if you look up in Gmail, apparently some people are saying that you'll
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:49.000]   get a, uh, all conversations have been moved to the trash, uh, because you're now, because
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.520]   your Babel chat user, these messages are still available in Babel or Babel.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.680]   I hope we don't have to say Babel.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:56.680]   Can we just call it Babel?
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.680]   Let's just call it Babel.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.840]   Where we just do people shall decide.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:03.840]   I think it's because the Googlers read more Douglas Adams than they do read the Bible and
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.040]   they don't understand that tower, Babel was not a good thing.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:13.200]   The Babel fish is a good thing, but there are two different kinds of things.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.240]   I'm, I'm, I'm a gift.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.240]   You.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.600]   Well, we know, cause the guy who invented the thing said how to pronounce it.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.240]   And I think he said, Jeff, I can't remember that.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   But I don't care about some point.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.440]   I don't care who cares.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.640]   But Google will have a canonical pronunciation won't they?
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.560]   They'll tell us how to pronounce it.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.560]   When they talk about a lie.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.560]   Oh, yes.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.160]   The angel say it's Babel.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:39.760]   Well, actually maybe they could, they could split the baby, another, another reference
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:44.120]   to ancient history and just spell it, Babel, but pronounce it, Babel.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.080]   And that's what I hope for.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.840]   I wonder if we're going to hold out on this until I owe.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.080]   We've still got some time to lie.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:55.840]   You know, looking at the screenshots, I have to say it looks very ugly and googly, very
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:56.840]   flat.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:57.840]   It does.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:02.400]   Instead of using Apple style emojis, which are not apples, they're a standard.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.040]   They use their own emojis.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.040]   I don't know.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.120]   I'm not crazy about these screenshots, but maybe they're just the original.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.480]   But this is the new look, isn't it?
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.480]   Everything's square and no.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.640]   There's an argument that if we want to see the future of Android design, we should look
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.480]   at the new Play Store.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.960]   I actually, I almost never do this now, but I grabbed the APK, the sort of leaked APK
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.920]   and install it because I couldn't wait to see the Play Store.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.400]   Oh, so it's not out yet.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.400]   I won't have it yet.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.400]   Oh, it's rolling.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.400]   It's rolling out.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.400]   It's rolling out.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.400]   I gave my mom my Galaxy Note too soon, apparently.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.760]   Yeah, I love to call her up.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.760]   Hey, mom, would you get the APK for the Play Store on the machine to show you so I can
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.760]   see it?
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.760]   It'd be a good challenge.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.960]   Show it to me on Skype, okay?
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.160]   Side load the APK, mom.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.480]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Leo, Leo.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:54.360]   You know that David Letterman did wonderful things with his mother on the show.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.360]   I know.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.360]   You ever had your mother on the show?
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.360]   Occasionally.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:02.280]   She's going to, she says she's going to come in.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.280]   I don't know if she's been putting it off.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.040]   She's been here two weeks.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.040]   I think she'll be on the next twig.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.040]   That'd be cool.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.040]   That'd be great.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.200]   She loves this show.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:11.800]   She watches this show.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:15.080]   That Jeff Jarvis is such a nice boy.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.480]   No, that's not what she says.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.480]   We know that.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.760]   That Gina Trapatti is such a nice girl.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:25.920]   She says that Gina is a nice girl, but why does Jeff keep fighting with you?
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:29.800]   No, she doesn't say that.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.160]   Because he's wrong with his report.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.240]   Your son is wrong.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.000]   My son is never wrong, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.400]   No, she actually is a fan of yours back from the San Francisco Chronicle days.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.760]   She knows who you are.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.600]   So she watches, she watches with great interest.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.600]   We've got to have her on the show.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:52.880]   So, so I think a Babel will be a uni, it's going to be a unified chat service.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:56.640]   It will tie into Google plus Google Hangouts.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.640]   Google now.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.640]   Okay.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.640]   Be nice to get notifications.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:05.240]   It would be nice to get notifications through now.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.240]   But not.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:11.680]   Spalcing out to Mr. Apparently not voice yet, although.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.120]   I'm worried about voice.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.120]   We fear that Google might give up voice.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.520]   That's one of the fears out there.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.160]   Why would they give up voice?
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.160]   I'm worried about voice.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.480]   But all this spring cleaning going on with now that reader is out, I feel like voice might
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.880]   be voice I think is right on that line.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.080]   They just, it just doesn't feel like they do a whole lot of voice.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.680]   They have an updated voice in ages.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.920]   And now some guy named Ken is answering my voice number.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.920]   There's some sort of crossed wires.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.920]   Oh, really?
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.760]   But so, so how does this tie in?
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.640]   So, so is the WhatsApp.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.760]   Is that basically what they didn't buy WhatsApp?
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.760]   They were thinking about buying WhatsApp maybe, but the WhatsApp guy said no.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:51.640]   But is that basically what Babel is?
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.520]   Well, it's WhatsApp is basically a chat.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.520]   WhatsApp is a closed universe.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.000]   So you can only chat with people using WhatsApp.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.040]   Now WhatsApp runs on every platform, not desktop, but it runs on every mobile platform.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.920]   But it's WhatsApp to WhatsApp.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.760]   It's like Beluga, which Facebook.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.720]   To, to SMS.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.720]   No.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.920]   It's an SMS replacement.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:17.720]   It's what teachers get when they run out of texts that month or they have an iPod.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.800]   Pudtotcher, you know, it's for kids.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.280]   The closest thing to Babel is Apple's messages.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.280]   Right.
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:30.200]   Messages will send it via text, but prefers to send it via Internet if it can.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:36.080]   And if so, if you're messaging an iPhone or an iPad, it will do it that way.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:41.880]   And it does have a desktop component, but messages is bad because it's only iOS and
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.720]   and OS 10.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:48.640]   So the dream, of course, is to have something that supports all protocols.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.560]   Google could totally cut around.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:55.240]   Of course, these days, everybody gets unlimited voice and unlimited texts and plans.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.080]   I think I don't think text is a big issue anymore.
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:58.880]   Or is it if you're 12 years old, is it?
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.880]   It might be.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.600]   But I think, you know, I pay 20 bucks a month for a family unlimited text plan on AT&T.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:07.080]   It's the middle of the snow.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.080]   I use WhatsApp.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.080]   I like WhatsApp.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:15.000]   Which, and it's better than MMS for sending video, audio and pictures.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   Video, audio, pictures.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.800]   So who do you know who's in it?
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.600]   You know, I have a handful of friends who use it.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.600]   It's not.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.200]   That's part of the problem.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.440]   You have to be using WhatsApp.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.080]   A lot of people use WhatsApp.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.080]   It's very popular.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.080]   It's huge.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.080]   You remember BBM?
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.080]   Pardon me?
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.080]   Were you ever BBM?
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.480]   When I used a BlackBerry, I used BBM.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:34.480]   BBM's great.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.080]   But again, only works with BlackBerry.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.560]   And with BlackBerry.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.560]   This is why there's a huge opportunity.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.360]   There it is.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.680]   And Facebook, you know, is there.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:47.360]   I mean, that's what Facebook Home does.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.840]   You don't have to pay attention to what protocol you're using.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   You're front now.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:53.960]   Everybody, the presumption is everybody's using Facebook.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   What happens to Facebook Home if somebody's not on Facebook?
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.000]   They don't exist, right?
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.760]   Well, well, no.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.360]   I mean, they're in your contacts.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.280]   Yeah, they should be in your contacts, right?
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:14.440]   And from what it looked like, chat heads integrated with Android's messaging, like SMS
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.440]   app, right?
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:18.880]   So in theory, if you're not on Facebook, Leo, but you sent me a text message, a theory,
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.880]   like that should pop up.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.680]   I probably wouldn't have your avatar, right?
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.280]   It wouldn't be as cool, but it would work.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:27.280]   And it would be bubble, but it should work the same way that the other ones.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.720]   They take over notifications too, which I'm not sure I'm crazy about.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.520]   I actually love Android notifications.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:36.040]   I didn't love how Zuck was like, oh, you know, if you get a notification for a friend,
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.800]   you don't really want to interact with her right now.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.600]   You just throw her away.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   That was cool.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.600]   Are you kidding?
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:42.600]   I love that functionality.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:46.440]   I just thought it was weird that he said you could just throw her like throwing her away.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.920]   I don't want to do that anymore.
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.800]   Just being like, just swipe it away for later.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.800]   For later.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:51.800]   It just seemed like a way.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.480]   Well, Google now does that too, by the way.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:57.000]   When I get birthday announcements from my Google plus people I've never met, I just
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   psh.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   Yeah, you can swipe it away.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   It's kind of the same thing.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Same satisfaction.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.640]   So I had, I searched for, I was looking for directions somewhere on my computer.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.840]   Apparently, it's been out in Google now for a while.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.080]   I just hadn't seen this.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.440]   I searched for Palm Springs on my laptop.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.960]   And then a few hours later, I picked up my phone and looked at it and Google now said,
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.480]   hey, two hours to Palm Springs, light traffic.
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.880]   I know, isn't that great?
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:21.560]   I was like, oh, hey, why is it telling me that?
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.560]   Oh, right.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.560]   I searched for this.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:25.760]   I got really seeing the integration now with now.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.800]   And you know, it would make me buy a Pixel.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:28.800]   What?
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   Google now?
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.000]   Google now in Chrome on the Pixel.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Oh, that's coming.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   That's definitely coming.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   I'm excited.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   I've marked that chat room.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.960]   I would put that in history, but mark that word.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:42.720]   When that happens, he has to buy a Pixel.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:49.680]   The chat room saying that is the difference between the HDF C first and the download version
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.680]   of Facebook comment.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.080]   In fact, it does say that on the webpage.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.920]   All notifications are available on the HTC first.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.520]   The free home download includes Facebook notifications only.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.520]   Ah, okay.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:01.920]   And that makes sense.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.560]   They can't hook you into notifications.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:04.560]   That's a technical limitation.
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.560]   That's a technical limitation.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:07.560]   Yes.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.560]   Okay.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.880]   So explain that to me, Lucy.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:10.880]   Why?
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:16.880]   You would have to take the Android code and hook into it, right, Gina?
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:21.320]   That's what they do with TouchWiz or Blur or HTC's sense.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.840]   They hook into it more deeply than a launcher can.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:25.840]   Right.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:26.840]   Right.
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.680]   That sounds more kind of like a skin, right?
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.680]   It's a skin.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.400]   So the skin can take over notifications of the launcher cannot.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.400]   Something like that.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.400]   I know it sounds kind of vague.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.280]   I haven't done a whole lot with notifications, but it sounds like because they're shipping
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:44.120]   because it's because that the first doesn't come with sense, right?
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.760]   It's just home.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.840]   And then you can, I guess, switch back to the vanilla launcher, the vanilla Android launcher
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.080]   if you want it on on first.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.080]   Right.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.520]   So it sounds like home is a little bit of an integration with sense.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:57.520]   Exactly.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.520]   Because still remove it, I believe.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.520]   Mm-hmm.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:03.120]   I just, I think this looks beautiful.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:09.120]   I just want to, this is, this would get me back on Google+, big time for it's so easy
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.120]   to use.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.120]   We're so integrated.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.200]   I'd start using instead of Twitter.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:18.120]   I would get involved in the chat, the hangouts.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:22.120]   I think Google's got to be thinking that it's not good for some things, right?
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:25.200]   When the big news event is going on, you're not going, you're going to Twitter, you're
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.200]   not going to Google+.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.000]   But that's a critical mass issue, isn't it?
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   No, no.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   It's a foreign issue.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   It's a style issue.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   Okay.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.320]   So that's also the form of the thing.
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:36.040]   Your post could be around three hours later.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.400]   Somebody comments on it, comes back and then they got rid of it.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:42.880]   The original problem, remember back, the early days of Google+, was it was scobles, scobles,
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:46.600]   scobles, scobles, over time somebody commented on scobles, came back up.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.760]   It was scoble hell.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:48.760]   Right.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.760]   Love you, Robert, but.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.760]   No, no.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.760]   And, you know, it's perfectly well what you're talking about.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:54.760]   Right.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   So they fixed that.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:58.240]   And suddenly the complaints went nowhere.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:03.520]   But still it's not meant for trying to stay on top of something.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.520]   No, it isn't.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.520]   It's meant for conversation.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.520]   Unfortunately.
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.520]   It's weird.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:09.520]   It's different.
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:14.040]   And I don't, you know, what would they give up if they tried to gain that Twitter share?
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:18.040]   There'd be too much stuff flowing by, I think.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.400]   You don't think people would post.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:21.400]   So what, okay.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:26.960]   So some of the things that I go to Twitter, if somebody supported it supposedly has died,
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.960]   I'll go to Twitter to see if they died.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.840]   That kind of thing would make it too.
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.840]   Oh, that'd be fine.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:32.840]   That'd be fine.
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:38.080]   No, I think it's more that when you have, you know, Egyptian, Bitcoin, jokes are happening
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.080]   to that.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.080]   Oh, okay.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.080]   But you're not going to do that on these little snippets.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.080]   I'm not going to have one.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:46.600]   But on Google, the reason I like Google Plus is because the conversation is good.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:53.160]   And you can see things like the fact that when you cry in space, the tears don't fall, they
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.160]   go straight out.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:59.280]   That's the kind of thing.
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.920]   I'm not kidding, actually.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:04.840]   Literally, this is the kind of thing I expect to see on Google Plus.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.280]   Is that the Canadian astronaut?
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.280]   He's right.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.280]   I mean, this is cool.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:13.560]   This is the kind of thing that you see on Google Plus because it is more long, for more
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:14.560]   thoughtful.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:20.760]   He's going to make himself cry by spreading water into his eye.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.960]   I think they should just bite him or spank him or something.
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:27.240]   And another astronaut to kick in the rear end.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:31.480]   Oh, in space, it looks kind of crazy.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.480]   Wow.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:34.480]   It just kind of sticks through the face.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.480]   You just got a ball of water in your eye.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:39.320]   Like clinging to your face.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.320]   Look at that.
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:46.840]   Now he says he's snorted up his nose.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:47.840]   It could be like that.
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:48.840]   Those French people.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:53.760]   It's supposed to have some sort of like innate gravity to make it.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:54.760]   No, you know what that is?
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:55.760]   That surface tension.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.760]   Ah.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:03.280]   It makes the surface tension of the water, makes it turn into a ball.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.480]   Really awesome.
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.920]   That's Google Plus right there, baby.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:07.920]   I'd love to have that.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.920]   That's what it came out of.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:09.920]   My last question.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:10.920]   Pardon me?
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.600]   It's a place to share and talk.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.120]   It is much more conversation, absolutely.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.880]   Which I, you know, it's funny.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:22.000]   We were talking the other day about there's this new service called branch.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   Branch.com.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.400]   That is a Twitter based conversation.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:30.760]   Basically adds kind of a threaded conversation off to the side from Twitter.
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.440]   Well, yeah, kind of.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:34.800]   What happens is I'll get into it with somebody on Twitter.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.360]   I try to argue less these days.
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:38.640]   And so they say, "Hey, take it to branch."
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.640]   Because then you can invite people in.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.120]   You can have actually more of a conversation in one place.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:45.480]   The problem they have is that after I've already had the conversation, I don't already
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.480]   had the conversation again.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:47.480]   Right.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:51.520]   I've solved that sick and patient problem of being, of when I feel like having a conversation
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.440]   with somebody knowing to go to branch to do it.
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.640]   And they just released a new design.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:00.120]   And also branch is partly backed by Ev Williams.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:01.120]   Right.
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:03.240]   So Ev is meanwhile doing, of course, media.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.680]   Medium just introduced a whole bunch of new collaborative tools.
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:06.920]   It looks like media.
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:07.920]   That's interesting.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:13.600]   So think up to new office in New York is actually in the branch medium office.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.400]   So we're going to be sharing space with them.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.400]   We're sharing space with them.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.280]   It's in a common open area and they collaborate.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:22.120]   And they're both backed by obvious, right?
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.120]   Right.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:25.120]   It's obvious that beta works and all the others.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.920]   A lot of parentage there.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.880]   And in both cases, you sign in with Twitter.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:34.760]   So it's an interesting, see, I kind of understand what they're doing because, you know, one of
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:39.000]   the reasons I didn't like Twitter and I fled to Jiku and Pounce and all the other places
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.240]   was I wanted threaded conversations.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:47.920]   And every, but that would not have worked on Twitter and buzz.
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:52.160]   And so this is a way of sideloading threaded conversations without impacting the main
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.160]   tools.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:54.520]   It's happening, it's happening on medium.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:59.240]   You can comment on a paragraph in the, in the, oh, I like that.
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.800]   So you're coming directly on an idea, which is really, really, really.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:03.800]   I like that.
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:07.800]   So why not ask?
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:08.800]   There's an issue on Twitter.
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.480]   Half of the fake users on Twitter are now out of control.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.280]   And this is where Google+ is going to see.
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:18.560]   Justin Bieber, for instance, it's estimated that has half of his followers are not real
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:22.720]   people, which kind of cuts back on the follower count a little bit.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.720]   There's a service, I forget the name of it, that will go in and estimate how many of
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:27.880]   your followers are fake.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.880]   By the way, this just in, I think it's just in.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:35.320]   Kleiner Perkins and Google Ventures are starting a Google class fund.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.400]   Ah, that makes sense.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.400]   They've done that before.
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.400]   Yeah, they have.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.720]   Then they do an iPad fund or an iOS fund.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:43.720]   Yep.
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.720]   I think so.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.280]   Well, not Google Ventures didn't, but yes.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.280]   I think Kleiner did.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.280]   KP did.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.280]   I know.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:55.960]   Oh, so let's take a break.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.960]   We're going to talk a little bit more.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:00.520]   I'm just looking at this fake Twitter followers story.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:04.160]   Bill Gates also has a lot of apparently half fake.
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:06.600]   The question is that you can buy for 10 bucks.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.200]   You can buy thousands of followers.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.680]   Are people buying them or is it happening because spammers?
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:11.680]   There's no benefit to that.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:15.120]   The only possible benefit to that is to what, Bragg, you have more, I can see some celebrities
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.920]   doing that to Bragg, you know, they're, you know, they're, they're, you know, there's
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:17.920]   a huge benefit.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:18.920]   What?
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:24.040]   Well, to celebrities in Hollywood, your Twitter, the number of people who follow you on Twitter
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:28.120]   is part of the deal, the contract.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:32.920]   So it's, you can get more money for a movie as a movie star.
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:33.920]   That's part of what you bring in.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.400]   Yeah, I got two million followers.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:38.080]   I could promote this movie and they make much more money.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:40.960]   Bill Gates doesn't care about how many followers he has on Twitter.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.000]   No, it doesn't help Bill Gates, but it helps Justin Bieber.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.880]   Bill Gates doesn't care, but it does help other people.
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:48.480]   You know, last, last time I negotiated with my book deal, I, you know, they offered me
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:50.760]   in advance and I was like, Hey, you know what?
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.840]   And I listed, you know, my Twitter followers, Google plus followers, different.
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:55.320]   And I was like, Oh, okay.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.320]   And I got more money.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:01.040]   I mean, you know, when you have that marketing power, it gives you cloud.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.040]   Yeah, it does.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:05.880]   It's people, people, all the time they mentioned, Oh, this person has 20,000 followers.
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:06.880]   They must be real.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:11.160]   It is really, I think a status symbol within the network.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:12.160]   I can fast.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.840]   I forgot her for worse.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.000]   I had to we had to hand it.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   We have a accreditation.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   What I hear is I had to redo my CV.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   I put it on there.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   What the heck is this?
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   Some monetization.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.400]   It's got a ridiculous, but it's what I did.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.000]   I mean, I felt ridiculous too.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.200]   Was there a minute go shit?
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:29.920]   Like I felt ridiculous because it really because it is so easy to buy and fake and whatever.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:31.360]   But it is, it is a thing.
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:32.360]   It is a thing.
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:35.320]   It's an it's some indication of one's reach.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:37.160]   Except that it's fake.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.880]   Same with likes, like, or meaningless.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:40.880]   Yes.
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:47.320]   I someday we're going to look back at this year and say, what were we smoking?
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.320]   Seriously.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:57.160]   Well, part of this problem, I would argue, is that it's still a mass media mentality.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.160]   Right?
[00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.440]   Look at the metrics that we have in media.
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.800]   It's masses of unique user page views.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.600]   What do they look at that we made?
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.120]   And pretty worthless those metrics.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.240]   And so how many followers do you have?
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.720]   How many likes do you have?
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.720]   So what?
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.720]   But that's the way we measured media.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.720]   That's a very good point.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.960]   And media for all that time.
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:22.520]   And those of us who, like here at Twit, where we pay less attention to broad numbers, but
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:28.800]   more attention to the engagement of the people, we've actually produced results far beyond
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.400]   the numbers that mass media would embrace.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:37.000]   In fact, it's one of the interesting challenges of selling the network is the numbers are
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.280]   low, but the results are high.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.280]   That's quality.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.800]   The other thing is Leo, that basically you, on this show, all your shows, you have what
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.600]   is now being trumpeted elsewhere as native advertising.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.600]   Right?
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:57.400]   When you do a Ting ad and it's you talking it through, it's part of the product, it's
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.400]   part of the thing.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.800]   It's exactly what people are trying to mimic.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.280]   That's so funny.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.600]   And all kinds of other media.
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.960]   Felix Salmon at Reuters had a really, really good piece this week about this and trying
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.360]   to look at whether or not so-called native advertising is scalable.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.520]   And he argues it's not.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:17.680]   But he also wonders whether that matters because if somebody actually reads this thing that
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:22.160]   is on BuzzFeed, how much more viable is that that it happened to be, you know, but near
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.320]   their eyeball for 40 seconds?
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320]   We've scaled it pretty well.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.560]   I don't know how much more we're going to be able to scale it.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:33.880]   Here's a funny picture, Mark Andreessen and of Andreessen Horowitz.
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.720]   And I don't know who these other venture capitalists are all wearing glass.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:43.920]   Mark Andreessen, when he wears glass, looks like he should be on Star Trek or something.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.480]   Yeah, he does.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.920]   The shape of his head is exactly so many.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.480]   He looks like Zippy the pig head.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.760]   This kind of, this rests my case.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.160]   I think the first thing they should invest in is somebody to make glass look less dorky.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.240]   That's John Doar on the right.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.240]   John Doar on the right?
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.240]   Okay.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.760]   So these are big shot venture capitalists.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:10.000]   Yeah, you can say they're really committed to the platform, which they took that portrait.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   That's committed.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   That's how committed they are.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   That's committed.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.160]   I don't see Kevin Rose wearing the glass.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:21.880]   So Google Ventures and recent Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins Cofield and Buyers, an investment
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:22.880]   syndicate.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.560]   They don't say how much money they're throwing into that.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.080]   Yeah, so this could be.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.080]   Yeah, it could be.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.080]   Yeah, it could be.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:33.800]   I'd say it probably meant more when Kleiner Perkins on its own did an iPad fund than others
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.800]   Google Ventures.
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.800]   But still.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:36.800]   Jeff, good news.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.880]   I just did a fake followers check on your Twitter account.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.400]   And you're very good.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.000]   This is, in fact, one of the highest percentages I've ever seen.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.600]   85% good.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.600]   Is that amazing or what?
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:49.600]   And the rest hate me.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.600]   You know what I do?
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.880]   I report spam accounts like mad on Twitter because it is easy enough to do it.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.880]   Yeah, I do too.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:55.800]   Yeah, I do too.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.840]   We have like every once in a while Russians will retweet things from years ago.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:03.880]   Oh, yeah, the Russians were taken over on Twitter like crazy about three weeks ago.
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:04.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.360]   And it was driving me nuts.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.720]   It's like they suddenly discovered Gina.
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.720]   We're still doing it.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.720]   It takes a while.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.840]   It's it's socialbakers.com for the fake follower check.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.840]   I'll do Gina.
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.960]   And when we come back, we'll tell you how fake Gina is.
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.000]   And then I'll do me and then then I'll be all over.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   I know.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   I know.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.680]   I think it's really a matter of the percentage goes up the larger you get.
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.680]   I guess.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.680]   I'm not sure.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:32.480]   Yeah, no, that's fair enough.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.880]   And I think once you're verified, things get really weird because you get on the special
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.280]   Twitter verified list.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:41.960]   And I think that, you know, that the fake, these fake accounts sort of glom onto that
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.680]   list as like, Oh, these are celebrities and big shots.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:45.680]   Right.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.040]   And I'll follow them to make myself look legit, you know, right?
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.160]   It's some weird spammer thing.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.160]   I don't know.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.160]   I never really did understand it.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.360]   Hey, have you tried Hulu Plus yet?
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.360]   Oh, I love Hulu Plus.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.160]   It's a way that you can, it's good.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.560]   It's great for cord cutters, but even for people, in fact, somebody in the chat was
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:03.120]   saying, I just use it as my DVR.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:09.480]   It is a way to watch unlimited instant streaming of your current hit TV shows, your classic
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.280]   series, great movies.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.520]   And it's on almost everything.
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:20.800]   It's on, of course, many smart TVs, but also Blu-ray players gaming consoles, the PS3, the
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.200]   Xbox 360.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.200]   It's on Apple TV.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:27.360]   It's a beautiful Hulu Plus interface, the Roku mobile phones, tablets, and you start
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:31.280]   watching on your Android device and you get home, you start watching on your Roku.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.720]   It's going to pick up right where you left off.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.240]   $7.99 a month with limited advertising.

[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:45.280]   If you go to huluplus.com/twit.

[01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.320]   Yeah, right there.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.320]   Two weeks free.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:04.680]   That's double the normal deal.

[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:12.280]   It should be part of your overall court-cutting strategy, my friends.

[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.440]   All right, Gina.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.960]   Okay, now I'm going to do my fake.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:26.960]   Wait a minute.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.960]   When we got Gina's first, 60% good.
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.960]   Oh, that's low.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.360]   30% fake or empty, 10% inactive.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.760]   No, I'm lower than that though.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.040]   I'm lower than that.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:42.920]   I know I'm almost 50% I think.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.280]   It's really interesting.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:48.560]   Now, I don't know how they, they aren't real clear about how they determine fake followers,
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.560]   but see, you can see these are your fake followers.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.560]   There are a lot of eggs.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.000]   A lot of eggs, yeah.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   That's a giveaway.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.800]   I would love to know how they're doing this because fetching someone's followers is really
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.280]   hard when there are lots of them, right?
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.640]   Yeah, you know about it, right?
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.640]   Yeah, right.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:06.200]   Because if someone has 300,000 followers, 200,000 followers.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.680]   They do a sample.
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.680]   They do a sample.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:09.680]   Yes.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.680]   I think they said that.
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:15.920]   You've got to list the followers, you get about 200 per page and you only get like 15
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.400]   API calls per minute.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.120]   So like, you're limited.
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.120]   It's got to be a sample.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.440]   So then they must parse through that sample.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:23.440]   That makes sense.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.360]   So I wonder if it's a sample of your latest followers?
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.520]   Because that's your favorite part of it.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.720]   No, you wouldn't want to do that either, would you?
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.720]   You wouldn't want to know.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.720]   You wouldn't want to do that.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:33.440]   It would have to be a random sample, which I don't think is too easy with the API off
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.440]   the top.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:38.160]   And if Twitter is clean, if they are pruning, which I think they are doing a pretty great
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.200]   extent, isn't this going to be oscillating?
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:43.720]   Well, I'll tell you because I haven't done mine in months, but the last time I did it,
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:46.360]   I think it was 45% fake.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.360]   I tweeted it.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.360]   I can't remember.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:50.000]   Yeah, it was a really high number.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.520]   But I've been on Twitter a long time.
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.240]   Yeah, and you were like.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.400]   About 400,000 followers.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.600]   So you were the most follower person on Twitter.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:57.600]   Well, why?
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.240]   You know when I was the most followed person on Twitter when you could be that with 5,000
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.240]   followers.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.240]   That sounded amazing.
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:04.240]   That's amazing.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.240]   That's amazing.
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.160]   And then Kevin Rose and I were in a race.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:11.120]   To see who'd be number one.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:15.200]   And then like shortly after that Ashton Kutcher joined it, it was all over.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.480]   Yeah, basically at that point.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.080]   Boom, blew me up.
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:25.000]   Ashton argued, like I know him first behind basis, Kutcher argued on Howard Stern basically
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.160]   that Twitter should have given him more value for this.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:30.640]   Like they should have given him stock for making it.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:36.720]   It should have given me some stock for making it, but no.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.040]   Last year I was Twitter.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.640]   He was year two.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.720]   Actually Gina, it was all Gina's fault.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.720]   So did you see this one?
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:46.800]   I don't know what to make of this.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.240]   This came from an article I saw it on Tech Dirt.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:58.240]   They were referring to an article from, oh, I'm going to find the original link.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.440]   I like to tell people the original link.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:06.680]   It's from Patrick McKay saying that universal music has an unusual deal with YouTube.
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.680]   This is scary.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:18.080]   Yeah, I bother the heck out of me that if you, if they issue a takedown, this is from fairusetube.org.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.360]   That's Patrick's site.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:27.080]   If universal music does a takedown, they don't have to honor counter-noses.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:31.800]   They don't even have to give you the option to appeal.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:34.440]   They just, YouTube just takes it down.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:40.800]   And he quotes an email received by a YouTube user named John.
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:47.160]   His name is YouTube, a Katis Werner Vonnall, Vonnrod, who posts reviews of old vinyl records.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:52.640]   He had a seven-minute video reviewing an old Eric B. and Rekim record from the '80s, most
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:56.880]   of which is him talking about the record, but there are a couple of clips of him playing
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.040]   segments of the record.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.960]   It's his opinion that that's fair use, but that's neither here nor there.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:07.800]   He got an email after YouTube pulled it down from UMG's request.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.800]   Hi there.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.320]   This is from YouTube.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.240]   Thank you for your counter notification.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:15.720]   The complainant has reaffirmed the information in its DMCA notification.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:21.640]   YouTube has a "contractual obligation to this specific copyright owner that prevents
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.880]   us from reinstating videos in such circumstances.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:29.200]   Therefore, we regretfully cannot honor this counter notification."
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.240]   That's that.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:38.320]   And then he points to the help page referenced in the email, which says on YouTube's site,
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:39.840]   nice Python script.
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.600]   "YouTube enters into agreements with certain music copyright owners to allow use of their
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.600]   sound recordings and musical compositions.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.980]   In exchange for this, some of these music copyright owners require us to handle videos
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:57.400]   containing their sound recordings in ways that differ from the usual process on YouTube."
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:02.240]   Under these contracts, we may be required to remove specific videos from the site, block
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:07.520]   specific videos in certain territories, or prevent specific videos from being reinstated
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.120]   after a counter notification.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:15.920]   In some instances, this may mean the content ID, appeals, and/or counter notification process
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.960]   won't even be available in the first place.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:21.240]   There will be no appeal.
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:27.360]   We win, you lose, and even if we're wrong, there's nothing you can do about it.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:32.640]   And it happens to me so often that there are incorrect takedowns.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:39.280]   NBCUniversal, the sister company of this, didn't take down of one of our videos.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.720]   I didn't notice for a long time.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.400]   Had no NBCUniversal content.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.440]   In that case, I appealed, and it was immediately reinstated.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.680]   If it had happened from UMG, it might be there be no appeal at all.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.680]   Gee, that's testable.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.040]   Let's play a UMG song right now, huh?
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.040]   Not on this show.
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.320]   Let's do it on a show with no ads.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:01.200]   Because it costs me money.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.560]   That's scary.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.560]   That's evil.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.440]   Yeah, that's definitely evil.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:13.600]   And if it's true, if this is as exactly as reported.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:14.600]   Well, yeah, it is.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:15.600]   You can see the YouTube page.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.360]   The YouTube page is not some phony page.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:22.720]   I'm reading directly from support.google.com.
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:26.120]   This is to make Siva Varianathan's argument.
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.440]   He argues companies must be evil.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.960]   And I disagree with that.
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:34.080]   But there's a greater truth in it in the sense that Google deals with Verizon, Ergo, Google
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:38.280]   sells its soul on net neutrality, Google deals with music companies, and says, "Please don't
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.880]   sue us," and it sells its soul, it would appear.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.120]   I can't believe that anyone in Google thinks this is a good idea for the customers and what
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.000]   happened with being customer first.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.800]   Well, doesn't it also raise legal issues, for instance?
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.440]   If there is a fair use defense--
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.840]   But Google doesn't have to allow anything to go up or down.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:57.960]   It's not like it's a free speech issue in a constant--
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.080]   No, no, of course not, because they're a private company.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:06.160]   But they might not lose their DMCA harbor status, safe harbor status.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.360]   How so?
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:14.080]   Because the Safe Harbor Clause protects them because they're not a publisher.
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.840]   As long as they adhere to the DMCA takedown process.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:18.840]   Oh, I see.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:20.800]   So if they don't do appeals.
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:24.920]   If they don't adhere-- now I'm no lawyer, we got to get Neil Eipatel or somebody to explain
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:25.920]   this.
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:32.000]   But I wonder, and maybe not, but I wonder, would this not impact the thing that protects
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.920]   you in the DMCA if you don't honor the DMCA takedown process exactly as specified?
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.400]   Now maybe it doesn't specify that there should be an appeal process.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:41.720]   Well, that's what I'm asking.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.960]   Is there a chat room?
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:47.040]   Is there an appeal process mandated under DMCA?
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.040]   An interesting question.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.040]   Wait for the answer.
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.040]   I think there has to be.
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.080]   No, I'm not sure there is at all.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:55.040]   The point is that you mitigated your liability if you took it down.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:56.040]   Right.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.040]   That's the DMCA process.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.040]   I think the appeals process--
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:02.960]   As long as you make it easy to take it down, who cares?
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:03.960]   Right.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:04.960]   If it's real.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   That's the issue.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:08.560]   We get takedowns all the time from like Brazilian broadcasters and stuff.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.560]   I don't understand.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:16.360]   DMCA says you have the right to safe harbor as long as you don't exercise editorial control.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.080]   You're a vessel.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.480]   I'm not so sure that's true on it.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:24.280]   That's a leftover of the probably whoever El Caliph is saying.
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.840]   And there's a lawyer.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:32.560]   But there's this commonly held belief out there from an old prodigy case, which the DMC
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.360]   was actually the answer to.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:39.320]   The original prodigy case, if you didn't touch any content, you were safer than if you once
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:42.360]   you made an internal control, then you became more liable.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.360]   And Congress in a rare moment of wisdom realized how wrong that was going to be.
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:49.720]   Because what would mean is no one would ever touch any content and they would just all
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:51.600]   leave crap up.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:58.400]   So they had to leave the ability for you to take crap down and not suffer.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.360]   They also had to leave the ability for you to have interactivity and have people put content
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.760]   up without you suffering.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.440]   And that's where Section 230 came in.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.200]   And that's where the DMCA tearout is.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:14.000]   So it was actually an answer to that idea that if you touch it, you lose.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.040]   That was what this was to cure.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.360]   I'm pissed off at Google because we're trying to hire people who live in Austin and they're
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:24.240]   never going to move to Petaloma now.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.240]   Google fiber.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:31.040]   It's official next stop, Austin, Texas for that gigabit fiber and AT&T says, yeah,
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.640]   we're going to do that too.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:33.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.720]   I don't know how much they'll charge.
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:36.720]   That's good.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.120]   That's exactly what you want, right?
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.120]   Competition.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:40.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.120]   Yes.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.120]   So our good friend.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.120]   It's just not fair.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.640]   Austin, Texas already has Southwest.
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:46.720]   It has good weather.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.720]   It has good burritos.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.400]   In fact, I think we're going to move this whole channel to Austin, Texas.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.400]   Let's do it.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.400]   I do it.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.400]   I do it.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.400]   The twos for everybody.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:56.400]   Sorry, Chad.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.400]   I interrupted you.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:03.800]   No, I just wanted to mention your friend in ours, Brian Brushwood lives four miles outside
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:09.440]   of the zone.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:10.920]   My evil plan.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:15.920]   But have you now, then he may be able to get AT&T fiber.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:19.160]   Well, AT&T, they didn't say there was going to be consumer or business with the story
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.160]   I saw.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.360]   AT&T just rushed to say, well, we can do this.
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.360]   Sure.
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:25.360]   But they can.
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:28.360]   I mean, I could buy gigabit fiber right now if I'm willing to pay a million dollars.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.240]   We know we didn't do, but we need to do.
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.240]   That's right.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:36.160]   We're going to lose Gina in eight minutes or something.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.160]   No.
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:42.800]   By the way, Brewster Kale coming up and triangulation, the man in charge of the Internet Archive,
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:44.960]   the guy who founded it.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.200]   Really interesting character.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:52.920]   But right now, it's time to play the trumpets and get ready for the Google change log.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:56.040]   The Google change log.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:04.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, with the Google change log, Gina Trapani.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.240]   We mentioned this a little bit earlier, but I wanted to bring it up again.
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:14.120]   There's Google Play Store, a total new redesign rolling out to Android phones right now.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:18.840]   It's got huge, beautiful images, huge icons, continuous scrolling.
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.360]   It looks amazing on a tablet.
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.560]   It's kind of like the best of the best kind of hollow treatment that you're ever going
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:27.600]   to see simplify purchasing process.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:32.080]   Start rolling out yesterday to Android phones and tablets running Froyo and above.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.000]   You should get it in the next few weeks.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.080]   If you can't wait, you can find an APK kind of floating around.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:42.040]   I believe it was Android police that maybe published links if you're feeling like taking
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.040]   a risk.
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:44.040]   I did it.
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.680]   I got it where that APK worked just fine.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.040]   It looks really, really nice.
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.320]   So new Google Play Store coming to Android.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:55.720]   A couple iOS updates as well.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:56.600]   Chrome 26 has dropped for iOS, the stable version.
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:01.200]   I guess there are a couple of security fixes, a little speedier, but the big new feature
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:06.920]   it has is that it lets you save any page reviewing as a PDF and stores it in Google Drive,
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:07.920]   which is super handy.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:11.960]   It also has built-in support for Google's cloud print service.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:16.280]   You can print directly from Chrome, on iPhone or iPad.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:20.920]   All these things making the pixel yet more valuable, wouldn't you say, Gina?
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.640]   I would say, because you can get those PDFs anywhere, anywhere you're logged into Chrome.
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:26.640]   That's right.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.640]   Chrome OS or not.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:31.440]   Also, we had an updated iOS app for Google Drive.
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:35.080]   Things just load faster, give you quicker access to editing.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:40.560]   And if you're actually editing Google Drive documents on your iPhone, you can rotate sideways
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:44.880]   and edit in landscape mode down that this new update.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:49.520]   And finally, Google Play Music has expanded to seven more countries.
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:56.360]   This is the Android app and on the web, Google Play Music hitting Austria, Australia, Belgium,
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:00.560]   Ireland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, and Portugal.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:03.960]   It's dropped to 20,000 songs on Google Play for free and streaming your devices for instant
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:04.960]   listening everywhere.
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:09.040]   I have to say, I've been using Google Play a lot more lately and I love it.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.120]   So happy to see that it's moving beyond the US.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.440]   What do you mean by music on Play?
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.360]   I have actually been using it just to listen to music on my phone a lot more, instead of
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:25.600]   kind of syncing the day I uploaded everything.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:28.800]   I just uploaded everything exactly before I get on the plane or whatever.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:33.880]   I pin the songs that I want available offline or I just listen while I'm all about.
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.720]   And I just find myself instead of firing up iTunes or my big old library sitting on my
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:41.920]   hard drive, I just listen to Google Play even when I'm at my desktop.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:42.920]   I've been using Google.com.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:43.920]   Say again?
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.920]   I've been using it for TV shows like crazy.
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:50.960]   I've been traveling like a madman to India and Amsterdam and London next week.
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:57.400]   And I just I've been watching Walking Dead and Breaking Bad and all these things on my
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.920]   Nexus 7 and it's really just wonderful.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:03.760]   Yeah, I have to say, I tried out that knowledge graph, that little knowledge graph feature
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.800]   that we talked about last week in the changelog where you can pause a movie.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.960]   I was actually just looking at Transformers because they gave us, they gave us Transformers
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.920]   last year at Google I/O in the Nexus 7.
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:12.920]   It was a really cool feature.
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:17.240]   I was like, "Oh, I'm definitely going to buy more video from the Play Store because I just
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.720]   like that I can say, 'Hey, what song is this?
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:19.720]   What actor is this?
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:20.720]   What else is this?"
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:26.040]   The problem they have still is there's a limited movie selection isn't as good as Apple.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.040]   Right.
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.040]   The TV selection.
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.040]   The TV selection is good.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.040]   The TV selection is good.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.960]   This is a case where you're going to use something like Hulu to watch more stuff because
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.040]   there's simply more stuff there.
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:41.960]   But when you're on a plane and like me, I fly on United so I don't get any access.
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.120]   But I've got tons of stuff on this thing and it's great.
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.680]   Right, yeah, yeah.
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:49.320]   That's all I got today for the changelog.
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:51.320]   [Singing]
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.640]   Chad, where's the timponies?
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:58.520]   You usually say and that's the Google change log.
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.320]   I'm sorry, I didn't give you the cue.
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:01.320]   It's my fault.
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:02.320]   My fault.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:06.960]   I'm going to start boom, boom, boom, boom at Chesapeake.
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:13.080]   By the way, Jeff, if this makes you feel any better, some strange person named Zach Koomer
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:19.760]   or Kumber on CNN has given a rave review to the Chromebook Pixel just came out.
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:20.760]   A rave review.
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.760]   That's not talking about the Pixel anymore.
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:25.120]   A rave review, he says.
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:28.760]   He says, "With the Pixel, I'm totally on cloud nine.
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:32.640]   If you're looking for a speedy sturdy machine and are comfortable living in the cloud, the
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.920]   Pixel may be for you.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:38.360]   Overall, I found this computer to be a refreshing approach to computing in the cloud thanks
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:41.240]   to his high def screen and wicked fast computer power.
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.160]   I'm on the left with a Pixel.
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.160]   You should have Jeff rant and Leo whine.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:49.560]   Thoroughly changed my thinking on how a computer should behave while handling my files.
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:54.200]   He does say he's not crazy about battery life, which was terrible.
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.760]   Charging port gets unhinged with the accident and pull the wire.
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.480]   I'm not sure I have that problem.
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.280]   He doesn't like the fan noise.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:05.080]   I'm wondering if Zach's ever used a computer to be honest with you, but okay.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:06.080]   It's kind of fan.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:10.840]   Well, I got spoiled by the $249 Chromebook with no fan.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:13.360]   It was quite lovely to never have noise come out of it.
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.600]   You're going to have anything with an i5 in it.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:16.600]   You're going to have a fan.
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:17.600]   Yeah, and I got a fan.
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:18.600]   I don't like it either.
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:22.240]   And an i5 is not wicked fast, but it's okay.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.240]   Nothing wrong with it.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.800]   You got to have the last word, don't you?
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.840]   You just got to try this.
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:30.880]   He says up to now, Chrome OS computers have been inexpensive and fast, but Google has
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:34.360]   done something unexpected with the new Chromebook Pixel.
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:40.560]   I don't know who this guy is though, so I don't know if I can trust him.
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:45.280]   I'm just, I read that so you'd see that you're not alone, Jeff.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:50.240]   You and Vance and this guy, Zach, all of it.
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.640]   We're going to get a room.
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.640]   Get a room, you guys.
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.960]   Let's see.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.760]   What else here?
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:01.760]   What do you guys think of the news corp and now CBS threatened to pull their networks
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:06.120]   off because of area.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.400]   Speaking of whining, they need the Leo whining.
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:14.000]   So apparently they're unclear on the concept of free over the air broadcast television.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.880]   Well, but here's the problem.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:22.560]   When networks were forced to pay to get carried, I mean, when cable was forced to pay to carry
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:26.520]   networks, sorry, retransmission fees.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.000]   But right there was ripping off every one of us in the country.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   There are airways.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.560]   We give it to them for free and in return, we get programming.
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:34.880]   That was the deal.
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.760]   And then a long comes cable is who wants no fear.
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.080]   Cable is making money.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.880]   So whether it's a charge cable, but they're not charging cable, they're charging us.
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:41.880]   The viewers.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.880]   Right.
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:46.280]   So if you still want to watch free over the air, there's only a last I checked about 12%
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:48.200]   of Americans still watch TV over a revenue.
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:55.240]   And by the way, those are often poor people and old people and CBS and Fox and NBC are
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.720]   trying to screw poor and old people.
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:01.480]   And they say they want to pull off programs and put them behind the table, which by the
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:03.080]   way, what are they going to put on?
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:06.240]   Worse shows, even worse shows on their networks.
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.920]   Don't they in fact have advertising on those shows?
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.760]   I mean, are they not making money?
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:13.400]   It's it's yeah, I don't get it.
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.120]   It's advertising is the business model, right?
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.120]   Well, he wants distribution.
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.080]   Well, no, that's the point.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:22.280]   It's just like newspapers now with so much competition with so many other issues.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.000]   No, they're counting on two revenue streams.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.640]   They are they are now very dependent, very dependent on this new revenue stream.
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:32.320]   New York Times is more dependent on consumer on circulation revenue now than it ever has
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:37.280]   been networks are now getting networks and local stations are now getting fees, consumer
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.920]   fees they never got before.
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:39.920]   Right.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.080]   So no, they're they're it's not it's not the majority of the revenue, but they're dependent
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:44.080]   on it.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.080]   Mm.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:50.200]   So just to recap, Ariel, A-E-R-E-O dot com, a Barry Diller company puts in antenna, a
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:55.400]   little tiny dime sized antenna for each and every person who subscribes up in the city
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.320]   you subscribe to.
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:01.680]   And then you can get over the air television over the internet.
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:06.200]   Of course, it's only available in New York City right now, but soon expanding to 22 cities.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.720]   They want a big court case recently.
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:08.880]   So they're expanding to other cities.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.880]   I thought it was silly.
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:13.960]   I don't care about broadcast TV, but now I'm so pissed at these stupid networks.
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:16.040]   A, I'm going to I want to subscribe to Ariel.
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:17.240]   I'm really going to do it.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:22.440]   And be full on FCC, take back our airwaves.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:24.640]   We can make much better use that spectrum.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.440]   Only 12% of Americans watch the stuff.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:31.000]   If we had a subsidy for internet connections for those people over the end of broadcast,
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   we don't need broadcast.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.040]   What happens if Fox and CBS go cable only?
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:37.040]   What does that mean?
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.040]   How do they do that?
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:39.040]   They still have broadcast channels.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.480]   They still have to fill them.
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:41.480]   So like I said, they have a license.
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:42.480]   They have a license.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:45.080]   They have a worse crap on them.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:48.480]   So what do they do with their broadcast licenses?
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.480]   This is pure bluff.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.480]   There's no way they do it.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:51.480]   They can't.
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:52.960]   They can't do it.
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.360]   But it's an interesting thought.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.360]   This is just bluster.
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:01.800]   You're going to pay for the Mindy project.
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:04.360]   Some people would pay for the Mindy project.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.400]   Mindy and her mom.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.400]   Mindy Kaling.
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:09.320]   No, there's people like that show.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:14.160]   There's a lot of stuff on broadcast television that's not well, you can get it on Hulu.
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:15.160]   That's your pixel argument.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:16.160]   Well, some people.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:17.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.800]   Yeah, maybe it is.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.080]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.880]   CBS is the pixel network.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.080]   Not the, not the.
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:24.080]   Not the Tiffany network.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:25.080]   Not the Tiffany network.
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.080]   They're the pixel network.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:33.840]   Do you know, good gossip, Neil Mowin, the Google's $100 million man worth reading.
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:37.720]   I don't know how accurate it is in business insider.
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:44.120]   The story was, and I think it's pure gossip that when Twitter tired, tried to hire or
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:50.920]   away, Neil Mowin, who came to Google through the double click acquisition that Google wrote
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:54.680]   him a check for $100 million cash.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.000]   And it was a cash or was it stock?
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.560]   It was stock because it's now worth $150.
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:00.560]   Yeah, it's worth $150.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:01.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:04.200]   Now it's gossip.
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.200]   But according.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.400]   It's a little suspicious of anything in business insider.
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.600]   But anyway, yeah, I agree.
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:18.880]   Rose and Blatt, the former CEO of double click and Google executive who joined Twitter's
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:25.280]   board in 2010, tried to hire Niro and he was told that Google made Neil an offer much
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:30.640]   richer than the one the nicks had just given Carmelo Anthony and they paid him $65 million
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:31.640]   over three years.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:36.640]   I think that crunch later said it was $100 million in stock.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:42.400]   But Mowin's worth it apparently because apparently he's brilliant at advertising.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.120]   You always pay sales people.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:45.560]   Pay the people who make the money.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:46.560]   Yep.
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.560]   And I'm sure he makes Google.
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:51.840]   In fact, we know he makes Google more money than he costs them.
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:58.040]   He runs the display advertising business for Google and of course that's the core business.
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.520]   It's a good gossipy article.
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:07.760]   Somebody said we need to bring a Valley WAG back because I think it was some others.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.720]   Alexia Sotsas or somebody said we need Valley WAG because there's nowhere to put the good
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:13.320]   gossipy stories like that.
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:16.360]   We get business inside.
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:21.040]   We should have Henry Blodgett who runs Business Insider on the show.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:23.240]   I'm fascinated by him.
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.240]   I am too.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:27.960]   I'm not sure I admire him, but I'm fascinated by him.
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:33.000]   He's controversial in general circles because he had a scandal as an analyst back in the
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000]   day.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.160]   But Henry is doing amazing work I think.
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:38.040]   He got thrown out of the markets by the SEC.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:45.920]   They said you can no longer be an analyst because you jiggered the game and he then created
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.920]   this very successful entity.
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:52.080]   Apparently they're all standing up all the time running around filing like crazy.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:56.480]   I'd love to just go look at the Business Insider offices and watch them work.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.480]   And who owns them now?
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:58.480]   Who bought them?
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:59.480]   No, nobody bought them.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:02.760]   He just got a $5 million investment from Jeff Bezos.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.760]   That's what it was.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:07.880]   Bezos just put some money into it.
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:12.200]   It just shows, you know, this is the beauty of blogging.
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:16.200]   Anybody, you know, and I guess you could say new media.
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.200]   Anybody can do it.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:25.680]   And if you've got the energy, the stamina, the ambition, the guts, you can do quite well.
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:27.040]   I think got ValiWag still around.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.040]   I think it's just a sort of subset of Gawker.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.640]   Yeah, they still do the occasional ValiWag E stories.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:34.200]   Yeah, they pursued the Arington story, didn't they?
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.000]   I thought they were really common.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.880]   You know, I have stayed well away from that story.
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.840]   I have no idea what the truth is in that matter.
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.600]   And I don't want to malign anybody.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.600]   I agree.
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:45.600]   I agree.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.600]   Fair enough.
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:47.600]   Fair enough.
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:48.600]   I just, you know, but you're right.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:49.600]   That's exactly.
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:50.600]   I'm sure, you know, Alexia wrote that story.
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:57.680]   I think in TechCrunch, maybe not, but that is a perfect example of quite some time actually,
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:58.680]   to actually write about it.
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:02.240]   I thought that that's what ValiWag was doing saying why is anybody else writing about it.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:03.920]   Alexia actually finally write.
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:06.120]   TechCrunch finally had to say something.
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:09.440]   And I think it was weird that they didn't for so long.
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:10.440]   I know.
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.680]   And Mike said something as well.
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:14.920]   But Mike finally said something after TechCrunch said something, right?
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:15.920]   Okay.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:16.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:17.920]   So people can ignore ValiWag.
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.520]   I, you know, I don't know what we're talking about.
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:22.520]   Just go look it up.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:23.520]   We don't really want to do it.
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:28.040]   You don't want to just forget it's some, it's hard to even know what happened.
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:29.040]   It's gossip.
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:31.760]   It's very gossipy.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.000]   Very, very gossipy.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.520]   I think we should take a break and come back with our tools, our tips, our number.
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:41.800]   I can't, any other big stories I'm missing here that you guys, I think, you know, I
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:44.880]   think it's basically about, you know, one of your many, many talents is I'll think,
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:48.120]   man, we're taking forever to go on the rundown and all the, you've hit all the high points.
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:49.120]   You better do it.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:51.120]   Oh, come on.
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.920]   No time to make up with me now.
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:53.920]   No stories.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:56.760]   No, you're the one who wants to make up with me, fella.
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:58.160]   Oh, I was wrong.
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.160]   Oh, I was wrong.
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.160]   Okay.
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:02.160]   Okay.
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:08.600]   I'm glad Arthur Froemer got the Froemer brand back from Google, by the way.
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:12.080]   I didn't know that that's who bought it from Google, but I'm glad that they got, he got
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:13.080]   his brand back.
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:14.080]   That's cool.
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:19.640]   He must be a hundred years old, but Google kept the social accounts.
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:20.640]   That's fine.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:21.640]   Yeah.
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:25.200]   He's going to start publishing from his guides again.
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:26.200]   So happy.
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:27.200]   He's 83.
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:28.200]   Wow.
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.920]   Good for you, Arthur.
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:34.680]   Right on his daughter Pauline is involved, I guess.
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:35.680]   Right on.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.680]   I lived on those from her skides.
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:39.680]   We talked about that, didn't we?
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:43.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.280]   Did we mention Blink?
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.360]   We talked about Blink last week.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:47.360]   Last week?
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:48.360]   Okay.
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.200]   No need to talk about this week.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.800]   All right.
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:53.800]   Let us move along.
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:58.920]   You want to really quickly show Seregaise April 1st joke?
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:30:59.920]   I love that.
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:00.920]   The bat was a...
[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:02.920]   Now they played it on him.
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:06.920]   Yeah, that's the only thing that makes it forgivable because I saw the image and thought
[01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:10.120]   that was just his car, but that was when April Fool's joke and his staff.
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:13.800]   So he owns a Tesla S. Oh no, he owns it.
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:14.800]   He owns it.
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:16.920]   Yeah, that's a sedan.
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:23.720]   And without his knowledge, apparently, his staff wrapped it in pink, added a Batman logo,
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:31.560]   added very cool Batman wheels, aluminum wheels, and little Batman wings on the back.
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:35.720]   Imagine him coming out the door at the end of the day.
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:39.840]   And the model asked that he drove in that looked completely normal in the morning suddenly
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:43.240]   looks like a pink batmobile.
[01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:45.000]   I like the little chrome logo on the wheels.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000]   That's my favorite one.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000]   That is very cool.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000]   On the hubcaps.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000]   But it...
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000]   That is a great April Fool.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.520]   I'll show you though that the April Fool's culture at Google is really out of control.
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.520]   Fuck.
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:56.520]   It's...
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:57.520]   Get back to work!
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:00.640]   We had a lot of time in our hands.
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:03.160]   I love it.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.160]   I just...
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:05.440]   I think that's so cool.
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:08.200]   Chrome logos.
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.200]   That's the expensive part.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:10.200]   The rest is just...
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:11.200]   You know, it's funny.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.200]   I wonder...
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:15.160]   I'd like to see you before and after because his rims may have just been that.
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:16.160]   Do you think you had chrome logos?
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:17.320]   No, they said they were big ones.
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:18.320]   They were big ones.
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:19.320]   Oh, really?
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.320]   I love it.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:22.320]   Maybe a little much of blurry had chrome rims.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:25.440]   Well, this is the guy who said looking at a phone zoom mask relating.
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:27.440]   Now, this is a mask relating.
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.600]   A big batmobile.
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.440]   That's a mask relating.
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:34.440]   It's Robin's car.
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:41.000]   I showed you today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.560]   LegalZoom is not a law firm.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.440]   No, LegalZoom is better than that.
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:48.440]   LegalZoom helps you do your legal business at your direction.
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:55.720]   They walk you through very easy to answer questions, generate documents like wills, patents, trademarks,
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:59.320]   and the big ones, the incorporation papers and the LLC papers.
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:02.760]   If you're thinking, "Oh, no, I can't trust my company to an LLC.
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:03.920]   I did without a lawyer."
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:04.920]   Yes, I did.
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:05.920]   It worked great.
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:10.240]   $99 plus the state filing fee and you got an LLC.
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:12.880]   If you're starting a business, protect yourself.
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:15.880]   I understand when you're starting a business, you don't have the money for the white shoe
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:17.200]   law firm.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:25.280]   You have $99 for an LLC or an incorporation S-corp or a C-corp, trademark, you can do
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:27.320]   a last-will in testament for $69.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:30.960]   If you don't do a last-will, the state decides what happens to your kids, what happens to
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:31.960]   your finances.
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:34.120]   Really, this is the way to do it.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:36.880]   By the way, this is a new feature of LegalZoom.
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:37.880]   I love it.
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:42.200]   They have now a legal plan that lets you connect with an attorney and get advice.
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.600]   It's not unusual.
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:48.360]   I came up with a couple of questions as I'm answering the form, filling out the form.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:50.720]   Delaware, California, for instance, that was a question.
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:54.720]   It would have been great to call a LegalZoom legal plan attorney.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:55.880]   They have fixed rates.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:00.120]   It's a low fee and they give you the answers and you can move on.
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.320]   It's really fantastic.
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:05.360]   You can even read reviews and profiles of the attorneys before you use them.
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:07.920]   You get the one that you really like.
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:12.800]   In the past 12 years, over 2 million Americans have used LegalZoom for LLCs and wills and
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.880]   trusts and trademarks and more.
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:17.120]   You can, too, start your business.
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:20.120]   Protect your family at legalzoom.com.
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:26.400]   Now, we'll offer self-help services at your specific direction or speak to a legal plan
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:29.280]   attorney and get your questions answered and get on going advice.
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:34.480]   To receive a special thank you for using LegalZoom through Twit, we invite you to use the offer

[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:51.480]   the offer code TWIG.
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:52.480]   It really is.
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:55.160]   I can't recommend it more highly.
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:00.440]   You need this kind of protection nowadays, but it's easy and it's fast and it's very
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:01.440]   affordable.
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:02.440]   LegalZoom.com.
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:08.080]   Time now, ladies and gentlemen, for Gina Trapani's Tip of the Week.
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:12.760]   I am going to dash right after this, but I wanted to mention, think I've got accepted
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.680]   into Google Summer of Code.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:16.560]   This is my Tip of the Week, Google Summer of Code.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:19.400]   This is for a awesome program for college students.
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:20.680]   I don't think just undergraduates.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.920]   I think graduate's PhDs count as well.
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:27.720]   It's kind of basically the best summer job that you can get as a student programmer.
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:33.080]   Essentially, Google pays you $5,000 to hack on an open source project for the summer for
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:37.200]   three months and you get actually assigned a mentor from the open source project.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:40.320]   There are some great projects that were accepted.
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:42.840]   In fact, I'm really thrilled that we got accepted.
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:47.240]   We're in there with the likes of Twitter and WordPress and Mozilla.
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:49.800]   I mean, great, really, really great open source projects.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:51.920]   There's 177 there that you can choose from.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:53.240]   Anyway, we got accepted.
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:57.120]   I hope you'll check us out at blog.thinkup.com if you're interested in contributing to our
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:58.720]   project or another project.
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:03.840]   It's a fantastic program and student applications open on April 22nd, but between now and then
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:07.320]   you should be doing your research and seeing what kind of projects are available for these
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.520]   different organizations.
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:12.880]   You get paid pretty good money for a really great summer job.
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:13.960]   In fact, we did this.
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:14.960]   The competition is stiff.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:19.280]   We applied two years ago and we didn't get accepted, but we did get accepted in 2010.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:23.840]   We mentored two students and one of them was based in India at the time.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.400]   He has since landed job at Facebook and moved to the United States.
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.560]   It's a really great resume builder and an awesome summer job.
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:30.560]   Do they?
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:33.600]   Do the students get to pick the project and do this?
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.920]   Do the project get to pick the students or you assign it?
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:41.600]   So students apply to as many organizations as they want and propose a project that they
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.000]   want to work on.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.080]   Then the projects say, "Okay, yes, we have a mentor who wants to work with you on this."
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:49.040]   They say, "Okay, yes, we want these students."
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.400]   Then Google helps match them up.
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.960]   Google has a system doing this called Milange.
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:56.560]   It's google-malange.com, which is the whole system.
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:59.520]   You just Google Google Summer Code 2013.
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:03.800]   Students can apply for several different organizations, but they have to propose a specific project
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:06.000]   that they want to get done by the end of the summer.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.440]   You don't get paid unless you're done.
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:08.920]   There are midterm grades.
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:11.000]   It's basically a full-time job.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.240]   Your mentor grades you get paid in increments over the summer.
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:17.840]   If you disappear, you basically got to ship something.
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:24.160]   Both of our mentees ship huge features or installation wizard and our maps plugin that
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:28.720]   are still huge parts of the software today, three years later.
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:32.720]   With a smaller project like ThinkUp, you can have a really big impact.
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:36.960]   With a larger project, you might get more experience or there might be more mentors.
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:41.520]   It's up to you, see what kind of organization you want to work with.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:44.920]   It's a fantastic program and we're really thrilled that we're in it this summer.
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:46.920]   I'm excited to mentor someone this summer.
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:47.920]   Congratulations.
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:48.920]   That's fantastic.
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:49.920]   Thank you.
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:50.920]   Thank you.
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:51.920]   I'm going to run Lee.
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:52.920]   I'm going to see you guys.
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:53.920]   Thanks, Gina.
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:54.920]   Sorry to keep you a little longer than me.
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:55.920]   No problem.
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:56.920]   Take care.
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:57.920]   I'll pay the overtime to the babysitter.
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:58.920]   Take care.
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:03.920]   Gina Tarpani, smarterware.org.
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:07.600]   That's her blog and of course ThinkUp.com is her app.
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:08.600]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:09.600]   Mommy.
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:10.600]   A number and money.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:12.040]   A number of money I said.
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:14.320]   A mummy and a mummy.
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:18.840]   So Fast Company's design site has six ways Google hacks its cafeterias.
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:23.440]   One of these I think I've heard, which is that they used to have M&M's, you know, hanging
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:25.320]   in these clear dispensers.
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.840]   They got rid of that.
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:27.840]   Now there's hard candies.
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:29.400]   You got to work at the candy.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.480]   You know, pay containers, but you have to reach in.
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:32.520]   You have to go on an effort.
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:36.520]   It reduced the weekly caloric intake of candy by 9%.
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:37.520]   Wow.
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:38.920]   That's cool.
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:42.960]   They also make desserts in small three bite portions.
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:43.960]   Good.
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:46.960]   So you have one, but it would be really big ish to go back and get two.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:49.160]   But I like this one.
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:53.880]   When I was last there, or there are more of the times, I wanted a bottle of water and
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:56.800]   I don't know, you can't get a bottle of water at the time because there was a recycling
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:57.800]   issue.
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:58.800]   People were wasting it only other things.
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:02.280]   I guess that's changed because according to this, they found that people were having
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:03.280]   too much soda.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:04.800]   Hello, Mayor Bloomberg.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:08.120]   So they moved the bottle water to eye level in the cooler.
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:15.240]   The soda has moved to the bottom and the shift in placement increased water intake by 47%
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:18.600]   dropping calories from drinks by 7%.
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:21.240]   Only Google would do data driven dining.
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:22.240]   Bingo.
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:25.280]   I love it.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:26.960]   We got to do that in the Twit cafeteria.
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:28.280]   We go through quite a bit of soda.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:32.320]   We go through a lot of soda, but we don't really have eye level refrigerators.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.320]   No.
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:34.320]   They're all on the ground.
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.320]   They're all down there.
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:37.640]   And we do have a water cooler.
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:38.640]   You can drink.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.520]   It's actually pretty easy to get to the water cooler.
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:42.040]   It's easier to get water here.
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:43.040]   It is.
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:44.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:45.240]   I'll vouch for that.
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:46.240]   Or coffee.
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:47.320]   Easy to get coffee too.
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:48.640]   That's because Jamerby brings it to me.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:50.560]   Does he bring it to you too?
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:51.560]   I don't drink coffee.
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:52.560]   I can't.
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:56.560]   But John does bring me anything that I need.
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:58.800]   We also have a soft serve ice cream machine.
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:39:59.800]   That's true.
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:01.960]   Hey, I didn't see that when I was there.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:02.960]   No, that's new.
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:03.960]   It's new.
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:04.960]   Two days old.
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:05.960]   We added that yesterday.
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:08.480]   And we have for some reason Lieutenant Urua serves you.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:10.480]   It's really cool.
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:11.480]   Jeff Jarvis.
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:13.640]   You did a caloric analysis.
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:15.760]   Oh, I don't even want to know.
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:19.720]   And people bring us the sad thing is people bring us sweets all the time.
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.800]   Pies, cakes, donuts.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:24.800]   Yesterday we had chocolate covered blueberries.
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:27.480]   Those are good from Saskatoon.
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:29.720]   Oh, you didn't share.
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:30.800]   Well, I would.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:34.120]   Should I mail you a blueberry?
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:39.720]   You know, today a guy came in with Icelandic yogurt.
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:42.280]   Samari, samariorganics.com.
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:43.640]   It actually was really good.
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:44.640]   That was my lunch.
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:46.600]   I want the name.
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:51.320]   It's very high protein, low carb, low fat delicious.
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:57.440]   Didn't know this, but Icelandic yogurt is thicker than even Greek yogurt because they
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:01.320]   take out the waters or whatever the liquids.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.320]   It's big.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.320]   It's a bit of a smart.
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:04.320]   It's way off topic.
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:08.680]   When I was in Amsterdam, I had to make up.
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:12.120]   My favorite thing is make up there is schmink.
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:13.120]   Schmink.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:14.120]   I love that.
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:15.120]   Go to schmink.
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:16.120]   It's time to go to schmink.
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:17.640]   If you get your schmink on.
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:19.440]   Get your schmink done.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:22.320]   Jeff, let's kiss and make up.
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:24.360]   Will you and me with schmink?
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:25.600]   You get your pixel.
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:27.920]   No, he says no.
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:28.920]   I was wrong.
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:29.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:30.920]   It's the only thing.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:31.920]   It's just too amused.
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:36.120]   I've got too many tweets saying this is great.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:37.120]   Let me say it.
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.120]   Let me be clear.
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:42.240]   I do not like the current world where people say fight, fight.
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.720]   I know.
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:47.960]   There's another piece I didn't do in the number of the week is somewhere in here that it says
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:53.800]   that we're a ruler, that the fifth of people have given up friendships because of an encounter
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:54.800]   online.
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:56.360]   Leo and I love each other.
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.360]   Yes, we do.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.360]   We're getting room.
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:41:59.360]   We're happy.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:03.400]   He has to sleep on the couch tonight, but otherwise we'll be fine.
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:04.880]   But he's wrong with the Pixel.
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:07.320]   And Harry Blodgett retweeted.
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:09.840]   He said, say hi for me.
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:11.080]   Well, he did.
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:12.080]   Cool.
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:17.200]   So, financial acrobat tweeted him and Harry Blodgett said, oh, they're talking about me.
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:19.480]   We'll say, tell him hi.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:24.280]   I'm busy filing three stories right now, right now.
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.280]   Thank you everybody for joining us.

[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:37.960]   We love it.
