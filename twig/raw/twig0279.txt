[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.800]   I am.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.300]   Thank you so much, Jason, for filling in for me.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.200]   I appreciate it.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.600]   You did a great job, by the way.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.400]   Well, thank you.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.900]   I particularly enjoyed that phone call to Google Help.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.800]   That's awesome.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.200]   The best things happen when you don't expect that they're going to happen.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.900]   You never know.
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.600]   You just pull up the app to show it off and suddenly you're talking to Google.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.900]   There you go.
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.400]   Oh, hi.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.200]   That was a lot of fun.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.000]   I had such a blast hanging out with everybody.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.800]   You know what's nice for me is I know that if next time I have a bad clam,
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.700]   I've got somebody who could fill in.
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.000]   I'm here for you.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Jeff Jarvis is also here, the professor of journalism at CUNY,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.900]   the City University of New York.
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.200]   He is the awesomest.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.000]   We appreciate all of our hosts.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.800]   We have such a great team on this show.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   I love this show.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.100]   We appreciate being here.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.000]   Do you want to see some ads?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.300]   Should we kick off with a Moto 360 ad?
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.300]   Yeah, why not?
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.000]   We're all wearing Moto 360s.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.600]   Aren't we, Gina?
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.100]   Do you wear one?
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.700]   I know everybody.
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.400]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.800]   I think there's a kind of a consensus in the group among which smartwatch,
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.500]   at least until Apple does theirs.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.000]   Here's the new ads.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.800]   It just came out.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.700]   Pah.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.600]   What we can.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.500]   Oh, system update.
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.200]   Oh, Gina just got a system.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.300]   You got a system update to which.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.300]   Style.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.000]   This might be the wear update.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.800]   Oh, nice.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   Excellent.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.800]   Oh, a charger battery.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   It does.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.400]   I hate it when that happens.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.300]   So this is the fashion ad, right?
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.100]   To make you think that this is a fashion forward watch, which I guess of all the watches
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.100]   it looks the best.
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.100]   Now what's going on here?
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.600]   Somebody.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   There's a few different ads.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   Read over the driver.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   Did it pause?
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.600]   Oh, it paused.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.600]   I just thought this was a very slow ad.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   No, that's the same one.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.600]   That's the same one.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   Let me get out of this.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   So let's go to the web page.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   Go to the web page.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.400]   Yeah, yeah, there's more.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   Okay.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   Stop.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.960]   You two can wear expensive suits.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.960]   Stop.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.200]   It's coffee shops.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.120]   This is from creativity online.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.640]   The businessman won.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.720]   All right.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.720]   What else?
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.720]   The low-chewy type.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.680]   There's more down here.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.680]   Yes, roll.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.680]   No, no, no, no.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.680]   Too far.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.520]   No, golf.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.520]   Too far.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.520]   Moto 360 Golf.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.360]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.360]   Okay.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.160]   Oh, what?
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.160]   What?
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.160]   Where?
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.160]   Show me.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.160]   I don't see.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.160]   No, just go to the middle of the page.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.160]   There's a whole list.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.160]   A little more.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.160]   There.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.160]   See the list.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160]   Let me get rid of the ad age registration.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.080]   Get more from that age.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.080]   There we go.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.160]   See the rest of you has now.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.160]   Architect.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.560]   We just watched Architect, right?
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.880]   So now businessman.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.160]   I thought we were businessman.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.160]   Was that what we watched?
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.280]   Why not say burritos?
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.280]   That's kind of distracting.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.840]   Okay, here's Architect.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.040]   These are apple-worthy.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.040]   Symmetry.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.040]   Symmetry.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.240]   But now I'm supposed to apple-able since you do.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.240]   Right.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.240]   That's a field.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.240]   Tinder.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.240]   What?
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.240]   Whoa!
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:39.560]   You have a new Tinder match.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.560]   That's cool.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.120]   I have a Tinder in my Moto 360.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.520]   Then they should have said, "Your wife is wrong."
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.240]   All right, this one is couple.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.560]   Then you do this to your watch.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.560]   Oh, oh.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.960]   Oh, this is sexy.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.960]   Sexy, sexy.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.960]   Desire.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.960]   Desire.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   Mom.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.960]   Except my friend request.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:14.920]   I'll send it again.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.920]   That's good.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.920]   All right.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.920]   I'm liking these.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.920]   Now I'm getting it.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.120]   Now I'm getting what's going on here.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.120]   Golf.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.120]   You want to see golf?
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.760]   You want to make fun of golf and then we can move on.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.760]   I bet I'm all right.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.760]   Power.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.760]   Power.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.760]   Ugh.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.760]   Precision.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:39.760]   You're an average.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   That's life.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.960]   People, people, you like for lunch.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.960]   Tommy, you're close.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.960]   Those are great.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.720]   Oh, I'm playing my powerful golf game.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.280]   That is nice.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.400]   Now is that Lenovo now doing this?
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.640]   It's not Google anymore, is it?
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.520]   Your ad agency is Droga 5.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.880]   This is a Lenovo but really, yeah.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.880]   I know.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.280]   I mean, it's an agency, so they hired a good agency, obviously.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.280]   But that's great.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.160]   And they had this good sense of humor to roll with.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.480]   Nice.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.680]   So we're getting lollipop everywhere.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.360]   I just got lollipop on my Nexus 7.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.120]   You don't have it on yours yet, Jeff, because you have LTE, I gather.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.520]   As usual, let's look where you're in apps country.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.560]   You pay more, you go to the little X version, then you don't get.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.560]   You know what I did?
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:44.840]   I decided to wipe this and just make it pure just so I could experience the pure lollipop
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.840]   goodness.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.840]   And it really does look nice on this tablet, I have to say.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.840]   It's very pretty.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.240]   Wait, was it not pure before?
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.240]   Yes, pure.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.000]   I mean, just instead of, well, because you know why?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.800]   Because I don't use a launcher.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.800]   I use a no-vulical.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.800]   Right, gotcha.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   Gotcha.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.200]   Now launcher, no fancy.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.080]   The wallpapers, I customize the heck out of these things.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.080]   I see.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.080]   So you're going with the defaults.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.080]   Yeah, all default for now.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.080]   It's quite nice.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.200]   And I do like, and one of the things I was curious about when we mentioned before, that
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.600]   the tablet settings, for instance, use the full space.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.800]   Let me go back to the settings here.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.400]   They use the full space available.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.080]   So you get actually all the settings on one or almost all on one page.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.080]   I like that.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.320]   From the Wi-Fi thing, go back to the pull down settings thing.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.160]   Yeah, no, on this one, it's interesting.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.120]   I know where you're going on this.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.520]   If I tap it, it opens the settings.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.840]   You can't go from there to Wi-Fi.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.160]   Oh, no, you can't.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.160]   You can't.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.160]   Wrong tap.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.800]   If you tap the actual icon, that turns on or off.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.920]   If you tap the word, that takes you to settings.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.280]   Yeah, good luck hitting the word.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.280]   Oh, you're kidding.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.280]   There we go.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.280]   Oh, tap doesn't work.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.280]   Oh.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.440]   There you go.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.800]   Ask all about Android if you want to know something.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   Thank you, Dr. Android.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.240]   Type the word, you get the thing.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.240]   Ask good to know.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.240]   All these little hidden secrets that Google has to specify.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.560]   Yeah, there's a lot of little stuff in Lollipop.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.960]   You know, once you discover it, then you know going forward.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:21.880]   Moto X this year's 2014 Moto X got its update last week.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.080]   What are you getting updated, Gina?
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.080]   Yeah, my-- this is my Nexus 7 from 2012.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.080]   This is the original Nexus.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.080]   Oh.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.080]   I really needed to get the new one.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.080]   And it just lies to me.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.160]   It just tells me my system's up to date.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.160]   When I know it's not.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.360]   The thing is, I had this weird bug and we were just talking about this on all about Android.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.760]   I got the system update notification like a week ago, week and a half ago, and I was
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.480]   like, great go.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.080]   And then it went and then it rebooted.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.200]   It was like nothing happened.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   It was still--
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.200]   It was a different update.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.800]   Yeah, still jelly bean.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   You know, so I don't know what's going on.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.840]   I think I'm just going to grab the system image and update myself.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.840]   Well, that's risky.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.440]   We don't recommend that folks sideloading an image is always a bad idea.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.440]   It is.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.440]   It is.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.600]   But you know, honestly, this thing is so old and so slow right now.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.760]   Like, I don't even think Lollipop can save it.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.240]   It's just-- it's super stuttery and it's the old Nexus 7.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.640]   It's the original Nexus 7.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.120]   And I've used it a lot.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.280]   Even this one feels a little more sluggish compared to the Snapdragon 805 processor phones
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.280]   I've been using.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.280]   This is a little bit slower.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.280]   But it's fine.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.800]   I really like the Nexus 7.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.920]   Given that it was $250 or whatever, $225.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.760]   So it was a great deal.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.760]   This is 5.0.1 or 5.01.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:37.200]   So it went straight to the updated version of Lollipop 501, which came out, I think, last
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.640]   week fixing some of the issues with Android.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.360]   What do I tap it five times and I could play the game?
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.360]   La lip up.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.360]   La lip.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.960]   Oh, is the Flappy Lolly?
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.960]   Flappy Lolly.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   Do I hold it?
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   Yeah, I think you're holding on it.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.960]   There you go.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   Flappy Pop?
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   Oh, it's so hard.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.360]   It's way too hard.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.720]   It's next to impossible.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.680]   The swing from down to up is just so wide.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.680]   It's so wide.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.280]   Somebody told me you should always go in low.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.280]   Yep.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.280]   Oh.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.280]   Oh, so hard.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.960]   Anyway, it's nice that they built that in.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.880]   Yeah, that's way better than the being, the scattering means.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.320]   Well, I don't know.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.320]   Is it better?
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   Is it?
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.400]   I mean, freaking nuts.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.000]   It certainly required more programming.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.800]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   Oh.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   Oh.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   Oh.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.640]   Maybe they just want me to break my Nexus 7.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.520]   Anyway, yeah, nice.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.120]   The word is going out.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:40.720]   The Verizon is doing a soak test on the turbo, which was nice.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.800]   This is essentially a Moto X Verizon style.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.420]   And so that's getting-- and it may get voice over LTE, which it lacked.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.860]   This was kind of a weird Verizon phone because you couldn't do voice and data at the same
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.720]   time as you can with, for instance, the iPhone if you have a LTE in your--
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.480]   Oh, get me started.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.480]   Rumor has it.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.160]   For has it an LTE?
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.160]   I know.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.600]   There'll be a voltage update on this when we get that lollipop.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.680]   I like lollipop.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.680]   I do.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.680]   I like it.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.680]   Who does it?
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.400]   The one thing about mine is it's making-- it's giving me weird alert noises.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.020]   And I can't figure out what it's learning to me.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.320]   It doesn't show me anything on the screen.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.860]   So I can't figure out what to kill.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.580]   I'll figure it out.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.580]   Did you do last week?
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.580]   Because we did it on Twitter.
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:35.060]   And I love this story that Google admits that 50% of all ads are not ever seen.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.500]   They never are on screen for more than a second.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:44.580]   56% of all ads are never even in view.
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:49.600]   56% percent.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   You pay for them?
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.600]   We did.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.740]   I think we did talk about this because I remember Jeff saying that like when you buy
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.340]   an added a magazine, you assume that some people were just going to flip past it.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.200]   But this is not a magazine.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.200]   On TV as well.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.440]   No, I hear you.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.840]   This is a very trolly headline though.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.040]   "Averitizers wasted their money on more than half of their ads."
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.200]   No, if you compare it to a magazine or TV, you're right.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   That happens all the time.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.200]   People get up.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.820]   And the big thing now in advertising is viewability.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.220]   That's what this is about.
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.580]   And so now their expected viewability.
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.780]   The problem is that it immediately deflates the price of advertising.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.780]   Because even though advertising is not a good product.
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.540]   It just says subtract 56%.
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.540]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.940]   From the total cost.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:36.620]   That's why I'll tell you why I like these stories because I think our ad view rate is
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.540]   a little higher than that.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.540]   Oh yeah.
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.880]   I know there are some people who skip through our ads.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.120]   But you never want one in ads.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.120]   So you got to be good.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.120]   Right.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.920]   I mean it's sort of nature of the medium though, right?
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.920]   I mean.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.960]   No, you can never guarantee an ad gets heard.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:57.940]   And there's a dirty little secret in podcasting which is we count downloads.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.200]   We don't know if anybody ever played that show.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.920]   We shouldn't say that out loud.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.960]   But the same thing with a magazine.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.820]   They count circulation, not how many people read it.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.020]   In fact in magazines don't they multiply it because they say there's a pass around rate.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.020]   Leadership.
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.020]   Yeah.
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.020]   They count readership.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.620]   When I was a TV guide our pass around rate.
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.820]   The alleged number of people who read every issue of TV guide was like two and a half.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.780]   But a people it was eight.
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.460]   They presume that eight people read every copy.
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.860]   That's such a lie.
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.060]   That's such a lie.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:36.620]   Which means that the copies in doctors offices were obviously read by 800 people.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.940]   That's what brought the average up.
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:38.940]   Okay.
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.000]   Yeah, you don't see TV guide in the doctor's office that often.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   No, no.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.240]   You don't see TV guide anywhere.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.240]   You know the real truth of this is that all advertising numbers are lies.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.360]   The arbitron ratings, the people meters, all of its made up.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.720]   Everybody knows this.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.280]   Everybody is in cahoots on it.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.640]   It always comes down to did you get your money's worth?
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:08.060]   And it's a little harder for brand advertising because you can't measure sales directly from
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.060]   the ad.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:13.220]   All of our advertisers are for the most part anyway are direct ads.
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.780]   So they can measure sales.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:22.580]   So all it really comes down to is we try to charge as much as we possibly can as long
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.580]   as they don't lose money on the advertising.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.580]   Everybody's happy.
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.420]   They make more money than they lose.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.420]   Return on it.
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:34.280]   And he's sort of like initiative and podcasting like to like ping back when somebody plays
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.960]   or anything that nothing's ever caught on.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.160]   Well, you can't because you'd have to have a special player and special software.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.320]   So in fact, I think it's Nielsen.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.840]   One of the rating groups, I think it's Nielsen is getting into podcast advertising along with
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.080]   Adobe.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.960]   And that's what they're proposed is there be a Adobe player that counts.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.960]   But I don't I don't want that.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.300]   Yeah, it have to be some sort of open thing where like you stuffed a ping back URL and
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:06.340]   a header and every player, you know, look for that URL and hit it, ping it when the play
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.340]   button was pressed.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:11.220]   I mean, the chances of that happening, same would have to be extremely wide adoption for
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.220]   a really good reason, right?
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.380]   It's an imperfect art.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.900]   It always has been in right.
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.860]   Jeff and magazines and his papers, same thing.
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:23.500]   And it comes down to yeah, did Coca Cola feel like when it bought a million dollar ad on
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.620]   the Super Bowl, did it feel like it got its money's worth?
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.840]   And I guess they do research to try to figure out who saw it.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:34.840]   Well, don't forget there's there's a moral hazard in here because ad agencies for a long
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.880]   long time and still to some extent are paid on how much media they bought.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.880]   Right.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.560]   So it was in the average to say to the advertiser, oh, it was worth spending a hundred million
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.280]   dollars because we got our cut of the hundred million.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:52.160]   That actually hurts us because we're cheaper than a lot of mainstream advertising, you know,
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:58.200]   and so the agencies aren't as incented to place stuff with podcasting because you know,
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.940]   they're there when they're podcasting, they're only doing a million dollar by not a hundred
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.840]   million dollar by and that's backwards.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:10.080]   But if they were representing their customers interests, exactly, they would say let's take
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.160]   the more efficient, lower spend, but that's not their interest.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.840]   Again, we shouldn't talk about any of this.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.840]   Sorry.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.680]   Hey, Jeff or Gina, maybe you know, somebody in the chat room saying, but doesn't Google
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.680]   charge per click, not per view?
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:31.720]   Well, this is not about search ads or ads sense.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.880]   This is about double click because don't forget the Google service.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.320]   It's a big fan of course with the display ads on the internet.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.040]   And those are charged per impression, not per click.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.000]   Yeah, as a rule.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Yes.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   I mean, there's various models.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Right.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.160]   But now the interesting thing happens is I don't know if we talked about this in the show,
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:55.840]   but chart beat run by Tony Hale is arguing that the metric we should move to is attention.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.840]   Right.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.080]   And the problem with the old media metrics of reach and frequency is that's what leads
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.240]   to click bait and cats volume, pure volume.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.240]   Right.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:09.200]   If you go to attention and how much time is spent exposed to an ad, then you get rid
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.040]   of that view of Billy problem because you're not exposed to it if you can't see it.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:18.120]   So the financial times and chart beat are going to charge based on attention minutes
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:23.520]   for certain demographics, like a thousand, 10,000 attention minutes of European CEOs.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:30.120]   And Williams at medium plans to charge on TTR, total time read, selling it like verifiable
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.000]   TV and the economist is now joining in as well.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.760]   So at a higher level end of content, you're starting to move from pure volume to attention.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.240]   I think that's the end of the book.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.880]   That's good for everybody because then you don't get rid of the buzzfeeds and all the
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:50.560]   click bait and the listicles and all of that you're really trying to measure what really
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.720]   matters, which is the viewers engagement with the content.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:00.200]   And the other thing gets rid of, I think, is what I've come to really despise now is
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.480]   this idea that everybody needs a take.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.480]   We need our take on this.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.480]   And of course we do that here because we just always do.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.480]   We just pop up.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.960]   We talk to a network is based on our take on that.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.400]   Our take on that.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:20.680]   But if you go to Google News, you see 1200 versions of the same story and know that it
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:25.080]   was reported just once, the amount of resource that why is that there?
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.480]   It's there because we want more page views, page views, page views.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.480]   Right.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.640]   That's become a real bane of my existence is the kind of the rehash article.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.320]   And everybody does this now.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.680]   And I always when we do, we report stories, we try to give credit, by the way, to the
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.320]   originator of the story.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.600]   And we try to get the original originator, not the rehash.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.000]   There's one exception there, the paywalls.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.800]   So when Jessica Lesson does some original reporting on the information or the Wall Street
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:56.440]   Journal does some original reporting reporting, I often end up quoting the rehash because
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.400]   we puke can't get past the paint wall to see the original reporting.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.320]   So there's a negative on a walls, by the way, not that that matters.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.920]   I try to get credit to the information.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.760]   If the information breaks a story, I want them to get credit because I want them to get
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.760]   more subscribers.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.920]   What do you all right?
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.960]   Now we're really going to go off our field.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.760]   What do you think about what happened to the new Republic, Jeff?
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.800]   Oh, this is going to be good.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.960]   Now let me just say I was a subscriber for years to the new.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.240]   Should we recap for folks who aren't meeting or media nerds?
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.240]   This is kind of an insider story.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:34.000]   This is a 100 year old magazine founded in Teddy Roosevelt's living room that represented
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.240]   the progressive, kind of an old political term you'll remember from high school, but
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.240]   the kind of progressive left-leaning politics.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.320]   But it was very much an insider journal for the Beltway.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.360]   I loved it, read it religiously, until Martin Perrette's came along and then I left because
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.360]   I didn't like him.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.080]   I was concerned about ownership.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:01.720]   Chris Hughes of Facebook, one of the Mark Zuckerberg's roommate at Harvard, who was hired
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:10.200]   in his freshman year at Harvard to work at Facebook bought it two years ago, right?
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.200]   And didn't...
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.200]   Three, I think.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.400]   Three, which I thought was, that's a good thing.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.600]   Because here's a very, by the way, Chris Hughes, very smart, you know, I mean, has a great
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.480]   pedigree.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:26.000]   Anybody who buys the new Republic presumably understands the value of the new Republic.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Most people never heard of it.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.560]   What's the name of the campaign after leaving Facebook?
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.600]   He worked in the Obama campaign.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.600]   That's right.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.640]   He was the guy credited with his digital, with Obama's digital success in 2008.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.240]   So I thought, "Oh, good."
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.240]   This is...
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.960]   You know, I was more excited about that than Jeff Bezos buying the post.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.720]   Ironically, Jeff has done a great job with the post and we...
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.840]   Well, we'll see what Chris has done with the Washington, with the new Republic.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:55.960]   So this week, the editor, my highly regarded editor-in-chief of the new Republic, I think
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.280]   he was fired.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.280]   Some say he left.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.280]   He had to...
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.840]   Well, he had to ask whether or not he had been replaced.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.720]   And then the answer was yes.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.440]   So he was a real hire Gabriel Snyder as from the digital person from the...
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.440]   From Godhead.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.440]   Not that he was the editor.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.400]   He had to call...
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.800]   Franklin Ford had to call Chris Hughes to find out whether he was fired or not.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.400]   And the answer was yes.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.960]   And then they brought it up.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:29.000]   And then the many decades, grizzled veteran of reviews quit.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.160]   And then about 30 editors and contributors said, "That's it.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.160]   We're out of here.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.160]   Everybody left."
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.160]   It was a mass exodus.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:41.320]   And partly because they brought in this digital guy, because what this really is about is
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.520]   something that's happening in every newsroom in the nation, which is the move to...
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.120]   You've got to find a way to succeed online.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.880]   But unfortunately, they brought in a guy from...
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.480]   Was he from Yahoo or AOL?
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.480]   I can't remember.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.480]   Yahoo.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.480]   Yahoo.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.480]   Yahoo.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.720]   And I guess he didn't pronounce for his name right for one thing, which kind of shows he
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.600]   doesn't even know what he's doing.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.920]   And then he said, "Well, we're going to do it.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.440]   We're going to be a vertically integrated digital media property.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.560]   And we're going to break stuff."
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.720]   And everybody just said, "Oh God, not us."
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:20.480]   But I have to say, some of this looks a little bit like old media rejecting digital
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.480]   ways.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.840]   It was a whole bunch of tribes going on here.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.840]   Now, I'm not...
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.880]   I'm pleased to not give any publicity to the name that I'm now about, not to mention.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.560]   But I have very much had a dog in this fight because New Republic ran an 8,000-word personal
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.560]   attack on me.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.560]   Really?
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.560]   Why miss that?
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.560]   I'm going to go find that.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.520]   No, you know what that is.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.520]   You know what that is.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.840]   We've not discussed it.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.720]   And when I wrote a reply, refused to so much as effin' linked to it.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.640]   Was this in the Chris Hughes era?
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.640]   Yes.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.640]   Okay.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.640]   I hate the Sons of Bitches.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.400]   I think they're irresponsible dorks.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.200]   And I think a magazine has been crapped for the last three to five years.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.040]   And they just tried to become trolls with degrees.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.480]   And so when all this happened, I read a piece which I think you're going to do a dramatic
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.640]   reading of in a moment.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:17.840]   And I tweeted that wonderful piece and I said it was brilliant.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.360]   And one of my friends came back and said, "Oh, how could you say that?"
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.360]   What?
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.280]   Well, because what you see is you see the defense of the New Republic.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.360]   Oh my God, how could Silicon Valley come into this?
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.880]   And the truth is, Chris Hughes isn't really a Silicon Valley.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.440]   He won the lottery at Harvard to end up as Mark's roommate.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.840]   And he did these smart guy and did smart things.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.840]   That's all wonderful.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.840]   But he's not really a Silicon Valley guy.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.840]   And hiring sort of a guy who won't even call Silicon Valley.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:49.760]   So this is not a war of Silicon Valley versus media, which is how it's been presented.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.120]   It's kind of a war of new republicites versus new republicites.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:59.200]   And there's various difficult tribes within the new republic world.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.520]   The new republic world is tiny.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.520]   There are far more Americans who are saying, "What the hell is the new republic mod?"
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.840]   than ever read the new republic in all this coverage.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.000]   And so they canceled their December issue.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.480]   They're going to come out next in February.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.000]   I think it's a big old honor.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.480]   I don't necessarily condemn the new regime or condemn the new editor.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.680]   We'll see how he does.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:26.080]   But I think the magazine has been crapped for quite some time.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.440]   And there are those who just like you Leo canceled the prior regime.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.440]   Long ago.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.440]   Where your current's owned it.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.560]   Long ago, instead it's been crapped ever since then.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.560]   So it's one of those magazines.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.280]   You know, it's like, I forget, when I went to South by Southwest, what year I forget
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.160]   who it was, asked on Twitter, how do I act like a veteran?
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.000]   And my response was, just complain that it's not as good as last year.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.320]   I think the same is true of the new republic.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.200]   Is that by acting like a new republic leader, you're going to complain about, it wasn't
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.200]   as good as the old days, whatever.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.000]   It's always been tiny.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   You know, I...
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   What is circulation?
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.240]   It can't be more than like 40,000.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.440]   Oh, it's about that.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:12.120]   And finally, the thing is that what we really see happening here, which of course, I celebrate
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:17.600]   as I think you do too, unless you want to be congratulated today, is that this idea
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.160]   that we had to have a journal of ideas isn't necessary anymore.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.120]   We have something called the internet.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.880]   And yes, it's hard to find, you know, the diamonds in the rough.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.880]   That's true.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.880]   But we'll come up with systems for that.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.720]   There's far more voices than ever existed before.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:37.320]   Those efforts wouldn't even so much as link to me, what I had something to say that they
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.840]   had caused, that idea that you have the gatekeeper who can be...
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.920]   You don't want to club.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.920]   You don't want to club.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.920]   You want to foster...
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.360]   You want to have a place where...
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:55.320]   Part of the problem is there isn't any money in being this kind of thinker and writer.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.320]   There never has been.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.240]   So it was nice that something fostered that and some rich people came along and said,
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.360]   "Well, we'll continue to pay you."
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.800]   But you don't want it to turn into a club.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.080]   So yeah, I agree with you.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.120]   And sometimes I feel like this is just old media going, "Oh, these internet people,
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.120]   they're so...
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.120]   They're so disgusting.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.080]   There's so plebeian."
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.960]   Where is that piece on Medium?
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.720]   Oh, it's on Medium.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   Hold on here.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.720]   Which piece is this?
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.960]   Oh, I want to read it because it was so funny.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.960]   This is the piece.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.960]   This is Jeff's response to the...
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.960]   No, no, no.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.960]   This is a send up.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:30.960]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.600]   This is a piece.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.600]   Just search for Medium, I quit New Republic.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.600]   I quit.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   Oh, right.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   This is a piece, yes.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.080]   You know, it's funny.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.560]   I never read the New Republic.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.760]   I've been really interested in Chris Hughes.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.520]   He's been the silent founder.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.400]   He barely had a role in the social network.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.720]   He's the silent gay founder of Facebook.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:54.680]   I don't know him personally, but I have a couple of close connections.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.760]   And I found this whole thing really fascinating to witness just sort of as a drama because
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.840]   it was this drama going on.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:06.560]   But what's interesting is that they cast the Silicon Valley side as anti-intellectual.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:12.000]   Like the one of the lines that got quoted was, you know, one of the new regimes said,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.880]   "Well, I just stopped even reading those long form articles."
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.880]   Right.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.880]   Like, TLDR.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.880]   Yeah, TLDR, man.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.880]   Let's just rough this business.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.000]   Let's just move fast and break things.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.960]   Like it was so, you know, which I find, you know, really funny because they were sort
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.800]   of acting just like a stereotype themselves.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.400]   I felt like it could have been that show on HBO.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.280]   But it was, you know, it was also, there seemed like there were many lessons in management
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.680]   to be learned from this scenario too.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.480]   Well, and the thing that's interesting--
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.720]   I just talked with you.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.640]   The thing that's interesting is contrastiness to Jeff Bezos' stewardship of The Washington
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.200]   Post, which one would expect to be terrible.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.360]   And in fact, I think the Post has been doing really good work in the last year.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.720]   Yeah, but don't build the statue yet.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.720]   Okay.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:03.720]   What he's been doing, which has been deering him to every editor of the shop, is he's been
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.720]   hiring.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.720]   He's been throwing money at it.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.720]   Okay.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:13.960]   But the most--the only thing we've seen so far that's been terribly technologically based
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.120]   is, "Oh boy, you can get The Washington Post on your Kindle fire."
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.880]   Yeah, no revolution in digital there.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.880]   None.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:26.840]   And my hope for Jeff Bezos at The Washington Post has long been since he bought it, that
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.840]   he would bring his expertise.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.520]   I mean, I wrote a certain book about the idea that we are going to move to a relationship
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.640]   structure in news or should.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.360]   And Amazon knows better than anyone.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.640]   Jeff Bezos knows better than anyone how to build relationships of relevance and value
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   for people.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.480]   And I want him to bring that to The Washington Post.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.400]   Yeah, I wouldn't want him just to say, "I'm going to make it a hobby and I'm just going
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.400]   to fund--"
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.400]   Or a bully pulpit.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.400]   Yeah, or a bully pulpit.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.240]   "What makes me nervous?"
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:56.360]   He hired a--there was a brilliant editor there at Marty Barron, which is great.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.680]   Marty is quite amazing and has great staff.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.240]   And so that's all good in my little world, my little club, we admire Marty.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:10.000]   But then he hired as the new publisher, the guy--basically a political fixer in town.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Guy who doesn't know anybody on the internet.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:19.080]   He's the guy who killed TBD, which was a local site in Washington that many of us who
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.960]   care about local news were really putting a lot of hopes on.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:26.360]   And then on ceremonies, they got executed.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:31.480]   And that's the guy who's hired to run the business side of the post.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.040]   I don't see a lot of vision coming there.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:38.280]   And if there's not vision on both the editorial and the product side, then it's going to be
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.280]   trouble.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.640]   So far, yes, Bezos has thrown money into the post.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.840]   So far, Marty Barron's doing really good things with that money.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:50.080]   But I was hoping for a lot more experience and vision from Jeff Bezos to the post.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.080]   Here's what I'm hoping for.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:57.840]   And what he's doing is quite rightly trying to get everything up to snuff, get a great
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:06.040]   quality product, and is willing to, because he's got deep pockets, defer this larger problem
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:11.160]   of how do you make this work in a modern digital age after he learns and builds.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.800]   We don't have the time to defer.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.800]   Why not?
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.960]   I'm going to defer.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.760]   I think he's going to start experimenting.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.200]   I think he will at some point.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.920]   But I'm glad he didn't just jump in.
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.360]   But I thought that's what's going to happen.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.360]   I was giving it all the time.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:30.400]   I just see the, the, uh, oh, sign I see is that the guy he put in charge couldn't be
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.640]   more old media publishers always though horrible.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.640]   Aren't publishers publishers in sales?
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.800]   No, no, that's no, because that's, that's our hubris in the editorial side where what
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:46.240]   we should be doing is putting visionaries on the business side as well and business strategies.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.480]   You're, you're, you're going to business vision.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.680]   Well, it needs to, it needs to be viable.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.680]   Right.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.680]   But we got to find some.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.680]   So it has to be modern.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:02.520]   It's very inside baseball, but I knew as soon as I read it, I said I have to ask Jeff.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.400]   Do you think Chris, so I get in trouble for Gina and I get enough air time.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:10.080]   By the way, this is the Washington, the Washington Post's opinion piece on this was the new republic
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.600]   is dead.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.480]   Thanks to its owner, Chris Hughes, they blamed him.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.800]   What do you think you, you said, you know, Chris a little bit or.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   No, no, no, no, I don't know.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.800]   Very smart guy.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.520]   From what I've heard, you know, I know, I know, I know friends who know him.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.960]   I mean, I'm interested to see what he does.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.720]   I think he's done a lot of interesting things in his career.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.320]   And so I think there's a, he has, he's got a shot at turning new republic into something
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.320]   new and different.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:39.360]   I just think that this was not the most, it was an inauspicious beginning, the shake
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.360]   up, the shake down.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.360]   I joined this time of year.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:47.280]   It's all these media companies go through these big sort of shakeups.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.800]   So it'll be interesting to see what happens.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.800]   But I'm definitely going to watch.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.440]   I think he has a shot at doing something good.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.920]   I just don't think this was a good start.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.920]   I think you're right, Gina.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.320]   And I think that, that, you know, I didn't, I didn't necessarily like the product before.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.680]   So maybe it's good news that the people who ran that product are out and we have new people
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.680]   in France was known.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.120]   Well, we're on inside baseball.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.520]   So they just happened just before we got on the air.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.680]   There's huge in my world, which is Alan Rusperger, the editor of the Guardian, who I think is
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.560]   the best editor, newspaper editor of any newspaper whose language I could possibly read
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:21.560]   in the world is stepping down to have the trust that owns the Guardian and he'll be
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.600]   replaced next year.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.000]   That's, that's gigantic news in my field.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.440]   And my geeky now and you can do your dramatic reading.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:35.000]   Actually, the big news in my field broke last night, which is that HBO is going to start
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.240]   putting its content on the web this spring.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:49.680]   And that the guy they brought in to run their digital, you know, streaming platform, quit
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.680]   and discussed.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.880]   Speaking of dramatic firing.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.360]   The OCTO is out.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:03.800]   Because HBO realized after the Game of Thrones debacle earlier this year that this guy didn't
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:09.320]   know how to do anything and that this team he had built was ineffective.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:14.520]   So they're going to Major League Baseball to stream the content.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.040]   They already do it for wrestling.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.200]   MLB does a great job of streaming content, right?
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.200]   Why build it?
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.640]   There was another argument this week in my world.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:31.040]   The CEO of the Guardian, Andrew Miller said, "Newspapers shouldn't be technology companies.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.160]   That's not what's going to save us."
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.080]   And then a lot of my friends got all angry.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   I thought that was Hottie.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.640]   I couldn't agree with him more.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:39.800]   HBO is not, I don't go to HBO because it knows how to do code.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.680]   I go to HBO because it knows how to do shows except for the newsroom, which is junk.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.680]   I can't wait for it to end.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.680]   It's almost over.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:53.600]   But anyways, HBO's core competence is not how to build a player.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.600]   No.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.120]   And the tech guys who they always have to build themselves.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.800]   So they hired this guy and he brought in a bunch of Microsoft cronies.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   They have a big office.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.680]   Hottie Berkis, as CTO, he's been there for a few years.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:11.360]   He brought in people from Microsoft, set up a large office in Seattle, 55 engineers laying
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:16.360]   off a number of longtime employees in HBO's New York headquarters.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.720]   This is from Fortune Magazine.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:22.160]   The Seattle office, which is rumored to cost HBO as much as $100 million per year has been
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:29.280]   the source of internal squabbling at the company, insiders accused Berk's of building a Napoleonic
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.840]   empire with an HBO.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:37.520]   He resigned and discussed after being informed that he wasn't going to be doing the streaming.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.200]   But also, I think very interesting, HBO has finally pulled the trigger.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:47.880]   I think remains to be seen if you'll have to demonstrate that you have a cable subscription,
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.560]   but they've been making noise about this for some time.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:54.760]   If they disintermediate the cable companies, that's the beginning of a big move to the
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:36:00.300]   company.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.760]   Here comes the thread to pull the sweater.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.260]   HBO is a big thread.
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.260]   What is?
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.260]   It is.
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.260]   It is.
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.040]   They've got a public deadline.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.800]   Game of Thrones premieres in the spring.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.840]   The streaming has to be flawless.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:18.740]   It sounds like this guy just wasn't able to ship on time.
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:27.140]   He knew about a memory leak bug and he's for nine months and he didn't fix it.
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:30.060]   And then that brought down the Game of Thrones streaming.
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.780]   HBO go, and this is the thing.
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.780]   People pay a lot of money for HBO.
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.940]   They expect HBO go to work.
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:39.420]   That sounds like a good right position.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.300]   I have some personal news.
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:48.060]   Today I resigned from the new Republic, but I am excited to join Fusion, which I'm also
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.740]   resigning from effective immediately.
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:56.620]   To start a new adventure at BuzzFeed, an adventure I might add, which ends today because I've
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:02.860]   been hired by Vox, from which I must summarily tender my resignation in order to join the
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:06.620]   amazing crew at the Intercept, who have been so kind to me in the single minute that I
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.980]   spent there before letting them know that I am moving on.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:15.100]   To fire up my career as a freelance writer, get at me editors and now please stop getting
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:19.340]   at me as the life of a freelance writer has proven too difficult, but not as difficult
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:25.620]   as a decision to join and then quit from and then again join the Atlantic.
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:30.180]   This is a wonderful medium piece by Jason O Gilbert and I love the illustration of a
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:35.580]   revolving door at the head of this inside building outside building.
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.180]   It's very funny and it goes on and on and on and on and on.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.620]   It's just great.
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:41.020]   But I really loved that.
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.500]   I just had to laugh out loud when I read that.
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:47.700]   I don't know who Jason O Gilbert is, but he's got a fine touch and he should find a job
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:48.700]   at the New Republic.
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:54.580]   And he clearly has lots of media time friends who announce their new gigs very often.
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.500]   We've all seen these emails, haven't we?
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.500]   Or tweets?
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.100]   I feel like my tweets stream.
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.060]   You've been under a yonder tech.
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.060]   Yeah.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.060]   Yeah.
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.820]   I am beyond thrilled, however, to announce that I'm launching a new media startup in collaboration
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:13.140]   with Tina Brown and The Puppet Smart from Too Many Cookies.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.900]   As I leave today due to disagreements with investors over the direction of the publication,
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:21.220]   as well as a series of two public arguments over usage of the office refrigerator with
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:22.220]   Smart.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.060]   I can only say I'm so proud of what we might have accomplished.
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:29.180]   Had I not been engaged full time in searching for other jobs in media, accepting other jobs
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:34.100]   in media and pouring through my Thesaurus for synoms to the word thrilled.
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.540]   They're so well done.
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.540]   Nice.
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.540]   There's news in your old world.
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.540]   Nick, there is.
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.060]   He's so-called unclenching.
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:47.300]   What do you interpret for this?
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:51.060]   So Nick is now stepping down to CEO and has a board of like 40 people who are going to
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:54.340]   attend to the founder and publisher of Gawker.
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.940]   We should say from our employer.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:59.300]   Ever where Gina started Life Hacker?
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.300]   Yes.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.300]   Life Hacker is a Gawker site.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.300]   I ran the site for five years.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.300]   I founded the site.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.300]   I own stock and Gawker.
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:08.300]   Gawkers is I haven't been there for years, five years now.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:15.340]   Nick wrote a 15-page essay, which the short version is he wants to blog again.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.580]   He doesn't want to be the president of the company and the single-point person to run
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.980]   the entire company, the company is huge now.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:25.020]   He's assembled a team of seven executive managers to run the company and he wants to
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:29.500]   write more, which I'm very excited about because Nick is actually an extremely smart
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.460]   and good writer.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.020]   So I'm happy to see him writing again.
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:38.740]   I thought that the essay is very, very long and probably wouldn't amuse anyone else as
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.740]   much as it amused me.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:40.740]   It's very Nick.
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:45.740]   I mean, it's very transparent, which is kind of what Gawker does, right?
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.300]   They turn things inside out.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:52.580]   So, Tommy Craggs, who's at Deadspin, is now the executive editor overall of eight flagship
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.580]   titles.
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:57.100]   Unlike this, Nick writes, "We'll return to our mission.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:02.100]   More line backers with fictional, dying girlfriends, less pandering to the Facebook masses."
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.300]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:07.300]   Let's click bait, in other words.
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:12.380]   I guess his point is more investigative pieces.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.700]   They want to break stories.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.180]   They want to break stories.
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.180]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.180]   And they want to speak truth to power.
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.180]   They want to stay independent.
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:21.980]   They've never taken any sort of funding.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:23.460]   They want to keep growing, which they have been.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.100]   And Gawker has done really well.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:28.700]   And every December, January, there's a reckoning there and there's some sort of reorg and there's
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.180]   a kind of a refocus.
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.180]   I think this one sounds good.
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:34.820]   I think that Nick is now not running a small company anymore.
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:39.020]   When I started there, it was just a couple of people that he pay pal the couple bucks
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.220]   a week to write one or two sites.
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:46.860]   And now it's a giant company with HR and all hands meetings and anything.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.860]   $60 million revenue.
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:49.860]   Mm-hmm.
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:53.180]   Gauter, Gizmodo, Deadspin.
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:54.700]   What's Deadspin politics?
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:55.700]   Sports.
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:56.700]   Sports.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:02.500]   Well, I09, Jalopnik, that's Cars, Kotaku, that's gaming.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.500]   And I love it.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.660]   He says, "It's life hacker."
[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.540]   Oh, beloved life hacker.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:11.300]   Yeah, I mean, you know, life hackers burden was always that we-- that, you know, we-- it's
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.300]   not we anymore.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.500]   But life hackers kind of like the nice site in the group.
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.500]   Right.
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:16.500]   Don't gossip.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.500]   Yeah, it's not gossip.
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.500]   It's not snark, right?
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:19.500]   It's just helpful.
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.780]   So we were always sort of like the black sheep tonally anyway.
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:27.260]   And I'm really happy to see that the current team has kind of kept up with that.
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.860]   But yeah, I like that he said, beloved life hacker.
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.860]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.860]   He says, "We haven't been ourselves lately.
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:37.660]   Editorial traffic was lifted, but often by viral stories that we would rather mock.
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:42.700]   We, the freest journalists on the planet, were slaves to the Facebook algorithm.
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:47.140]   The story of the year, the one story where we were truly at the epicenter, was one that
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.100]   caused dangerous internal dissension.
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.860]   We were nowhere on the Edward Snowden affair.
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:55.300]   We wrote nothing particularly memorable about NSA surveillance.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.980]   Gadgets felt unexciting.
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.220]   Celebrity gossip was emptier than usual."
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:02.980]   Boy, I hope he's sincere and I hope this is the direction they take.
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:03.980]   That's great.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:09.740]   Nick, Nick, as highly self-critical always has been, always rose the other way.
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:10.740]   Nick's brilliant.
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:12.740]   I mean, he's just amazing.
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:17.420]   I was on the board of his last company, Moreover, and I once said to him, it was in
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.420]   the middle of the crash.
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:21.460]   And I said, "Boy, Nick, it's a good thing you raised too much money.
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.460]   You raised a lot of money.
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.020]   The company's surviving through this."
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.500]   And he said, "No Jarvis, it's the worst thing I ever did.
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.820]   Not that this guy could go off and go down rabbit holes.
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:30.820]   That was wrong."
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.020]   And that's just the way Nick is.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.740]   He just, you ever think he's going to go this way, he's the exact way.
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.620]   And that has a good reason to do so.
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:41.660]   I hope this is the beginning of a lot of these companies kind of is chewing the clickbait,
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:45.460]   the listicle, the Facebook news algorithm and starting to try to create good content on
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:47.940]   its own face and not worry about my rally.
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.940]   But we need this as well as the support bank.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:50.940]   I do too.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.620]   Yeah, well that's always been the problem, hasn't it?
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:57.580]   Because it was important, the old volume metrics.
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:58.580]   Right.
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.100]   It ain't about volume.
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:03.460]   No, 60 million is pretty decent.
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.100]   I could see it becoming a 60 million dollar company.
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:10.340]   Yeah, we're on our way there.
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:13.860]   Let's take a break and we will continue with more.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:16.700]   Jeff, Gina, Leo, this is Twig.
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.140]   Yes, there's Google News.
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:19.660]   And there's the Google change log.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.420]   Let's not be that.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:22.420]   Yeah.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.420]   Never.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.420]   Never.
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.420]   But first a word from FreshBooks.
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:32.020]   If you're a freelancer, you know the pain of the 31st of the month when you got a, oh,
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:36.140]   fire Microsoft Word and creating voices, stamp them and mail them.
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:37.140]   There's a better way.
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.700]   That's what FreshBooks did for me.
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.340]   2004, I was doing that.
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.780]   Amber MacArthur said, you got to try FreshBooks.
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.940]   Nice little company here in Toronto.
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:49.820]   It's a cloud accounting solution and it changed my life.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:54.940]   There are now five million people who have used FreshBooks to run their business.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:59.980]   The easiest way to invoice clients, organize expenses and track your time.
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.580]   You'll spend less time on paperwork.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:05.300]   In fact, they've done studies of FreshBooks customers.
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:10.980]   For instance, FreshBooks users free up average on average of two days a month that they
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.580]   don't do in the invoicing and the accounting.
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:19.380]   They get paid on average five days faster because it's easy for your clients to pay
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.380]   with FreshBooks.
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:21.660]   Here's my favorite.
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:27.660]   On average, FreshBooks customers double their revenue in the first 24 months.
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:33.740]   It's good for business because the more you know the less friction involved in things
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:39.340]   like invoicing and billing and tracking your time.
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:43.780]   For instance, the FreshBooks app on your phone will track your time and you can take
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:46.980]   pictures of your receipts, keep track of your expenses.
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:51.220]   If clients are late paying, automated late payment reminders help you get paid faster
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:55.900]   and without those nervous making emails and phone calls.
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.260]   Are you keeping your receipts in a shoebox?
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.260]   Iowans?
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:01.060]   Snap photos of receipts right from your phone.
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:02.820]   Track expenses easily.
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:06.140]   You can connect your FreshBooks account to Google Apps so you can stay on top of your
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:09.100]   small business without breaking your workflow.
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.860]   Be man your account and love it.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.020]   Come tax time, you'll be so feeling so good.
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:17.180]   Bennett Coleman, one of their users, he's a web designer and developer says, "I seriously
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:18.700]   don't get excited about accounting.
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:19.900]   Who does?"
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.180]   But I love FreshBooks.
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:24.500]   I love setting up recurring hosting invoices.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:25.860]   I do too.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.860]   It could not be.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:28.140]   I really love FreshBooks.
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:29.540]   I want you to try it free.
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:30.900]   30 days, no obligation.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.340]   Just go to freshbooks.com/twig.
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.020]   If they ask, how do you hear about it?
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:37.140]   Mention this week in Google if you would.
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:38.460]   Be nice.
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:44.740]   Take a 30 day free trial today, freshbooks.com/twig.
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:47.820]   I love FreshBooks.
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.820]   How do I do?
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:53.900]   Now let's play the drums, break out the trumpets.
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.060]   I don't see a Google change log.
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:57.060]   Is there a Google?
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.060]   Oh, it's here.
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:45:59.060]   It is there.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.060]   It's there.
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:07.060]   The Google change log.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:11.700]   And out of here is Gina Trebati, who's all bundled up in the winter snow.
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:12.700]   In the snow.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.340]   To bring us this holiday change log.
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:19.940]   Got a couple, lots of new features here and there to talk about Google+.
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.940]   Two new things in Google+.
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:26.140]   First, now you have the ability to pin a post at the top of your profile, your Google
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.140]   Plus profile.
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:30.780]   This used to be only available to I think to brands and pages, but now personal profiles
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:31.860]   have this.
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.500]   So the feature is similar to Twitter's pin tweets.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.700]   It means anybody who visits your profile will see the pin post and you can do any kind
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.620]   of content, videos, links, etc.
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:47.940]   And the pin posts are viewable to Android and web Google+ users with iOS support coming
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:48.940]   soon.
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:52.260]   So post stay pinned until you manually unpin them.
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:56.180]   The other thing that Google+ got was some expanded gender identity options.
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:47:00.060]   So it used to be when you filled out your Google+ profile, you chose male, female or
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:01.420]   other.
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.260]   The gender field now has four entries.
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:05.740]   Male, female, decline to state and custom.
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:10.780]   If you choose custom, you can fill in however you want to identify and you can limit who
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:14.460]   and you can still limit who you can see your gender just like you can do now.
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:20.140]   And that feature, the gender feature is rolling out for all users over the next few days.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:23.860]   Google brings my maps to Google+ Drive.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:28.180]   So if you go to Google+ Drive and you choose that you click on the red new button and you
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.380]   go to the more, you can choose my maps.
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:36.700]   And this is the custom map creation tool that lets you create maps and share them.
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.620]   This update is rolling out over the next week or so.
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.100]   I already have it.
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:44.940]   So you can create maps in Drive and you can also do all the things you can also do in
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:45.940]   Drive.
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:49.740]   Just organize these maps and folders, search them alongside your other files and share
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.300]   them easily.
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:54.580]   The My Maps tool also gets a couple of other functional improvements.
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:58.780]   You can add more layers and points of interests to user-generated maps too.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:04.700]   So nice kind of interesting differentiation between Google Drive and say, you know, like
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:07.660]   Office 360, for example.
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:10.620]   Google Hangouts got a couple of new neat features.
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.340]   I really like this one.
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:15.500]   When someone asks you if you're doing a Hangout with someone and someone says to you, "Where
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:16.500]   are you?"
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:19.980]   Hangouts will automatically detect that someone has asked, "Where are you?"
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:23.260]   and prompt you with a Share Your Location button.
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:28.140]   So you can just tap Share Your Location and drop a pin on a map and it'll send the person
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:30.420]   your location.
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:34.780]   So a nice kind of one-time way to say, "Here I am," and Hangouts automatically kind of
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.460]   detects that someone asks you that.
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:38.460]   So really, really, really neat.
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:42.020]   Of course, there's location sharing in Hangouts already, but this is just a little extra prompt
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:45.540]   in case you forgot it's there and someone's asking where you are.
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:49.740]   There's also a couple of other little features in Hangouts, new stickers, a couple of Easter
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:50.740]   eggs.
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:54.140]   If you tap Happy Birthday, you get a little visual.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:59.540]   You got to apply filters to video chats like sepia or vignette, black and white.
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:02.060]   Your contacts also now show last scene timestamps.
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:06.540]   You can see the last time that someone logged in and really, really get creepy on it about
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.180]   keeping track of your friends.
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:11.820]   Sorry, I said creepy because, you know, Jeff.
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:13.780]   Sorry, Jeff.
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:19.580]   Jeff, actually speaking of, I want to ask you, are you on the dev channel for Chrome OS?
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:23.220]   Because there's a new smart lock has been rolled out to the dev channel.
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.220]   I am for this, Jim.
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.220]   Me too.
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.220]   This is so cool.
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:27.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:33.180]   So then this new feature that we heard about at Google I/O, which lets you keep your phone,
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:38.580]   your, sorry, your Chrome OS running laptop unlocked with having your lollipop phone in
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:39.580]   the vicinity, right?
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.980]   So it knows you're there and it logs you into your laptop.
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:49.180]   So this has been a part of lollipop since lollipop came out, but just now this feature
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:52.700]   is rolling out to Chromebooks, running the dev channel only.
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.140]   So if you're not on the dev channel, you won't see this, but it's good news that it's in
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.140]   the dev channel.
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:50:00.140]   Because that means it'll be in stable very, very soon, very, very convenient on locker.
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.940]   And I do use this, though, Gina.
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:05.060]   My motoro C360 keeps my Nexus 6 unlocked.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.060]   Yeah, that's really nice.
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:10.500]   There'll be a three way here where my 360 will keep my photo lock, which will turn deep
[00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.500]   my laptop unlocked.
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:17.860]   Yeah, it's, I'm, I got to tell you, I'm a little bit like, I give you, maybe I got to
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:22.140]   figure out if I set up my dev environment on a Chromebook because, man, that pixel, it's
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:23.140]   nice.
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:24.140]   It's really, really nice.
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:25.140]   It's pretty flaky.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:26.140]   Is it?
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:28.020]   What's, what's flaky?
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.140]   The dev, the dev environment.
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.140]   Oh, the dev.
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.140]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:37.580]   I, in fact, I even on the, on the Mac stopped using the beta version of Chrome and on my
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:38.580]   phone.
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:39.580]   Yeah.
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:41.140]   It just, even the beta version's gotten a little bit cranky.
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:42.140]   Yeah.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:43.140]   Yeah.
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.780]   The beta version had this bug where I tap the menu and it would just crack.
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:46.780]   Yeah.
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:50.740]   Like, yeah, it's unstable, but once I wouldn't go with dev, I might go with beta, but yeah,
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:51.740]   I hear you.
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:52.740]   That's Canary.
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:53.820]   That's Canary, right?
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:54.820]   That's Canary.
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:55.820]   Yes.
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:56.820]   Yes.
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.580]   So I'm excited to see that come now.
[00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:01.860]   Once that's down and stable though, I'm definitely, I'm kind of like, I'm going to use my pixel
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.500]   a little bit more because that's just cool.
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:08.300]   Finally, Android Wear just has an update rolling out.
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:09.500]   I think it's Android Wear 5.0.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:13.420]   And in fact, I literally just got the notification that I had a system update.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:17.540]   I tapped it and it said that I have to charge my battery and my charger's upstairs.
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.380]   So I'm on the edge of my seat here.
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:24.300]   But Android Wear 5.0 has a couple of new features.
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:27.980]   First, it's got the launch of the official watch face API.
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:32.340]   This means, thank goodness, that we'll have custom watch faces by designers you actually
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:36.700]   like and things that you actually want your watch to look like.
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:39.340]   And you'll see even in the Play Store, I think, Face-er is one of them.
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:44.780]   A few different apps now are plugging into the official watch face API to offer new watch
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:45.780]   faces.
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.900]   And in fact, I believe the Play Store has a new section.
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:53.820]   Thank you, Jeff, for dropping this into the change log, just for Android Wear watch faces,
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:55.180]   watch face options.
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:59.980]   So really good exciting stuff there for people who want to customize their watch.
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:03.700]   Android Wear 5.0 also has a couple of other new updates.
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:07.420]   There's a new navigation feature, which gives you the ability to bring back cars that you
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.140]   may have accidentally dismissed.
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:13.900]   When you tap on the watch face, the list of actions that you can do is now reordered based
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:17.420]   on how recently they were used, which is nice, a little smarter.
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:21.500]   And it's got new modes, including theater and sunlight that lets you keep the screen dim
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.100]   or boost the brightness.
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:27.500]   So for those of you with Android watches, look for that system update card because it'll
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.340]   be coming soon.
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:30.900]   And that's all I got.
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:36.660]   That's my friends is the Google change log.
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:38.020]   The end.
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:39.020]   The end.
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:40.580]   No JS is forking.
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:43.660]   Somebody in the chat room said, "Do you think they'll cover that on this show?
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.860]   Well, if we don't cover it on this week in Google, what do we wear?
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:46.860]   We'll be covered."
[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:51.980]   Actually, I'm a little concerned about this because it is our plan to do the front end
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:55.180]   of our new website and node JS.
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:58.540]   So node JS, I didn't know this.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:04.660]   It's while it is open and open source project is owned in its entirety by Joyant.
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:10.060]   Is it owned or is it the folks who lead it are employed by Joyant?
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:11.060]   Work at Joyant.
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.060]   I don't know.
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:16.540]   You can clarify this for me because it sounds like there is a group of people who aren't
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.740]   thrilled about Joyant's influence over node JS.
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:20.740]   Okay.
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:24.420]   So it sounds like Joyant is node's official sponsor.
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:25.420]   Okay.
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:28.060]   And so they're kind of in charge of stewardship.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:34.540]   The way that Google is in charge of the Android open source product, for example.
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:35.700]   However, forking.
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:39.620]   No, so I should explain what node JS is, I guess.
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:44.700]   The idea is to use JavaScript to, it's server side or client side.
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:45.860]   It's a little both, right?
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:49.500]   It's a little both, but it's server side JavaScript.
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:53.100]   Primarily server side JavaScript to do websites.
[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:58.020]   And it's very modern and all the hot kids, cool kids are doing it.
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.020]   It's true.
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:00.020]   It's true.
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:01.020]   Node is the new hot thing.
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:02.020]   Everybody loves node.
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:03.020]   Yeah.
[00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:09.020]   But I'm worried because if it's forked, that means there will be at least two nodes of node
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:10.020]   JS.
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:15.380]   Actually, Joyant and the latest, well, actually this isn't Joyant.
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:18.460]   Apparently has been fighting this off for a while.
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:26.100]   So they created an advisory board to offer community input into node JS.
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:31.660]   So last week, some of the developers, contributors, not developers, the youth in the open source
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:38.980]   world, they're called contributors forked the project, creating IO.js.
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:44.620]   The schism, according to this article, it read right by Lauren Orsini.
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:51.500]   The schism surprised the open source community as well as its corporate overseer, Joyant.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:57.260]   Isaac Schuleder has put out a statement saying he's one of the contributors.
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:00.180]   He's a nodes former project lead in its number two contributor.
[00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:04.500]   It says that IO.js will not compete with node.
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:05.780]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:12.060]   And that once he hopes the two projects will merge back together once the company resolves
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:14.220]   issues related to its management of the project.
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:18.140]   So it is a little dissatisfaction with Joyant's involvement.
[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:21.660]   Yeah, yeah, you know, this sounds bad.
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:22.900]   It's not so bad, though.
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.260]   I mean, no, it has enough momentum behind it.
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:28.980]   It really depends on the people who leave and fork off.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:34.740]   And you know, maybe this is a lot of times away that an open source project resolves issues,
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:38.060]   you know, you know, you know, you know, you, but when enough people vote with their feet,
[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:43.740]   if it's IO.js does certain things that the community loves that node.js hasn't done,
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:46.260]   they'll figure out a way to merge back together.
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:50.420]   I mean, in some ways, it's like, hey, you know, this is, this is a way that that innovation
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:51.420]   happens.
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:54.100]   It just seems like it's, you know, it feels like a splintering.
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:58.220]   And in this case, it really does seem like there's, there's a genuine conflict here,
[00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:00.620]   but I don't think node.js is going to go away.
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:02.260]   It'll be around in some form.
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:06.820]   Look, if at some point in two years, Leo, you have to upgrade from or laterally grade
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:12.660]   from node.js IO.js, like that won't be a big deal.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:14.260]   I wouldn't be worried about your project.
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:16.100]   Oh, we're going to use Angular anyway.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:18.100]   It's the new hotness.
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:19.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:20.940]   Yeah.
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:21.940]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:22.940]   Yeah.
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:23.940]   All right.
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:26.020]   See, I come here.
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:29.900]   I know when I read these stories, I know that I can come and I'm Gina will explain this
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:35.140]   all to me, or I read about the new republic and I know I can come here and Jeff will explain
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:36.500]   it all to me.
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:40.460]   That's why you guys are here to help me understand what's going on.
[00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:43.420]   So thank you.
[00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:48.580]   Eric Schmidt says, hey, don't worry about the killer AI robots.
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:49.740]   That has been an amazing story.
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.020]   Hasn't everybody been going berserkle on that?
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:59.780]   You know, even Elon Musk has been saying that AI is this huge danger.
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:01.100]   I'm not sure I disagree.
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:07.860]   We've had a number of interviews on triangulation on this subject, including a guy named Barrett
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:11.580]   who wrote a book, Our Last Invention.
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:14.620]   Now he's not a scientist or a computer programmer.
[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:19.180]   He's a journalist, but he has talked to a bunch of people in artificial intelligence.
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:24.300]   And he says, he's a surprising consensus in the AI community that now is the time to
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:25.300]   start thinking.
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:26.500]   You know what I think it is, Leo?
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:29.300]   I think that's hubris in the AI community.
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:31.700]   Maybe we're going to get really smart machines.
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:32.700]   Yeah.
[00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:33.700]   Yeah.
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:34.700]   Yeah.
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:35.700]   We're really dangerous.
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:36.700]   We're not nursing more.
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:37.700]   We could kill everybody.
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:45.140]   Show me how far along AI is, except trying to kill two guys on Jeopardy.
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:50.260]   We had a guy who, Nick Bostrom, who is one of these really top academics in this area.
[00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.620]   He's written a book called Superintelligence.
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:55.660]   He was on two weeks ago on triangulation.
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:59.420]   He's a kind of interesting multi-disciplinary threat.
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:01.980]   He's a philosopher and a scientist.
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:04.620]   He's at Oxford.
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:10.100]   And his thesis is, it's going to happen.
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:11.660]   It's not going to happen.
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:12.660]   He says, we don't know when.
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:15.740]   It could happen as Ray Kurzweil says in the next few decades.
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:17.780]   It could happen in 200 years.
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:22.060]   But at some point, you're going to create an intelligent machinery.
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:27.780]   And he said, the problem is we don't have any kind of fundamental ethical basis for
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:32.100]   how this machinery should be designed so that it doesn't.
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:34.580]   He says, for instance, if you create
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:39.980]   the ultimate paperclip making machine, eventually it would turn the whole world, including all
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:42.540]   humans, and the paperclips.
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:51.900]   And so the time is now to think about these issues so that when they do get, as they get
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:53.740]   smarter, that we're prepared.
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:57.380]   He said, we know, you know, asimov's robotic rules are not right.
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:59.100]   They're not sufficient.
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:04.540]   They have all sorts of, you almost need somebody to work on this like a Bertrand Russell.
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:10.780]   This is kind of this higher order philosophical, ethical, scientific thinking that.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:15.140]   But anyway, Eric Schmidt says, relax.
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.140]   I trust Eric.
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:17.220]   He knows.
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.340]   He says, these fears are normal.
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:22.540]   He was speaking at a Financial Times conference.
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:27.660]   They're also, to some degree, misguided.
[00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:30.140]   Don't fear artificial intelligence.
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:33.980]   Welcome our new overlords.
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:37.740]   I like the photo of Schmidt that they chose for the Business Insider article.
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:38.740]   Yeah.
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:39.740]   What is he pushing up?
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:40.740]   What is he doing?
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:41.740]   Yeah, it sort of fades.
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:46.340]   He's like a tiny little man.
[00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:52.140]   Schmidt admits sitting shotgun in a self-driving car is not an altogether happy experience,
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:54.820]   i.e. terrifying.
[00:59:54.820 --> 01:00:01.900]   But you don't have to worry about machines stealing our jobs and taking over the world.
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:04.980]   When Schmidt people have been concerned about machines taking over the world for centuries,
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:05.980]   it doesn't make it okay.
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:08.220]   It doesn't make it mean that it's wrong.
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.860]   Go back to the history of the loom.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.300]   There was absolute dislocation.
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:15.620]   But I think all of us are better off with more mechanized ways of getting clothes made.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:18.620]   There's lots of evidence that when computers show up, wages go up.
[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:20.740]   See, he's not really addressing these issues.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:23.780]   And I think people who are really involved in AI, you're right.
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:28.460]   There's hubris because there is the underlying assumption that at some point we will make
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:31.100]   an intelligent machine.
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:35.580]   But do you think, Jeff, that we should pretend that we should act as if we never were?
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:36.580]   No, no, we should.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:37.580]   You're absolutely right.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.580]   We should have the discussion.
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:40.260]   But guess where that quickly goes?
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:46.500]   It quickly goes to, why don't I pick on them, the EU passing laws, limiting the technology
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.220]   that's not even invented yet?
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:50.780]   Well, none of these AI experts want that.
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.380]   This is their meat and potatoes.
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:55.380]   They want to have AI.
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:58.460]   But I'm just saying, beware.
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:00:59.460]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:03.540]   I agree with the panic that will inevitably emerge.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:07.340]   And that's, I'll be on back on this show in a few months and we'll see people screaming
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.340]   somewhere in the world.
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.340]   No, that's right.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.340]   Not just Europe.
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:16.380]   Demanding regulation of artificial intelligence for God's sakes, the smartest man on earth
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:18.860]   says that we're in trouble.
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:22.700]   The craziest man on earth, God wants to be on a must, says we're in trouble.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.460]   We must do something.
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:27.660]   And we're at the point now where as soon as new technologies come out, they get regulated.
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:29.420]   At least they're out.
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:32.860]   And the regulation won't stop this anyway because this is going to continue.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:42.140]   This is Ned Ludd and his Luddites didn't stop jacquard looms either.
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:43.780]   So I don't think, I don't, I agree.
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:46.100]   You don't want this whole technopanic thing to get out of control.
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.100]   And of course, you know what?
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:50.100]   You can also predict that it will, Jeff.
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:52.300]   But it's not going to stop it.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.900]   I don't know.
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:56.460]   I don't know.
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:58.300]   You and I will be long dead.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:01.180]   Yeah, it doesn't really matter.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:04.660]   You kids go ahead and do whatever you want.
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:07.500]   Make paper clips.
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.780]   Turn everybody into a paper clip.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.220]   I don't care.
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.140]   Googles road to virtual reality begins with cardboard.
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:18.220]   I love my Google cardboard.
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:19.460]   I love cardboard.
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:21.660]   I still think cardboard's amazing.
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:27.980]   Well, apparently Nicole Lee, who we know very well, she worked for us for a long time.
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:29.140]   She's an engadget.
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:33.260]   She says, I thought cardboard was dumb, but I was wrong.
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:40.620]   Cardboard, well, so cardboard is a, there's a cardboard SDK not only for Android, but
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:44.020]   for Unity, which is a very powerful gaming platform.
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:48.860]   A lot of games are written in Unity.
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:51.660]   Maybe we're going to see more for cardboard.
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:55.660]   This is Google's response to Oculus Rift and the billions of dollars at Facebook's
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:57.540]   Spinal Oculus Rift.
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:03.580]   You just need a little cardboard and a smartphone.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:06.620]   It's a good article, Nicole wrote, on the history of cardboard.
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:10.500]   It's so interesting to me that they named it cardboard because it's funny, like we were
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:15.340]   talking about the Samsung Gear VR last night and all about Android and our guest.
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:19.660]   And I was saying, putting that thing up on my face, I just don't want to do it, right?
[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:23.020]   But cardboard looks like a kid's project.
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:27.980]   I mean, it sort of makes fun of itself just by the fact that it's Velcro and stickers
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:30.660]   and magnets.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:35.180]   And I just think that Google did the right thing by calling it cardboard and making it
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:36.740]   this thing that you fold up.
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:40.580]   The thing that you keep on your desk, so when you come to a co-workers, they'd be like,
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:41.580]   "Oh, let me check this out."
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:45.660]   Whereas the Gear VR takes itself so seriously that I think it turns off people because it's
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:48.220]   just this giant things strapped to your head.
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:52.980]   Well, and ironically, I think the functionality of Google cardboard is no less than the function
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:56.900]   of the functionality because you still need a Samsung phone in the Samsung handset.
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.060]   It's not that much less.
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:03.500]   I mean, probably technically it's probably very much less, but it's not less enough for
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.740]   anyone who's a casual user to notice.
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:06.740]   You know what I mean?
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:12.540]   So I feel like cardboard is going to do more for VR than something like even Oculus or the
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:13.540]   Gear VR.
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:17.180]   And I just think that this is a brilliant, kind of an uncharacteristically brilliant
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:19.980]   marketing or naming thing that Google did here.
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:22.780]   I was like, "Oh, yeah, this was the right way to do this."
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:28.660]   And the way they just sort of off-handed joke, they threw off, but then they're in the keynote.
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:30.700]   At the Google I/O, they handed these out.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.700]   Yeah.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:32.700]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:33.700]   Leo, what?
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.700]   Leo, my big question is, will an X is 6-fit?
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:37.700]   Oh, no.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.700]   Oh, that's a really good question.
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:40.700]   No.
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:41.700]   No.
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:42.700]   Oh.
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:43.700]   I don't think so.
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:44.700]   Jason, you have yours.
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.860]   All right, we're going to find out.
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:52.860]   I have my cardboard here, thanks to, by the way, Gina, who brought me this back for the
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:54.220]   Google I/O.
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:56.060]   She made it.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.060]   She made it.
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.820]   Okay, in the back seat of a car.
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:01.740]   I refused to look at the directions, by the way.
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.220]   I just fumbled with it.
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:04.220]   Oh.
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:05.220]   Oh.
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.220]   What kind of fit?
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:07.220]   Yeah.
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.220]   Yeah.
[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:10.220]   You'd have to just comb it a little differently.
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:11.220]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:12.700]   You'd just make a bigger one.
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:13.900]   You need a jumbo cardboard.
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:14.900]   Yeah.
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.660]   They're going to have to do different sizes of cardboard now.
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:18.380]   And it has NFC in it.
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:22.620]   So maybe you could, yeah, you could, you know what?
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:25.100]   That's the beauty of cardboard.
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:26.100]   You can easily cut it.
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:27.100]   It doesn't matter.
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.100]   Oh, my cardboard is running.
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.100]   Wait a minute.
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:33.180]   So the NFC kicks in and it says, put on your viewer.
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:34.700]   Now, what do you want to do?
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:35.700]   You want to do it?
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:36.700]   I got to take off my glasses.
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:37.700]   Do you want to do airplane?
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:38.700]   Wait a minute.
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:39.700]   I got cardboard.
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:42.940]   There's a new store for things.
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.140]   Are there new apps?
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.140]   Up yet?
[01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:52.420]   You know, I don't know if there is a cardboard app, Paul McCartney concert, the whole world.
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:55.300]   Pull and release ring to click.
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:58.300]   That's not working.
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:01.420]   This cardboard is a little funkified.
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.420]   But I--
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:03.420]   Gee-dah.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.220]   Maybe because Gina didn't read the rules.
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:08.140]   It's possible that's because I didn't read the instructions.
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:12.420]   No, this used to work, but it's just been lying around.
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:13.420]   That's all.
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:17.140]   I see that this dirt, dirt, dirt doesn't--
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.300]   So I could show you.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.660]   See, it's a stereo thing.
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:23.860]   So there's stereo eyepieces in here.
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:28.580]   And then the phone immediately, when you put it in, senses, I guess via NFC, that it
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:29.940]   should launch the cardboard app.
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.260]   If you have the cardboard app, it'll launch.
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:34.780]   And you could see it then has-- can you see that?
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.900]   It has a left and right screen.
[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:39.500]   So this says pull ring to release.
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.940]   But when you look at it through the stereo viewer, you see one image.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:44.300]   It's going to be a 3D image.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.540]   But the clicking's not working, so I have to work on that.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:50.700]   That might be a droid turbo issue.
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:52.580]   But people are making cardboard.
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:56.060]   Dotto case is making a-- you can buy it.
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:56.660]   Oh, really?
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:57.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:57.860]   Oh, wow.
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:01.260]   Yeah, that happened almost like the day after Google I/O.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:04.100]   Yeah, I'm looking at I am cardboard.com.
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:05.580]   There's tons of different colors and models.
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.140]   You can get plans.
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:11.860]   I bet you they're going to make one for the Nexus 6, just the right size.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:12.860]   Yeah, just the right size.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:17.460]   Here's the Google Play store page.
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:18.420]   Oh, there is a habit for--
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:20.100]   Oh, and the after cardboard, yeah.
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:20.620]   Yeah.
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.620]   Now, I think Dotto case is overcharging for their cardboard.
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:27.340]   It's $25.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:28.420]   Wow.
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:30.020]   It's pretty much the same.
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:33.780]   Well, Dotto case is-- it's not premium, is it?
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:34.380]   Yes.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:37.340]   Well, it looks like premium-- yes, it's premium cardboard.
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:37.900]   Premium card.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.180]   Made from actual trees.
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.180]   I don't know.
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.700]   Are they-- I wonder if they're making it with books?
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:43.620]   Oh, it's up to--
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:44.100]   Oh, no.
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.860]   No, this looks like regular card-gated cardboards.
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:47.780]   Yeah, that's regular cardboard.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.620]   I don't know why they charge so much.
[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:51.820]   New capacitive touch button mechanism
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:55.260]   works with all devices, including iPhone 6.
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:56.260]   What?
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:57.260]   Hmm.
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:58.620]   Does it come assembled or anything like that?
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:01.940]   Oh, oh, look at that.
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:05.980]   Oh, they launched the hat.
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:07.100]   You know, the--
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:09.500]   It's the MotoX hat thing.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.500]   Oh.
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.100]   There's the mouse.
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:17.620]   Little Django, big Django.
[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:18.620]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:21.660]   This is the really-- this is Twitch for stupid people.
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.460]   The problem with VR is that watching other people do it
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.420]   is completely unsatisfying.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:28.380]   I should do a Twitch channel, so--
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:29.700]   Just me doing this.
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:35.620]   That would be a good Twitch channel.
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:37.020]   I want to do a Twitch channel that's
[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:41.780]   called the dumb gamer or the bad gamer, where I don't--
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:42.740]   I'm clueless.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:44.500]   Like, it's like grandma.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:45.460]   I like that.
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:46.780]   Wouldn't that be good?
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:48.060]   What do you do now?
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:49.060]   Shoot.
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:50.140]   Oh, shoot now.
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:53.740]   Oh, oh, wait.
[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:56.820]   Unofficialcardboard.com has two sizes--
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:58.140]   Classic and Large.
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:02.700]   So you can-- Jeff get one that will fit your Nexus 6.
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:04.100]   Oh.
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:04.940]   Yes.
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:08.780]   And yeah, this is pretty cool.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:11.700]   I haven't even opened mine yet from Google I/O.
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:12.820]   At the same end, I'm like, oh, no, that's--
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:13.860]   Oh, no, hold onto it.
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:14.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.380]   And it's unopened for it.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.860]   Oh, no, no.
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:18.660]   That's like an action figure in the box.
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:19.660]   Exactly.
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:20.180]   That is--
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:21.380]   The Minted box.
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.580]   That is valuable.
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.460]   That is very valuable stuff.
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:27.820]   Mint unfolded cardboard.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:29.900]   I've got Mint card digital.
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:32.220]   This is where it all began, kids.
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:33.820]   And then the robots took over.
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:36.500]   And well, ever since we've been living in the sewer pipes
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:37.900]   under town--
[01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:39.700]   Everything turned into paper clips.
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:40.420]   Yep.
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:42.860]   But there's no paper clip shortage.
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:43.660]   I can tell you that.
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:49.180]   The-- well, Scott, you put so many stories in here.
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:50.380]   I don't know what even to look at.
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.420]   What do you guys like?
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:52.140]   Pick a story.
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:53.500]   Tell you what, I'll take a break.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:56.180]   Gina Pick 1, Jeff Pick 1.
[01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:58.260]   We'll be back in a second after this word.
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.820]   From Squarespace, that's my pick--
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:02.980]   the place to make your next website,
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:05.100]   the best hosting plus the best software,
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:07.220]   merge together to make it not only easy for you,
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:11.340]   but great for your clients, your customers, your readers.
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:14.340]   If you're a blogger, a photographer, if you're a band,
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:18.260]   if you want to sell stuff online, Squarespace 7 is here,
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:22.300]   which makes it absolutely easy, completely redesigned
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:23.580]   interface.
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:26.580]   In fact, now they have templates for specific businesses.
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:29.020]   They've been working with businesses to help set these up.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:32.380]   So if you're a band, for instance, the Horizon template
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:35.700]   has tour dates, music player, and a merch store.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.820]   If you're an artist and architect, a chef,
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:41.300]   they've got category specific templates just for you.
[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:43.220]   But the truth is, any Squarespace template
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:45.300]   can be used to do anything.
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:46.500]   It's so gorgeous.
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.940]   Easier editing too now, you can live edit right on one screen,
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:52.940]   no more toggling between site manager and preview mode.
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:55.620]   You can even preview your design in a device mode
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:59.020]   so you'll know what your site looks like on a tablet
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:00.340]   or a phone.
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:03.060]   All Squarespace sites are mobile responsive.
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:04.580]   They use state of the art technology
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:08.740]   to make sure your site looks absolutely stellar and unique,
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:10.100]   which I think is important.
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.620]   These aren't cookie cutter templates.
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.180]   This is amazing.
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.020]   Plus, you get instant access to professional stock
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.660]   photography from Getty, instant branded email
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:21.060]   set up with Google Apps, a developer platform that's
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:21.700]   second to none.
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:24.980]   If you are a developer, you're going to love this with its editor
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:27.380]   with syntax, color coding, and more.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:29.660]   Ecommerce enabled on every single site
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.020]   for all subscription plan levels.
[01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.260]   And man, do they have the best help in the world,
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:36.740]   right from their offices 24/7.
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:40.860]   Plus, a portal for self help with articles, video workshops.
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.580]   All this, as little as $8 a month,
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:44.980]   and that includes a free domain name
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:46.100]   when you sign up for here.
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:47.900]   Best thing to do, go to squarespace.com,
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:50.060]   click the Get Started button, and play with it.
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:50.860]   Absolutely free.
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:53.100]   You don't even need to give them a credit card.
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:55.940]   You can also try out their free apps, the portfolio,
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:58.340]   the note, the metric, the blog app.
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:00.220]   Noting a blogger now available on Android 2.
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:01.380]   Notes just a note taking app.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:05.140]   Blog app lets you post to your site, moderate comments.
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:08.460]   The metric app lets you measure social follows,
[01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:10.340]   visitors, and all of that.
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:11.660]   Best hosting, best software.
[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:12.660]   What more could you ask for?
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:16.340]   Start that free two-week trial right now at squarespace.com.

[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:23.340]   to get 10% off.
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:23.980]   I love it.
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.340]   And by the way, if you're in existing,
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.220]   if you're one of the people who's been listening to our ads
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.580]   and already has a squarespace site,
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:30.500]   you can just go to the Settings tab
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:31.980]   and activate squarespace 7.
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.060]   You'll love all the new features.
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:36.340]   Squarespace, start here.
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:37.780]   Go anywhere.
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:40.980]   Squarespace.com.
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:49.420]   Are you guys using Inbox still?
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:51.100]   I never switched over to it because they
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.540]   don't support Google Apps yet.
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:53.060]   Oh, that's right.
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:55.220]   I'm waiting impatiently.
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:59.180]   There was an AMA with the Google Inbox developers,
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:01.820]   and they say they know this, and they're working on it.
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:02.900]   They're working on it.
[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:04.380]   Yeah, the app's been good.
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:07.420]   I mean, I think everyone agrees it's a hit.
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:10.620]   Good, because I am hooked.
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.820]   Yeah, I'm dying.
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:13.820]   I'm dying to use it.
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:14.460]   I really am.
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:15.380]   Love it.
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:16.700]   And Jeff, you have the same problem, right?
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:17.860]   You're an apps user.
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:18.420]   Same problem.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.780]   So I go in and say, "I don't want to go to,"
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:21.980]   because it's my university account
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:25.900]   that I got all messed up with stuff I don't read.
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.780]   They are going to start allowing support for more than just
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:33.100]   Gmail, a unified Inbox for all your email addresses,
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:34.340]   cross-browser support.
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:36.740]   I didn't know this, but you can only use it in Chrome right now.
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:38.260]   That's what I use, so I never noticed.
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:38.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:42.860]   They are going to make it work with Safari.
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:43.940]   And presumably other--
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:44.940]   Any group of us planning with that?
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:47.100]   Yeah.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:54.700]   And they do say-- I thought this was the most encouraging--
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:57.380]   Jason Cornwell, who's the interaction designer.
[01:13:57.380 --> 01:13:57.940]   Hi, Jason.
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:13:59.820]   We know you watch.
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:02.580]   Jason said, "There's a long list of Gmail features
[01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:04.780]   that will eventually come to Inbox."
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:08.260]   In other words, parity with Gmail.
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:10.380]   "We really want to balance building those features
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:13.020]   with building out new features that continue
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:16.700]   to improve the Inbox product concept.
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:17.940]   Undo send tool."
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:21.140]   I don't care about Undo send.
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:22.140]   Yeah.
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:23.100]   You used it a lot?
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:24.740]   There's times I wish for.
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:27.020]   Drunk emailing?
[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.260]   I don't even have much of a drunk.
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.220]   You're doing slacking now.
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:33.100]   There is an Undo on Delete or archive, which I really like,
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.540]   because I frequently accidentally click this sweep thing
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:37.660]   and then I go, oh, Undo that is very easy.
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:40.900]   I'm waiting for Gina's next insight on ThinkUp,
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:43.300]   which is the tweets Jeff Jarvis should have deleted.
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:46.820]   I'm working on that one now.
[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:48.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:50.300]   I got a funny incident the other day.
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.180]   Leo, do you know how many times I
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:54.540]   used the F word on Twitter this year?
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:56.740]   How many times?
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:57.900]   What do you guess?
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:14:58.900]   273.
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:00.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:01.820]   Merely.
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:03.340]   Merely.
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:04.300]   39.
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:04.860]   What?
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:06.500]   And then 40 when I complained about it.
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.460]   I was amazed.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.260]   What?
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:10.180]   You complain-- wait a minute.
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:15.060]   You complain and you use the F word twice when you complain?
[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:17.140]   Well, then I said OF.
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:18.140]   OF.
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:18.660]   OF.
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:20.860]   So there are you doing year end insights on ThinkUp?
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:21.140]   We are.
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:22.180]   We're doing best of 2014.
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:26.260]   We're doing one best of year end insight per day in December,
[01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:27.420]   which have been really, really fun.
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:28.500]   People love them.
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:29.260]   They've been great.
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:30.140]   Oh, I got to go there.
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:30.500]   Right now.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:31.500]   So glad you've been joined.
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:35.020]   Then Gina told me how many words I tweeted in the year.
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:37.780]   And of course, I had to point out the 39 of them were the F word.
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:39.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:43.460]   The F on insight was like tailored for you, Jeff.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.580]   I was afraid you did it just for me.
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:47.420]   I was afraid it was called the Jarvis Insight.
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:48.780]   All right, well, let me see here.
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:52.140]   I tweeted 10,483 words in 2014.
[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:53.540]   How many did you?
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:54.140]   That's good.
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.060]   That's good.
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:57.700]   I think I was like 12K.
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:04.660]   That would be not very long, but that would be a book about 38 pages.
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:11.340]   For some reason, September was a busy month with 2,641 words.
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:13.540]   And then this is the Facebook thing.
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:18.100]   I want to know how many of those 10,000 words were F bombs.
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:20.860]   So click on the "See More" button and the header there.
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:22.020]   Oh.
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:23.220]   Where it says best 2014.
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:24.500]   "See More."
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.420]   Yeah, and so these are all your best ofs.
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:29.700]   And then you'll see.
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:32.220]   And if you've never used the F word,
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:34.980]   you don't have the insight at all, because we're not trying to--
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:35.620]   Right.
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:38.140]   You use the F word zero times.
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:39.100]   Right, right.
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:42.180]   We don't show that insight.
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:47.420]   I tweeted 78,933 words so far.
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:47.940]   Wow.
[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:49.460]   73,000.
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:49.980]   Wow.
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.540]   78,000.
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:54.620]   My updates resonated with men.
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:17:00.220]   76% of my updates were liked or commented on by people who
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:02.900]   identify as male.
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:05.660]   Can you identify as male or female?
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:06.460]   Well, yeah.
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:06.940]   Well, yeah.
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:10.340]   Oh, dear, 218 tweets had exclamation marks.
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:11.660]   That's almost a third.
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:14.020]   That's bad.
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.340]   It's not so good.
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.300]   This is my most popular picture on Twitter.
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.380]   This is when Lisa and I were featured in Mad Magazine.
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:21.020]   Oh, that's right.
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:22.140]   Yeah.
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:25.260]   That's my most popular picture ever.
[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:26.740]   My most talkative day on Twitter
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:28.220]   was September 12.
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:30.540]   I tweeted 28 times.
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:31.740]   Good Lord.
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:32.660]   Tweets storm.
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:34.900]   Tweets storm.
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.900]   I don't see any F words.
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:38.500]   Yeah, I think you kept it clean, Leo.
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:41.380]   You kept it clean.
[01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:47.060]   I tweeted to Mark Andreessen 98 times in the year
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.860]   and he replied 44 times.
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:49.540]   Wow.
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:50.860]   OMG.
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:53.060]   OMG, get a room that says think up.
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:18:01.780]   Jeff and Mark sitting in a tree.
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:05.220]   Drew Nilsen wants to know, do I need a paid membership
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:06.620]   to get these insights?
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:07.140]   Nope.
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:07.980]   Nope, free trial.
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:09.940]   If you sign up for the free trial right now,
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:12.220]   all your insights for the month will be backfilled.
[01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.380]   You'll get all your best ofs.
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:15.940]   And you've got a free trial for the next two weeks.
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:17.140]   So you'll get all of them.
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:19.340]   Now's the time you've been putting it off.
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:21.260]   Thinkup.com.
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:21.740]   Yeah.
[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:22.020]   Yeah.
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:25.980]   This is the first time that we've had insights go viral.
[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:27.260]   People really talk about it.
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:28.260]   It makes a lot of sense.
[01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:29.780]   It's when you look back.
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:32.820]   But yeah, we've had a gangbusters sign-up day,
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:34.060]   the last few days.
[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:34.500]   Good.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.220]   And it was like, oh, OK.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:37.540]   Like, people care about this stuff.
[01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:40.380]   But this is the time of year that people care about this stuff.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.540]   Yeah, some of these have landed, too, oh.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:43.860]   All about ego.
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:44.580]   Enough about you.
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:45.300]   What about me?
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:47.380]   How many times did I use the app for?
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:48.020]   Yeah.
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:50.380]   Yeah, we had one called Twitter Bestie,
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:52.420]   which would tell you the person that you replied to the most
[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:53.820]   and who replied back to you.
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:55.540]   The get a room won.
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:57.660]   And so that copy landed really well.
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.500]   And then people would be like, well, what about mine?
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:00.580]   And so it kind of traveled.
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:02.860]   We'd see people tweet at one another, hey, you're my bestie.
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:04.220]   And then we'd watch that of the person sign up.
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:07.580]   So it was really fun to see that.
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:09.100]   It's kind of trickled through the network.
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:10.220]   Yeah.
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:13.820]   Here's the one that's really most obnoxious.
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:17.020]   In 2014, 28% of Jeff Jarvis's tweets,
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:20.260]   a grand total of 2,511 contained the words,
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:23.220]   I, me, my, my, myself.
[01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:26.740]   Sometimes you just got to get personal.
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:27.860]   No judgment.
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:28.660]   No judgment.
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:29.980]   That's nice.
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:31.900]   You used to have a judgment in that one,
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:33.500]   but you took it out.
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:37.060]   You took it out.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.540]   This is-- I love it.
[01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:40.220]   A little-- but that was a little ad for ThinkUp.
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:40.460]   We just--
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:40.980]   Thank you.
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:41.740]   Yeah, thank you.
[01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:42.620]   That was unexpected.
[01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:44.060]   I appreciate that.
[01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:45.540]   Gina, what do you think of these stories?
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:47.700]   What do you want to talk about?
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:51.860]   Well, I am kind of excited about Android Studio 1.0 going
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:52.380]   unstable.
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:54.020]   We talked about this on the Olive and Android last night,
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:55.820]   but I wanted to bring it up again,
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:57.180]   because it's pretty neat.
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:58.860]   I've installed it and played around with it.
[01:19:58.860 --> 01:19:59.620]   And it's really neat.
[01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:05.020]   So Android Studio is the IDE, the development tool
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:07.700]   that developers use to make Android apps.
[01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:10.580]   And Android Studio, it's been in beta for a while.
[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:12.820]   We saw a demo of it at Google I/O,
[01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:15.140]   but it went stable just this week, which means--
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:17.140]   This is better than Eclipse.
[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:17.900]   It's better.
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:19.100]   It's definitely better.
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:21.780]   It's based on IntelliJ, and it's way better than Eclipse.
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:25.060]   And Google's clearly invested their resources into it
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:27.260]   and is using it to kind of guide developers.
[01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:30.100]   So when you create a new project in Android Studio,
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.580]   it'll say, you check boxes.
[01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:38.020]   Are you developing for Wear, TV, Android Auto,
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:39.980]   and what screen sizes?
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:42.620]   You can, as you change your layout,
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:44.580]   you can see the way that it would look
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:47.140]   on lots of different screen sizes.
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:48.580]   It's really, really nice.
[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:50.060]   I have to say, it's really slick.
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:52.820]   And I was kind of hesitant to use the beta versions.
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:55.660]   You really don't want to release a production app using
[01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:56.300]   a beta tool.
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:58.620]   But now that it's stable, I feel like developers are really
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:00.340]   going to move over to it.
[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:02.380]   And yeah, it's quite nice.
[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:03.020]   It's quite nice.
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:06.220]   And I think we're going to see a lot more apps with material
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.500]   design and laid out really nicely and working on all
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.620]   different screen sizes and form factors, and for Wear,
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:17.620]   and TV, and Auto do a lot to this tool, which is definitely
[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:20.300]   better than Eclipse, from what I can see.
[01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:21.500]   IntelliJ was paid.
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.500]   Is this free?
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:24.380]   This is free.
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.380]   What's IntelliJ's period?
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:28.340]   Yeah, you have to buy it expensive, I think.
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:29.940]   Yeah, this is definitely free.
[01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:33.100]   This is the official Android ID.
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:37.420]   And it runs on Windows and Mac and Linux, of course.
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:38.020]   Yes.
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:39.020]   Nice.
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:39.940]   Yeah, you have to install it.
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:40.780]   I had a little funkiness.
[01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:42.420]   I had to install the JDK.
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:44.220]   And I had to add one of the keyless files on my Mac,
[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:46.900]   but I got it working.
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:48.500]   And yeah, it's quite nice.
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.180]   Got to do this.
[01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:51.860]   Apple makes Xcode available for its developers.
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:53.300]   And it's a very nice IDE.
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:54.740]   And so you have to compete if you're
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:57.220]   going to get developers, you're going to offer a nice environment.
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:59.300]   Microsoft has a visual studio.
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:02.180]   So I think it's something Google had to do.
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:02.740]   Oh, definitely.
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:03.240]   Definitely.
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.620]   And I think that a lot of developers,
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:07.660]   a job developers feel like Eclipse is really old and clunky
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:09.140]   and slow.
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:10.860]   And so this is kind of the next generation.
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:11.660]   It's really nice.
[01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.980]   So I think consumers are going to start
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:16.220]   to see some of the improvements that Studio improves
[01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:20.140]   or makes easier trickle down and starting really now
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:20.900]   and into next year.
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:23.460]   It's exciting.
[01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:25.380]   Because it's the hour of code.
[01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:28.300]   And I like to celebrate that by learning a new language
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:29.980]   every year.
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:32.940]   By the way, everybody should take advantage of this hour of code
[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:34.820]   now to learn programming.
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:35.700]   Something.
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:36.780]   It's fun.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:37.820]   President did.
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:40.140]   President wrote his first program.
[01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:41.820]   Yeah, he's on GitHub.
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:42.180]   What?
[01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:43.420]   He put it on GitHub?
[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:44.420]   Yeah, he's on GitHub.
[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:45.900]   What's his GitHub account?
[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:48.660]   It's a resident Obama, if I'm not speaking.
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:49.180]   Let me see.
[01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:50.500]   That's a good account.
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:52.860]   Yeah, that's a good account, right?
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:54.540]   There's some great photos of him coding.
[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:55.180]   Yeah, I saw that.
[01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:56.420]   Yeah, there he is.
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:23:02.820]   And look at-- he doesn't have any repositories you can view.
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:04.020]   But he has--
[01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:06.380]   Public activity.
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:09.620]   He contributed to a repository for sunlight labs
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:11.660]   called US laws.
[01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:14.100]   Yeah, he's opened a few issues there.
[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:15.020]   That's great.
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:15.500]   Look at that.
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:16.100]   That's great.
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:18.060]   Look at that.
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:18.700]   This is great.
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:22.100]   So I started looking at Go, Google's Go language.
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:23.340]   Oh, good for you.
[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:24.820]   I like it.
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:26.060]   Yeah?
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:31.980]   So it's-- they're replacing Python, I guess, really.
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:32.460]   Google.
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:33.900]   Well, because Google's a Python domain.
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:39.180]   Yeah, and this is Python-ish, but not a lot of the issues
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:41.820]   people have, like, the white space issue are gone on this.
[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:44.940]   And they have a very nice tour, which I highly recommend.
[01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:48.060]   If people want to play with it with an integrated,
[01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:51.620]   interactive interpreter.
[01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:54.980]   So you can actually walk your way through many of the features
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:59.980]   of Go in this little Go Playground interactively.
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:02.220]   You know what they have that's so cool?
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:04.780]   They say, just ignore formatting.
[01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:06.460]   Type in how you want it.
[01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:10.900]   Because they have this button and they have a formatter
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:12.140]   that you run it through.
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:15.860]   It will reformat everything to the kind of standard
[01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:17.620]   that everybody adheres to.
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:19.460]   So it doesn't have the white space--
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:21.420]   It doesn't use white space.
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:24.900]   Now, it uses braces more as a result.
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:28.380]   But no, I think it's a very nice, very interesting language.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:31.220]   Of course, concurrency is built in.
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:34.220]   Because it's really a web programming language more than Python
[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:35.340]   was.
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:37.980]   So I think really nice.
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.180]   And very easy to learn.
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:41.780]   There's a lot of resources online, of course.
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:42.900]   But start with the tour of Go.
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:45.540]   If you're a programmer or you'd like to learn programming,
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:49.260]   I think this would be a good choice.
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:49.620]   They got it.
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:52.180]   It makes a good language.
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:56.220]   For learning, in my opinion, a good language,
[01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:58.620]   I think having an interpreter that you can try stuff in
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:24:59.340]   is really important.
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:01.620]   That was one of the real advantages Python had.
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:06.540]   You can just say 2 plus 2 and see what happens and hit return.
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:09.060]   But then also kind of a cleanliness of syntax
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:14.860]   and a lot of easy to understand good libraries helps.
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:16.060]   I think it's nicely done.
[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:18.180]   I'm very impressed.
[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:20.900]   It's always sort of a delicate balance between brevity
[01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:23.860]   and clarity, being able to read code
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:26.540]   and get a sense of what it's doing.
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:28.220]   And having an easy to debug.
[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:31.340]   I think having code that's easy to debug is really important.
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:33.340]   Because most of your time, you're not writing code.
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:34.940]   Most of your time, you're debugging code.
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:37.220]   You're figuring out why the code you wrote didn't work.
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:39.700]   Or that someone else wrote didn't work.
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:40.820]   They do a lot of round that.
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:42.140]   That's why they have the formatter.
[01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:45.500]   They have a formatter and a documenter that takes--
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.380]   I mean, most languages have features like this.
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:50.540]   But it's really-- I mean, it's even in this tutorial
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:51.900]   that they have the format button.
[01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:54.620]   So they're really emphasizing that.
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:55.980]   I think this is good.
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:26:00.500]   The one note that I read was there was a really strong debate
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:01.740]   internally in Google.
[01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.260]   They use braces a lot.
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:04.860]   And a lot of the Google primary members
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:07.580]   can you just use brackets that'll save millions of shift
[01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:09.100]   key presses.
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:12.380]   Just use-- as a braces, shift bracket.
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:14.140]   I said, could you just please use bracket?
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:16.380]   But no, they decided to use braces.
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:19.060]   If you've used Python or C, it will be very easily
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:22.980]   clear to you immediately with how the language works.
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:24.260]   And I think it's elegant.
[01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:25.580]   It's really nicely done.
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:30.220]   So speaking of code, and then run out and download
[01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:31.580]   the Android Studio.
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:32.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.780]   Start writing your new app.
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:35.860]   Yeah, build a whole world for your Android phone.
[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:36.580]   Yeah.
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:38.420]   I'm going to do that.
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:40.060]   Start messing with my phone.
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:40.980]   Dude, you should.
[01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:41.780]   You should.
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:42.420]   Yeah.
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:45.300]   It's fun.
[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:48.340]   Jeff Jarvis, what story did you like in there?
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:50.580]   I actually-- I think you did a great job of covering it.
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.900]   I guess all I do is I want to give a plug.
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:55.580]   Did I steal your story, as always?
[01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:56.580]   No, no, you didn't know.
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:57.180]   You didn't do a thing.
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:59.340]   You just did a brilliant job as host, as you always do.
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:01.460]   You picked out too sweet.
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:02.700]   You went around.
[01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:07.220]   You found the best berries in the patch.
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:09.940]   I'm a berry-bearer.
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:13.180]   Andrew Carvin, you want to plug Andy for something?
[01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:14.460]   Andy, who's a great friend.
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:15.660]   You're a new job.
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:16.860]   A tweeter of tweeters.
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:18.860]   And he started something called Reportedly
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:20.780]   as part of PRMIDDR's venture.
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:22.180]   And the idea there is very simple
[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:24.060]   is to go take journalism to people
[01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:27.220]   where they live in Facebook and Instagram and such.
[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:28.380]   I think it's very interesting.
[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:29.460]   So let's give a plug to Andy.
[01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:32.980]   Where do I find Reportedly?
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:34.340]   Reportedly, it's at medium.
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:37.060]   So it's medium.com/reportedly.
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:38.260]   And they also have a Twitter account.
[01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:41.980]   While I'm plugging on Medium.
[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:44.180]   Let me mention that I started last week.
[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:46.340]   After the last show, putting the entirety of Geeks
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:49.460]   Bering Gifts, my book, up on Medium for Free, chapter
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:49.980]   by chapter.
[01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:56.260]   So if you go to medium.com/geeks-bearing-gifts,
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:58.460]   you will find the latest chapter on top.
[01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:01.820]   And I'll be putting them up a bit by bit as we go.
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:03.180]   And I'll be free there.
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:04.180]   I will be ready.
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:04.700]   Nice.
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:05.860]   Nice URL.
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:08.700]   Very nice.
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:09.940]   I cannot wait.
[01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:12.220]   Medium did a great job design it.
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.140]   Yeah, I was going to say, this is really beautiful layout.
[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:16.780]   But that page.
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:17.820]   Except for that page.
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:19.100]   They did a great job.
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:19.820]   Yeah, it's a definite.
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:20.660]   But there, that's nice.
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.100]   Yes.
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.300]   Medium seems to be taking off.
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:26.020]   I mean, I'm impressed they got Steven Levy
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:27.140]   to run their editorial.
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:28.060]   Great stuff.
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:32.780]   Caitley, my old agent, Caitley, is getting stars and celebrities
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:34.500]   and smart people up on Medium to publish.
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.220]   They really are doing a very good job.
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:37.780]   They really are.
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:41.140]   And the fact that Carvin started a whole new news
[01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:43.740]   venture on Medium, I think, is significant.
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:45.340]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:46.820]   Well, that's-- I'm sure would have Williams.
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:48.140]   A great Medium.
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:50.500]   Loves to here.
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:54.300]   And he has Caitley and Evan Hansen and Steven Levy
[01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:54.980]   all working there.
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:56.260]   They're top notch editors.
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:58.660]   And good things are going to happen.
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:28:59.700]   So I'm further in.
[01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:00.700]   Andy's going to do a great job.
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:01.980]   And this is going to be really cool,
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:03.180]   because he does incredible work.
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:05.980]   But I have to share with you all a pet peeve of mine, which
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:08.460]   is any startup name, particularly one
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:10.500]   that has to do with writing that ends in LY,
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.700]   because I had this hatred of adverb.
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:14.900]   It was kind of like banged into my head.
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:15.420]   No adverbs.
[01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:16.740]   It's a major.
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:18.500]   No adverbs.
[01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:21.340]   I always feel sad when I see the dot LY.
[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:24.620]   But I get it's also just the domain, that name thing.
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:25.180]   But that's OK.
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:27.180]   Well, also you're pouring money into Libya.
[01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:29.340]   I don't know if that's a good thing either.
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:31.820]   That's who owns dot LY.
[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:32.540]   That's not a problem.
[01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:36.180]   One of our best graduates has a site called Narratively.
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:38.900]   Those are the word called Contently.
[01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:42.580]   I briefly owned d-a-i dot L-y.
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:43.420]   And I let it go.
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:44.420]   Really?
[01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:45.420]   Yeah.
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:46.700]   I hope you made some money.
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:48.460]   No, I just didn't renew it.
[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:50.820]   And then I had geekly for a while.
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:51.260]   Wow.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:55.940]   All right, the story I picked.
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:59.300]   And I'm hoping that we're going to cover a little bit of this
[01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:00.220]   on Sunday on Twitter.
[01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:01.580]   We're trying to get I Justine on it,
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:06.020]   because she is one of the people in the new YouTube rewind.
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:08.020]   YouTube started doing this a few years ago,
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:11.180]   where they'd make a video that rewinds the year.
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:18.460]   This one out of control, they shot this in eight--
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:21.500]   I think eight locations, five principal shooting days.
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:24.580]   They're at all the YouTube spaces, LA, New York, Tokyo,
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:25.780]   London.
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:29.300]   Many YouTube stars featured in it.
[01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:33.860]   Great music, a few mainstream celebrities as well,
[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:34.660]   including--
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:36.580]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:39.860]   PewDiePie!
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:43.140]   So part of the game is to see how familiar you are
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:45.260]   with YouTube memes, because all of these people
[01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:48.900]   are famous on YouTube.
[01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:51.620]   And as an old man, I can tell you,
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:53.980]   I recognize about five.
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:56.420]   I remember that video, though, right?
[01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:57.540]   The Adam and him claws.
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:06.740]   They did a nice job of transitioning.
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:08.460]   That was Jimmy Kimmel, wasn't it?
[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:08.980]   Yeah.
[01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:09.980]   Yeah, it was.
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:10.980]   You got him.
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:19.220]   Oh, suddenly, we're in Tokyo and New York City.
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:20.860]   That's New York, yeah.
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:23.700]   Hey, the grounds of a stately mansion.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:24.700]   I love this guy.
[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.780]   I don't know who he is, but I love him.
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:27.620]   This is good, too.
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:29.420]   I don't know who these guys are.
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:30.220]   That doesn't need effect.
[01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:31.300]   There's London.
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:33.020]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:35.020]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:37.060]   I think he's put up this cost.
[01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:38.420]   Well, I'm trying to think of it.
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:39.780]   It's got to be tens of millions.
[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:40.420]   I don't know.
[01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:42.540]   Maybe not.
[01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:43.380]   But what it tells you--
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:47.220]   I was trying to think, why does YouTube do this?
[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:50.300]   Partly is to make these people feel like stars, which they are.
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:50.820]   I think it is.
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:52.620]   Because if you don't know YouTube, this is going to say anything
[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:52.900]   to you.
[01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:53.820]   Right.
[01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:54.780]   Yeah.
[01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:56.900]   And then, of course, they had to celebrate the ice bucket
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:59.900]   challenges, which took over YouTube for a few months this
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:01.620]   summer.
[01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:02.780]   And there's quite a few.
[01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:06.180]   They really handle this well, the transitions from set
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:08.860]   to set are really well done, I think.
[01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:10.700]   Everybody's dumping water on each other.
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:13.700]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:16.980]   And so I had Michael, our 11-year-old.
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:17.540]   I sat him down.
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:18.780]   I said, do you know these people?
[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:20.660]   He named every one of them.
[01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:21.180]   Wow.
[01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:23.340]   Every-- he said, oh, yeah, that's--
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:24.900]   Well, they're doing-- they do ads.
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:26.740]   YouTube does ads on the subway in Manhattan
[01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:29.180]   here with different YouTube stars.
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:30.780]   And I never know any of them.
[01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:33.100]   I'm like, oh, that channel must be great.
[01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:33.820]   I'm going to check it out.
[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:36.140]   I'm fragmented because-- is that me, shell fan?
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:40.140]   It's kind of fragmented because nobody knows--
[01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:41.660]   I wouldn't think anybody would know all of them.
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:42.020]   He did.
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:44.540]   Kids do, I guess.
[01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:45.420]   Or even know all of them.
[01:32:45.420 --> 01:32:46.660]   How does it feel to be old, Gina?
[01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:47.740]   Rhett and Link, I know them.
[01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:50.860]   Yeah, no.
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:51.940]   It makes me feel really old.
[01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:54.500]   I thought I was like, I told you the idea in 2015,
[01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:56.660]   at least for a couple of months, to just be Instagram
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:58.460]   and Tumblr only, because that's clearly
[01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:00.060]   where the kids are at YouTube.
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:01.060]   That's Jenna Marbles, right?
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:01.460]   And Twitch, maybe.
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:02.300]   Go crazy.
[01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:06.060]   But I would be a stranger in a strange land.
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:08.060]   It's pretty well done, I got to say.
[01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:08.580]   And you know--
[01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:10.140]   It's a great, epic video.
[01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:12.420]   The rights involved in this--
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:13.460]   the music, of course.
[01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:19.620]   It's really nicely done.
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:21.580]   A lot of these-- a lot of the sets
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:27.260]   were from YouTube spaces in New York, LA, London, and Tokyo.
[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:27.700]   Space and New York--
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:30.780]   Did anyone we know work on this?
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:31.620]   Ooh.
[01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:32.660]   Creepy.
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:34.660]   Creepy, baby.
[01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:37.260]   I'll bet your former producer--
[01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:37.940]   Eileen.
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:39.380]   Eileen, for sure, we're going on the LA.
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:40.140]   That's this.
[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:40.740]   OK, yeah.
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:41.780]   Did Eileen work on this?
[01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:42.540]   Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:43.340]   Here's John Oliver.
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:43.700]   Look.
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:44.620]   I saw Eileen.
[01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:45.140]   I didn't tell you.
[01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:48.380]   I saw her in New York with the open, the space there.
[01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:49.300]   And she's better.
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:50.620]   She's getting ready.
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:52.260]   Oh, yes, she was part of that.
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.700]   Great.
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:55.860]   Big bird.
[01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:56.860]   I know big bird.
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:57.860]   Yeah, there's some--
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:00.220]   There's some mainstream stuff.
[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:02.340]   Here comes Conan.
[01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:03.820]   Conan.
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:04.820]   Coco.
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:11.260]   Little Slappy Bird action.
[01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:19.300]   A few of these are viral videos, but most of them
[01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:22.180]   are channels, right?
[01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:25.660]   If you like the Adam and Adam Claws,
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:26.980]   here's the Justine is in this one.
[01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:28.220]   Look at this.
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:29.980]   Let it go.
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:31.460]   Let it go.
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:32.740]   Oh, nice.
[01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:34.020]   A little frozen action.
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:35.020]   OK.
[01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:36.020]   Let it go.
[01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:37.020]   Let it go.
[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:38.020]   Let it go.
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:39.620]   This is really quite well done.
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:42.700]   Yeah, this is great.
[01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:43.940]   A positive one we see.
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:45.340]   There's Justine right there.
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:46.340]   Nice.
[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:47.580]   Hey, Justine.
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:49.980]   Hey, we know one person in this whole dang video.
[01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:53.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:58.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:01.340]   It's pretty spectacular.
[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:04.260]   Although, you know, I mean, all this stuff
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:07.620]   could be done with green screen and so forth.
[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:11.860]   They do what's nice besides putting all of the YouTube
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:13.100]   channel stars in here.
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.700]   They also give them credit at the end.
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:18.340]   So there we are in Tokyo.
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:21.740]   And you'll see they'll-- if you didn't know,
[01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:23.620]   there's a guide at the end.
[01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:28.220]   Oh, by the way, here's a hamster eating a YouTube gum drop.
[01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:29.900]   Oh, OK, that's cute.
[01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:30.420]   So--
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:32.660]   Yeah, is this like the guide for old people
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:33.620]   who don't know what's going on?
[01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:34.660]   Yeah, if you don't--
[01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:34.700]   Oh, my good.
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:37.340]   If you aren't smart, here's who you just saw.
[01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:40.100]   PewDiePie's guide is Minecraft, Jenna Marbles, Bethany Moda.
[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:41.300]   You die pie.
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:42.300]   What is that?
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:42.800]   Cute.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:48.100]   Smosh, Rhett and Link, Michelle Phan, Jimmy Kimmel, Big Bird,
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:50.180]   John Oliver, Stephen Colbert, Chris Hardwick's in this.
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:51.180]   Conan O'Brien.
[01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:52.940]   That's those are the big star guys.
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:56.060]   Freddy Wong, epic rap battles.
[01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:58.980]   Everybody knows them.
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:02.300]   Amazing Phil.
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:04.300]   Yeah, it just shows you--
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:04.780]   Wow.
[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:05.700]   Yeah, the Gregory Brothers.
[01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:06.620]   All of these names, I don't even--
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:07.860]   Yeah.
[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:09.540]   Well, these people are all pretty big,
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:11.100]   I would say, with millions of subscribers
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:14.420]   in all of those channels.
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:17.220]   Kid President, love him.
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:19.020]   He saws two and three.
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:20.140]   Tiny hamsters.
[01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:21.580]   The hamster's still nibbling.
[01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:23.940]   Tiny hamster, I just dean.
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:26.540]   Enjoy Phoenix, Bart Baker.
[01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:27.420]   Makeup by Matty.
[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:33.420]   There you go.
[01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:34.980]   That is the big YouTube.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:36.220]   They are pretty amazing.
[01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:37.660]   The big YouTube rewind.
[01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:39.140]   Each year, they get crazier and crazier.
[01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:40.900]   Remember last year was a parody.
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:41.900]   And I wonder what the--
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:44.700]   Here's an animated PewDiePie.
[01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:46.220]   Oh, this is how it should have ended?
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:47.020]   It should have ended.
[01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:50.700]   He jumps into the roof and face plant.
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:57.740]   Turn down for 2014.
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:36:59.780]   They have a behind the scenes.
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:03.300]   You can go back to the 2013, the 2012, 2011.
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:06.940]   So Zuwojiski is investing.
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:09.020]   Yeah.
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:12.020]   Yeah, it makes sense to me that they would--
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:12.620]   Those?
[01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:14.820]   Because you want to keep those stars happy.
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:16.980]   So making them bigger stars, that's
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:18.940]   good for everybody.
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:24.500]   And I think about my usage of YouTube--
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:25.500]   well, obviously yours too.
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:26.860]   We didn't know who any of those people are.
[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:29.220]   How do we use YouTube?
[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:30.820]   I watch "All Mow With My Kid."
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:37.140]   Yeah, or a viral clip or embedded video from other things.
[01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:38.460]   Yeah.
[01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:40.980]   I think that's probably how most people use YouTube.
[01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:43.780]   But maybe not the most avid YouTube users who are--
[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:46.060]   the people who subscribed all these people's channels.
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:48.740]   Leo, did you see the news at the bottom of that YouTube
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:50.860]   block that totally ties into what you're talking about here?
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:54.780]   Google offering its top makers bonuses
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:58.540]   to sign multi-year deals so that they won't be lured away.
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:01.180]   Yeah, because Yahoo's threatening to steal some of these people.
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:01.700]   Yeah, this art--
[01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:04.660]   And I am in the hunt with some big bucks
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:08.700]   looking to sign some YouTube stars.
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:09.900]   Interesting.
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:12.140]   They want to lock them in for several years.
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:13.940]   Hey, my advice, kids, get an agent
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:16.900]   before you sign that deal.
[01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:20.140]   Yeah, I mean, part of me is really just happy to see
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:24.060]   companies vying for to pay independent content creators.
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:25.060]   Right.
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:25.700]   Lots of money.
[01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:26.300]   This is good.
[01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:29.620]   YouTube tries to shape the kind of content
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:32.020]   by the money they throw around.
[01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:33.740]   Or do they just say, hey, you're a star.
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:36.660]   I'm going to give you money.
[01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:38.540]   There is-- I don't think this is more shape,
[01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:43.900]   but there is a quasi-approval process to use their space.
[01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:46.060]   And I asked about that when I was at the opening.
[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:48.100]   And basically what they're saying is, they're saying,
[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:49.340]   well, we're just trying to save you
[01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:51.740]   the hassle of making something and then finding out
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:53.300]   that it violated some rule or something.
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:55.460]   So let us know what you're going to make before you make it.
[01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:58.020]   OK.
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:01.740]   I have a feeling that if I-- well, if I were Susan,
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:04.860]   I would definitely want to reward the most lucrative
[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:07.460]   partners, because frankly, you wouldn't have thought
[01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:10.620]   PewDiePie, who basically sits in comments and swears
[01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:14.620]   during gameplay videos, would be the number one attraction
[01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:16.100]   on YouTube that he is.
[01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:18.300]   So you don't want to discourage that.
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:20.540]   But at the same time, you don't want to shape YouTube
[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:22.540]   a little bit as to the kind of content.
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:25.460]   I doubt there are many crotch shot video guys getting money.
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:28.100]   Well, it's just like medium.
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:29.500]   I hate this made up word.
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:30.420]   It's platissure.
[01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:32.340]   But you're a platformer and publisher at the same time.
[01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:33.980]   Any crap can go up there.
[01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:35.340]   Because you're a platissure.
[01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:37.340]   Platissure.
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:38.900]   Like the platypus.
[01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:41.940]   It's something that could never exist in nature, but does.
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:46.380]   It's curated user-generated content.
[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:47.180]   Yeah.
[01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:48.820]   Yeah.
[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:49.980]   You can promote the best.
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:51.020]   You can have a brand.
[01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:52.780]   It makes it possible to have a brand,
[01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:54.180]   because you can show the best stuff.
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:40:00.940]   I think it's fantastic.
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:03.860]   If you think about the transformation YouTube has made,
[01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:05.860]   it's unbelievable.
[01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:08.060]   And it's unpredictable.
[01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:08.900]   In internet years.
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:10.820]   But yeah, it's been huge.
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:12.060]   It's under-
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:15.100]   You would never predicted it.
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:17.060]   YouTube, by the way, will tell you now,
[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:21.100]   if you have copyrighted music, how it will affect your video.
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:23.740]   Because one of the problems is some record companies
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:24.820]   will have your video pulled down.
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:27.260]   Others will just put an ad on it.
[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:28.540]   And you don't know ahead of time.
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:32.380]   So now their content ID system will help you figure out
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:34.340]   if you're using copyrighted music.
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:36.300]   And what the label or the artist will do?
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:37.300]   Will it mute the audio?
[01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:39.260]   Will it block the video from being seen?
[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:41.820]   Or will it monetize?
[01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:44.020]   That's a good feature.
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:48.020]   So that's something that's a search feature in the audio library.
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:50.580]   We'll help you with that.
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:52.860]   Most YouTube-- serious YouTube creators
[01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:54.380]   will know all about that.
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:57.700]   But the rest of us with our crotch shot videos,
[01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:00.820]   hey, you never know what's going to happen.
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:01.780]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:04.100]   Your picks of the week or your tip tool
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:06.140]   and number of the week are coming up.
[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:07.780]   Our show today brought to you by Personal Capital.
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:09.300]   Here's my tip for you.
[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:12.140]   Prepare for the future.
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:14.860]   Retirement is sooner than you think, trust me.
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:16.500]   And if you're not thinking about it now,
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:18.780]   even if you're in your 20s, you ought to be.
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:20.380]   The problem, of course, is a challenge
[01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:22.220]   because your accounts are spread out all over the place.
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:23.340]   You've got monies here.
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:24.780]   You've got loans there.
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:26.220]   And you don't know where everything stands.
[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:30.060]   You probably don't-- I bet you don't even know what your net worth is.
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:31.060]   Personal capital will help.
[01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:32.740]   Go to personalcapital.com/twig.
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:36.100]   It's a free tool, free tool that will put everything
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:39.580]   on a single page on your computer, on your tablet, on your phone,
[01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:41.220]   with real time intuitive graphs that
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:43.820]   will let you know how you're doing, what you're worth,
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:45.980]   will help you budget, will help you plan for the future.
[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:47.900]   They even have an Android Wear app.
[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:50.020]   You can download in the Play Store that
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:52.900]   will seamlessly integrate with Personal Capital on your phone
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:55.100]   to give you relevant and timely updates
[01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:56.540]   on your financial situation.
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:42:01.020]   They'll also tell you if you're overpaying in management fees,
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:03.900]   if you've got your 401(k) properly distributed
[01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:05.820]   for your plan retirement time, all sorts of tools
[01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:06.820]   like that.
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.500]   It is your personal financial dashboard,
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:11.500]   and there's no reason not to use it because it's absolutely free.
[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:14.420]   Please do yourself a favor.
[01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:17.340]   Your older self will thank you for it.
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:19.900]   Personalcapital.com/twig.
[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:22.620]   It's free, and it's the smart way to grow your money.
[01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:25.700]   And we are thrilled to have them as part of our show.
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:27.020]   And it only works.
[01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:33.340]   If you all go there right now, personalcapital.com/twig.
[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:36.580]   Gina Trappani has a tip of the week.
[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:40.460]   So this isn't actually my tip, but it led me to my tip.
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:42.340]   The Play Store is doing a promo where
[01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:44.980]   if you buy a Chromecast, they're giving you a $20 Play Store
[01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:48.100]   credit before, I believe, December 21.
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:51.300]   So if you still want to do that, you can do that.
[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:57.740]   And in researching that, I saw that you can go to Chromecast.com/offers.
[01:42:57.740 --> 01:43:01.100]   The Play Store has put out a lot of offers for Chromecast owners.
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:03.380]   As we know, I took advantage of the Netflix one
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:04.900]   when I first got my Chromecast.
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:05.900]   But there are other ones.
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:08.500]   And if you don't know what offers are available for your Chromecast
[01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:12.100]   whenever you body, go to Chromecast.com/offers.
[01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:16.340]   The page will actually prompt you to connect to your Chromecast.
[01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:19.420]   And then it'll show you if you have any open offers
[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:22.180]   that you can take advantage of associated with your Chromecast.
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:26.140]   I had a few, which I was totally unaware of.
[01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:30.300]   And you know, the special offers and time off
[01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:32.500]   or subscription are discounted to various things.
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:35.820]   So you can check that out if you got a Chromecast.com/offers.
[01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:37.900]   Do it on the network that your Chromecast has plugged in.
[01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:39.100]   And you can see what's available.
[01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:41.380]   And if you buy that one between now and the 21st,
[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:42.020]   you get $20.00.
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:45.380]   And Google Play credit, which basically brings the cost of it
[01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:47.620]   down to like $15 or something.
[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:48.860]   I mean, it's a no-brainer.
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:49.860]   Cool.
[01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:50.380]   Yeah.
[01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:51.700]   But you have to be on the same network.
[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:52.740]   So I can't do it here.
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:53.540]   Yeah, sorry about that.
[01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:55.900]   Yeah, you do have to be on the same network as your Chromecast.
[01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:57.940]   Actually, what I could do, I'm on a network that
[01:43:57.940 --> 01:43:59.020]   has some Chromecast.
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:00.260]   I can see.
[01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:01.300]   No, no Chromecast.
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:02.060]   All right.
[01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:03.220]   Oh, well.
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:04.220]   Sorry about that.
[01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:06.100]   Chromecast.com/offers.
[01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:07.740]   Jeff Jarvis, number of the week.
[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:11.660]   Mutant.
[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:13.700]   Oh, I violated your rule, Leo.
[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:16.980]   I agreed to an embargo.
[01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:18.100]   So don't tell.
[01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:19.060]   Just give us the number.
[01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:20.060]   But don't tell us what it means.
[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:22.940]   It's like a sleaking.
[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:23.780]   No, it's leaking.
[01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:24.780]   No.
[01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:25.780]   Oh.
[01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:27.420]   Ah.
[01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:28.060]   Leaking.
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:29.620]   And I did agree.
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:31.260]   So I--
[01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:33.140]   This is why we don't agree to embargoes,
[01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:36.140]   because then others can cover the story and we have no--
[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:36.820]   I know.
[01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:37.380]   I know.
[01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:39.940]   I know.
[01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:42.980]   Well, it was going to be 11, 3 tomorrow morning.
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:44.300]   And now it's time for a little bit.
[01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:47.100]   Put the link in, because I didn't agree to the embargo.
[01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:49.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:50.940]   No, it's all right.
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:51.460]   Sorry.
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:53.340]   Is it a big deal?
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:54.260]   I'll all say is this.
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:56.300]   You have to translate.
[01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:58.020]   I think it's a very big deal in my world.
[01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:00.620]   And all I got to say is you'd have to translate from the Spanish.
[01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:03.900]   Oh, never mind.
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:06.460]   Does it have to do with [NON-ENGLISH]
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:09.940]   [NON-ENGLISH]
[01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:10.860]   Yeah.
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:12.060]   Yeah, that's as far.
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:12.700]   Yeah.
[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:15.700]   [NON-ENGLISH]
[01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:19.020]   But in Español, all right.
[01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:24.940]   So Instagram hits 300 million monthly users now beating Twitter.
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:27.420]   Really?
[01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:28.420]   That's a yell, I think.
[01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:29.420]   Yeah, that's--
[01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:30.420]   That's what--
[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:31.420]   Yeah.
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:33.180]   What?
[01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:34.420]   And you get verified, Ben.
[01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:38.260]   You know, all the kids these days ain't using Twitter.
[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:44.940]   I, about six months ago, realized that the only social network I ever use that makes me happy
[01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:46.700]   is Instagram.
[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:48.460]   Because it's just pictures.
[01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:49.220]   Just pictures.
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:49.740]   Just pictures.
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:51.180]   Yeah, but not controversial.
[01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:51.380]   Right.
[01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:54.060]   I don't read the comments, because that can get a little weird.
[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:56.340]   Just look at pretty pictures.
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:57.420]   I love Instagram.
[01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:00.340]   They're not filtering the feed.
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:01.780]   It's just pretty pictures.
[01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:02.140]   And you follow them.
[01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:03.220]   I mean, it is Facebook.
[01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:04.820]   It is owned by Facebook, at least.
[01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:06.740]   But yeah, I hear you.
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:07.980]   Pretend it's not.
[01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:10.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:12.260]   Pretend it's not.
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:15.660]   Let me look at the popular feed here and see.
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:17.780]   They've changed this a little bit.
[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:23.540]   So how does-- what is the-- so you can look at popular photos or now popular people.
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:28.980]   And you can see, oh, this is my-- what people I know have liked, which is kind of interesting.
[01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:29.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:31.740]   That's a new discovery feature.
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:33.620]   How do you-- you know, I haven't used Instagram enough.
[01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:34.540]   How do you use it?
[01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:35.740]   How do you-- how do you--
[01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:37.220]   All right, let's do an Instagram right now.
[01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:38.020]   What do you do on Instagram?
[01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:38.420]   What do you do?
[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:40.580]   So I launched my photo thing.
[01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:42.180]   OK, so I'm going to take a picture.
[01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:47.300]   The one thing that's a pisser with Instagram is it has to be square.
[01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:51.860]   So a picture that you would normally take, you're not going to-- I'm going to take a picture
[01:46:51.860 --> 01:46:53.580]   by keyboard.
[01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:54.980]   There we go.
[01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:56.620]   And say my word of the week.
[01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:57.900]   So let's take a picture of that.
[01:46:57.900 --> 01:46:59.620]   It's good to take it with Instagram, but you don't have to.
[01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:01.220]   You can load it from some other thing.
[01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:02.780]   Word of the week is Excelsior.
[01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:03.780]   Then you apply a filter.
[01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:07.940]   This is what everybody says made Instagram the hit it is because you can take a really
[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:13.580]   ugly picture and make it look much more interesting just applying a filter.
[01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:17.420]   Then you continue on and Gina's going to help me.
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:19.140]   You can tag people in it.
[01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:20.900]   You can add the photo to a map.
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:26.340]   You can also cross share to Facebook, Tumblr, Flickr, Twitter, or 4square, including a 4square
[01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:27.340]   check-in.
[01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:28.180]   You also write a caption.
[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:33.780]   Now the pros use this as an opportunity to add 80 or 90 hashtags.
[01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:34.780]   Oh, really?
[01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:35.780]   Is OK?
[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:40.060]   I don't know how they typically tap.
[01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:45.140]   They must have some hashtag machine, some hashtag engine that does this.
[01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:48.460]   Why didn't know that there was SE or Instagram optimization?
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:51.460]   Seriously.
[01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:52.460]   Seriously.
[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:55.060]   I'm just going to write my...
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:48:00.740]   You can also, as in Twitter, use hashtags to make comments and stuff.
[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:05.220]   My word of the day.
[01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:08.100]   Then you can say something like hashtag...
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:10.980]   Here's a good one.
[01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:13.060]   Sorry, not sorry.
[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:17.340]   I like that hashtag.
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:20.780]   It's completely meaningless in this context.
[01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:22.580]   Now I press check and I go.
[01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:26.260]   One thing Instagram added, and they've fortunately been slowed to add too many features.
[01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:30.500]   Is this direct messaging capability, which I don't use, but you do have an ability to
[01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:33.180]   directly send it out.
[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:36.260]   Otherwise it's going to be sent to my followers, which it is.
[01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:38.780]   Now it's sent it out, and there's my Instagram post.
[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:39.780]   Jeff, you should do it.
[01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:40.780]   It's fun.
[01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:43.580]   People can then heart it by double tapping it.
[01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:44.580]   I do it.
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:45.580]   I just don't do it.
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:46.780]   Here's the only problem.
[01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:48.140]   I don't think of it often enough.
[01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:50.780]   I don't think, "Oh, I'm going to take a photo.
[01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:51.620]   I share it on Twitter.
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:53.580]   I share it on Google+.
[01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:54.580]   Don't laugh."
[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:58.700]   I don't share so much on Facebook actually.
[01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:00.620]   But I should do it more on Instagram.
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:03.460]   You can't cross post to Facebook.
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:07.220]   If you wish, you could just start an Instagram.
[01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:11.300]   The thing is, again, I have to say this.
[01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:13.780]   A Instagram always makes me happy.
[01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:17.900]   The only bad thing that happens with Instagram is sometimes a little FOMO.
[01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:23.340]   I'm looking at all the web postings right now, and I wish I were in Paris.
[01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:24.740]   I'm following Chris Michelle.
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:25.740]   Do you know who he is?
[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:28.220]   He started military.com.
[01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:33.380]   He turned into an amazing, like-a-style street photographer.
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:40.660]   If you want somebody, Christopher Michael, if you want somebody to follow on Instagram,
[01:49:40.660 --> 01:49:42.980]   it's M-I-C-H-E-L as his last name.
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:43.980]   Let me just show you-
[01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:44.980]   Christopher Michael?
[01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:45.980]   Yeah.
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:46.980]   Instagram.
[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:49.100]   Let me just show you his fee.
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:51.380]   This is another thing Instagram did, I think, which is really great.
[01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:53.860]   They finally added a web component.
[01:49:53.860 --> 01:50:00.700]   For the longest time, you couldn't go look at people's Instagram pictures on the web.
[01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:02.140]   Right, right.
[01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:03.660]   And that was a real pain and a button.
[01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:06.100]   There were a lot of third-party apps to handle that.
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:09.060]   Nope, that's not his Instagram.
[01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:11.900]   I have to figure out what his-oh, it's Chris, I think.
[01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:17.180]   Chris underscore Michael, let's try that.
[01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:21.460]   Chris underscore Michael, let's see if that's it.
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:25.420]   But he is not a professional photographer.
[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:26.420]   That's it.
[01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:31.140]   And he's doing a lot of beautiful, kind of black and white stuff of all the people you
[01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:34.300]   know in the industry.
[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:35.300]   Entrepreneurs-
[01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:36.460]   No, yeah, I recognize some of these folks.
[01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:40.620]   Yeah, there's Kevin Rose and Tony Conrad in a beautiful picture.
[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:42.180]   I mean, I really think these are beautiful pictures.
[01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:44.620]   So this is all at low web and this is the bad thing.
[01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:48.860]   The only bad thing is that I get depressed because people are having better lives than
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:50.020]   I have.
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:51.020]   [laughter]
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:54.300]   It's the only-look at this picture of-
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:56.660]   I didn't even realize when web was all, by the way.
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:50:57.660]   I know.
[01:50:57.660 --> 01:51:00.420]   Let's see if you are on Instagram, look at that.
[01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:06.740]   And I also can tell from this picture that they're at Geese of Wa at low week's yearly
[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:11.540]   dinner party at the best restaurant in Paris and that makes me even more pissed off.
[01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:12.540]   Oh.
[01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:14.940]   I want to be there.
[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:15.940]   Oh, my.
[01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:16.940]   I want to be there.
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:17.940]   There's low week meditating.
[01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:18.940]   He's beginning to meditating now.
[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:20.780]   Low week La Mer the entrepreneur.
[01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:22.500]   There's low week in Cheryl Dina's beautiful wife.
[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:24.660]   They are the organizers of low web.
[01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:28.620]   All they've sold it, but I think they still run it.
[01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:30.740]   These are great pictures that Chris takes.
[01:51:30.740 --> 01:51:31.740]   I want to.
[01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:32.740]   Yeah.
[01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:35.580]   So this is why you follow somebody on Instagram.
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:37.380]   A lot of photographers on there.
[01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:38.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:39.380]   No, I like them.
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:41.180]   I just got to think of it.
[01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:42.180]   Yeah.
[01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:43.180]   Well, I do.
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:44.180]   I put it on my front page.
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:46.180]   Well, and I mean, Jeff, you're a writer.
[01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:49.340]   I mean, you're both writers, but you're a word guy.
[01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:50.340]   Right.
[01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:52.700]   That's a good point, Jeff Clavier.
[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:55.540]   Here's Tim Berners-Lee, who was the keynote speaker on-
[01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:56.620]   That's my reflex.
[01:51:56.620 --> 01:51:59.140]   On low web this year, talking to low week.
[01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:05.180]   Who was complaining about the right to be forgotten on stage at low web?
[01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:07.180]   A friend in the room?
[01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:08.180]   Yeah.
[01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:10.980]   A friend in the room.
[01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:11.980]   Yeah.
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:14.220]   So this is fun.
[01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:15.900]   They all look so French.
[01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:17.420]   It's a French.
[01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:18.420]   Anyway.
[01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:19.420]   Okay.
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:20.420]   I don't know.
[01:52:20.420 --> 01:52:23.860]   I don't know how we got into that.
[01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:24.860]   But let me tell you.
[01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:26.820]   Oh, I know how because it's bigger than Twitter now.
[01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:27.820]   And now I know why.
[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:28.820]   And I know why.
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:30.820]   You can't troll people on Instagram.
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:32.620]   You can only put up nice pictures.
[01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:35.140]   The worst thing you could do is make me feel bad about my life because I'm
[01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:36.140]   not in the world.
[01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:37.140]   Can you?
[01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:38.140]   That's a question.
[01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:39.140]   Can you?
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:40.140]   What can you do?
[01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:41.140]   That's my own flaw.
[01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:43.140]   What cool about what do bad people do on Instagram?
[01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:46.420]   Well, you can post crappy comments on someone's phone.
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:48.420]   Comments are the big problem on Instagram.
[01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:49.420]   Yeah.
[01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:51.180]   And they currently have no way to delete comments.
[01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:52.180]   Like a troll.
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:53.180]   But I control them, can I?
[01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:54.180]   No.
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:55.180]   No, you can't.
[01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:56.180]   That's a flaw.
[01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:57.180]   Why can't delete some bozos comments?
[01:52:57.180 --> 01:52:58.180]   No, it's very frustrating.
[01:52:58.180 --> 01:52:59.180]   That's a mistake.
[01:52:59.180 --> 01:53:02.060]   Well, I'm sure they'll fix that.
[01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:05.020]   It is a mistake.
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:13.660]   Damon Wayans, we had on The Great Comedian who we had on our show, Triangulation, a
[01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:18.780]   couple of weeks ago, has been using it to do commentary, which is sometimes very profane.
[01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:27.300]   He has this new app that lets you embed video into a little head, a little TV into an Instagram
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:30.180]   movie.
[01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:33.780]   So he's talking and I don't know if we should play it because I don't know.
[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:35.420]   Sometimes it could be.
[01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:36.420]   But it's funny.
[01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:38.220]   Here's a good guy to follow.
[01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:42.380]   Damon's very funny.
[01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:45.900]   And this is, this is, oh, he doesn't like Charles Barkley.
[01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:47.060]   Yeah.
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:50.700]   Charles Barkley's been kind of controversial.
[01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:51.700]   Oh, wow.
[01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:52.700]   Look at that.
[01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:59.300]   A lot of interesting commentary on Garner and Ferguson and so forth.
[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:01.340]   So I can see why it's got 300.
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:02.820]   Hey, I got a treat for you.
[01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:04.420]   Here's my tool of the week.
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:08.220]   Nokia, before they got sold to Microsoft, really made a great suite of apps called the
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:10.020]   Hear Apps.
[01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:14.300]   Many thought that Nokia's Hear Maps were the best Nav tool out there.
[01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:15.660]   It is available now.
[01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:16.660]   It's come out of beta.
[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:20.340]   I've been using it for a while on Samsung was offering it on their Samsung store for Samsung
[01:54:20.340 --> 01:54:25.500]   phones only, but now you saw on all Android devices, Nokia Hear Maps.
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:28.900]   And you know, of course you're going to continue to use ways in Google Maps.
[01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:30.780]   I'm not saying replace it.
[01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:35.100]   But one thing that's great about Hear Maps, you can download the maps.
[01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:39.060]   And the maps can be all of, I have downloaded all of the United States.
[01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:44.340]   So I can use this completely offline from now on as a turn by turn nav.
[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:47.100]   It's among the best nav tools out there.
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:48.580]   And it doesn't need to be online.
[01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:50.260]   It just needs a GPS.
[01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:51.260]   So it's free.
[01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:52.260]   It's available.
[01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:56.300]   It's still beta, but it is available on all Android devices now.
[01:54:56.300 --> 01:54:58.580]   Hard to find in the play store just went live today.
[01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:01.380]   So you know how sometimes it takes a while to propagate through search.
[01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:07.020]   But if you search for Hear Beta and the maker is Nokia apps, don't be fooled.
[01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:08.860]   There are some fakes.
[01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:10.260]   Hear Beta.
[01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:12.460]   Very good turn by turn.
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:14.780]   Just one more thing to have on your phone in addition to Google Maps.
[01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:16.260]   If you're offline, it's very handy.
[01:55:16.260 --> 01:55:19.700]   And you forget to download ahead of time.
[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:23.460]   I put the entire United States on there as a few gigabytes.
[01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:25.620]   But you can download maps from all over the world.
[01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:30.780]   Because it's Nokia, they really have excellent representation all over the world.
[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:33.940]   Asia, Australia, and you can do country by country.
[01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:38.180]   It's the next time you're in Hong Kong, just download the Hong Kong map before you go.
[01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:40.660]   That's my tip, tool and number of the week.
[01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:42.500]   We are done, my friends.
[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:45.940]   Gina Trapani, smarter where-- I'm sorry.
[01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:46.940]   Think up.
[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:47.940]   Think up.
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:48.940]   Let's just say think up.
[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:49.940]   Think up.
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:50.940]   And scribbling.
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:51.940]   Scribbling.net.
[01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:52.940]   Yes.
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:53.940]   Where I haven't been doing very much scribbling.
[01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:56.380]   No, we all go through this phase.
[01:55:56.380 --> 01:55:57.540]   I'm going to blog again.
[01:55:57.540 --> 01:56:01.340]   I'm going to write another blog post about how I resolved the blog again.
[01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:02.340]   And then it'll be like six months.
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:05.500]   And then it'll be another post about how I resolved the blog again.
[01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:06.500]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:09.140]   This is a lot of fun today.
[01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:10.140]   Great to have you.
[01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:11.140]   I like one of the three of us.
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:12.140]   I love our guests.
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:13.140]   But I also love those.
[01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:14.140]   No, I think it's cozy.
[01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:15.140]   That's the four of us.
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:16.140]   The four of us.
[01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:17.140]   Yep, with Jason too.
[01:56:17.140 --> 01:56:18.140]   Yeah.
[01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:20.820]   Gina is also a host of all about Android Tuesday nights, 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern time on
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:21.820]   Twitter.
[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:23.420]   And that's a great show for your Android user.
[01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:24.420]   We have a lot of fun.
[01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:26.020]   Yeah, I have to watch that every week.
[01:56:26.020 --> 01:56:28.140]   Jason Elza's the host.
[01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:29.620]   Jeff Jarvis, we love you.
[01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:31.220]   CUNY, City University of New York.
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:33.460]   They're a lot of very lucky students.
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:34.460]   It's awesome too.
[01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:40.220]   Hey, did one of your students get arrested?
[01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:46.300]   Yes, one of our students did get arrested in the protests after the, I can't breathe,
[01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:50.380]   the lack of an indictment against the cop who did the chokehold.
[01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:51.740]   And what was she doing wrong?
[01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:52.740]   Journalism?
[01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:54.620]   She was practicing journalism in public.
[01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:55.780]   She was taking pictures.
[01:56:55.780 --> 01:56:57.940]   She was taking pictures.
[01:56:57.940 --> 01:56:59.100]   They told her to move.
[01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:00.100]   She moved.
[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:05.060]   As she said, evidently not fast enough and they wouldn't recognize her press pass, which
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:06.980]   we issue because it wasn't a police issue.
[01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:07.980]   It's as well.
[01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:09.540]   Get used to it NYPD.
[01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:11.540]   You don't decide who the press is anymore.
[01:57:11.540 --> 01:57:12.540]   Yeah.
[01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:13.540]   Yeah.
[01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:15.260]   Why should they decide?
[01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:17.780]   That's the last people you want to decide this stuff.
[01:57:17.780 --> 01:57:18.780]   Amen.
[01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:21.780]   Let the authorities decide who gets to cover what's going on.
[01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:23.780]   It's called the fourth estate for a reason.
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:29.780]   If the authorities in question, I mean, you can't cover this.
[01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:31.300]   So she's recovering the authorities.
[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:32.460]   The authorities tell you can't do it.
[01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:34.500]   Oh, no, you don't have a permit to cover us.
[01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:39.540]   That sounds a little bit like, I don't know, North Korea.
[01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:41.540]   So she's out of jail.
[01:57:41.540 --> 01:57:43.500]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:46.180]   She was just giving her whatever they call it.
[01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:47.180]   They spanked her.
[01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:48.180]   Or whatever, but there go.
[01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:49.180]   Okay.
[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:52.300]   Who was the former city editor of the daily news who heads our student news service said
[01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:55.380]   that when the Republican you mentioned he was getting those calls all the time about
[01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:56.380]   his reporters.
[01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:57.380]   Yeah.
[01:57:57.380 --> 01:58:01.380]   All right, my friends, thank you so much.
[01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:02.660]   We appreciate your time.
[01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:04.100]   We do this show every Wednesday.
