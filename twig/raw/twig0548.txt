[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, Jeff Jarvis, Ant Pruitt, and Matthew Ingramer here, Matthew sitting in for Stacey Higginbotham, who's out on assignment.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.240]   We've got lots to talk about. The coronavirus. San Francisco has declared an emergency.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:23.800]   Google says, "We're gonna stop labeling pictures with that man or woman thing, and trying to trick Amazon goes grocery store by stealing a banana. It's all coming up next."

[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.800]   Windows, why don't I say that? I don't want to talk about Windows.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   No Windows. That's AMP-Pruit. He's got a new computer. That's pretty. You got it bet backwards.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   It's like a... It's not backwards. It is a flip.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   It's doing the downward dog. Something some strange yoga possible.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.800]   That is sort of a yoga pose. That's an HP flip. What I really like is the magnetic pencils just adhering.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   This has a stylus.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   Ooh, because you know how I love to use a stylus. He's our creative guy.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   Yeah. Jeff Jarvis is also here. Mr. Jarvis is blah-dah-da-da-da. Professor blah-blah-blah.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   I would shake your hand, but I'm not going to shake your hand anymore. I'm not going to do fist bumps.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   We're just going to wave.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.800]   Wave?
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   You know, the whole thing, as far as I'm concerned, this whole coronavirus thing is BS.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   [laughter]
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   And I... I for what? Actually, I have this in my pocket.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   Are you getting ready to go mow to lawn or something? Because that's about how that's good for it.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   Oh, great! Oh, this is an N95 mask. This is approved by the CDC.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   How did you get it?
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   I had it from the fires.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   I'm very careful.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   Because it does have a problem.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   Oh!
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   It is for particulate filtering, so if you're doing a lot of sanding.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   But I think it's also... I mean, it's on the list of approved masks for coronavirus.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.800]   Um, San Francisco today declared an emergency due to coronavirus.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   But yeah, but it's not because we have any cases.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.800]   It's because they want... they want to get the money now.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   By the way...
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   Oh, I see.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   Great white north where there is no virus because no virus can survive.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   Matthew Ingram is here, filling in for Stacy who is off doing a job today.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   Hello, Matthew.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.800]   Hello.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   Uh, yes, San Francisco.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.800]   Well, and one of the things that concerns me a little bit is the big RSA conferences going on in the city right now.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.800]   And IBM bailed. Big, big booths.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   They were a platinum sponsor. They bailed.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.800]   So, uh, and Lisa was going to go today. I talked her out of it.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   But we are going to a after party for last past this evening.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.800]   In fact, if you're going to be in the Bay Area and you're not infected, you might want to...
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.800]   You might want to head over to Burnt.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.800]   Thanks for that qualifier.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.800]   And then, Ranch, actually, before you go, go to twit.tv/blog.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   Because there's a form to fill out.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.800]   Because we... it's a speakeasy.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   That's a coolest old bar in San Francisco.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   And you need a password to get in.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   They're doing the whole speakeasy thing.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.800]   So, that starts at seven o'clock tonight, if you're in the city for RSA. Please.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   I am going to go get some Chinese food tonight.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.800]   Just to show solidarity. Because what's happening all around...
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.800]   People aren't going to Chinese restaurants.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.800]   Right? Right?
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.800]   Like, that's the problem?
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   Yes, it is.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   We had a session at the...
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.800]   Here's the...
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.800]   Newmark...
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.800]   J-School for community media.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   And, yes, restaurants and stores are empty.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   It's a huge problem.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   Well, you know, the CDC is saying it's probably pandemic.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   It's spread now to a number of countries.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.800]   It qualifies to be a pandemic.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   No, there was a really good letter today from the... or speech talk from the head of WHO that said, no.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   I tweeted it. It's near high and my Twitter feed.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   That said, no, it's not a pandemic yet.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.800]   And use of the word pandemic causes panic.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.800]   It potentially has more implications, economic and otherwise.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.800]   People can go overboard and no, they're not ready to use it yet.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.800]   They will use what they need to.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:33.800]   But he also pointed out that there were some number of countries where they have not had a new case in a week and some of them where they haven't had a new case in two weeks.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.800]   Oh, that's good news.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.800]   For this containment.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.800]   So take a deep breath behind a mask.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.800]   Italy had 100 cases in the last 24 hours.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.800]   Yeah, they canceled Carnival in Venice.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.800]   That's...
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   Matthew and I are supposed to go to Italy soon.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   I think Matthew, you're right.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.800]   Rouge.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.800]   I'm going to go unless they cancel it.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   So who is the WHO Director General said the epidemic peaked in plateaued in China between the 23rd of January and the 2nd of February and has been declining ever since.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.800]   So this is...
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.800]   If we believe the Chinese authorities, which is always the issue.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.800]   Well, but the WHO is in there.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.800]   The WHO is there.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   Yeah, the WHO is there, yes.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   The World Health Organization.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   14 countries that have had cases have not reported a new case for more than a week.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   And nine countries have not reported a new case for two weeks.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   So it does sound like maybe the worst is over.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.800]   That's how sudden it increases in Italy, Iran.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   They're deeply concerning.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.800]   So yeah, I don't know.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   This is a very good...
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   So I just read this obviously when I tweeted it.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.800]   It's a really sobering, but it's also sober.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.800]   It's a good letter from the expert I would trust above all else.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.800]   He says, "Don't mistake me.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.800]   I'm not downplaying the seriousness of the situation.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   The potential for this to become a pandemic.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   It has that potential."
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   But potential doesn't mean it is a pandemic at this point.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   I've seen other virologists say it's time to admit it.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.800]   It's a pandemic.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   And not to scare people.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   That's always the fear.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.800]   But to get people to be prepared.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.800]   Which is...
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   Well, I tweeted another piece that said that if the top ten airports in the world would...
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   I don't know how you do this...
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.800]   markedly increase their hand-washing hygiene.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   It would decrease spread by a quarter to two-thirds.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.800]   Wow.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   I don't know how you do that.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   Do you put sinks out of the airport?
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   You do it like you do it on cruise ships.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.800]   I mean, that's what they do on cruise ships because of course they've had lots of problems with
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.800]   noroviruses, cruise ships that contained environment.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.800]   Or they do all the cruise ships.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.800]   They put hand-signitizing stations everywhere.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   They stand out in front of the restaurant.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   Yeah, there's people in the restaurant.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   And they say, "Sanitize?
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   Some cruise ships have been on cruise ships that have been on cruise ships."
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.800]   Wow.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.400]   And then ships have been on cruise ships that have sinks and special areas for washing
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.800]   your hands at the entrance to the dining room.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.800]   Really?
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.800]   So they take that seriously.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.800]   Let's give you pause.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.800]   It's sort of weird seeing a cruise ship.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.800]   Oh, I've never been sick.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.800]   No.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   Not once.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.800]   Never got sick on a cruise ship.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   They would give me pause if they didn't do that.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.800]   Right.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   That's a point.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   And when you first leave on the cruise, most ships they will serve food.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.800]   They won't let you touch anything.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.800]   Sometimes that changes after you've been out to see for a few days.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   I suspect now because of coronavirus, that's the case across the board.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   Just the whole trip.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.800]   They don't let you touch the food.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.800]   There's ways to do it.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.800]   I wash my hands like crazy.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.800]   I very rarely get sick.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.800]   So maybe that's...
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.800]   I wash my hands like crazy.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   I don't use hand sanitizer.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.800]   I think I'm going to start.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   No, in fact, you're...
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   Well, they say washing is better than hand sanitizer.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   It is, absolutely.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   But just in that moment.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   I don't like shaking hands.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.800]   I'm not Howard Stern like.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   But after I shake someone's hands, I just kind of think what's off.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   Enough across this in my mind.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   You know what else?
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.800]   And I've talked about this before and I learned this in Japan.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   Because in Japan, they don't have paper towels in the mensroom.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   So everybody carries a handkerchief.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   I carry handkerchiefs with me.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   And I don't touch anything.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   You know, I wash my hands.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.800]   I dry in the handkerchief to save trees.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   But then I use the handkerchief to open all the doors and get out.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   And I don't really.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.800]   I'd never touch anything.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.800]   So...
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   They don't have paper towels?
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   Or they have like...
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   Nothing.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   Let it in towels?
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   Nothing?
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   You're expected to.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.800]   You're expected to carry a handkerchief.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.800]   It's eco-friendly.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   Separate from the one you blow your nose into, I hope.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   That's the other pocket.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.800]   Even though he just reached out the same sign.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   So this side, the right side is the washing hand.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.800]   The color coat is...
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.800]   That is color coat.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   The white one is for either blowing your nose or giving to damsels in distress.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   Because these are really cheap.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   You can see that's actually coming all the colors.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.800]   When you say in hotels, do you put towels along the carpet on the window?
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.800]   No, no, no.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.800]   I'm not how are you.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.800]   Or how are you meant to?
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.800]   Yeah, or how are you meant to help?
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.800]   It's not that crazy.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.800]   I try not to say that.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.800]   You can't know what hotel rooms are like and I never do that ultraviolet light.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   That's just crazy talk.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.800]   Remember reading the number one contact surface?
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   It's handrails.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.800]   In airplanes.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   In subways.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.800]   Who is it?
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.800]   Naomi Campbell, who basically wears a mask and bunny suits.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.800]   Because I guess she flies a lot and then she brings with her a seat cover for the airplane
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.800]   seat.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   She does not sanitize cloth but she does wipe all the surface down.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   The key with the wipe surfaces down is to leave it wet for 30 seconds.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.800]   Johnny Jett, who's germaphobic.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   He wipes the, he says you got to wipe the luggage, the overhead luggage handle.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.800]   Everybody's touching that.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.800]   He says never touch, never touch remote controls on hotel rooms.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   I said what are you nuts?
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   What are you nuts?
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   You're a germaphobe.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.800]   He says never, I never, I put it in a plastic bag.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.800]   And I said oh stop it.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   And so he did?
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.800]   He got sick.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.800]   Oh man.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   This is my phone.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   Oh man.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.800]   I'm, don't listen to me ever.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.800]   Well I, I've been in a hotel, cheaper hotels where they have remote controls that are advertised
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.800]   as germ resistant.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.800]   What's it made of?
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   If you gotta say that.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   Everything should be made of silver.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   Anyway, anyway, I'm glad.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   I hope that was actually, yeah, silver's germless.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   Don't they put silver in your underwear?
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   I didn't know it.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   I didn't act well then.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.800]   Our sponsor have silver.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.800]   Not mine, I don't think.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.800]   They use silver threads because it's handy.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   I see I keep touching my face.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   Don't touch your face Leo.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   Ever.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   Ever.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   At least not for now.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.800]   Until maybe after you wash your hands you can touch your face, but then you have to watch your
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.800]   hands again.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.800]   And your face.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.800]   And your face.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800]   In the room.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.800]   Who's on first?
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   So there's a, that's my new mask, the Bane mask.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   Actually there is an indigo or other Skype will be able to take the load.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.800]   Did you see the masks where you can print your face?
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   The lower.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   I'll verify this that I, this, when I wear this N95 mask, I can't unlock my phone.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.800]   But it's just, it's just enter the thing.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.800]   You touch your phone?
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   Nobody else is touching it.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.800]   It's just me.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.800]   Don't touch a surface and then touch your phone.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   See the Android gestures will be, you hold your phone three feet away from you.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   Right.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   It'll be okay.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.800]   Look at this.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.800]   This is an indigo go for plague doctor masks.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   Those creepy birds.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.800]   It's so cool.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.800]   Masks.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.800]   The plague doctors were in the middle ages.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   They would stuff them with herbs and straw thinking that the airborne particles from a plague victim
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.800]   couldn't, don't jokes on them because of course it was rat bites.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.800]   I'm going to find some more on this.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.800]   What about your idiots?
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.800]   But if you want, you can now get an N95 protective plague doctor mask.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.800]   Wear that around.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.800]   Nobody will think you're weird.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.800]   Mm.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   Okay.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.800]   I don't, you know.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   So while we're on the, just while we're on the, so China is having problems because everybody's
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   working at home, the internet is not able to take it.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   Oh man.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.800]   We live in dystopian times, don't we?
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.800]   Well, imagine if we didn't have the internet.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   Well, I was thinking about doing all the shows by Skype in the future.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.800]   (laughs)
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:30.800]   And in all seriousness, I was asking the staff today, should we continue to have an open studio?
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   Anybody can come and watch our shows.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.800]   We have people from all over the world.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.800]   Is that it?
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.800]   People from Germany, in the UK and Australia.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.800]   Yes, Jay.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   And I didn't get a strong feeling when we were the other.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.800]   Just do a heat scan, you know, before they come in.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   Oh, I like to do in the China Air Force.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   Yeah, we could do that.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   That number is a little thing to aim at your tiny wood fire oven to get the temperature.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.800]   I could just aim at the people.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.800]   I think I'm going to bring that to the party.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.800]   The numbers are tiny.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.800]   (laughs)
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.800]   Less than the flu.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   We weren't that worried about the flu.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.800]   Right.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   There was a Harvard, Harvard epidemiologist was interviewed and I think it was an Atlantic
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   piece and he said one of the problems with this particular virus is there are lots of people
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   who are infected who show no symptoms whatsoever.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.800]   Right.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.800]   The flu show symptoms.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.800]   So 27 days.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   A guy got it to 27 days.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.720]   After exposure.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   Maybe we don't have visitors.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   Superks three weeks.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.720]   (laughs)
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.800]   No, you can come but you have to be in quarantine for two weeks before we let you in the studio.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   Okay.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.800]   You have to.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.800]   So the parking lot.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.800]   Live in our basement.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.800]   And wear a bunny suit.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.800]   No, Mr. Burke wouldn't want you in this.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.800]   I'm not going to ace me.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.320]   I'm not going to worry too much about it.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.920]   I've decided if I get it, I'll get it.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.920]   Not everybody dies, right?
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.920]   That's the other story.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.760]   You're all going to get it.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.760]   I read that story.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.480]   We're all going to get it.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.000]   Or tell it he rates under 2%.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.640]   Yeah, that was the Atlantic piece that said you're going to get it.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.080]   It's just people over 60.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.080]   Who's?
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.080]   Oh.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.080]   Oh.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.080]   Whoops.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.680]   By the way, Leo, man, our more susceptible to women.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.680]   Uh oh.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.920]   Think of it this way.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.600]   It's a 98% survival rate.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.600]   Exactly.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.560]   As opposed to the flu flu, which is a 99.9% survival rate.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.560]   Oh.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.120]   So it is a little more deadly than the flu.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.120]   It's a little more.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.120]   Didn't know that.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.120]   It's a little more.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.120]   I never get sick.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.120]   I'm very healthy.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.120]   Oh, you just, you just chase yourself.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.120]   And here it comes.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.120]   Oh, I don't hear that.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.120]   I don't hear that.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.120]   Oh, there's no, what do you think?
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.120]   Hey, doxam, Leo, for all of us.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.120]   Doxam, but...
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.120]   Doxam, but...
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.400]   Oh, I'm a scientific person.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.400]   I don't believe in that.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.400]   I'm a superstitious.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.240]   Would you go to China right now?
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.240]   Yes.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.640]   Do really good deals on airfare.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.640]   And hotels.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.600]   Your hotel rooms are really intense.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.400]   But none of the restaurants are open.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.880]   I wouldn't want to go to China, but I don't know.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.040]   We're going to St. Louis next week.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.040]   We're traveling on an airplane.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.040]   Airplanes are terrible.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.040]   It's almost like China.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.040]   It's got an arch.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.440]   It's China with an arch.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.880]   I know, with an arch.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.560]   Google is notifying Google I/O 2020 ticket winners.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.640]   It's like the golden ticket in Charlie and the chocolate factory.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.800]   Give us a check.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.640]   Oh, yeah, that too.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.640]   You've been nothing.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:23.480]   $1,150 for general admission or academic pricing $375.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.480]   Wow.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.320]   It's going down, right?
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.560]   You still get a little more expensive, I thought.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.280]   Oh, that's a stupid word.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.400]   It's tied to the price of a Pixel phone.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.400]   There you go.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.400]   There you go.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.320]   Floating index.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:45.480]   Google in the FAQ says all I/O registrants to cancel the registration, they will allow
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:52.520]   all I/O registrants to cancel the registration up to April 15th without financial penalty
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.240]   due to COVID-19.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.760]   Wow.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.760]   That's still three weeks from the event.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.920]   May 12th is Google I/O's keynote.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.440]   We will stream it, of course, live.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.880]   This is what the invitation looks like.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.880]   Congratulations.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.600]   You've been selected.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.760]   Are you going, Jeff?
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:17.000]   No, I'm not that you're going to Leipzig to give a talk.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Oh.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   The first time I've missed it in quite a long time.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Well, watch our stream.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I will.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.400]   Yeah, we'll just stream.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.760]   I am wondering really if-- so the good news is if this is peaked and it's going to go
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.880]   away, then we could say, oh, it's like swine flu or something.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.680]   It wasn't-- it was a tempest and a teapup.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.360]   But eventually there's going to be something.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.360]   Yes.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.960]   And I wonder what the future of conferences holds.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.640]   Maybe this is also this impetus that will spur telecommuting and working at home and
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.640]   all that.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.640]   I came across--
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.640]   Say again?
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:59.840]   I came across a mention of-- I think it was journalists coming back from Asia.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.280]   They're not in quarantine, but they've been encouraged to work at home.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.280]   I would.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.640]   I don't think that's unreasonable.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.040]   My wife today asked what-- she's going to look up and said, do we really need to stock
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   up on food?
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.560]   Did she go to Crater Joe's and get lots of frozen stuff?
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.560]   Vegetables, the thing?
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.560]   No, no, no.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.560]   Just get a bunch of beans.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.560]   You can live on beans for two weeks.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.560]   I can live on beans.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.560]   I can live on beans.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.560]   And candy pugs.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.560]   And water.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.200]   Are you allowed to eat beans?
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.200]   I am now.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   I got off the keto thing.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   Oh, you did?
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   Notice how happy you're normal again.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.400]   Notice how happy you-- you know, I don't know what to think about.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.680]   First of all, I did it for exactly a year.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.320]   Today is the one year.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.280]   But-- and it was good for me.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.840]   My-- all my numbers were better.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.840]   I lost weight.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.440]   I'm feel great.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.840]   But I have been reading increasing numbers of articles about-- oh, it's going to kill
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   you.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.960]   You just don't know it's a silent killer because all that meat, your arteries-- yeah.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.960]   And bone density.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.960]   I read another study.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.840]   It was a mouse study with the bone density decline and all sorts of stuff.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.400]   So I thought, I did it for a year.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.400]   I've got the benefit.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.160]   I'm going to do a modified thing where I'd have--
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.160]   --to change your whole grains, lifestyle, thinking--
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.160]   The old house.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.840]   How was that first piece of bread?
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.040]   Oh, so good.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.560]   I started-- I started making bread.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.920]   But because I wanted whole wheat.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.640]   I don't want any refined, you know, all right.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.640]   But I don't know.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.640]   OK, OK.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.640]   So there's no white flour.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.760]   So I'm making my own whole wheat bread, but I ate the whole loaf.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.240]   It was so good.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.600]   It's like, oh my god.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.000]   That's not how that's supposed to work.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.400]   Oh, sweet mystery of life.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.000]   I don't know.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.480]   It was so good.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.080]   That is the one recommendation for going keto.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:40.600]   Right.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.400]   Man, that first slice of bread, you are going to enjoy yourself.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:51.800]   I did the sourdough too, because so my bread is just literally just flour, starter, sourdough,
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.320]   and water.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.720]   There's nothing else in it, no yeast.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.760]   Where'd you get the starter?
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.640]   I made it with a little bit of yeast, a little flour, a little water.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.440]   And I just fermented it over a period of time.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:06.520]   We're in wine country, so there's a lot of natural yeast coming through the air.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.960]   And so am I-- so I made two starters.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:14.920]   One was named Bernie, and one was named Liz.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.640]   And I've been watching them go up and down.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.640]   Are you serious?
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.360]   Bernie kind of went crazy.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.600]   Did you notice?
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.720]   Just-- oh.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.920]   God bless America.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.720]   So no, these starters are great.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.560]   There's a guy.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.920]   They're living things on your counter.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.400]   You had flour and water in the morning.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.120]   You feed them.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:37.960]   The old-- that's why gold miners got called sourdoughs, because they would keep a little
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.440]   starter in a leather pouch around their neck in theory with them.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.440]   You don't have the yeast.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.080]   You don't need commercial yeast.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.600]   In fact, there are sourdoughs started.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.280]   I think Boudin in San Francisco is a 167-year-old sourdough starter.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:49.800]   It's fine.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.920]   There's a guy who has a museum of sourdough starters.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.920]   And he got one from a woman who got it from her dad who got it from his dad.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.520]   Because they gain character over time.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.440]   That's so cool.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.680]   My starter is very amazingly delicious.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.320]   It's really good.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.240]   And so that--
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.280]   I think you should be sending loaves to all of your--
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.240]   Not to do-- are we going to get one?
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.000]   Doesn't keep well.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   You really-- that's why I have to eat it in the first hour.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   A whole loaf.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.680]   And it's mixed two loaves.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.480]   What did you miss most?
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.760]   Was it bread or pasta or--
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.200]   No beans.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.360]   Oh, I would kill.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:25.880]   I would kill.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.320]   I love beans.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.080]   I do too.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.280]   Beans, quinoa, I missed quite a bit.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.360]   There's a lot of-- even brown rice is delicious.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.520]   If you don't eat it for a while, it really is quite good.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.480]   I'm so glad you're normal again.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.120]   Well, we'll see.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.080]   Is your family happy, too?
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:44.920]   Yes.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.840]   Although, funny, when I quick Keto, Lisa went on it.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.680]   Oh, no.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.160]   Not that she gets it.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:49.680]   No.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:49.840]   No.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.000]   She doesn't need it.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.640]   No.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.120]   No.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.240]   No, she doesn't do it.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.080]   She does what she calls a modified Keto.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.080]   All right.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.520]   She means she can have some ice cream at night.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.240]   Well, I'm a modified Keto, too, since I have ice cream at night.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.520]   Nothing better.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.920]   I do not eat ice cream at night.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.640]   Google removing 600 apps from the Play Store.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.800]   This is an ongoing story.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.920]   I almost don't read these anymore.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.880]   Annoying ads.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:18.400]   This isn't even a malware issue, although--
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.760]   They just do it all the time.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.440]   They're constantly.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.880]   Every week is another 1,000.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.080]   Why is this a story today?
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.080]   I don't know.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:24.920]   I don't know.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.440]   I guess the biggest-- there's 3 million apps in the Play Store,
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.080]   so 600 is hardly anything.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.600]   But I think what's interesting is it isn't for malware.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.440]   It's for annoying ads.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.280]   So ads show up when you're not actually using the device.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.600]   That's annoying.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.160]   Or you get a surprise full-screen ad
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.200]   when you're trying to make a phone call.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.160]   That's annoying.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.520]   I agree.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.880]   So they're cracking down on that.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.960]   They've removed nearly 600 apps.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.680]   Disruptive ads enforcement and our new approach.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.280]   That's why it's a story.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.280]   If there's going to be disruptive ads, they should be Google.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.760]   Would it be malware, too?
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.720]   Well, it depends on your definition.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.680]   I define--
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.160]   It can be-- yeah, I think it's malware.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.360]   If it's annoying you and you didn't install it,
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.360]   that's a malware.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.960]   But I think technically it's not malware.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.680]   If you installed something, agreed to it.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.480]   And you can uninstall it, for example.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.520]   Then I think it's adware versus malware.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.720]   So remember, remember, remember, kids back
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.880]   when we used to complain about pop-ups?
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.120]   Are there pop-up blockers?
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:33.920]   What's that annoying?
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.360]   Now, every damn web page, you end up
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.520]   getting that much space with the things that come down,
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.840]   the things that come up, the things that come over,
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.520]   the things that won't leave, the things that hide the Xs.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.200]   So true.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.520]   It's really awful.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.280]   And when I go to Stacy and IoT, and I
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.720]   sit there for a little while, I get a pop-up saying,
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.360]   hey, you really want to subscribe to our newsletter.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.000]   But see, I think that's OK.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.720]   Let's see if it shows, because maybe it finally--
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.560]   You've already got the--
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.960]   She knows about this, and she said I'm getting rid of it.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:02.800]   Nope, there it is.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.320]   There it is.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.320]   There we go.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.320]   So is that malware?
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.320]   Where has the one--
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.320]   Where is the one-- pop-up?
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.040]   What is it?
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.200]   My favorite's the one where just as your mouse goes towards the address
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.800]   bar, then it pops up.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.480]   So you just--
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.480]   It's on the screen.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.760]   But just as you're leaving, it's like, wait.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.760]   Wait.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.760]   Honestly--
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.760]   Because we're at support.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.040]   Salon doesn't add a lot.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:23.560]   Salon?
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.160]   Yeah, Salon, anytime you start to leave,
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.280]   you start to leave your page.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.240]   They're like, oh, here's an ad.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.280]   Hey, wait.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.360]   Before you go.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:31.880]   So--
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.720]   That's pretty clever.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.560]   I really love ads.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.120]   That's what keeps us alive.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.280]   We wouldn't be able to do any of this, because we're at support.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.760]   We don't ask people to give us money.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.360]   It's free.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.560]   But I think it's also really important to be responsible.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.000]   But I see.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.560]   I don't mind Stacy's little pop-up there.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.480]   That's not a big deal.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.920]   I do, though, think what happens when you get annoying
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.960]   is people run ad blockers.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.600]   And that's going to be bad.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.240]   That's bad for-- as we know, that's bad for the whole ecosystem.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.360]   You know, in a lot of pages, we're
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.320]   warning about the whole ad blocker usage.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.880]   Oh, they say you're using an ad blocker.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.920]   You know you're taking money out of my kid's mouth.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.920]   Yeah, and that goes bad.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.680]   And then if you turn the ad blocker off,
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.600]   and it just starts to bombard you, you know, I'm like, come on,
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.120]   man.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.920]   I know you need to run your ad services,
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.560]   or what have you.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.920]   But there's a better way, right?
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.560]   There's got to be.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.200]   Matthew Wiggles got ad blocking built into Chrome, right?
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.080]   Now it does, yeah.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:34.640]   Yeah, there is--
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.560]   So there's a story in the run down, in the change log.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.560]   But I actually think is above change log.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.560]   Should I take it out of the change log and do it for reals?
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.640]   OK.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.680]   So it's the one where Google AI is going to stop
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:52.440]   recognizing and labeling gender in photos.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.640]   Good.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.160]   Right?
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.040]   I think it's great.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.560]   It's going to what?
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.600]   Stop labeling gender in photos.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.080]   To avoid bias.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:01.880]   To avoid bias.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.400]   And I also think it just says something about where
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.520]   society is right now.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.360]   We have many non-binary students at our school.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:13.920]   The whole notion of gender and of pronoun cannot be
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.000]   intuitive for people.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.560]   So it's time that we just let people be whoever the hell they are.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.800]   Now that's the good news part.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.400]   The bad news part, as I saw just now, just minutes ago,
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.560]   on Twitter, a woman in the UK, a black woman who was trying
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.880]   to submit her passport photo.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.880]   And it kept telling her that her lips were open,
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.280]   violating the rules.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:38.760]   Oh, geez.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.320]   And the lips were not open.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.760]   And so this is one good step in the right direction from Google.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.520]   But boy, they--
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.360]   AI is terrible.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.280]   What's that?
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.920]   AI is terrible at that.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   All you could do is laugh at this book crap.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   I know.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.320]   It's so bad.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:54.840]   Geez.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.560]   And actually, that's not overly racist.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.160]   It's just really bad AI.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:58.840]   It's just bad.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.200]   It's really bad coding.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.240]   Yeah, it's a feature too far.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.000]   But it is, frankly, likely that the AI was
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.320]   trained with a lot of white people.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:07.800]   Right.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.320]   Exactly.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.880]   That's what it all boils down to.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.320]   Yeah, it does.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:10.920]   It's not--
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.800]   But the problem is not the AI, so much of the data.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.320]   Right.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:13.800]   Right.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.200]   Not enough people training that AI.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:16.880]   Yep.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.320]   Not enough--
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.880]   So what I thought was really interesting--
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.240]   diverse people.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:20.800]   Right.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.920]   But the Google story, I thought, was just really interesting
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.960]   because it's done for one purpose.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.480]   But it has another comment on where we are in society.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.480]   Right.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.000]   Right.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.840]   And you know, Google's points, well,
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.000]   you can't identify some age gender by how they look,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.880]   obviously.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.200]   And why would you try to?
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.080]   I think that--
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.520]   Say their person is fine.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.800]   Right.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.880]   Human versus--
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.280]   Human.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:49.880]   Animal.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.800]   And some people, I can't tell whether an animal
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.360]   are human.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:53.960]   I don't know.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.160]   I've had my moments.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.120]   Some people do call me a beast.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.840]   You are in beast mode.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.680]   That's for sure.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.960]   I've seen you at the gym.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.400]   That's good.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:03.960]   Good for Google.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.320]   That's the right thing to do.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.960]   I thought that was actually an important story.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.480]   So thank you.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.080]   It's kind of funny, though, that we're making such--
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.280]   that they're such a big deal.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.320]   It's like, well, that's obvious.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:18.040]   If you can't identify something by how it looks, then don't.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.440]   But I think that not many years ago at all, advertisers
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.280]   would say, no, no, no, we have to no gender.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.360]   We're paying for it, right?
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.600]   Yeah, because that's marketing.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.760]   And they want to know-- they want--
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.040]   show me a picture of a woman that, you know,
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.520]   in the kitchen that I can use from my ad.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.320]   So they need to know because that's who they're marketing to.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.600]   Maybe we should have fewer pictures of women in the kitchen.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   You think?
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.840]   You're here.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.800]   And honestly, that's a mistake on advertisers' parts.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:53.600]   They shouldn't assume by gender who they advertise to.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.840]   That's just a mistake.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.440]   Just a mistake.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.360]   But that's going to be the problem
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.520]   because these aren't necessarily biases.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.480]   These may be driven by data.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.960]   Well, we just know, Leo, that 48% of women
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.080]   don't buy our products, so we don't want to advertise to them
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.800]   or whatever it is.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.480]   That's data-driven, and yet it comes off poorly.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.560]   But you can understand the advertiser saying, well--
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.600]   Business is business.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.560]   Right.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:18.840]   Business is business.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.000]   That's building your way for most.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:22.640]   Is it?
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:22.960]   What's that?
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.160]   Yeah, if you buy an ad in people, which
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:31.640]   was a predominantly female readership by the research,
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.040]   and you're advertising a product that only women will buy,
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.200]   they kind of discount on that basis.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.600]   They give you a CPM based on the women you reach.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.080]   OK.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.440]   Yes, but again, the underlying assumption is, well,
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.800]   I only want to reach women or I only want to--
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.760]   Well, but this is sexist.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.260]   Right?
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.520]   In the old days of newspapers, there
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.840]   were no real endemic, that is to say, category ads and sports.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.120]   The thing that appeared in sports sections was tire ads
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.320]   under the assumption that--
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.160]   And buy the tires.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:07.000]   And be men by tires, both of which are wrong.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.600]   So maybe we're doing an advertiser a favor by saying,
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.400]   you know, it's better you don't know.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.640]   They're just people.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.600]   They're just people.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.160]   And people buy your products.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.040]   I mean, advertisers have to put things into buckets, right?
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:22.080]   And they want sort of standardized bucket.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.080]   That's right.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:23.920]   Just easier.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.440]   That's right.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.240]   Yeah, when I was making ads to show in Costco's and Walmart's,
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.120]   we only made ads specifically designed for women.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.120]   Really?
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:33.480]   Yep.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.080]   You made ads--
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.520]   It's a card that our producers think, who
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.560]   is now you know why he likes working here.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.480]   You used to be ads for Costco?
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.280]   Yep.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.440]   Yeah, we worked a place a lot.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.600]   A lot of tech TV people ended up
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:52.200]   at that made in-house ads for Costco and other other places
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:52.640]   like that.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.360]   I was at a gas station once.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.000]   I saw Patrick Norton on the screen over the pump.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.280]   Was that it?
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.200]   No, but I have used Luria Petrucci in it.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.920]   Because that's for Costco.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.920]   Callie--
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.920]   Callie.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:07.920]   Woman formerly known as Callie.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.920]   Yes, she was Callie Lewis then.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.920]   Mm-hmm.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:15.560]   This seems like it's a trivial day for news.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.560]   It just feels like that.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.560]   A little bit.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.560]   It's a little-- like, it's a trivia.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.560]   A little bit.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.640]   We'll do-- we'll do trying to fool--
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.760]   like, this seems to me trivial-- trying to fool Amazon
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.200]   with a banana.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.200]   So--
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.200]   That was not my story.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   That was my--
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.120]   By the way, let me get a rant out of the way first.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.880]   I hate the headline.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.200]   Amazon made a bigger camera spying store.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.200]   It's not spying!
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.080]   So we tried to steal its fruit.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.040]   So-- and this is Sam Mushkovich, by the way, who's a good friend of the--
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.040]   --that worked in an air show.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.040]   So--
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.040]   A funny story.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.600]   --there is an interesting story, which is that Amazon is going to build a 7,000 square
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.440]   foot Amazon Ghost Store in Seattle.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.400]   It's going to be a full-sized grocery store.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:58.720]   You go in, you scan your phone, you take whatever you want off the shelf.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.680]   They actually have a sign on the cart that says, bag it as you buy it.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.240]   You get to the end of the shopping spree, you pick up the bags out of the cart and you
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.240]   go.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.240]   That's it.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.240]   And it's--
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.080]   And I was my first thought was, what about produce?
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.840]   So that's what he investigated.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.880]   Well, ironically, the thing is, there's plenty of humans, because who's putting the produce
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.880]   out.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.880]   Right.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.120]   But there's just no-- one thing you're eliminating is check stand.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.920]   But that is a bottleneck at grocery stores.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:30.040]   That's the-- that's when you're done shopping, you have to wait in line at the check stand.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.920]   That's the bottleneck in the grocery stores.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.120]   But, dad, come in.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.920]   I don't work in the grocery store.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.760]   Stop forcing me to check out my own groceries.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.720]   Well, this one, you don't even have to do that now.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.720]   See, we're not going to make you do that.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.720]   You don't check out.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   Yeah, you don't scan anything.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.720]   We're going to spy on you.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.480]   I'm cool with that.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.720]   I know it's not in and out.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:50.720]   I'm cool with that.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.720]   But the whole notion of--
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:56.120]   Research shows that most people-- most people agree with you and most people do not
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.120]   want.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.920]   Those self-checkouts, no one uses stuff.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:32:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:04.880]   I get it if I'm just in there to grab a pack of-- I don't know-- a deck of cards or something.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.440]   And I can just scan it and walk on it and do my thing.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.160]   And have it advise a deck of cards in the grocery store.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.160]   And?
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.160]   OK.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.160]   A bad example, Mr. Jordan.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.160]   No, you don't.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.160]   They may sell them.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.160]   They sell them in Vegas.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.160]   They sell them in the grocery store.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:23.380]   They're yag
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.380]   I clearly have the casino on my brain.
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:27.380]   Sorry.
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.880]   I'm old enough to remember when people objected to UPC-- I mean, those barcodes.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.880]   Or codes and scenerys.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.640]   They didn't trust them at all.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.760]   But they're so much better than the end human.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.760]   Of course.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.960]   But you'd stand there and you'd check to make sure--
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.960]   Folks would check to make sure.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.520]   They put that on the screen so you can look and-- they go so fast.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.520]   How can you--
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.520]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.520]   I think you missed it.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.520]   $2 off.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.520]   Yeah, sure.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.520]   It looks fun.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.160]   So this is it.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.800]   This is the Amazon Go store.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.160]   Grab a cart bag as you shop.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.160]   So they--
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.440]   Tries to hide a banana, which is probably a joke, but I'm not going to--
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.440]   Yeah, no.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.440]   That's just a joke.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.400]   But here's the interesting thing.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.040]   It is true that they have cameras.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.160]   There's cameras in the ceilings up here.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.920]   I don't know if there's sensors on the shelves.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.760]   There might be.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.080]   They are looking-- you know, obviously they're going to charge you for whatever you put in
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.280]   your cart.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.600]   But I have to say, I think a lot of the value of this is the data about what you look at
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.560]   and don't buy.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.840]   Or what you pick up and put back.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:33.720]   When you think if you're a potato chip company and Amazon could say, you know, 43% of the
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:37.960]   people who picked up your bag of chips put it back in the shelf, you'd like to know them.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.920]   They looked at the nutrition label.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.920]   That's it, never mind.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.680]   So there's data here beyond what you're buying.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:49.080]   So I think when Sam says surveillance, obviously that's a loaded word.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.520]   But in a way it is.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.360]   I mean, see, there's the cameras.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.120]   They're surveilling the products, not you.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.080]   What's the amount of surveilling your behavior?
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.360]   Do they get you to agree to anything before you go in the store?
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.360]   Wow, look at all these inference.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:06.600]   Matthew, you download the app specific to these stores.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.600]   Oh, OK.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.600]   And I've been with all the--
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.600]   I didn't-- I didn't use the app.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.600]   I didn't even click through.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.600]   Click OK.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.600]   That's the number he reads.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.600]   Right.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.600]   This is a 56 page.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.600]   Well, it's Amazon Go.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.600]   Let me see if it's--
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:22.000]   So despite the scandalous headline, which I'm sure Sam did not write.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Yeah, I'm sure that.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.560]   This actually is really interesting because--
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.560]   Go in the story.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.560]   He calls it creepy.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.560]   Oh, OK.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.440]   Well, I want to know what grocery stores you guys are going to that don't have cameras
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.440]   on you at all times.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.440]   That's a good point.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.440]   But I don't know if there is--
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.440]   Good point, Karsten.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:41.440]   Teddleham, a market wouldn't be checking out what I'm buying and--
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.440]   A little market is constantly--
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.440]   A little bit of a tiny little town in the middle of the--
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.200]   They're still veiling me so I don't steal stuff off the shelf.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.440]   But that's different from this.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.000]   I guess, yeah, if you didn't want to be on camera at all, you wouldn't go on a grocery
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.600]   store.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.320]   So there's the store tutorial when you get there.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.640]   There's a little diagram.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.800]   So I went, not do.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.520]   And it tells you, don't pick up anything for anyone else.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.400]   Oh, yeah, because you'll get charged.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.000]   You'll get charged.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.880]   And he goes to the restroom.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.880]   So this is--
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.280]   That was really kind of cheating the test here.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.040]   Does he hide the fruit in his backpack?
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.360]   I feel like Sam did this last time, too, didn't he?
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.360]   He did.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.360]   He did.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.560]   He's a serial banana stealer.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.560]   OK.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.200]   So they should have him on some kind of list.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   He's got a control group.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.200]   He's got a control group.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.200]   That's what it sounds like.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   You know, like Vegas.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.200]   Yeah, he also found--
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.600]   Yeah, he also found--
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.400]   I almost don't want to say this because he had a coat on.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.400]   He went into the restroom.
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:46.240]   He put the coat into his backpack.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.600]   And it didn't recognize him when it came out.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   Oh.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.000]   Well, don't try to fake.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.520]   Look, this is a convenience, not--
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.520]   Which is?
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.520]   Which is?
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.760]   It's some credit for trying to do a little bit of R&D to hopefully make this experience
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.040]   better and more efficient.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.200]   He left an avocado on the table outside of the restroom.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.480]   And he was pretty sure there were no cameras in the restroom, by the way.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.360]   I am glad he did that.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.760]   And-- but left it there.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.680]   So he did get charged for that because he-- only fair game.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:21.680]   Well, yeah, if you take an avocado and leave it on a table somewhere, you should be charged
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.680]   for it.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.040]   Well, robots have to go get it, put it back--
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.040]   Put it back.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.360]   And responsible for that avocado.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.680]   That's your avocado, buddy.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.160]   What you want to do with it after you pick it up?
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.720]   How does it know-- how does it know-- how many-- how many-- we got a picture on the screen
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.720]   now cooking.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.720]   How many strudels you pick up?
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.720]   Albert, there's no-- how many cookies?
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.720]   So the cookies are in a stack.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.680]   There's three cookies high, right?
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.320]   You take one or two.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.280]   How that-- is it the weight?
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   How the hell does it know?
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.280]   There's a lot of--
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.280]   There's a lot of cameras.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.560]   That's pretty-- that's pretty-- I'm sure there's like a plat of a lot inside there,
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.560]   melt in the camera.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:59.080]   There's still-- you also said that in some cases when he had a complicated thing, most
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.360]   times the receipt comes in immediately.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.960]   Sometimes it took two hours.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:07.680]   So you imagine there's some room somewhere on Earth where people are replaying the video
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.680]   too.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:09.680]   Oh, yeah, we're doing it.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.120]   Well, at least initially for sure.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.520]   He said it took four hours for him to get the notification.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.920]   This is a good-- thank you, Sam, for doing the-- during the work.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.920]   Skynet above--
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.920]   Stroup waffles.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.920]   Stroup waffles.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:25.920]   Don't you love Stroup waffles?
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:26.920]   I love those things.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.920]   Holy cow.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.920]   That was a well-done.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.920]   We started buying Stroup waffles for our staff.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:31.920]   How's this thing?
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.720]   I haven't seen it here in a little while.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:41.720]   It's a special little Dutch thing, the little chocolate cookie wafer thing that you put
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.560]   over your coffee when it's hot and it kind of softens it and the caramel softens and
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.160]   you eat it with your coffee.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.160]   Oh, man.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.200]   They have not had a Stroup waffle, by the way.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.200]   It's--
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.200]   Ever?
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.200]   They've been--
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.200]   Oh, that pleasure comes next.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   No, no.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.200]   Oh, good.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.200]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.200]   They're a little bit of goo.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.200]   Just kind of do it.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.200]   Not kind of do it.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   Not kind of do it.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.200]   I don't think it's chocolate.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.200]   I think it's caramel.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.200]   It's caramel.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   It's caramel.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.200]   Well, you see my ignorance.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.200]   Speculos.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.200]   Oh, I do like speculos.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.880]   Okay, I admit I had a little speculos butter the other day.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.120]   If you're ever in New York--
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.120]   Mr.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.120]   D.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.120]   There's a--
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.640]   You guys are changing those cookies and people are mad.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.640]   I am too.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.520]   It's not that they're going to keep the Stroup waffle, but there's another cookie that I
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.680]   like that they're getting rid of.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.680]   And Twitter is enraged.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:35.120]   How is it that I'm the fattest guy in the panel?
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.160]   And you guys are eating all this--
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.680]   I think I got a bad roll of the dice.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.640]   I guess I am good jeans.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.640]   I know that.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.640]   It's being a--
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.640]   Gosh darn it.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.640]   I'm lighter than you go balls.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.640]   I got that.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.280]   If you go to New York, go to a place called Waffles and Dinges.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.280]   You go balls.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.240]   What's a dingy?
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.680]   So dingy is a thing that you put on the waffle.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.680]   It's not as dingy.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:02.320]   It's a Dutch word for whatever you put on the waffle.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.320]   I heard that right.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:07.320]   So you can put speculos on there and you can put Nutella on there.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.320]   You name it.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.320]   Hey, you know what?
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.160]   This price for avocado is 49 cents.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.160]   That's a good deal.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.840]   19 cents for the stolen banana.
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.840]   That's only if you leave it outside the bathroom.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.720]   They charge you more a few.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.240]   Oh, he says this is what they say I bought.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.240]   Well, that's because he went around the whole thing.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.240]   He left it around the middle of the bottom.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.600]   He bought a banana and a avocado.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.120]   He's on a list, buddy.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.280]   That's how you get on a list.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.120]   19 cents for a banana is not bad.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.120]   That's a great deal, Noah.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.800]   That's about normal, but that's a dang cheap avocado.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.520]   That's a real cheap avocado.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:42.040]   I think at Starbucks they charge you a buck for each banana, don't they?
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.120]   So what you should do is buy them here and walk them over to Starbucks and sell them to
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:51.200]   Starbucks or have a little stand out front.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.040]   25 cent bananas here.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.920]   Get your 25 cent bananas.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.680]   It's always been money in the banana stand.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.240]   It's banana arbitrage.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.640]   It's banana arbitrage.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   Bylo, Selhi.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.640]   Oh my God.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.760]   What are these people doing themselves?
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.720]   How did you pronounce that Matthew Waffles and what?
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.720]   Dinges.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.720]   Oh, dingies?
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.720]   I thought it was dingus.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:14.720]   Oh, no, it's dingus.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:15.720]   I think it's something else.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.720]   Oh my gosh.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.720]   Dinges.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.360]   It's highly recommended.
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:24.720]   It feels like if it's Dutch and it's a G, isn't it?
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.720]   There he is.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:26.720]   There he is.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.680]   I don't, not in that particular word.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.680]   I don't.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.680]   Not that spot.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.680]   Okay.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.680]   This weekend.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.680]   I'm gristic.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.880]   I honestly think, as soon as he said it, I felt like Matthew is saying this with such confidence
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.880]   he's actually gone to Holland to get the word.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.360]   He was saying it was confidence.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.960]   But he's going off the accent of a New Yorker.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:45.960]   Yeah, true.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:49.800]   I feel like he asked somebody on one of the K, 1000 Amsterdam.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.200]   How do you say dingy?
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.520]   And the trustee in Canadian just believed him.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.960]   Facebook is going to ban something.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.960]   Thank God.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.520]   They have standards misleading coronavirus ads.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.600]   They're not going to let people sell cures.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:06.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.960]   Now they've got some standards.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.720]   Come on.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.160]   That's freedom of speech.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.760]   Freedom of speech.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.760]   Freedom of speech.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:20.520]   If you're going to, if you're going to let another story on that farther down, that's
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.040]   not, that's not breaking the first.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.200]   It's not breaking the first amendment because it's commercial speech or something.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.200]   True that.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.920]   Well, they have a right to have one.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.040]   They should decide to take them out.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.280]   In my view, they're not going to actually do whatever they want.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.280]   They can do whatever they want.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.040]   It's just interesting that they.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.760]   They're not bound by the first amendment appeals court rules.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.520]   There's obvious ruling.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.520]   The first amendment.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.520]   First of the government.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.520]   We always know.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:47.760]   Prager, you lost one.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.320]   Yay.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.560]   Prager, you said, as soon as saying you can't.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.560]   Jesus.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.560]   What's the YouTube?
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.560]   Oh, YouTube took him down.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.120]   And Prager, you said, first, first amendment.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.120]   No.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.560]   I mean, it's, it's for show.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.200]   So they can act like victims.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.400]   Trump campaign just, just this afternoon sued the New York Times over a column.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.400]   You know, you're really.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.400]   Wow.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.400]   Contending libel.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.400]   It's ridiculous.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.400]   Loss.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.720]   I would, if I'd be the judge, I'd be so upset.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.320]   Is there any recourse for a judge?
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.320]   For those lawsuits.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.320]   Oh, sure.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:24.320]   It's like slap.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.320]   I don't know.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.120]   You can make, you can make them pay the other parties legal expenses.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.480]   I don't know if there's any, any further.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.080]   I think you can go up to the lawyer too and there and there.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.080]   Certification.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.080]   You can strongly reprimand them.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.400]   The XKCD on this, of course there is.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.960]   There's an XKCD on everything.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.600]   This one, you know, I was gonna say it seems like it had.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.600]   It was the first amendment.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:44.600]   Everything covered.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.320]   Russell Monroe does leaves no stone unturned.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:53.440]   Here is his cartoon on free speech, public service announcement.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.440]   This is funny.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.440]   They actually had to go to court to find this out.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.440]   The right to free speech means the government can't arrest you for what you say.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:04.000]   It doesn't mean that anyone else has to listen to your BS or host you while you share
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   it.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.600]   The first amendment does not shield you from criticism or consequences.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.800]   If you're yelled at, boycott it, have your show canceled.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   Prager you.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.480]   Or get banned from an internet community.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.720]   Your free speech rights are not being violated.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.160]   It's just the people listening.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.160]   Think you're an A-hole.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.160]   I don't wanna hear it.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.760]   And they're showing you the door.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:25.400]   Is there an XKCD on section two, that explains section two, thirty, four boxes?
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.200]   I can ask, Russell, Randall.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.600]   What's the alt text on that one?
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.600]   The alt text.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.760]   The alt text is always funny.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.760]   I can't.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.760]   I can't hold on.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.520]   I'm trying to get there's a joke.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:38.520]   There's a hidden joke.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.960]   I popped up and then it went away.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:41.960]   What do I do?
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.080]   Hold the mouse over.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.080]   I'm so impatient.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.080]   Stand on the left.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:50.160]   I'm so impatient that I can't leave the mouse alone long enough for the alt text to pop
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.160]   up.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.160]   That's not popping up now.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.760]   I popped up a second ago.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.760]   Let's try it.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.760]   Let's go out and come back in.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.800]   I can't remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:03.360]   by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.640]   You're saying the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it's not
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.800]   literally illegal to express.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:10.800]   It's good.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   It's not good.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.800]   I didn't know about the alt text.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   I didn't know that.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:15.800]   I had no idea, Matthew.
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.400]   Did you find that by accident or by?
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.400]   No.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.400]   It's probably well known.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.400]   No, so much.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.840]   Oh, that's fantastic.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:29.120]   I interviewed him on the late limited triangulation of last year and he is great.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.080]   He has a wonderful book.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.080]   Was it called What If?
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.360]   So funny or just rye?
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.280]   Rye and funny.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.280]   Is he funny?
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.280]   I thought he was funny.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.280]   Was he?
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.280]   Do you like make jokes?
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.280]   Did he?
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.280]   Okay.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.800]   Speaking of funny, another Facebook story, the one next up, I put that one in.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:48.800]   Okay.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   I giggled for quite a while.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.800]   Okay.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.280]   Facebook quietly cuts off.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.280]   Sense it.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.280]   No.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.280]   No, no, no.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:59.040]   The reporter accidentally, TV reporter on literally turns on Facebook filters before
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.040]   going live.
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.040]   Oh, she's pretty funny.
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.040]   Oh, she's pretty funny.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.040]   Oh, she's funny.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.680]   He gets the dog's face.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:11.920]   So he's, he's, he thinks he's streaming to the channel.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:12.920]   A dumb weather report.
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.760]   Because he didn't want to, he didn't want to use.
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:20.120]   So he's got a hat and sunglasses that aren't real.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.120]   He's got a barbell.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.920]   He got a space on it.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:23.920]   Oh, man.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.920]   You think you didn't know it?
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.920]   I mean, you think you didn't know it?
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.920]   No, I don't know.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.920]   I don't know.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.200]   That's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's,
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.040]   that's, is that green by what I believe, Matthew?
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.040]   I want to believe.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.040]   I know.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.040]   I know.
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.040]   It's just, it's almost too good.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.240]   The yellow west is, is it greenville?
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.240]   Isn't your home?
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.240]   I believe this, I believe this greenville is.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.680]   He's got googly eyes.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.680]   Definitely snow.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:46.680]   We know that.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:52.600]   So you think he's like, he put on, so can you do this by accident?
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.880]   Like you put on Facebook live, you go stand on the other side of the camera and accidentally
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.960]   you hit the face mask thing.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:02.440]   I'm wondering it's happened to a Pakistani government like, oh, I remember that.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.440]   True.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.440]   Committee meeting.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.440]   Yes.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.440]   Yes, you can.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.440]   Yeah, that's his, this is hysterical.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:11.800]   But wouldn't someone have told him like, did he, did he not have an ear?
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:12.960]   These are spawning at the end.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.360]   He's saying, did I have something on my face?
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.320]   I know, but while, but like the first time I would happen with the gun.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:19.320]   I love the dumbbells.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:25.120]   Well, he's staring at the phone, just doing his report saying, oh snow and collect on
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.120]   the ground.
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.120]   He's left in dumbbells.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.720]   And then a hat comes on him and then a beer.
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.360]   The wizard ones, definitely.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:35.200]   I like the follow up to that story.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.840]   Why so serious mistakes were made, but news 13's Justin Hinton reminds us to laugh it off.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:41.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:43.640]   Well, at least he's only a weather man.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.120]   Oh, I love this.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.880]   He's got a, they darkened him and have a flashlight.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.720]   Can you imagine you should do that all the time?
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.960]   Viewers at home would love this.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.600]   Oh, I'd watch.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.600]   Looks more watchable.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.600]   I'd watch this all the time.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.600]   I had a nice little sight.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.880]   In fact, Carson, can you push that button for the rest of the show?
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.240]   Is there a three-
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.240]   I wouldn't not have that button yet.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.160]   Mr. Kevin has something over there.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.240]   I want that button.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.160]   I can do the face mask button.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.920]   I got that.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:19.840]   Yeah, that is the news.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.720]   The station from back home.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.160]   Oh my goodness.
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.640]   You should ask your mom if she's.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.360]   Yeah, I will be following up.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.360]   Do you know, Jesse?
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.360]   He knows.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:32.560]   Do you know the Hinton guy?
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:37.760]   We mentioned, I think did we mention that the Oracle Google battle has finally got made
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.480]   its way to the Supreme Court on appeal.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:51.440]   And shortly before the president tweeted about it, oh boy, Larry Ellison had a fundraising
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.480]   dinner party raised a bunch of money from Silicon Valley.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.480]   Who was there?
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.480]   The president was there.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:02.720]   And the next day, he says, you know, Supreme Court, you know, my buddy Larry Ellison and
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.160]   Oracle, I think he should win.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.240]   I think he should win that one.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:12.200]   Now, I normally would say, oh, the Supreme Court would not read Twitter and pay attention
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:19.040]   to what the Twitter, Twitter chief says, except then Justice Sotomayor said, well, in fact,
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.040]   they do.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.040]   Thanks.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:28.280]   And she wrote it in dissent, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of means testing of immigrants
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:33.040]   before they come in the United States in a party line vote.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:38.000]   And Sotomayor who was in the minority wrote a dissent that said, I just want to let you
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   know.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.680]   They just do what the president told them what to do.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.680]   Mm hmm.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.880]   Well, then she should recuse herself.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.680]   No, no, no, the other one should recuse themselves.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:53.960]   No, Trump told her Trump said, recuse yourself because you're not under my influence.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:54.960]   Yes.
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.960]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:57.960]   Brilliant.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.960]   Oh my God.
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:03.720]   You know, we laugh, but we laugh because we're not crying.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:04.720]   The thing is I stopped.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.240]   I don't read his tweets anymore.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.320]   And now I didn't even know I missed that.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:12.480]   I missed that follow up tweet.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.520]   I don't know where do we stand with Huawei these days?
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:18.600]   What's how does the president feel about Huawei?
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.600]   Do we know?
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.600]   I don't know if you didn't.
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:24.000]   Does he know them?
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:31.540]   Google is telling Huawei, okay, you can sell your phones with Android, but do not sideload
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:35.160]   Gmail and YouTube onto your Huawei phone.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:39.600]   They say it poses a significant security risk.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.120]   We were talking about whether we should get the new Huawei Mate phone for review.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.200]   And I said, well, let's not because you can't buy it in the US.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.400]   But on the other hand, it actually looks like a really nice photable.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:53.640]   That thing that last year is the Mate X was very, very nice.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:54.640]   Goodness.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.640]   That's so nice.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:56.640]   No, Huawei makes great phones.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.640]   I had a P20.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:58.640]   I thought this is the nicest thing ever.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:02.640]   I, you know, I did notice that when I first booted it up, it said, can we send all your
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.640]   data to China?
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.800]   I thought that was a little odd.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:06.800]   I'm not joking.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.280]   It does, in fact, have a kind of blanket.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.200]   You're, you know, we have access to everything on your phone thing.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.680]   I did ask the Huawei people.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.280]   I saw the Huawei PR person and I said, hey, what about that?
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.360]   She said, no, it all goes through Boston.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:21.360]   I think they said Germany.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:22.360]   And then Germany.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.360]   And then Germany.
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:25.360]   Because it's a Germany to China.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.360]   Right.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.360]   Who doesn't get it?
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.560]   So Huawei, yeah, right.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:36.840]   Huawei can't use the Google version of Android thanks to trade restrictions.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:43.440]   And Google is prohibited from working with Huawei on new device models.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:47.680]   This is actually a Google support article or providing Google's apps, including Gmail,
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.680]   apps, YouTube, the Play Store and others.
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.840]   Huawei on new device models are providing apps.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.840]   Is that you?
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.280]   It's a ray is telling me about Huawei.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.280]   Thank you.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.080]   I didn't mean to.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.080]   Nice work.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.320]   I have a story about that, by the way.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.360]   We'll get to it in a second.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:07.280]   The Play Store and others were preloaded, downloading these devices.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:11.640]   There's, but Google says we've received a number of questions about the new Huawei devices
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.160]   launching and whether Google apps and services can be used.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:18.080]   We want to provide clear guidance.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.600]   They say it's a security issue.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:25.240]   Sign-loaded apps will not work reliably because we do not allow these services to run on
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:29.520]   uncertified devices where security may be compromised.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.880]   So they say, you know, we're not going to let it run because we don't know what the
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.840]   security status is of that.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:38.480]   Once you turn on the, once you turn off the guard, then you're vulnerable.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:43.960]   Who's the, we did a story I think two weeks ago, the game guy who wouldn't put the game
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:44.960]   up.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:45.960]   That's the same thing with Fortnite and Epic.
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:46.960]   Fortnite.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:47.960]   Tim Sweeney.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:51.840]   So he was arguing that Google was all evil because Google was warning people not to load
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:52.840]   it.
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.200]   Well, because Google always says don't sideload.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.200]   Right.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.200]   But this is going a step further.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:00.680]   They're saying don't let sideload our stuff.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.680]   Right.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.680]   I mean, Gmail's safe.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.680]   Right.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.960]   Well, because again, it's the act of sideloading.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.640]   Once you turn on the ability to sideload, it's all on.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:10.640]   Right.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.240]   And anything can come in.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:18.160]   And so you've ruined the protections that the phone has.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:24.640]   I'm glad my phone just went off because there was, yes, because there was an interesting
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:31.040]   study just done by Northeastern University and the Imperial College of London about speakers,
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.040]   smart speakers.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:36.200]   When speakers are all ears, understanding when smart speakers mistakenly record conversations,
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:41.600]   they took all the major smart speakers, including Cortana.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.920]   Nobody uses Cortana.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:44.920]   That's the hard stuff.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:45.920]   That's the video game.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:46.920]   Oh, that was sad.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:48.920]   He's a Windows guy.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:49.920]   Is that the video game?
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.920]   Yeah, it's in Halo.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:52.920]   Oh, yes.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.920]   That's sexy.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.920]   So there's a Google Mini.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:59.960]   There's a Harman Carden invoke, which runs Cortana.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:04.720]   There's the Apple HomePod and an Echo device, a couple Echo devices.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:10.200]   They did the second and third generation and then they put them in a box with a really
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:13.200]   hot light pointed at them and a camera.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.520]   And then they played 125 hours of Netflix TV shows.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.920]   The interrogation light?
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.000]   They played Gilmore Girls.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.400]   By the way, the two shows that really triggered a lot of activity with the assistants were
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.680]   the Gilmore Girls and the office.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.680]   And they think it's because there's a lot of dialogue.
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.680]   Mm-hmm.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.080]   So they'll talk over each other too.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:37.760]   One of the things they said is, look, key findings.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:43.320]   These devices we found, no evidence that these devices are constantly recording conversations.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:46.680]   So rest assured, they're not always listening.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:52.200]   The devices do wake up frequently but often for short intervals with some exceptions.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:55.760]   The average rate of activations, again, this is not because you said the wake word but
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:02.520]   because they were watching TV, is between 1.5 and 19 times in a 24-hour day, HomePod
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:07.680]   and Cortana devices activate the most followed by the echo.series 2, the Google Home Mini
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.480]   and the echo.series 3.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.600]   But it's roughly 1 to an hour.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.280]   They're not recording your conversation.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.280]   They're not.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.280]   It's just waking up.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:23.920]   But they are recording when they activate and whatever conversation follows the activation.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:31.440]   And they said several cases, the echo second generation and the invoke would activate for
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:38.160]   20 to 43 seconds after hearing thinking they heard the activation phrase.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:43.320]   For the HomePod and the majority of the other echo devices, six seconds.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.280]   That's a huge difference.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.720]   Here's the pattern on wake words.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:54.280]   The Google Mini activations occur when the dialogue includes words rhyming with "Hey"
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:58.320]   like "A" or "They" followed by something that starts with a hard "G" or that contains
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.320]   "O" like "Cold" or "Told".
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.640]   Examples include "AP Girl".
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:05.320]   Okay, and what?
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.160]   I can work.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:11.880]   What kind of "Okay" but not "I can spare" and "I don't like the cold".
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.680]   All of that makes perfect sense.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:14.680]   I can spare.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:15.680]   That's why I love researchers.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:17.640]   All of that makes perfect so much fun.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.880]   I say "AP Girl" multiple times in it.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:20.880]   "AP Girl".
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.840]   Well, apparently the gossip girl that happens, I guess.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:23.840]   I don't know.
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:24.840]   Okay.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:28.360]   For the HomePod, of course, with "Hey" or "Hi".
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:33.240]   "Follow" by something that starts with an "S" and a vowel or something that rhymes with
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:34.880]   "R" as in "Ciri".
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.680]   Faith's funeral?
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.320]   Faith's funeral.
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:39.320]   What?
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:44.240]   So if you were going to invent a human sound, that doesn't sound like a word that would
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:47.760]   trigger these things to turn on more reliably.
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.120]   Can you imagine what that sound might sound like?
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.120]   What?
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.120]   German?
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.120]   So like a cough.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.120]   German.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.120]   Unless you're in Germany in which case.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:57.120]   I got it.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:58.120]   I got it.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.000]   I shouldn't say expect.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.560]   I can't even say it.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:08.760]   So this, it baffles me why these companies don't let us say what our own activation words
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.240]   could be.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.760]   We should get to say our own.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:12.760]   Yeah, why not?
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:13.760]   It's hard because they've got to have 87 versions of them.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:17.200]   Because they want to get to the MottoX five years ago.
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.200]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:19.200]   Because they want to control it.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.960]   Facebook is now paying people.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.960]   It's on there.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.960]   They'll pay you a big $5.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.120]   This is awful.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:27.120]   To record your voice because they're trying to get a larger...
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:32.800]   I would pay good money if I could tell my Google to say, "Okay, Stroup Waffle."
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:33.800]   I love that.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.760]   That would be awesome.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:40.240]   Unless you're in Holland, I don't think it's going to come up a lot.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.240]   Nope, it's not.
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:44.640]   Maybe you could say Stroup Waffle Funeral.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.640]   That would be good.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.640]   Nobody would ever say it.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:47.640]   To mash potato.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:48.640]   And to jam it.
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:49.640]   Mash potato.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:50.640]   You got it.
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:53.640]   So funny.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:55.720]   So yeah, I mean researchers, right?
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:59.480]   I just liked it that they had to watch 125 hours in Netflix.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:00.760]   And then they repeated it.
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.280]   I remember like...
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.280]   Oh, sorry.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:07.920]   No, I was just going to say I appreciate them doing that because here in the Google side
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:14.560]   of things, it makes perfect sense when I look at scenarios in the house and those little
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:18.440]   chimes just pop up in the middle of a random conversation that we were all mad at.
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:20.920]   All the time it's happening here and it's a raise reading me.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:25.800]   And I'm thinking like, well what did it and I think back to what one of us said and that
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:29.800]   sort of sound like the trigger word.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:35.560]   I remember a story, I think it was a while back and I think it was Siri, but it somehow
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:42.840]   recorded a conversation between a woman and her husband and then emailed it or texted
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:43.840]   it to someone.
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:45.840]   Do you remember that?
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:50.400]   When they explained it, they said, yeah, it misheard the trigger word, then misheard
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:58.000]   record this, then misheard send a message, then it was literally like five commands in
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   a row.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   It's not highly likely.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:06.200]   But if there's millions of activations every day, each one of those case statements failed.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.320]   I like Stroup Waffle.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:11.360]   That would be a very good, it's awesome.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:16.840]   I love that chat room.
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:17.840]   Some pot of cool pineapple.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:18.840]   That would be another one.
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:20.480]   That's why you should be allowed to do your own.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:23.320]   Because you could make up something you know would not get heard.
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:25.040]   A Google bomb.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:28.280]   Maybe they don't think people would be good at that.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:32.160]   Well, it's also like, yeah, it would be how they would actually do change settings.
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:33.160]   Right.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.200]   But they could have it in there.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.360]   I've mentioned this before.
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:37.560]   My Moto X was help me.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.760]   I'll be one kind of.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.200]   And that was a really good trigger word.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:41.200]   It never got false.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:43.120]   Just to the test.
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:45.280]   And okay, Stroup Waffle doesn't work.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:47.120]   But Hastroup Waffle does work.
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:48.120]   No.
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:49.120]   Yes.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:50.120]   Hey, Stroup Waffle.
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:51.120]   Hey, Stroup Waffle.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.120]   Hey, Stroup Waffle.
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.120]   Damn.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.120]   You know, I stopped working.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.120]   I think we got it.
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:56.120]   Carson and I discovered this.
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.120]   I said, okay, boomer.
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:58.120]   And it triggered Google.
[00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.120]   But that stopped.
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.120]   I think they've actually took that out.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.120]   Okay.
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.120]   Okay, boomer.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.120]   Okay.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.120]   Boomer.
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:11.120]   It worked.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.120]   It worked.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.120]   Did it?
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.120]   Well, both.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.120]   Oh, worked on his.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.120]   Okay.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.120]   Goodness.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.120]   Thank goodness.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.120]   All three.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.120]   Sounds like a nickelback song.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.120]   Hey, Stroup Waffle.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.120]   Watch out.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.120]   You got to be on the show.
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.120]   You got to be nice.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.120]   This is some classic.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.120]   I'm going to be a little bit more.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:36.120]   You got to be on the show.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.120]   Good stuff.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.120]   Good stuff.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.120]   Verizon.
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:43.200]   There was a funny rumor going around that Verizon was going to -- didn't like the Pixel
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:47.120]   phones and we're not going to take the new one, the Pixel 5 or the 4A.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.120]   Verizon was quick to say no.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.120]   That's not -- that's wrong.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.120]   I don't know where these things come from.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.120]   So who reported that?
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.120]   The first place.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.120]   That's probably a Twitter.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.120]   I saw it first, I believe, 9 to 5 Google.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.120]   We did not repeat it.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.120]   Nope.
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.120]   We did not.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.120]   And I'm glad we didn't.
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.120]   Sometimes I -- yeah.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.120]   No, Andrew --
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.120]   I'll be able to run down.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.120]   No, Andrew or police.
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.120]   That's where I saw it first.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:13.120]   And then as you read down, they stuck an update in there to say, hey, no.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.120]   Update and --
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.120]   And not even traction.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.120]   Good.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.120]   You know what?
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.120]   There's a word you don't hear a lot in modern journalism.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.120]   Good on you.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.120]   Retraction.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.120]   Oh, good for that.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.120]   Good on you.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.120]   They said our report -- our source was working -- we believe -- we believe -- we believe -- we believe
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:34.120]   we believe with inaccurate, unreliable, outdated information.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.920]   That's not -- you know what?
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.120]   I give them credit because you can get stories wrong.
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:43.120]   But if you properly update and retract -- and you don't bury it, but you put it right there
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.120]   in the headlines.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.120]   It increases your credibility.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.120]   Yes.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.120]   Right.
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.120]   It came in my news feed, whatever news feed I was reading, the original headline.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.120]   So I clicked on it and read through it.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:58.120]   But I got about, you know, two-thirds through it and saw that there was an update in the
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:04.120]   bottom of the article that said, "Hey, our sources don't seem to be reliable."
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.120]   Good.
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.120]   You know.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.120]   But it's nice to see today updated ahead, too.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.120]   Bravo, Android Police.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:19.120]   That's the right way to do it.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.120]   So because of Brexit --
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.120]   I was looking at that story.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.120]   I don't know.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.120]   But I'm just looking at what you're looking at.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.120]   So, you're looking at the news feed, how do you do it?
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.120]   How do you do it?
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120]   You're looking at the news feed.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:57.120]   They do see a picture of a ship, but I can't believe they would do it.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.120]   It's full of data.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.120]   What were those old...
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.120]   Oh, God.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:08.120]   What were the brands of those carts you used to put in the machine, those square...
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.120]   Not those zip drives.
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.120]   Zip drives.
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.120]   Zip drive.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.120]   Yeah, they got old houses.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.120]   Eight million zip drives.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:19.120]   I remember a guy from NASA at a gig home conference saying that the only way that they could share
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:25.520]   data from some of the telescopes was to put hard drives in a box and put them on a UPS
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:31.120]   truck and ship them to someone because there was no bandwidth fast enough to transmit,
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.120]   you know, petabyte some data.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:36.120]   Do what you got to do.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.120]   Actually, the sneaker nut...
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:48.120]   Reed Hastings, the founder of Netflix, tells the story that...
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:56.440]   His college computer science professor asked him which has more bandwidth, a fiber optic
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:01.600]   cable across the country or a truck carrying 20,000 DVDs.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.120]   And when they did the math, it was the truck.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.120]   Right.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.120]   It was the truck.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:06.120]   Oh, yeah, for sure.
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:11.440]   So he had the insight, "Oh, you know, maybe we should mail DVDs instead of the making
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.640]   people download them."
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:17.480]   However, however, that's changed.
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.920]   Because now everybody's got enough bandwidth.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.920]   Not NASA.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.920]   Not NASA.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.120]   Not NASA, of all people.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.120]   Sick.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.120]   I kind of acute story.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:34.240]   Actually, apparently the story's changed over the years, so I don't know how accurate it
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.240]   is.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.240]   It's a good story, though.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.240]   It's a good story.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.600]   Shouldn't let facts get in the way of a good story?
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.600]   No.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:41.600]   No.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.600]   What else?
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.360]   Gosh, I don't know why.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.360]   Maybe it's me.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.360]   Maybe I'm getting ready for a little bit of virus.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.360]   Oh, this is what I like.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.360]   Okay.
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.360]   Maybe I need some carbs.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.360]   I don't know what.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.360]   Twitter is real life.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.360]   Carbs.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.360]   Twitter is real life.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.360]   There are many words in this column.
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.360]   There are many words in this column.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:04.040]   A rare moment of tech positivism in the New York Times.
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.040]   Clickbait.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.080]   I can't even click on typing.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:13.360]   No, as someone who wrote an optimistic book, I can tell you that optimism never sells.
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.360]   No.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.360]   There's Bernie.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:20.520]   So, for the better part of the year, I've been hearing the same refrain.
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:24.000]   He writes, "Friends, colleagues, peers, and respected pollsters of caution.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.080]   Twitter is not real life.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.120]   I think I'm one of them.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.600]   I've been saying that for a long time."
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.640]   I disagree with this, Charlie says.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:33.240]   In one reading, "The Twitter isn't real life.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:36.720]   Mantra has perhaps a laudable attempt itself for flexion by the media and the political
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.720]   elite.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.280]   Elite, but there's also a separate, less charitable reading of the phrase as it's deployed by
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.280]   the pundit class.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.280]   Oh, huh.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:48.200]   I'll ever bit of misdirection intended to make elite seem in touch while they protect
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.200]   the power."
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.200]   Exactly.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.200]   Mundo.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.040]   Is that what you're saying to me?
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.040]   I'm just...
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.040]   Uh-huh.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.080]   You're a scared elite.
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.640]   Try and protectionism for your great power.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.280]   That's the nicest thing you've ever seen, Jeff.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.280]   Wow.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.240]   If only it were true.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.720]   This thing ever said.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:13.240]   So we've seen other pieces, even in the New York Times, saying, you know, the...
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:15.920]   Arab Spring, there's lots of, you know, giving black...
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.080]   Far off on Jew.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.080]   Black Twitter.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.160]   Giving people who don't normally have voices.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.160]   Have a voice.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.160]   The chance to speak is important.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.160]   Mm-hmm.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.760]   And yes, and there are lots of people on the other side as well.
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.760]   Um...
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.160]   The thing is it's both.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.160]   It's both.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:32.160]   That's the problem with...
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.960]   It's like anything the internet touches.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.240]   It enables all the good stuff and all the bad stuff at the same time.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.080]   The other problem with the analysis is that people try to act like...
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:50.040]   They use a media analysis to act as if the total usage of Twitter reflects something.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.040]   It's not.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.720]   It's a bunch of individual voices you can finally hear.
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.720]   The agglomeration is meaningless.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.720]   But...
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:00.880]   Which end is that what the media often does, which is say, "Oh my gosh, people are really
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:05.720]   upset about the red dress versus the blue dress when it's just a bunch of yas on Twitter."
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.720]   Right.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720]   It's not a story.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.720]   Do you remember when...
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.720]   It's a buzz.
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.720]   Right.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:16.440]   They say, "Oh, uh, uh, the word such and such has been searched this many times on Google."
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.440]   Right.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.280]   Or if you search it, you get this many results like that showed anything.
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.280]   Right.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.680]   There's a million pages about this word.
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:30.880]   I love it when our local TV, they'll put a video on that they got off like college humor
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.880]   or some...
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.160]   Or Reddit or something.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:35.920]   And they'll say, "It's gone viral."
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.400]   And it'll have like 3,200 views or something.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.960]   This piece...
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:46.160]   I'm guessing and I haven't read it yet, so correct me if I'm wrong, Jeff, is really
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.480]   a defense of Bernie Sanders.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.480]   Right.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:53.880]   And if his grassroots movement on Twitter and the media elites rejection of Bernie Sanders
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:57.000]   saying, "Oh, well, don't believe the fact that he's got all this grassroots support on
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   Twitter doesn't mean he's going to get a lot of votes."
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.400]   That's kind of a subtweet opportunity.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.400]   I think it's partly that.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.400]   I think it's partly that.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:10.840]   But it's also saying that there are lots of influential people who are on Twitter and
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:15.920]   they help shape the discussion that then actually makes things happen.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.320]   So in a real way, it is real.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.320]   But that's why it's...
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.320]   That's why it's both.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:24.480]   It is media elites saying, "Bernie is overblown."
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:27.560]   And then there's a lot of Bernie supporters saying, "No, Bernie's the greatest thing
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:28.560]   I've ever...
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:29.560]   It's all of that."
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.560]   Right.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.560]   Yeah.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.560]   And so it would be...
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:36.400]   I think it's a mistake, especially because you only see the things you follow on Twitter
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.400]   so safely.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:39.520]   I'm putting my finger on the pulse of America.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.520]   That's clearly not true.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.520]   Right.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:44.400]   It's not even the pulse of Twitter because it's just who you follow.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.400]   Well, it didn't again.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:48.000]   But it's also complicated.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.280]   Even if it is Twitter, you still have that trending column or whatever it is that they're
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:56.200]   constantly trying to put in your face when you open up the app.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:00.080]   So I don't necessarily follow that stuff, but I'm always agreeing.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.080]   You can use...
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:06.640]   I was just going to say the algorithm, unless you constantly tell it to only show you the
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:12.000]   latest weeks, which you have to do over and over and over, the algorithm takes over.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.200]   And it starts showing you things that it thinks you'll be interested in.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:18.000]   So you're not even deciding what to say.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.360]   Well, here's an interesting thing.
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.640]   I just went to my Twitter stream.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.840]   And instead of just showing general trends now, it's showing trends for me.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:25.840]   Trends for you.
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:27.840]   So now that's...
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:28.840]   I see a gear too.
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:29.840]   So can I...
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:30.840]   Just based on your location, I think.
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:31.840]   So I can uncheck that.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.480]   And who do I follow?
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.200]   So I'll uncheck that.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:39.800]   Now, what I want to be the NBA, I have never in my life read up story about it.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:40.800]   Exactly.
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:41.800]   That's what I'm talking about.
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:44.600]   I have things muted and talked or whatever.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.000]   So I made a mistake.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.920]   I said I want a global trends and all I'm getting is soccer.
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:49.920]   It's global.
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:50.920]   It's global.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:55.560]   I mean, literally, it sounds like I'm making a joke.
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.560]   That's global.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.760]   Soccer, soccer, soccer, soccer.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.400]   And then I think saying you should call it football.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.200]   That's all that's important.
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.800]   Apparently, let me go to what other countries.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.400]   Geez, that's the big worldwide trend.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.880]   Let me go...
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:13.120]   I would want to follow the United States trends, right?
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.600]   And not trends just for you.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:20.520]   Soccer, soccer, Major League Baseball and the coronavirus.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.520]   Coronavirus.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.520]   The coronavirus is number four.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.520]   Do these?
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.520]   Wow.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:32.240]   In your opinion, gentlemen, are these actual like statistical trends or is it somewhat curated
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.560]   and curried?
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.360]   I'm betting they're pushing some of them.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:42.160]   They may even have a deal with the champions like I don't know.
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:45.560]   I can't report the trend.
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.080]   This trend is about soccer.
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.320]   Why don't I have that?
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:55.080]   Okay, well, maybe I do want to go back to tweets trends for me.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:59.200]   This seems new though because I used to see just a list of trends by geography.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.000]   Every time I open the mobile app, different.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.200]   It pops up with that mess and I'm like, "I don't care about any of this."
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.200]   Trends for me.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.200]   See, they know me better.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.200]   They're just trying to help.
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.200]   Shooting in Milwaukee.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.200]   Shooting in Milwaukee.
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:15.200]   It's not helping when I actually have a mute word.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.200]   I don't.
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.200]   Trump.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.200]   I don't know.
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:19.200]   If you get Trump any trends.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.200]   And Trump is the thing that pops up.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.200]   Is it your trends?
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.200]   Come on.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.200]   Who's reading this?
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.040]   Twitter, I've come around to the point.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.040]   You need to know.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.040]   That's what you need to know.
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.040]   It's just this is an amusement.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.360]   This is just an amusement.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.360]   Right.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.360]   Right.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:36.120]   It's seriously, sometimes I read and I go, "Oh, people are awful."
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:41.240]   But most of the time I still have a handful of people that I care about on Twitter and
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:42.800]   you have great conversations.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:46.800]   I see what you, and you're going back and forth with who's always fist bumping guys on.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:47.800]   He's a nice fan.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:48.800]   What am I?
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:50.800]   You could be a good person to that.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:51.800]   No, you're like me.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:52.800]   You're an AO.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.800]   I'm not changing the video.
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:54.800]   I'm not changing the video.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.320]   You're more like a poor chap.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.360]   I know actually I long ago learned never to say anything on Twitter.
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.040]   I'm completely anadine on Twitter.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:06.440]   It's like, "Oh, yeah."
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:07.440]   Maybe that's why.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.440]   I don't know.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.440]   There's nothing you can't...
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:10.440]   The poor people are mad at you.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.440]   There's nothing you can do.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.440]   No, no.
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:13.440]   You tweet too much.
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.440]   They drop you.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:16.440]   You tweet too little.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.440]   At least they don't know you're there.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.440]   That's true.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:26.000]   I came across a great essay actually at Ribbon Farm, which is a blog you should check out.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:33.760]   It was about how Twitter is an example of what this guy calls the Internet of Beefs.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:41.920]   All it is is people who have a beef and unless you are 100% in alignment with them, then that's
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.320]   a moral failing on your part and they need to attack you.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.640]   There's no room for nuance.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.960]   There's just people looking for a fight.
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:49.960]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.640]   Also, the activist champions of Twitter.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.680]   There's a whole lot of activism on there, but no action.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.840]   Hashtag.
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:12:59.840]   I'm upset.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:00.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:01.840]   But then there's...
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:05.640]   I used to say the classic Twitter was, "I would say I love pancakes."
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.520]   And the first response is, "Why do you hate waffles?"
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.960]   Yeah, it is.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:12.960]   And then there's this.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:13.960]   Turn on my audio.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:14.960]   All the best.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.960]   Oh, man.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.960]   Yes.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:17.960]   Okay.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.600]   We're going to get pulled off YouTube for this, but it's worth it.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.240]   It is apparently a sea otter.
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.840]   It looks like he's actually eating the phone, but instead they're saying he's playing the
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.840]   saxophone.
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:31.840]   Uh-huh.
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.840]   That's awesome.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:33.840]   Okay.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:34.840]   Hairless whisper.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.280]   Why does someone have a sea otter in their living space?
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.280]   A sea otter.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.280]   What is it?
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.280]   What is this animal?
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.280]   I need to know more otter.
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.280]   It looks like a sea otter.
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:43.280]   It doesn't like an otter.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:44.280]   I need to know more about this.
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.280]   Is it an otter?
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.520]   It's clearly an otter.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.560]   I don't think it's okay to own otters.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.280]   Shouldn't it be in water?
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.280]   Maybe it's not a sea otter.
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.400]   There's a land otter.
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.160]   There's no such thing as a land otter.
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.160]   It's a sea otter.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.160]   There are river otters.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.160]   Where is the sea otter?
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.160]   It's a sea otter.
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.160]   All right.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.320]   Call the SPCA.
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.320]   So that's a sea otter.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:06.320]   There.
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.320]   That's where it's going.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.920]   So I look up on Google and I see, is otter a good pet?
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:11.920]   Answer.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:14.440]   Otters are frequently described as ferrets on crack.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.440]   That's a good reason.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.960]   The catarom says it's a river otter.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:19.960]   That is our algorithm.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.200]   It's still not a living room otter.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.520]   It's not a living room otter.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.920]   But it does play a mean saxophone.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:30.400]   All right.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.520]   Otters are frequently described as ferrets on crack and for good reason.
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:37.800]   So you can't even legally own a ferret in California.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.800]   So an otter must be right out.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:44.160]   They must be really mean because ferrets are pretty mean.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:46.320]   Jeff, am I a mistake?
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.680]   So we have a super Tuesdays.
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:49.680]   This is coming Tuesday.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:51.480]   We're voting in California.
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:55.720]   And I am, I can't vote.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.280]   I'm waiting to see.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.520]   I want to see what happens until Tuesday.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.320]   Normally I have a mail-in ballot.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.320]   Okay.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.880]   I want to see what happens in South Carolina.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:04.880]   Is that stupid?
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.040]   I'm like, I want to vote for the winner.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:11.800]   So I have my Kamala hat with black morning around it.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.440]   And then I have my Corey hat with black morning around it.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.120]   Now I have my Warren hat.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:21.880]   But right now I'm going to get ratioed for this.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:25.640]   The person I do not want to win the nomination is Bernie.
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.440]   So Biden, who I know, who he has a report whatsoever.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.920]   I might end up voting for Biden in your case.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.920]   I'm not Bernie.
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.800]   I decided I'm just going to get over it.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.800]   I'm going to like Bernie.
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.800]   That's just the way it is.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:37.800]   It is what it is.
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:38.800]   It is what it is.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.800]   It's not just about liking.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:40.800]   It's about fearing what else.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.560]   Chris Hughes had a really good piece the other night on a show trying to argue that the data
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.360]   doesn't back up these fears, but I still don't buy it.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.960]   Nothing Bernie is saying is weird.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:54.600]   You know, it's the word socialist, unfortunately.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.040]   That's really people say, oh, he's a communist.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.040]   He's a socialist.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:01.920]   He's Fidel Castro in a ill-fitting suit.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:06.320]   And everything he's saying, well, he kind of does look like Larry David.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.400]   Everything he says is perfectly legitimate.
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.280]   It's not like he's advocating the over.
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:14.760]   He's not even saying let's take over a TD.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.960]   Which I might support, to be honest with you.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.000]   It's just public health care for Christ's sake.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.160]   No, but it's a question.
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.960]   The question now is winning.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.800]   So this whole audience, that's a big deal.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.000]   That's why I still have to get women.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.160]   They only use that word against women.
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.160]   Like ability.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.160]   You should go like ability.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.160]   Like ability.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.160]   Like ability to.
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.160]   All right.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.160]   I didn't mean to get all political on you.
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.160]   I just wanted to get.
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.160]   You brought it up.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.160]   Let's look at the record.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.160]   I wanted to know.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.160]   There it is.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.160]   By waiting.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.160]   See how everybody else.
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.160]   That's all.
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:48.160]   That's all that we always use.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.800]   But the risk is that you're playing a sort of horse race game.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:52.800]   Right.
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.960]   Where you're trying to like, game the results and then you want to vote for the winner.
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.360]   Not the person that you actually support.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.360]   No, I want to vote for Amy.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.360]   I'm not sure.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:00.960]   But I don't want to throw away my vote.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:04.200]   And I think at this point, it would have to debate last night where everybody was at
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.200]   each other's throat.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.000]   I thought it might be good if we just got rid of all these other people.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.720]   Pick one person, it doesn't matter who.
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.280]   And just all get behind that one person.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.080]   There was an eight last night.
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.960]   Yeah, you glad I didn't see it.
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.960]   It was a Twitter debate.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:19.560]   It was a Twitter debate.
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:25.440]   And there's a great picture of Amy standing here while Tom Steyer screaming at Joe Biden.
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.880]   There's screaming at each other.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.800]   She's like in between going like this and it's got a press.
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.640]   It should just be a big cage match.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:33.440]   Like they should just all get in a cage.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.440]   Yes.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:35.440]   That's another one.
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.640]   Six politicians enter one leave.
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:40.600]   That's literally what it is.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:43.040]   There's no cage, but it's a virtual cage.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.920]   That's another one of my mute words, debate.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:47.680]   You don't want to know anything bad, huh?
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.600]   Don't you want information?
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.600]   What's left?
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:55.280]   It's like when I go in and order the burger without this and without that, without that,
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:59.080]   why don't you just say what is your Twitter just basically kittens?
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.080]   Almost.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.240]   There's a couple of dogs too.
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:02.240]   That's it.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.280]   People will always say how much they love Twitter.
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.760]   People like you basically you're not seeing Twitter.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760]   Google.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.760]   Oh, I already did that one.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:15.000]   I only reason I'm bringing this stuff up.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   I got nothing to say.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   I got nothing here.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   Are you well?
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   That's not true.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   Oh, I get coronavirus.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   Are you well?
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   Come on.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   You, nothing to say?
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   I got the blame.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.880]   There was another good Twitter one there actually about them trying to test new ways
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:29.040]   to fight misinformation.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:35.840]   They're thinking about not just badges on things that are misleading, but a kind of community-based
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.840]   point system.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.840]   I'm not sure any of them are going to work.
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:44.640]   I, you know, so there's a story like this every freaking week.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:48.480]   Twitter's thinking of all the text being upside down.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:49.480]   I know.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:50.480]   I know.
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.480]   And it never happens.
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.480]   It's usually never happens.
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.480]   I know.
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:54.480]   That's a fair point.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:58.720]   It's like I don't even, we're exploring a number of ways to address misinformation and
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:01.800]   provide more context for tweets on Twitter.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:02.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:08.600]   I almost saw a comment from someone who studies disinformation and they said this would actually
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:11.200]   be the worst thing to do.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:15.640]   That when you flag something and show that it's misinformation actually makes the problem
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:16.640]   worse.
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.120]   We know that because Facebook tried it.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.120]   Yeah.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.120]   And we know that.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:24.120]   And what got shared the most misinformation did.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:28.600]   Twitter's rolling out supposedly the new continue threat option.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.720]   So you don't have to use that stupid spool of thread or whatever.
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:34.720]   Oh.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:38.560]   Jeff is of the opinion that lots of people put a spool of thread on their tweet.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:39.680]   Before they do a threat.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:42.280]   I've never seen it, but he says it happens.
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:44.280]   Oh, the leader.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:45.800]   You're a thought leader.
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:46.800]   Never seen that.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:47.800]   Yes.
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:48.800]   Thank you.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.800]   Matthew, you're coming back.
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:52.440]   He's coming back.
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.600]   So I know actually this is an interest.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:20:00.440]   First of all, I feel like Twitter should not encourage these massive tweet storms.
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.800]   They're not a good way to post your thoughts.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:03.800]   Oh, really?
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:05.440]   That's what a blog posts.
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.440]   Yes.
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:09.880]   But on medium or something, nobody does that.
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:10.880]   Nobody does that.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:13.920]   You got to put it where people are.
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:17.520]   But it's the worst possible platform for a lot.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:23.680]   I think once it gets to 100 or 200 tweets in a thread, I think that's probably a little
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:24.680]   over the top.
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.680]   That's an essay.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.680]   That's a book.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:28.680]   Right.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.680]   That's only what?
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:32.080]   2800 or no, 28,000 words.
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.840]   That's an essay.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:37.120]   So you like this idea to have a button.
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:43.360]   So what happens is if you post a tweet and then you post another tweet, referring to that
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:48.000]   tweet, they'll give you a button that says, "Continue the thread."
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   Do you like that, Jeff?
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   Is that a good idea?
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   Tweet that's already used to that.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000]   You don't know because you quit Twitter before the threads were invented.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:01.360]   I quit Twitter before the hashtag.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.080]   There weren't even any ad symbols.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.560]   We didn't...
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:05.800]   Does Christmas scene is still getting...
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.960]   He gets credit for creating the hashtag, doesn't he?
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:08.960]   I think he should.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:09.960]   Yes.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:10.960]   Well...
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:11.960]   No?
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:12.960]   Who?
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:14.960]   That's a real range of reactions.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:15.960]   Wait a minute.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:16.960]   Wait a minute.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:17.960]   Well, who?
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:18.960]   No, the name you said.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:19.960]   I didn't hear the name you said.
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:20.960]   Chris used to work at Google.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:21.960]   Christmas scene.
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.600]   He's the first to use the hashtag.
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:26.040]   But he repurposed the hashtag to a mother.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.040]   I thought it was on the other side.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.040]   From like IRC, right?
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.040]   So it wasn't...
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.040]   He didn't invent it.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.840]   No, but he was the first to use it on Twitter and Twitter incorporated it.
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:33.840]   He was.
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:34.840]   Oh, okay.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.200]   I thought it was someone else.
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.200]   Did you love that?
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:40.960]   I remember when William's got so mad at me, I wrote something about Twitter and I said
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:44.120]   that all the best ideas had come from users.
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:47.760]   Like the ad symbol and the retweet and the...
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:48.760]   That's a good thing.
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:49.760]   And then things...
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:50.760]   And then things that are bad things?
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:52.800]   No, no, no, it's a great thing.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:59.280]   But I was saying that Twitter didn't actually come up with a lot of the great things about
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.120]   the service that it was users that came up with it.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.720]   And then Twitter just implemented them and he got it all mad.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:05.720]   Because he...
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:09.640]   Because it was like I was saying he wasn't smart enough to come up with good ideas about
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.640]   Twitter.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:12.640]   Insecure much, have Williams.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.640]   Jeez.
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:14.640]   Yeah, but I forgot the ads.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.520]   All right, let me do a break.
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:20.120]   That's why I'm gonna add a little ad C.
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:21.640]   Because I just...
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:23.720]   We haven't had ads in so long.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:26.240]   And then I forgot to do them.
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:27.240]   Sorry about that.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.240]   We'll be back smoking if you get it.
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:29.240]   Yeah, I know it.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:31.480]   Yeah, the chat room wants to go to the bathroom.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:35.080]   I brought to you by ExpressVPN.
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.360]   You can only go to the bathroom if you're already using ExpressVPN.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.120]   The rest of you sit in your seats.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.120]   You need to know this.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:43.240]   This is how you protect yourself online.
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:45.400]   Privacy and security.
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:50.080]   ExpressVPN, a virtual private network, encrypts your traffic from your computer to the ExpressVPN
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.080]   server.
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:52.880]   So your ISP can't spy on you.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:56.200]   The guy in the coffee shop in the hoodie can't spy on you.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.720]   People can't inject ads into your stream.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:22:59.720]   No man in the middle.
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:01.000]   It's a really good technology.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.840]   Long standing good technology.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.360]   But there is a caveat.
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.200]   Maybe you're just kicking the can down the road.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:10.120]   Maybe the guy in the coffee shop can't spy on you.
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:11.480]   Your ISP can't spy on you.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:15.120]   But you've got to trust where your traffic emerges on the internet.
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.640]   They have the same access that all those other people have.
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:21.440]   That's why it's so important you choose the right VPN provider.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:22.440]   Here's what you want.
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:23.440]   We've talked about this on security now.
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.600]   Steve Gibson said this.
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:29.080]   You want a VPN besides one that's obviously using the latest technology that's secure.
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.960]   It doesn't log your data.
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.120]   They're not keeping track of it.
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:38.320]   And honestly, that's how those cheap and free VPN providers make money.
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.320]   They log your data.
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.480]   They sell it to the ad companies.
[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.240]   ExpressVPN does not.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:46.560]   In fact, they are so committed to your privacy.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:49.080]   They developed a technology called Trusted Server.
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:54.560]   When you press the button, you can express VPN on the back, Windows, Android, iOS, Linux,
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.320]   wherever you are, there's a great big button on the app.
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:00.880]   You press the button, you're now going to a VPN server.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:02.520]   It spins up.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:05.440]   It spins up a new copy of the VPN server.
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:09.600]   You use it as soon as you log out, it spins it down.
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:13.640]   The whole time that server is running, they call it the Trusted Server technology, it cannot
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:14.920]   write to the disk.
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:16.120]   It cannot write to the disk.
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:22.560]   So even if somebody wanted to log your behavior on ExpressVPN, they couldn't.
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.040]   They couldn't.
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:26.080]   The other thing that's great about ExpressVPN, it's fast.
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.720]   So fast, you can use it.
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:28.880]   I know a lot of people do.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:29.880]   I've tried this.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:32.520]   It really works to log into another country.
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:37.560]   Let's say your Netflix customer in the US, you want to use Netflix in Japan.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.960]   You choose the ExpressVPN server in Japan.
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:42.960]   Now you can watch Japanese Netflix.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:43.960]   You're not stealing it.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:47.920]   You're a subscriber, but you can watch Japanese Netflix because there's no geographic restriction
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:48.920]   anymore.
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.720]   Fast enough, you can actually watch HD video.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:52.680]   I've tried it again and again.
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.520]   Many other VPNs are too slow to watch video, not ExpressVPN.
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:02.200]   So you can eliminate geographic restrictions, protect your privacy, protect your security,
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:04.720]   stream HD quality video.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:05.720]   And it's just so easy.
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.680]   If I run up the app, you click the button.
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:12.000]   If normally it'll pick the server nearest you, but if you want to be in another country,
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.880]   you want to watch Netflix in Canada, I'm not the only one who loves ExpressVPN.
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:21.040]   TechRadar, the Verge, seen at many other tech experts, great ExpressVPN.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.240]   Never one in the world.
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:25.960]   In every respect, this is a great service.
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:28.140]   30-day money back guarantee.
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:29.140]   Give it a try.
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.140]   We actually have a great deal for you.
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:31.140]   Go to expressvpn.com/twig.
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:35.720]   You'll get a three extra months free on a one-year package.
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:41.280]   expressvpn.com/twig to learn more.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:44.280]   Chrome OS is really easy to set up on there too.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.280]   It is great.
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:46.280]   I use ExpressVPN.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.720]   That's kind of neat that you can do that on a Chromebook.
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:49.720]   I love that.
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.720]   It's pretty slick.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:51.720]   It's really good.
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:52.720]   ExpressVPN.com/twig.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:26:05.760]   This is an example of why we're talking about ClearView AI, how they have been scraping
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:10.080]   faces from Facebook and everywhere else.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.080]   That all chestnuts.
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:14.880]   And offering Facebook technology to law enforcement.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:15.880]   And they said, "No, no, no, no.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:16.880]   We don't.
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.400]   We only give it to law enforcement.
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.200]   It's only legitimate law enforcement."
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:22.200]   No, no, no, no, no, no, it's secure.
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:23.200]   All right.
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:31.400]   "An intruder accessed its entire list of customers."
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:41.200]   And someone got access to, I mean, this is why you can say, "Oh, no, we're secure."
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:45.040]   The servers were not breached, but they did get on all the customers.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.160]   The number of user accounts those customers have set up.
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.600]   The number of searches the customers have connected.
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:55.160]   If I were law enforcement, I might be a little miffed.
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:27:01.080]   ClearView security is ClearView's top priority," said Tor Eclan, an attorney for the company.
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.560]   "Unfortunately, data breaches are part of life."
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.360]   "Oh, this is the new defense.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:06.360]   That's normal.
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:07.360]   Oh, this happens.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:08.360]   This just happens.
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.360]   This thing's happened."
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:10.360]   "You know, what can you do?"
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:11.360]   "Come on, Leo."
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.360]   "There's nothing you can do."
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.600]   "You're gonna get a deal with it."
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.600]   "That's nothing you can do."
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:17.600]   "This happened."
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.200]   "Maybe there's a good reason why you wouldn't want a company."
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:21.200]   "Nobody has followed."
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:26.440]   "To have six billion pictures of everybody in the United States."
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.600]   "Maybe there's a reason."
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:32.160]   "They also said they worked with a bunch of law enforcement that turned out they didn't,
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:37.280]   so they were in their marketing and then someone called them and were like, "Did you use this?"
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.280]   "No."
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.280]   "And who was it?
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:44.080]   It was a cashmere hill that they were, she was, it was a good piece on the daily."
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:49.920]   They interviewed her about her coverage of the New York Times of Clearview.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:53.520]   And among other things, apparently they have a flag.
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:56.440]   So she had a friend in law enforcement and she said, "Search, here's my image.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:57.440]   Search for it."
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.440]   And they couldn't find her.
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.440]   "Right."
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:05.560]   And eventually she talked to the founder and he said, "You know, what, oh, not only could
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:10.760]   it not find her, Clearview then contacted that law enforcement officer and killed his
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:14.120]   account for letting a reporter use it."
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:15.120]   And that's what I remember.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:16.120]   "Oh, well, you know what you are."
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:17.120]   "Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:18.120]   For searching for reporters."
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:19.120]   "Searching for reporters."
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:20.120]   "Yeah, right."
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:21.120]   "Oh, yeah, that's it."
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:24.560]   So he said that the founder said, "Ah, that was a bug."
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.280]   That was a bug.
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:27.280]   He couldn't find you.
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:29.260]   And so she gave him her picture and he found her.
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:30.260]   Lots of them.
[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:31.260]   A bug.
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:32.260]   It was a bug.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:34.840]   "Sam Song has admitted there was a data breach.
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:42.640]   A number of us got weird unsolicited texts with a number one on our phone, a mystery
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:43.640]   push."
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:44.640]   "What's the frequency, Kenneth?"
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:45.640]   "Isn't that weird?"
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:55.200]   "In this case, we kind of, we found out, in fact, Sam Song says, 'Oh, a small number
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:02.000]   of users could read other people's personal data, finding last week's, following last
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.720]   week's unexplained find my mobile notification.'"
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.720]   That's weird.
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:09.720]   "What is it about?
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.720]   Like a hundred fifty or so?"
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.720]   "Yeah.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:14.360]   It's a small number, but still."
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.600]   "Yeah, it's not good."
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.360]   So Sam Song said, "A technical error."
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:23.720]   "Yeah, this what happens in the 21st century.
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:24.720]   It's what happens.
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.080]   It's nothing you can do about it.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:29.080]   Nothing you could do."
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:32.080]   "We had a case of the Mondays, that's all."
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.080]   "I love that.
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:34.080]   That's my new defense.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.080]   Hey, it's the 21st century.
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:36.080]   Get over it.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.080]   What do you expect?"
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:38.080]   "Things happen.
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.080]   Things happen.
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:40.080]   Breaches happen."
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.080]   "It's digital now."
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:42.080]   "We're all digital.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.080]   It's an imperfect world."
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:44.080]   "Yeah.
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:45.080]   Things break."
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:47.080]   "All right, I have news.
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:49.080]   You see a little down-leo.
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:52.080]   So I have news that's going to brighten your day.
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:55.280]   Now what will brighten your day a lot more when you were still on the keto diet?"
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:56.280]   "Uh-oh.
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:57.280]   Oh boy.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.280]   Uh-oh."
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:29:59.320]   "You have to do with streuploughs?"
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:00.320]   "Dunk and do-offles?"
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.320]   "Oh.
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.320]   Even better?"
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.320]   "That's released.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:04.320]   Bag of bacon."
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:05.320]   "Yes, I saw that.
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:06.320]   What the-?"
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:08.320]   "Wait, what the-?"
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.360]   "The Dunkin' Bag of Bacon."
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.440]   "The Dunkin' Bag of Bacon.
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:15.560]   Eat half strips, which they point out to you as equivalent to four full strips."
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:16.560]   "Yes."
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:17.560]   "There were half of them."
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:18.560]   "It's in a bag?"
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:19.560]   "Yes."
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.560]   "It's in a little bag.
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:21.560]   There it is."
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:22.560]   "Oh, that doesn't look like good bacon."
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:23.560]   "Nackin' all."
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:25.340]   "No, because it wasn't just fried.
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:27.960]   You know it was fried about three months ago.
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:28.960]   It'll be fine."
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.960]   "What are those flakes?"
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:31.960]   "I'd take it."
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:32.960]   "It reveals his standards."
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:37.960]   "If it's bacon, what better you need to know?"
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:40.120]   "I'll bet why you're eating it.
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.960]   If you eat part of the bag as well, you wouldn't notice."
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:43.960]   "Nope."
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:44.960]   "Oh."
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:45.960]   "Oh."
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:46.960]   "Still good though, Danica."
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:47.960]   "Do you think that's-?"
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:50.560]   "Yeah, like Jimmy's is gonna be any better."
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:51.560]   "Do you think they could-?"
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:52.560]   "This should be for the whole bag."
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.560]   "To get the keto people in the door?"
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:55.560]   "Maybe."
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:56.960]   "Eight pieces of bacon."
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:57.960]   "Maybe."
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.960]   "Because they're not coming in for the donuts."
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:01.960]   "How do we get the keto people back?"
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.960]   "So that come in the donuts."
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:06.960]   "What about a donut?"
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.960]   "But it's made out of meat."
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:10.560]   "Who a meat donut?"
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:11.960]   "Now you're cooking with-"
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.960]   "Oh, that's pepper."
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:14.960]   "That's a lot of pepper."
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.960]   "Well, no, that's just for-"
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:18.960]   "There's something to flavor about you."
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.960]   "That's just for product photography."
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:22.960]   "Yeah, it's probably not- it's probably like copper."
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:24.960]   "Not even meat, it's probably not a carbon."
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:25.960]   "Yeah, whole thing."
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:27.960]   "You should do a hands-on photography, your great show of
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:29.960]   "effortography, you should do one on food style."
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:30.960]   "Do it."
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:31.960]   "And the things that they do-"
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:32.960]   "Oh, yeah."
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:33.960]   "Like it said in maple syrup, they use motor oil."
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.960]   "Yeah, motor oil, yeah, motor oil."
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:36.960]   "That would be a good one."
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.960]   "Yeah, 'cause actual food doesn't really look that tasty."
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:40.960]   "Hold up, that would look good."
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:41.960]   "It actually doesn't look very good."
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:42.960]   "I remember that as it takes-"
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:43.960]   "So when you see-"
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:44.960]   "So when you see-"
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:46.960]   "For on the go snacking ease."
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:47.960]   "Yes, of course."
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:50.960]   "You don't want to get your hands all shiny and greasy."
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:54.960]   "Swedled some more than it takes over."
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:59.960]   "Is there anything wrong with Mike Bloomberg?"
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:05.960]   "He's got a lot of money hiring people for $2,500 a month to post on Twitter."
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:09.960]   "And now apparently he's hired a comedian to write a material."
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:11.960]   "Somebody's having a birth-time career."
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:13.960]   "I hope you're a Gilbert God friend."
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.960]   "Oh man, yes."
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:18.960]   "Oh my God! I'm Mike Bloomberg!"
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:20.960]   "And I have proofed this message!"
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:25.960]   "And worse."
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:33.960]   "It's interesting that Twitter took down 70 accounts because it said it was basically coordinated inauthentic behavior."
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.960]   "I have so much coordinated on authentic behavior."
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:38.960]   "Facebook is 100% totally fine with it."
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:39.960]   "Yeah."
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:41.960]   "I've reached my free article limit."
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:42.960]   "Uh-oh."
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:43.960]   "Oh no."
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:47.960]   "You don't know, but with him hiring influencers, though."
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:54.960]   "I guess that's no different from them hiring somebody else just to do the marketing campaign."
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:57.960]   "But they just happened to hire the best of the best, if you will."
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:59.960]   "But you got to be transparent about it."
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:00.960]   "Yeah, just be upfront about it."
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:03.960]   "Especially if they're all tweeting exactly the same phrase, as you can see."
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:04.960]   "Right."
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:05.960]   "They are."
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:06.960]   "Yes."
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:11.960]   "There was one guy, I think it was an Instagram maybe, and he posted something positive about it."
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:17.960]   "But positive about Bloomberg, and then the very next message was, just ignore that.
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:18.960]   Folk for Bernie."
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:21.960]   "The check cleared."
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:31.960]   "Ads made by influencers on behalf of politicians," says Facebook, "will be allowed on the platform
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:33.960]   so long as they're labeled as ads."
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:34.960]   "But?"
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.960]   "But they don't go in the ad library."
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:37.960]   "Right."
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:38.960]   "You don't go in the ad."
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:41.960]   "Well, you can't review them as you can all the other election ads."
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:42.960]   "Right."
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:46.960]   "Apparently they have no policy on influencer marketing."
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.960]   "Of course they don't."
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:51.960]   "Oh, no, I'm sorry, the Federal Elections Commission has no policy."
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:53.960]   "It's even worse."
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:57.960]   "So, the FTC has rules about it."
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:59.960]   "You have to put, if I tweet..."
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:01.960]   "You're a free lipstick, you got to say something."
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:05.960]   "Yeah, or if I tweet something about ExpressVPN, I have to have a hashtag sponsor."
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:09.960]   "A hashtag ad or say our sponsor ExpressVPN," which I always do.
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:10.960]   "Yeah, I usually do."
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:12.960]   "Yeah, if you forget, okay."
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:13.960]   "But they have to see a little fun."
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:16.960]   "I'm almost perfect on time."
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:20.960]   "If there is an FTC fine for that and all that."
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:23.960]   "We instruct all of our people about that."
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:28.960]   "But the FEC, the Federal Elections Commission has no policy."
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:34.960]   "Influencer posts can be fact-checked on Facebook unless they contain the speech of a politician,
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:36.960]   in which case, of course, they can't."
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:37.960]   "They can't."
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:40.960]   Well, so this gets it further into today.
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:41.960]   "That's so clear."
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:44.960]   "Pama, this is kind of ridiculous.
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:45.960]   I will confess."
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:47.960]   "No, we'll be seeing this for a second."
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:54.960]   So, in the ads database, everybody is very frustrated that they don't give you the targeting criteria
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:55.960]   that were used.
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:56.960]   "That's what you'd really like, yeah."
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:57.960]   Exactly.
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:03.960]   So, then I heard a discussion that said, "Well, problem is, if Mr. Ant Pruitt comments,
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:14.960]   or interacts with a given ad, and I can see that, and then we know what targeting was used for that ad,
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:18.960]   then it identifies those criteria to Mr. Pruitt."
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:19.960]   Oh.
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:21.960]   And as a privacy problem.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:22.960]   Yes.
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:24.960]   Data, data, data.
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:32.960]   So, the other story today is that Obama is trying to get the networks to stop airing a Trump ad
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:41.960]   that is misleading, but the networks do not censor wrong, but on the other side.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:42.960]   Yeah, they're not allowed to.
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:43.960]   They're not allowed to.
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:44.960]   They're not allowed to.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:49.960]   So, you have the former president asking the networks to take something down, and it's going
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:51.960]   to be very interesting to see what happens.
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:56.960]   So, they do in some cases take them down, but it has to be really, really extreme.
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:03.960]   So, it would be interesting to see whether this is going to make them be extreme enough for them to do it.
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:04.960]   Right.
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:05.960]   The cable networks can take them down.
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:08.960]   They're not under the rules, but the broadcast networks.
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:14.960]   Then there's this Swiss court that says clicking a like button.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:15.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:19.960]   Could be a crime if it's to spread hateful or defamatory content.
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:20.960]   Oh.
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.960]   What do you think about that?
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:23.960]   It's scary.
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.960]   Is that going too far in the other direction?
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:27.960]   It seems to be.
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:29.960]   They're technically right.
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:32.960]   You distribute it by liking it.
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:35.960]   Do you kind of, you bump it up in the algorithm?
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:36.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:37.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:39.960]   Well, technically you don't do anything.
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:40.960]   Facebook does it, but.
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.960]   Oh, based on the signal.
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:43.960]   Got it.
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:47.960]   We've got to grapple with freedom of expression.
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:48.960]   It's challenging.
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:49.960]   And it affects.
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:55.960]   So today Toby Young was a very controversial media figure in the UK.
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:58.960]   He's conservative pro Brexit and all that.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:02.960]   He started something called the free speech union.
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:08.960]   And the Guardian had a rip roaring laugh at this, and I get why.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:17.960]   So you pay money and 49 pounds regular rate, 250 pounds of full rate.
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:25.160]   He says that they will, if somebody goes to your boss and says, Jeff, shouldn't have tweeted
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:26.840]   that as this happened.
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:30.040]   They will send letters to the boss saying, remember, Jeff has freedom of expression, and
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:32.240]   that matters.
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:36.600]   So it's a weird kind of service.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:43.400]   Seems like it's a so much gray area around a lot of this stuff to one way or another.
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:45.960]   It's all a great area.
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:52.480]   It's the complaints about the right wing saying that their speech is being violated.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.640]   You know, sometimes comes off as rather disingenuous.
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:57.920]   But on the other hand, we've got to get used to speech.
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:03.120]   I was at a conference in May, a great conference, the Camden Conference in Camden, Maine this
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:04.760]   weekend speaking.
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:10.960]   And one of the people on stage, someone at a major university in the United States said
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:15.360]   that the First Amendment is outmoded, which maybe wanted to just scream.
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:16.880]   What is, what are they proposing?
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:17.880]   It's a place.
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:21.280]   Well, there's just going to say, I see this in other academics these days.
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:23.120]   Do we have too much speech?
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:25.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:27.960]   Be careful what you wish for.
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:28.960]   You've got it.
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:38.280]   You know, and I'm going through my, you know, Lutheran, you know, there are people, so,
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:45.920]   so one thing I mentioned up there in the, in 15, I think, 15 something.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:54.320]   A printer had his right hand cut off because he had dared to print a criticism of the Queen's
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:55.320]   marriage.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:56.800]   Wow.
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:59.640]   His name unfortunately was Mr. Stubbe.
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:00.640]   That's terrible.
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:03.480]   I'm not going to laugh at that.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:04.480]   Remshout.
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:05.480]   That's terrible.
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:06.480]   That's true.
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:13.760]   So I have been for recently, if last say year saying, because I was a big proponent of PGP
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:18.720]   and encrypting email, but I think I've gotten, saw the light finally that after a number
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:24.200]   of exploits took advantage of poorly designed PGP implementations and so forth, that the
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:29.920]   whole notion of email just cannot be secure, that you should always think of email as potentially
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:32.280]   exposed.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:35.320]   And so what I've been telling people who asked me, in fact, I just didn't ask the tech
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:36.320]   guy about this.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.800]   I think I had a blackberry.
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:40.200]   I said, okay, now the blackberry is gone.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:41.560]   What else can I use for secure email?
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:46.680]   And I said, well, I don't know if it was ever that secure and email has its own problems.
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.240]   And I recommended Signal Messenger.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:55.800]   I said, if you really, the only easy way to have secure messaging is not email is metadata
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:56.800]   leaks.
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:58.360]   There's no forward secrecy.
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.400]   There's all sorts of problems with it.
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:03.720]   But signal, and there are others like it.
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:04.720]   Keybase, is that another one?
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:06.200]   Keybase is very good.
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:10.200]   Signal is open source uses perfect forward secrecy.
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:11.200]   It does everything right.
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:13.240]   Moxie, Mo, and Spike is very trustworthy.
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:18.400]   And actually it's kind of funny, Brian Acton, who was the founder of WhatsApp, sold it for
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:23.840]   $22 billion to Facebook and then left Facebook because he didn't like the commercialization
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:24.840]   they were kind of playing.
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:25.920]   And he put money into Signal.
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:28.000]   He put about half a billion into Signal.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000]   And they're in their hiring staff.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000]   He's on a different page from Facebook.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000]   They put stickers in.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000]   They're trying to make it more appealing to real.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.840]   I would say Signal is the best.
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:37.640]   I love Signal.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:39.520]   The only negative, and there's Edward Snowden.
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:40.840]   He loves it too, of course.
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:46.080]   The only, and as well as Bruce Schneier, another great security guru and Matthew Green, the
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:47.880]   cryptographer, John Hopkins.
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:52.680]   So that's a pretty good, and Laura Pinkis, who is of course then a biographer, I guess,
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:53.680]   or documentarian.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.680]   Portrus.
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:55.680]   Portrus, did I say?
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:57.960]   Yeah, portrait.
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:00.440]   The only bad thing about Signal is tight of your phone number.
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:04.000]   Now you could get an anonymous phone number, but I don't like it that it does it that way.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.840]   There are other choices perhaps to look at.
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:15.040]   That the EU has just told its staff, the EU Commission, switch to Signal.
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:19.080]   This is, Signal has been selected as the recommended application for public, instant
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:20.080]   messaging.
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:24.320]   I wish they would say for all messaging, including email.
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:26.640]   So that's very encouraging.
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:27.640]   I think it's very encouraging.
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:28.640]   I'm glad to see that.
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:33.440]   I don't recall Signal having a web interface to way key-based stuff.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:38.320]   You can use key-based on your mobile device, but you can also download and install it.
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:43.080]   Signal has a desktop app, but you still have to unfortunately tie it to your phone.
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:44.080]   To your phone, yeah.
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:47.200]   And you can only have five devices besides your phone.
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:48.960]   And I think that has to do with the security model.
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:50.200]   Security, yeah, that makes sense.
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:51.200]   But you can't.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:53.000]   I do have Signal on my desktop.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.640]   As you know, the ones I use most of the time, as well as on my phones, yeah.
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:02.640]   I've used key-based over the last six months or so I've been getting a ton of spam.
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:03.640]   Oh, really?
[01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:09.280]   They have a problem which they fixed because they were giving away their cryptocurrency,
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:11.760]   or cryptocurrency they're affiliated with called Lumens.
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:12.760]   Lumens.
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:16.600]   And a lot of people suddenly joined key-based trying to get Lumens.
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:19.640]   So I think they fixed that.
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:21.160]   It seems a lot better.
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:23.800]   Key-based is an interesting story because it's free.
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:25.320]   It's open source.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:31.800]   It has a lot of nice features in Cryptocap, but also team messaging, encrypted Git.
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:37.760]   It was originally conceived of as a way to store your crypto keys, either have them generate
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:42.160]   or for more security, generate them yourself and store them, which I do store your public
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:44.640]   key on key-based so it's a directory.
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:46.520]   And you could follow people if their key changes.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:47.520]   You'll get a notification.
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:48.680]   There's a lot of nice features.
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:50.400]   I really like key-based.
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:54.040]   But I think I am probably using Signal for, but I also use Key-based.
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:58.440]   And I have a number of people I chat with on that key-based.
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.400]   So yeah, I just have a small group in there just to--
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:06.560]   It's private, but yeah, it's about it.
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:11.120]   For a while I was thinking about making it our team, instead of Slack, our team messaging
[01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:12.120]   is free.
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:13.120]   It's free.
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:15.040]   Yeah, locked down.
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:16.800]   Yeah, it's really well designed.
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:19.680]   I'm trying to remember the guys who founded it.
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:25.280]   We were going to do an interview on triangulation and right before we cancel it.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:31.640]   But the guys who founded it made a lot of money with the startup, I can't remember the name.
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:34.720]   And so now I think they're just paying back.
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:35.720]   They're paying forward.
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:40.520]   As far as I can tell, they may have a long-term monetization strategy, but there's currently
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:44.680]   no way to give money.
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:48.040]   So anyway, I think this is-- it's pretty clearly.
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:50.680]   This is a better choice.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:52.240]   And not TikTok.
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:53.240]   I'm--
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:54.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:55.240 --> 01:44:02.360]   TSA has banned employees from using TikTok for their social media posts.
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:09.120]   Chuck Schumer actually wrote a letter to the TSA administrator saying, "Stop using TikTok.
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:13.240]   They've been using it to create and post videos explaining boarding processes and rules.
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:16.960]   Why not use TikTok to help people understand--
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:17.960]   To keep people safe.
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:19.120]   Yeah, for information.
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:20.360]   There are people there, yeah.
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:21.360]   A lot of people.
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:26.640]   Don't do it on the head of the TSA's phone.
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:27.640]   All right.
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:34.040]   But then again, social media matters because we have the head of the coronavirus efforts
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:35.560]   going to Twitter to ask for help.
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.560]   As he should.
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:38.560]   As he should.
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:41.440]   What do you know?
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:47.960]   The TSA has never itself published content to TikTok or sent people to TikTok.
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:54.400]   It's just individual employees on their personal devices for their social media outreach.
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:59.840]   The Homeland Security, which houses the TSA, banned the use of TikTok from government-issued
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:02.040]   devices last month.
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:05.000]   In December, the US Army banned soldiers from using the device.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000]   All this because the parent company, ByteDance, is in China.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.000]   China.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000]   China.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.960]   Although, they're making attempts to move their servers out of China.
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:19.440]   They're looking to hire an American CEO based in Washington, D.C.
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:21.440]   They're not--
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:24.440]   Are they though?
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:30.720]   If you've got a company, even if you're in China and you want to make money, it's not
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:32.520]   helpful to be seen as a spy company.
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:34.520]   I feel like both Huawei and TikTok.
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:37.880]   Wow, you seem to be doing just fine though.
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:40.360]   Well, you also do what the government tells you to do.
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:41.360]   That's the problem.
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.360]   So if you can, move out.
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:44.360]   But you know, I--
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:45.360]   But you can't.
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:48.000]   And as an American, you probably shouldn't trust it.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.640]   But what are you putting on TikTok?
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:52.040]   I don't know.
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:53.640]   I just lurk on there.
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:55.360]   I have nothing to share.
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:02.280]   Yeah, it's hard for me to imagine that I have much of value to the Chinese government.
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:04.200]   Google Translate-- oh, let's do the change log.
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:08.160]   Play the thing, the drums, the trumpets.
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:10.160]   The Google Translate.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:11.720]   The River Otter.
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:16.520]   The River Otter saxophone.
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:22.760]   Google Translate now supports-- get ready for this-- five more languages.
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:24.760]   Actually, pretty big number of people.
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:25.760]   That's cool.
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:27.600]   75 million people.
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:32.520]   So I can't even pronounce these languages.
[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:37.560]   Kenya-- Kenya-Awanda, Odia, Tartar, Turkaman, and Uyghur.
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:39.920]   75 million people.
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:42.760]   108 languages in total.
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:44.480]   That's pretty cool.
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:51.160]   And if you're going to the steps, it's nice to be able to speak a little tartar.
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:52.560]   Or is it Tartar?
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:53.560]   No idea.
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:54.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:55.560]   That's be saucy.
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.560]   No idea.
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:02.560]   Quick share button in Google's Chrome's toolbar.
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:04.560]   What do you think?
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:05.560]   Quickly share.
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:12.360]   Oh, so you-- because some sites, believe it or not, don't have a share button on it.
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:13.360]   So this would be on everything now.
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:14.360]   I like that.
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:16.360]   Yeah, so you see how it's on the browser.
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:17.360]   This is in mobile, I guess.
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:18.360]   So you can only--
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:19.360]   I'll take Google+,.
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:20.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:22.360]   No.
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:26.720]   You can turn it on if you want going to Chrome colon slash slash flags.
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:27.720]   Flags.
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:30.480]   Search for share button in the top toolbar.
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:31.480]   Enable it.
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:32.480]   Restart the browser.
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:34.240]   And you can do it yourself.
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:39.240]   This is in Chrome Canary in Android, on Android.
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:40.480]   I like that idea.
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:44.440]   You know, this is one of the advantages where Apple, Apple has it.
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:45.720]   Well, actually, no.
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:47.680]   Android has a share sheet, just like Apple.
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:48.680]   Yeah.
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:49.680]   OK, so you can take it back.
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:50.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:51.680]   Yeah.
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:54.120]   In fact, the nice thing about Android share sheet, unlike Apple's, is any developer can
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:55.560]   put their app on it.
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:56.560]   Yeah.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:57.560]   Yeah, I like that.
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:02.160]   That's actually one of the things that when I switched to Android from Apple, that's one
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:04.200]   of the things I liked the best about it was when I switched to Apple.
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:09.080]   And I wanted to share things Apple gave you this incredibly restricted group of things
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:11.680]   you could, and most of them were apples, of course.
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:12.680]   So unknown.
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:14.440]   It seems a little random, like this happened.
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:15.440]   Not that happened.
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:16.440]   Yeah.
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:18.440]   Yeah.
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:25.520]   Google Stadia has four new games from Steam World.
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:26.520]   Do you know what this is?
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:27.520]   Carsten, our US team.
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:29.640]   It seems like this is something you would like.
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:32.960]   Steam World Dig, Steam World Dig 2, Steam World Heist.
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:36.400]   And Steam World Quest the Hand of Gilgamesh.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:37.400]   I'm sorry, Gilgamesh.
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:39.120]   I do not know these games.
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:40.120]   They do look interesting.
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:41.120]   Yeah.
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:42.120]   This seems like your kind of thing.
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:43.560]   Interesting or fun?
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:44.560]   Both.
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:45.560]   Okay.
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:46.560]   They are a style of gaming.
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:47.800]   Does Carsten really have fun?
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:48.800]   No.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:50.800]   Carsten has lots of fun.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:51.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:54.520]   He thinks tying a bow tie is fun.
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:57.080]   Let's put it in perspective.
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:58.080]   These are...
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:48:59.080]   The top.
[01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:01.440]   He has fun at the expense.
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:05.120]   These are games in a style called Metroidvania.
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:06.600]   Yes.
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:09.760]   Which means they're kind of like Metroid and kind of like Castlevania.
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:10.760]   Right.
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:11.760]   8-bit.
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:12.760]   16-bit.
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:13.760]   16-bit.
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:15.760]   Lots of side-scrolling...
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:16.760]   Side-scrollers.
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:18.760]   Alright.
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:19.760]   Puzzles.
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:21.000]   Whips and chains and knives.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000]   Labyrinths design.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000]   Yes.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000]   Labyrinths.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.160]   I like this kind of thing.
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:26.960]   I have no idea what you all just said.
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:27.960]   Well, these are just games.
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:30.880]   You sit in there in front of this high-end gaming laptop.
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:32.480]   This is not a game in that time.
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:33.480]   Okay.
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:34.480]   This is not a game in that time.
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:35.960]   It's kind of like a platformer with weapons.
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:37.680]   A platformer with weapons.
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:38.680]   Okay.
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:39.680]   Ooh.
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:43.240]   Google details its I/O 2020 sustainability goals.
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:44.240]   I think this is so good.
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:45.760]   We've actually been looking at doing this too.
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:50.480]   They're going to buy carbon offsets for all the attendees' air travel.
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:51.480]   Oh, no.
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:52.480]   It was at cost for a...
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:53.480]   It's like 1%.
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:54.480]   It's like 1%.
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:55.480]   It's 1%.
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:57.760]   I get mine from the good traveler.
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:59.840]   Let me go there right now so I could show you.
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:02.240]   In fact, we could figure it out.
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:03.880]   Thegoodtraveler.org.
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:09.320]   Let's do a coast to coast flight.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.600]   Let's say you're going to do domestic.
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:15.040]   You're going to go from JFK to SFO.
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:16.520]   And there we go.
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:17.520]   San Francisco.
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:20.160]   I guess I have to do the JFK.
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:21.160]   Click this.
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:23.400]   And I'm going to calculate the offsets.
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:27.520]   Your trip was 5,248 miles around trip by six offsets.
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:28.920]   Oh, two bucks?
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:29.920]   Two dollars.
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:30.920]   That's awesome.
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:31.920]   Wow.
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:32.920]   Actually, wait a minute.
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:33.920]   Oh, round it up.
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:34.920]   Make it 10.
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:36.920]   Offsets the carbon release in 1,000 miles.
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.080]   So you need to buy six of them.
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:39.080]   So $12.
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:40.880]   Oh, oh, I see.
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:41.880]   $12.
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:42.880]   But still...
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:43.880]   Still.
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:44.880]   I think...
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:45.880]   You know, that's...
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:46.880]   So I've been doing that.
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:47.880]   And I just love it.
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:51.880]   It seems like you spent like $20 or so for your last vacation, right?
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:53.560]   Yeah, it was cheap.
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.040]   And it makes you feel good.
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:56.360]   You got to pick carefully.
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:58.680]   I picked this one.
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:05.560]   It's from the Rocky Mountain Institute because the Yale School of Forestry...
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:08.280]   I read that that's what the students there used.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:09.640]   So I figured they did the research.
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:11.080]   Oh, I have to.
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:15.720]   And then there's another one which we're looking at for our company.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:20.440]   So Google's doing some of this, too, where you can...
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:25.280]   For a business, you can just buy offsets, which can be carbon offsets, renewable energy
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:29.800]   credits, water restoration certificates for your business.
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:30.800]   And so we're looking...
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:32.680]   Lisa and I are looking at the cost of that.
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:34.160]   It's not too expensive.
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:35.160]   And you know what?
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:37.440]   It's probably one of those things that makes you feel good.
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:39.920]   It's kind of like that social activist...
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:42.800]   You may be helping out somewhere.
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:45.080]   Better than nothing, you know.
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:48.680]   So Google's going to be doing this.
[01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:49.680]   They're going to do...
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:53.240]   They want to do zero waste, net zero emissions model.
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:54.480]   Not a perfect process.
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:56.880]   They say carbon offsetting helps for every mile flown.
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:01.960]   We help fund high quality offset projects that reduce emissions like methane reclamation
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:02.960]   at landfills.
[01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:07.680]   That's where the money goes by the way, to plant trees, carbon sequestration, you know,
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:10.680]   the kinds of things that would reverse the amount of carbon you...
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:12.800]   Into the air.
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:13.800]   So that's good.
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:16.600]   It's an effort.
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:17.600]   Yep.
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:25.480]   So the venue at Shoreline has a big parking lot, but they're going to...
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:26.480]   It's a no parking event.
[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:27.480]   It didn't last year, too.
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:31.920]   Yeah, we'll have to arrive via shuttles or public transit.
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:32.920]   This is...
[01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:34.920]   Because if you press, of course, we get a whole...
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:35.920]   Yeah, we get a special lot.
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:36.920]   So that's fun.
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:38.720]   I'll be driving my Hummer.
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:40.680]   [laughter]
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:43.920]   By carbon offsets for my Hummer.
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:45.480]   They're making electric trucks.
[01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:46.480]   I know.
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:47.480]   I like that idea.
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:51.360]   So let's not forget it's still a massive waste of sources for the energy.
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:52.360]   The energy.
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:53.360]   The energy.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:54.360]   Yeah, other stuff.
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:55.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:59.400]   Local materials to create the tents for Google I/O with low invested energy, fewer virgin
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:02.160]   materials, more clean grid power.
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:04.160]   That is a good thing.
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:05.640]   I like seeing companies do this.
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:09.480]   I know it's not perfect, but at least they're doing something, right?
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:10.480]   Yep.
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:12.480]   More sustainable I/O.
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:15.880]   Okay, Google.
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:19.480]   Charge my car.
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:21.840]   Somewhere a Tesla's have been problems like that.
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:28.920]   Assistant is adding native control for chargers and batteries for your iRobot for a lot of...
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:34.400]   Anything that uses a battery.
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:37.600]   I don't know what it means, but I'm just saying it.
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:41.480]   The actions associated include starting or stopping a charge, asking about the current
[01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:46.920]   capacity and checking how much time is left until something is fully charged.
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:48.120]   So that would be very handy.
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:49.120]   I don't know.
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:50.120]   No.
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:54.400]   Maybe this is because I don't have an EV and not well versed on these matters, but why
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:54:00.280]   do I need Google Assistant to tell me to charge my car and I'm plugging a daggum thing into
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:02.560]   the car and with myself?
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:03.560]   You don't.
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:04.560]   Okay.
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:05.560]   All right.
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:06.560]   You do that to impress other people.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:09.640]   So you go and they're living around and you say, "Okay, Google, charge my car."
[01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:12.240]   And then they know that you have an electric car.
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:18.280]   And I would hope someone would look at me, "Dude, you were just out there."
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:20.600]   Some chargers allow you to defer charge.
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:23.080]   A lot of... most chargers like to defer charging.
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:28.440]   So it doesn't mean that it's going to charge when you plug it in, unlike your computer,
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:31.760]   because you might want to charge it when rates are lower in the end of the night.
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:34.320]   So a lot of cars are set to defer charging.
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:36.720]   So you might be sitting in the living room thinking, "Oh, crud.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:39.960]   I forgot I have to go down to Sunnyville tomorrow."
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:41.640]   Okay, Google charged my car now.
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:42.640]   See?
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:45.720]   Well, this is why I asked because I don't own an EV and I have some ignorance.
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:50.080]   It's also valuable to know what the level of charging is before you go out to the garage
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:52.080]   and it makes it fully charged, things like that.
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:54.120]   You know, it's not a huge...
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:56.080]   Like most of the things Assistant does.
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:57.080]   Right.
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:58.080]   Is it sunny out?
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:54:59.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:00.080]   Oh, the daggum window.
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:01.080]   You can see.
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:02.080]   You can see.
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:03.080]   You can see.
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:04.080]   Google Contacts.
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:05.640]   I don't understand this.
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:10.840]   Google Contacts can now find people you haven't saved to your account.
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:13.800]   Oh, so Contacts can go through...
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:16.160]   It'll just go through your email.
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:17.160]   Your email.
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:18.160]   Right.
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:20.160]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:22.560]   Well, they're already in there.
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:23.560]   Yeah, you might as well.
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:24.920]   I don't know if it has to be Gmail.
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:30.200]   This is not yet available, but it'll be a new update soon, apparently.
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:32.200]   So that's good.
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:33.200]   Okay.
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:36.520]   That was some Contacts app on Android.
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:44.640]   Oh, so there is apparently, if you use Google Contacts on the web at Contacts.google.com/other,
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:48.800]   a list of people that you have received email from on Gmail.
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:50.120]   I didn't know that.
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:51.920]   But you don't see that normally on Android.
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:55.520]   So the next time you get an Android Contacts update, it will see that.
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:56.520]   It's pretty cool.
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:57.520]   Yeah.
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:55:58.520]   Yeah.
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:55:59.520]   Handy.
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:00.520]   I didn't even know it was...
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:01.520]   I never...
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:02.520]   I'm really bad at putting Contacts in.
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:07.960]   I always have thought of mail in general as being a database of Contacts, agreements,
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:09.040]   documents, all that stuff.
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:10.920]   I hate to delete mail.
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:15.320]   But I don't use Gmail anymore, so this isn't much good to me.
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:20.720]   I love being able to tag people, and this seems like it'd be good for the PR standpoint.
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:22.720]   The PR connects.
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:23.720]   Yep.
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:24.720]   So I don't want them necessarily.
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:25.720]   No, you don't want to add...
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:31.400]   I made the mistake over the years of adding PR people back when I was foolish and young.
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:34.080]   Now I have such a giant contact list.
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:35.640]   Got to tell you.
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:39.880]   And there's nothing older than the contact information from a PR person that's 10 years
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:40.880]   ago, right?
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:42.320]   They haven't been there in years.
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:43.320]   Yeah.
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:44.320]   So...
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:45.320]   But it's fun sometimes.
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:46.520]   It goes through my list and see people I...
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:50.160]   I periodically look at my Google contacts and then I give up.
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:51.160]   It's like...
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:52.160]   It's too big.
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:54.720]   You go to your garage and you think, "I should organize some of this."
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:56.560]   But it's just, yeah, it would take weeks.
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:57.560]   And the good news is it doesn't...
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:56:58.560]   It's just there.
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:56:59.560]   It doesn't take any space.
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:03.160]   It's not like you look for contacts by going through your contact list.
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:04.160]   You just type it in or...
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:07.720]   Yeah, I'll let you fall and I'm looking for signs to pull up.
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:11.160]   Google now makes the Titan security keys available across Europe.
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:12.520]   I didn't know they hadn't.
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:17.680]   I am now using Google Advanced Protection because I just feel like there is some disadvantages.
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:22.600]   But I just feel like I don't want to risk losing my phone or with a key or what.
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:23.600]   I use...
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:24.600]   You have to have...
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:25.600]   Yeah, I use a Yubik key.
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:30.360]   You have to have two keys just for backup in case you lose one.
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:32.040]   They recommend one be a Bluetooth.
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:33.040]   I don't do that.
[01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:37.080]   In fact, I just got the new Yubik keys that have both a Type C and a Lightning connector
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:38.080]   one on each end.
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:40.120]   Can't you use your phone now?
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:41.120]   Yeah.
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:42.120]   So the phone...
[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:47.000]   Yeah, that's another thing where the phone will pop up a pop up saying, "Is that you?"
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000]   And you can do that with the iPhone now as well.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.160]   But I also think it's handy to have a physical dongle.
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:52.160]   You'd have to...
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:53.160]   You'd have to...
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:54.160]   There it is.
[01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:56.640]   That's the tech guy about Yubik key.
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:00.920]   You'd have to tear these keys out of my pry, the amount of my cold.
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:03.760]   Go ahead and just try to take my keys.
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:06.160]   I don't want to break your fingers, sir.
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:07.160]   I like you.
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:08.320]   And you could.
[01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:09.320]   You could.
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:14.400]   I don't know what makes people think that's so secure.
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:18.800]   Soto speakers can now be your default playback option for Google Assistant.
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:20.200]   That's good.
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:26.280]   Google Image Search now tells you a little bit more about the results you get, including
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:30.880]   weather, clicking on it's going to send you to a e-commerce site.
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:31.880]   Hm.
[01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:34.480]   Logos or little icons.
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:35.480]   I mean...
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:37.480]   I think that's a...
[01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:38.480]   Yeah, see the little...
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:39.480]   There's a little tag.
[01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:40.480]   That's a good idea.
[01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:41.480]   I like that.
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:46.200]   Later this week, Google Images will show new icons and desktop that provide useful information
[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:50.560]   to indicate if the images lead to products, pages with products for sale, recipes...
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:51.560]   That's useful.
[01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:52.560]   Yeah.
[01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:57.120]   The recipes has a little fork and knife or video content has a little play button.
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:04.040]   Mousing over the icons expands them to show the icons with text or the length of the video.
[01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:05.040]   That's nice.
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:08.160]   That's a good use.
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:11.120]   That makes search even more useful.
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:16.400]   The next one is one may not be new, but I didn't know about it.
[01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:17.920]   I put it in here.
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:19.760]   The old days of the anchor tag.
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:26.160]   If you could link directly to right in the middle of the story, now you can put in a text
[01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:31.160]   snippet and it will link directly to that text in the page.
[01:59:31.160 --> 01:59:32.160]   Oh!
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:34.360]   Now to be doing that, you have to be doing HTML.
[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:37.360]   No, well, just when you put that in the...
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:42.100]   Oh, you can do it in Markdown or Wiki or B.B.
[01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:46.200]   Edit whatever it is that your B.B. code, whatever you're using, I guess.
[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:56.400]   If the link has... so you use... you do pound colon tilde colon text equals...
[01:59:56.400 --> 01:59:57.400]   Wow.
[01:59:57.400 --> 01:59:58.880]   And then the snippet.
[01:59:58.880 --> 02:00:00.960]   That's so easy to remember.
[02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:01.960]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:02.960]   Sure.
[02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:06.080]   I'll be doing that all the time.
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:10.080]   How many people know what a tilde is?
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:12.560]   It's that thing above the tick.
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:13.560]   Right.
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:18.000]   Under the escape over the river and through the woods.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:22.280]   I thought that was Heidi's dog in that...
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:23.280]   Tilda.
[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:24.280]   Swedish movie.
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:25.280]   Yeah.
[02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:26.280]   Tilda.
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:27.280]   Hey, tilde.
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:28.280]   Gmail is...
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:29.280]   I just...
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:30.280]   I don't know.
[02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:35.280]   Maybe I'm confusing this, but I thought the anchor was just, you know, a bracket...
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:36.680]   It's a hashtag.
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:37.680]   You have to...
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:40.280]   A ref and then a hashtag.
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:41.280]   A ref.
[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:42.280]   That's it.
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:43.280]   That's what I was thinking about.
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:47.880]   And so this article is showing it using a wiki text.
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:48.880]   Yeah.
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:49.880]   So...
[02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:50.880]   You know what a tilde is.
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:51.880]   Yeah.
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:52.880]   He's just...
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:53.880]   He's just...
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:54.880]   Everybody's typing a tilde's.
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:55.880]   Okay.
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:56.880]   Okay.
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:59.760]   So what you get is wiki p dot org slash wiki slash cat.
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:02.360]   That loads the cat page.
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:10.520]   But then if you do hash colon tilde colon text equals and then some text, it will highlight
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:12.080]   text and go right to it.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:13.680]   Is that only in Chrome?
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:14.680]   I guess so.
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:16.320]   Is it a W3C?
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:17.880]   Is it a...
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:18.880]   So let's try it.
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:21.120]   Well, I can't because it's not...
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:22.120]   That's not...
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.120]   Let's try it.
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:24.120]   Yeah.
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:25.920]   See, it's not...
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:27.400]   They didn't do it right in there.
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:28.400]   Oop.
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:29.400]   Demo.
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:33.280]   The Chrome status dot com.
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:35.640]   Chrome platform status, huh?
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:36.640]   WIC.
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:38.880]   Well, the next link is down there.
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:39.880]   Wait, wait, wait.
[02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:40.880]   Oh, let's try another link.
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:41.880]   No, we're right there.
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:42.880]   Yeah, that's the one.
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:43.880]   Well, that's...
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:44.880]   But that's the old anchor.
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:45.880]   That's the old anchor tag.
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:46.880]   No, is it?
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:48.400]   Yeah, because it pulls it to this.
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:49.400]   This is a census.
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:50.400]   Well, maybe it's not a...
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:51.400]   Yeah.
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:52.400]   If that looks like the anchor...
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:53.400]   Wait a second.
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:56.400]   You know what I should do is just...
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:57.400]   You look at the source.
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:01:59.400]   Let me load this 12.
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:00.400]   No, that's...
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:03.000]   It's not the anchor tag.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.160]   It's not.
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:06.800]   So it's doing a text search of the page.
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:07.800]   Right.
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:08.800]   Yeah, this...
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:10.800]   Of course, I'm not using Chrome, so...
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:13.040]   Look at the kitty cats, though.
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:19.760]   I didn't know you could go to the internet and find kitty cat pictures.
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:22.040]   Google is getting better at finding...
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:23.040]   What?
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:25.520]   No, don't think...
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:26.520]   No.
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:27.520]   No.
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:28.520]   No.
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:29.520]   No.
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:30.520]   No.
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:33.240]   Gmail is catching more malicious attachments than ever before.
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:37.400]   I don't know how widely known this is, but this is a very good thing to know.
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:43.560]   If you are fortunate, as we are here at Twitter, to have a good IT department and lots of security,
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:47.120]   all of our email goes through a variety of services that take...
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:50.520]   That look for malicious attachments that chiefly ran somewhere.
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:52.640]   That's a big threat to any enterprise.
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:55.360]   And make sure that those attachments don't get through.
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:03:01.560]   So I don't have to worry so much about employees clicking attachments because it does a pretty
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:02.560]   good job.
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:04.960]   But the other thing we do is we use G Suite.
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:06.400]   That means all our mail goes through Gmail.
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:11.280]   And Gmail actually does a fantastic job of blocking malicious attachments.
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:13.400]   Hix spam even.
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:18.040]   It does a good job with spam, but it also blocks malware.
[02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:22.680]   Users of Gmail get 300 billion attachments every week.
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:25.320]   And they are now using AI.
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:28.800]   I suspect they've always used a little bit of AI in their spam and filtering.
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:32.080]   But this was at RSA on Tuesday.
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:37.680]   Ali Burstein is presenting findings about how the new deep learning scanner for documents
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:42.680]   is faring against the 300 billion attachments that it has to process each week.
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:47.120]   63% of the malicious documents it blocks each day are different than the ones it's
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:48.960]   system flagged the day before.
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:49.960]   That's nuts.
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:52.440]   It's not a system like a spam system.
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:54.240]   It's a moving target.
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:55.240]   It's huge.
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:58.360]   And spam, you saw a spam yesterday, you blocked it today.
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:00.400]   You've got to know it's malicious now.
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:01.400]   Man.
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:05.480]   Apparently, deep learning is very good at this.
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:12.040]   56% of malware threats against Gmail users come from Microsoft Office documents, only
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:14.000]   2% from PDFs.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.560]   I thought it would have been the other way around, actually.
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:22.800]   I think it has something to do with the fact that if you get a Microsoft Office document
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:26.400]   from someone purporting to be your boss, you're more likely to open it.
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:27.400]   Okay.
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:28.400]   Yeah.
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:29.400]   Oh, that's safe.
[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:30.400]   There's the wrong there.
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:32.560]   You know, and here's that spreadsheet.
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:34.000]   I really want you to update this.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.400]   You're going to update it.
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:37.480]   You can't update the PDF more likely.
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:38.480]   Yeah.
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:44.280]   Scanner has increased its daily malicious Office document detection by 10%.
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:48.200]   I mean, you'd like to be 100%, but it's not that easy.
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:51.880]   Scanner is particularly good at Microsoft Excel documents.
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:56.920]   And that's hard to do because apparently, according to wired Excel documents are complicated,
[02:04:56.920 --> 02:05:00.080]   difficult to assess.
[02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:06.760]   So, you know, even if you can't afford fancy, you know, filtering at your place of work,
[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:10.720]   just using Gmail for your working for you is trying to work for you.
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:12.360]   I feel pretty good.
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:14.520]   Now this one, I am in a knock on wood.
[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:16.360]   We have, we have not the virus.
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:20.720]   This one, we have, yeah, you know, coronavirus doesn't scare me as nearly as much as I am
[02:05:20.720 --> 02:05:21.720]   somewhere.
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:23.000]   That scares me, man.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:24.000]   That's good.
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.280]   Well, it should.
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:26.640]   We could be brought to our knees.
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:27.800]   This is true.
[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:32.400]   I ask every time I see Russell, our IT guy, I say, we're safe, right?
[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:33.600]   He said, yeah, we're safe.
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:35.640]   He says, should we train people?
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:36.640]   We're safe.
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:37.640]   We're safe.
[02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:38.640]   Is it safe?
[02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:39.640]   It's safe.
[02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:40.640]   It's safe.
[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:42.640]   What's the frequency, Kenneth?
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:45.240]   Did we have the running man?
[02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:46.240]   No.
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:47.240]   Yeah.
[02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:48.240]   Yeah.
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:49.240]   The marathon man.
[02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:50.240]   Is it safe?
[02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:51.240]   Yeah.
[02:05:51.240 --> 02:05:52.240]   Lawrence Olivier with the dental drill.
[02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:53.240]   Yeah.
[02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:54.240]   Is it safe?
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:55.240]   I don't know what you're talking about, man.
[02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:56.240]   No drill on me, man.
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:57.240]   Is it safe?
[02:05:57.240 --> 02:06:00.400]   That's my little.
[02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:02.600]   I don't think that's going to get pulled down on YouTube.
[02:06:02.600 --> 02:06:04.600]   I'm just guessing.
[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:05.600]   Yep.
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:12.000]   That's from now on, everything we do is going to be a dramatization of the original so that
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.000]   we won't-
[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.360]   I think I invented that, Michelle.
[02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:15.920]   You did.
[02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:16.920]   You did.
[02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:17.920]   That is my specialty.
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:18.920]   Wait a minute.
[02:06:18.920 --> 02:06:19.920]   That's, what's his name?
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:20.920]   That's Gandalf.
[02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:21.920]   Yeah.
[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:22.920]   Why is he in this?
[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:23.920]   I don't think that's where his safe comes from.
[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:25.720]   He's talking about the marathon, man.
[02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:26.720]   No.
[02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:28.800]   And then he's talking about the Olivia, the dentist.
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:34.840]   I remember a story, Dustin Hoffman, for that movie ran around the block and didn't sleep
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:37.440]   for a couple of days because he was tired and sweaty.
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:38.920]   Yeah, I worked.
[02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:42.720]   And Lawrence Olivier said, "You should try it at something.
[02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:44.440]   It's called acting."
[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:51.120]   Lawrence Olivier was not a method actor.
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:54.160]   He actually was crippled.
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:58.400]   I didn't know this, but I read it in his biography by paralyzing stage fright.
[02:06:58.400 --> 02:06:59.400]   Wow.
[02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:00.400]   Yeah.
[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:01.400]   Who would have thought?
[02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:02.400]   One of the greatest actors of our time.
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:03.400]   Wow.
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:06.800]   He also, he's not a method actor, but he said, "putting on the costume and putting on the
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:11.640]   makeup or the beard or whatever the character was always the way that he, so he was not
[02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:13.520]   a method actor, but he did do that.
[02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:15.600]   He got into character, definitely.
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:17.720]   He knew how to do that.
[02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:20.480]   He's got a war paint.
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:21.480]   The war paint.
[02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:22.480]   We'll do it.
[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:24.120]   And that, my friends, is the guru.
[02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:30.440]   Google change log.
[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:35.160]   Our show today brought to you by HealthIQ.
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:39.640]   This is a life insurance agency that was tailored for people like Ant.
[02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:40.640]   Maybe people like you.
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:41.640]   Are you healthy?
[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:43.120]   You can make sure you get enough sleep every night.
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:44.520]   You exercise every day.
[02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:45.520]   You eat right.
[02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:49.200]   You understand what it takes to live healthier.
[02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:50.200]   Good news.
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:51.200]   You're probably going to live longer.
[02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:55.320]   The point of view of a health insurance company, that's gold, you should be paying less.
[02:07:55.320 --> 02:07:58.160]   The problem is health insurance companies are not that smart.
[02:07:58.160 --> 02:07:59.160]   They use numbers.
[02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:00.920]   They use things like the Body Mass Index.
[02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:02.960]   It's a very brute force system.
[02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:07.360]   What you really need is a life insurance agency that goes to bat for you.
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:10.600]   It does, basically, it becomes a concierge.
[02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:12.760]   That's what HealthIQ specializes in.
[02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:17.840]   They specialize in the health conscious folks, the people who have been overpaying and subsidizing
[02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:20.180]   the less healthy people.
[02:08:20.180 --> 02:08:21.600]   That's how life insurance works.
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:23.080]   There's no judgment on that.
[02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:28.840]   HealthIQ uses science and data to secure lower life insurance rates for people like you.
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:33.840]   I mean lower, as much as 41 percent lower.
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:38.440]   As an example, a million dollar policy for just $36 a month.
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:42.740]   If you're a runner, if you're a cyclist, if you're in a crossfit, if you lift like Ant
[02:08:42.740 --> 02:08:48.520]   does, maybe you're vegetarian or a vegan, you shouldn't be paying as much for life insurance.
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:50.000]   It's just simple.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:53.780]   HealthIQ is concierge service, white glove service.
[02:08:53.780 --> 02:08:56.660]   They walk you through the entire process of applying.
[02:08:56.660 --> 02:08:59.940]   They're working with the top 30 insurance companies in the United States.
[02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:05.420]   These are good policies from good, the best insurance companies, but they've negotiated
[02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:06.420]   rates.
[02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:08.180]   These are rates you can't get from anywhere else.
[02:09:08.180 --> 02:09:12.740]   You have to get through HealthIQ because these companies know HealthIQ is going to
[02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:16.340]   vet you and make sure that you're healthy before they even bring you to the insurance
[02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:17.340]   company.
[02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:18.340]   It all starts with the HealthIQ quiz.
[02:09:18.340 --> 02:09:19.340]   You can do that right now.
[02:09:19.340 --> 02:09:22.240]   Go to healthIQ.com/twig.
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:25.760]   HealthIQ.com/twig.
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:27.560]   It's actually pretty quick to take the quiz.
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:28.840]   By the way, it's not a self-assessment.
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:30.320]   They're not asking about you.
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:31.760]   They're actually testing your knowledge.
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:35.000]   Do you understand what is a healthy lifestyle?
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:39.400]   They put this together with the nation's leading medical health and fitness experts.
[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:42.000]   Then, why don't you take the test depending on your score?
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:48.040]   By the way, you can also volunteer additional information to qualify you and then you could
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:50.640]   save up to 41% on your premiums.
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:52.240]   41%.
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:53.240]   No commitment.
[02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:56.380]   You're going to learn even more about opportunities to be rewarded because you're committed to
[02:09:56.380 --> 02:09:57.840]   living healthy.
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:02.140]   HealthIQ wants to help you get the best life insurance money can buy.
[02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:04.540]   The HealthIQ Concierge Service.
[02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:05.540]   See if you qualify.
[02:10:05.540 --> 02:10:07.340]   Go to healthIQ.com/twig.
[02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:08.440]   Take the quiz.
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:10.600]   HealthIQ.com/twig.
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:13.460]   If you pass, you'll talk to a HealthIQ concierge.
[02:10:13.460 --> 02:10:15.380]   They're great people.
[02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:16.380]   Answer their questions.
[02:10:16.380 --> 02:10:18.980]   They'll go to work for you and get you some great rates.
[02:10:18.980 --> 02:10:21.060]   Walk you through the whole process.
[02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:22.460]   Information's king here.
[02:10:22.460 --> 02:10:26.540]   HealthIQ.com/twig.
[02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:31.700]   I actually really flattered that HealthIQ came to us and said, "Oh, you have a healthy
[02:10:31.700 --> 02:10:33.700]   audience, right?"
[02:10:33.700 --> 02:10:35.180]   Sure.
[02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:41.500]   But, I understand that in fact, our audience has been very responsive to these ads.
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:42.500]   We do have a healthy audience.
[02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:43.500]   So, good on you.
[02:10:43.500 --> 02:10:44.500]   That's awesome.
[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:45.500]   You do, Kate.
[02:10:45.500 --> 02:10:46.500]   You do, but for yourself, that's great.
[02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:47.500]   That's awesome.
[02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:48.500]   Yeah.
[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:49.500]   I'm not obese anymore.
[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:51.140]   Your BMI is down to 20.
[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:53.060]   I'm finally below 30.
[02:10:53.060 --> 02:10:54.060]   29.4.
[02:10:54.060 --> 02:10:55.060]   Holy cow.
[02:10:55.060 --> 02:10:58.540]   Geez, Louise, would you stop lifting?
[02:10:58.540 --> 02:11:02.460]   No, I got sick a couple weeks ago and I lost weight.
[02:11:02.460 --> 02:11:04.340]   30 is the cutoff though.
[02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:05.980]   You're real close.
[02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:10.420]   Have one of those bags of bacon and you're-- Right over it.
[02:11:10.420 --> 02:11:11.420]   That's it, man.
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:12.420]   This was so clever.
[02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:14.860]   I loved this.
[02:11:14.860 --> 02:11:19.340]   Damon Reel and Noah Reuben, they're musicians and they wanted to do a good thing for the
[02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:20.780]   public domain.
[02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:25.380]   So, they generated every possible melody.
[02:11:25.380 --> 02:11:27.380]   Wow.
[02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:30.700]   Every possible-- It's like brute forcing it.
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:34.220]   Every possible melody within an octave.
[02:11:34.220 --> 02:11:37.580]   And then they turned around and they put it in the creative commons.
[02:11:37.580 --> 02:11:38.580]   Oh, really?
[02:11:38.580 --> 02:11:40.220]   How many are you going to stop?
[02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:41.220]   It's a lot.
[02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:42.220]   They don't actually say.
[02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:45.020]   And by the way, these are eight note 12 beat melody combos.
[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:47.740]   So they're not really every possible melody.
[02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:52.620]   But that's a common-- I'm not a musician, but I gather that's common for music.
[02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:54.940]   That's two bars.
[02:11:54.940 --> 02:12:01.940]   The algorithm they wrote generates 300,000 melodies a second.
[02:12:01.940 --> 02:12:05.820]   And once a work like this is committed to tangible format, they put it on a hard drive,
[02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:07.820]   it's copyrighted.
[02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:12.180]   And in MIDI format, the notes are just numbers so they could easily fit it on a hard drive.
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:13.180]   So, cool.
[02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:14.180]   Isn't that great?
[02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:20.180]   The data sets are fast to get with these guys and start suing everyone.
[02:12:20.180 --> 02:12:22.180]   No, the idea is not to sue.
[02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:26.180]   Yes, yes, just to prove how broken it is.
[02:12:26.180 --> 02:12:27.180]   Yeah.
[02:12:27.180 --> 02:12:33.180]   So I did see someone on Twitter, Parker Higgins, who works for Freedom of the Press and who
[02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:36.100]   is an expert in copyright said that this was a great--
[02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:37.100]   Stunt.
[02:12:37.100 --> 02:12:39.300]   --thing, stunned.
[02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:44.700]   But that it doesn't actually mean that you can't sue for copyrighted works.
[02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:50.060]   I mean, he said you can't-- you just-- the fact that you've simply reproduced a whole
[02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:52.060]   bunch of potential melodies.
[02:12:52.060 --> 02:12:53.060]   It's not all you actually created.
[02:12:53.060 --> 02:12:54.060]   It's not all you actually created.
[02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:55.060]   It's not all you actually created.
[02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:56.060]   It's not all you actually created.
[02:12:56.060 --> 02:12:57.060]   Copyrighted.
[02:12:57.060 --> 02:12:58.060]   Copyrighted.
[02:12:58.060 --> 02:12:59.060]   Copyrighted.
[02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:00.060]   Copyrighted.
[02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:01.060]   Yeah.
[02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:02.060]   Although they also mentioned--
[02:13:02.060 --> 02:13:05.060]   I'm not where they're going with every possible combination of words.
[02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:06.060]   Right.
[02:13:06.060 --> 02:13:07.060]   Then every article will have been written.
[02:13:07.060 --> 02:13:08.060]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:08.060 --> 02:13:14.380]   This was based on-- or I don't know if they got the idea from-- a Quinn Norton mentioned
[02:13:14.380 --> 02:13:21.180]   something, I think in 2006, that she came up with a conceptual prank called Quinn Symphonic
[02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:28.140]   Conundrum that basically said, get a computer program to write every conceivable melody.
[02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:33.300]   It's, you know, it's unknown really what the impact of this would be, but it's a great
[02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:37.260]   little hack, 1.2 terabytes, every melody possible.
[02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:40.980]   And you can download it if you want all the melodies.
[02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:44.300]   I imagine most of those melodies don't sound so good.
[02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:45.660]   Yeah, I would love to have them.
[02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:46.660]   They're all of them, yeah.
[02:13:46.660 --> 02:13:47.660]   No, but--
[02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:48.660]   I'm downloading them.
[02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:49.660]   I'll play for them.
[02:13:49.660 --> 02:13:53.140]   In the right hand, so those things could sound good, you know?
[02:13:53.140 --> 02:13:54.140]   The right or the--
[02:13:54.140 --> 02:13:55.140]   No.
[02:13:55.140 --> 02:13:56.140]   No.
[02:13:56.140 --> 02:13:57.140]   No.
[02:13:57.140 --> 02:13:58.140]   Some of them will just sound good.
[02:13:58.140 --> 02:14:01.740]   There are some combination of notes that no matter Marvin Hamlish or James Brown could
[02:14:01.740 --> 02:14:02.740]   make sound good.
[02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:05.740]   They also didn't include notes of different durations.
[02:14:05.740 --> 02:14:13.060]   Yeah, but you don't have to because-- well, remember Ghostbusters, right?
[02:14:13.060 --> 02:14:14.060]   Was it Niles Rogers?
[02:14:14.060 --> 02:14:15.060]   Who was it?
[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:17.060]   Rote Ghostbusters got sued by Huey Lewis.
[02:14:17.060 --> 02:14:18.060]   Oh, yeah.
[02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:22.500]   Because they said Ghostbusters is the same melodic combination as I want a new drug.
[02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:25.300]   It isn't the same song, but that melody, right?
[02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:30.860]   Even if one notes sustain longer or maybe the rhythm's different, the melody, the sequence
[02:14:30.860 --> 02:14:33.100]   of notes-- and they won, by the way.
[02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:34.100]   Yeah.
[02:14:34.100 --> 02:14:36.420]   And then Niles was in a similar situation too.
[02:14:36.420 --> 02:14:37.940]   He shouldn't be a sampling.
[02:14:37.940 --> 02:14:38.940]   Yeah.
[02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:39.940]   That's sampling.
[02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:42.460]   That's another matter entirely.
[02:14:42.460 --> 02:14:45.100]   The article quotes a more recent case.
[02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:49.220]   I didn't know this, but Sam Smith stayed with me, which is a beautiful song.
[02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:52.900]   Tom Petty claimed that's my melody.
[02:14:52.900 --> 02:14:53.900]   That's I won't back down.
[02:14:53.900 --> 02:15:00.620]   And eventually Smith gave Petty co-writing credits and royalties, which I feel bad because
[02:15:00.620 --> 02:15:01.620]   I know this song says--
[02:15:01.620 --> 02:15:03.740]   Do you remember what happened with the Verge?
[02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:04.740]   Pitter-suite symphony?
[02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:05.740]   Yeah.
[02:15:05.740 --> 02:15:06.740]   For a longest time.
[02:15:06.740 --> 02:15:07.740]   So they used--
[02:15:07.740 --> 02:15:08.740]   So they sampled something.
[02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:15.740]   Yeah, they sampled-- I think it was an orchestral track, but it came from a Stones song.
[02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:22.860]   So they actually took the songwriter's name off it and put Mick Jagger and someone else
[02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:23.860]   on it.
[02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:24.860]   And then eventually--
[02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:28.260]   Just a month or two ago, Mick gave it back.
[02:15:28.260 --> 02:15:29.260]   Yeah, not that long ago.
[02:15:29.260 --> 02:15:30.260]   Yep.
[02:15:30.260 --> 02:15:31.260]   Yeah, gave it back to him.
[02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:32.260]   Mick said, you know what?
[02:15:32.260 --> 02:15:35.260]   In fact, he gave all the royalties back, which is--
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:36.260]   Mm-hmm.
[02:15:36.260 --> 02:15:37.260]   Yeah.
[02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:38.260]   That's pretty cool.
[02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:39.260]   That's really cool.
[02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:41.260]   Not that it's a great song or anything, but--
[02:15:41.260 --> 02:15:43.260]   It was done that it even happened.
[02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:46.260]   Well, it was a sample, right?
[02:15:46.260 --> 02:15:52.500]   Yeah, but to take the credits off it so that someone doesn't even get paid for it.
[02:15:52.500 --> 02:15:55.620]   Mick certainly didn't need any more money.
[02:15:55.620 --> 02:15:57.380]   Well I'm guessing it wasn't Mick, probably.
[02:15:57.380 --> 02:15:58.380]   It was probably the--
[02:15:58.380 --> 02:15:59.380]   No, no, I don't think it was he.
[02:15:59.380 --> 02:16:00.380]   Usually it isn't.
[02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:02.380]   It isn't the music company that holds.
[02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:03.380]   The lawyers.
[02:16:03.380 --> 02:16:04.380]   Yeah, the lawyers.
[02:16:04.380 --> 02:16:05.380]   It's always the lawyers.
[02:16:05.380 --> 02:16:08.380]   I just-- I thought that was kind of a neat story.
[02:16:08.380 --> 02:16:09.380]   It is.
[02:16:09.380 --> 02:16:11.380]   Did I leave anything out?
[02:16:11.380 --> 02:16:14.380]   Intuit's going to buy credit karma for $7 billion.
[02:16:14.380 --> 02:16:15.380]   Oh, yeah.
[02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:17.380]   I didn't even know what credit karma did, actually.
[02:16:17.380 --> 02:16:18.380]   I just see the ads.
[02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:19.380]   Oh, I've used it.
[02:16:19.380 --> 02:16:20.380]   It's great.
[02:16:20.380 --> 02:16:22.380]   It gives you your credit score.
[02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:23.380]   I want to say FICO's credit.
[02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:24.380]   Oh, that's right.
[02:16:24.380 --> 02:16:25.380]   I got confused with something else.
[02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:26.380]   That's what I knew what it does, yes.
[02:16:26.380 --> 02:16:27.380]   Yeah.
[02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:29.380]   And it's kind of like, you know, Intuit has Mint also, which--
[02:16:29.380 --> 02:16:30.380]   Yeah.
[02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:35.060]   --makes money by offering you better deals, you know, and stuff like that, and gives you
[02:16:35.060 --> 02:16:37.380]   actually a pretty darn good service.
[02:16:37.380 --> 02:16:39.380]   Kind of the same way.
[02:16:39.380 --> 02:16:42.380]   I think the Hirey and the Bruchnier by Surtendler.
[02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:43.380]   I love that.
[02:16:43.380 --> 02:16:44.380]   I love that.
[02:16:44.380 --> 02:16:49.380]   So, Schnier, who is really one of my favorite guys ever in the security--
[02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:50.380]   So, which is just the article--
[02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:52.380]   --a security guru.
[02:16:52.380 --> 02:16:55.380]   Go to the article and look at the caption under the photo.
[02:16:55.380 --> 02:16:56.380]   Okay.
[02:16:56.380 --> 02:16:57.380]   Let me go to the Schnier--
[02:16:57.380 --> 02:16:58.380]   It's on Schnier's blog.
[02:16:58.380 --> 02:17:00.380]   Is that where you're talking about?
[02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:01.380]   No, the register.
[02:17:01.380 --> 02:17:03.380]   Oh, I didn't see the registers.
[02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:04.380]   Look at the caption.
[02:17:04.380 --> 02:17:05.380]   It's on the rundown.
[02:17:05.380 --> 02:17:06.380]   All right.
[02:17:06.380 --> 02:17:07.380]   Let's go back to the rundown.
[02:17:07.380 --> 02:17:10.380]   There's so many things in the rundown.
[02:17:10.380 --> 02:17:12.380]   There it is.
[02:17:12.380 --> 02:17:17.380]   Go.theregister.co.tms.
[02:17:17.380 --> 02:17:27.380]   HTTP colon slash slash www.tms.burners.ly/index.html.
[02:17:27.380 --> 02:17:29.380]   That's the caption in the picture of TV.
[02:17:29.380 --> 02:17:30.380]   I like that.
[02:17:30.380 --> 02:17:31.380]   That's the check out in the ward.
[02:17:31.380 --> 02:17:37.380]   Tim always said, "I never thought humans would ever see HTTP slash colon slash slash."
[02:17:37.380 --> 02:17:38.380]   That was for machines.
[02:17:38.380 --> 02:17:41.380]   I never intended anybody to see a URL.
[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:43.380]   Let alone say it on TV.
[02:17:43.380 --> 02:17:44.380]   Let alone say it on TV.
[02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:46.380]   I'm able to say backslash versus forwards.
[02:17:46.380 --> 02:17:49.380]   Aren't you glad that we don't have to do that anymore?
[02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:52.380]   I remember in ads, in ads, people would actually say that.
[02:17:52.380 --> 02:17:57.380]   HTTP colon slash slash slash slash.
[02:17:57.380 --> 02:18:00.380]   I fought a battle at tech TV.
[02:18:00.380 --> 02:18:03.380]   Because I said, "Look, you're talking to geeks.
[02:18:03.380 --> 02:18:06.380]   You don't have to say HTTP colon slash."
[02:18:06.380 --> 02:18:09.380]   And you don't have to say www.
[02:18:09.380 --> 02:18:10.380]   Yeah.
[02:18:10.380 --> 02:18:13.380]   And they've been going to leave it for a long time.
[02:18:13.380 --> 02:18:15.380]   They put the full thing in there.
[02:18:15.380 --> 02:18:21.380]   And ww is twice as long to say as worldwide web.
[02:18:21.380 --> 02:18:22.380]   Right.
[02:18:22.380 --> 02:18:24.380]   Good choice for an abbreviation.
[02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:31.820]   Anyway, so Sir Tim created something called solid, which is actually composed of social
[02:18:31.820 --> 02:18:32.820]   linked data.
[02:18:32.820 --> 02:18:42.700]   But the notion is you have a kind of a vault with your personal data in it, which you control
[02:18:42.700 --> 02:18:48.700]   and you only give that data to people who offer you something you think worth a while.
[02:18:48.700 --> 02:18:55.700]   Because he was really concerned about privacy on the web and who controls your data.
[02:18:55.700 --> 02:19:00.700]   So solid is a brilliant idea.
[02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:02.700]   They created a company called inrupt.
[02:19:02.700 --> 02:19:08.700]   We talked about it and I don't know how clear I was about what its plans were.
[02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:15.300]   The idea is inrupt is going to use the solid technology to enable people to do this.
[02:19:15.300 --> 02:19:18.700]   How this works, I have no idea.
[02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:24.900]   You'd have to convince Facebook and Google to give up everything they know about you
[02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:27.700]   and put it in a vault and then they have to fire it back.
[02:19:27.700 --> 02:19:28.700]   So that's going to happen.
[02:19:28.700 --> 02:19:30.700]   Or they could federate.
[02:19:30.700 --> 02:19:31.700]   Yeah.
[02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:37.300]   I mean, it's in any way, Bruce Schneier, who is awesome, posted a blog post on Friday
[02:19:37.300 --> 02:19:43.420]   saying, "Hey, I just want to let you know I've taken a job with inrupt.
[02:19:43.420 --> 02:19:48.300]   He is going to be their chief of security architecture.
[02:19:48.300 --> 02:19:50.420]   He's actually been doing it since last summer.
[02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:52.660]   He just didn't tell anybody.
[02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:53.660]   I love Bruce.
[02:19:53.660 --> 02:19:57.860]   He's one of my favorite geeks.
[02:19:57.860 --> 02:20:01.620]   And now he's working on this project, which seems a long shot.
[02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:07.140]   But boy, if you've got people like Tim Berners-Lee and Bruce Schneier behind it, maybe.
[02:20:07.140 --> 02:20:11.420]   I mean, what has Tim done recently though, really?
[02:20:11.420 --> 02:20:14.580]   I want to be done for us recently.
[02:20:14.580 --> 02:20:18.420]   Some of those are some pretty good people who are working there.
[02:20:18.420 --> 02:20:23.700]   But I just don't understand how you're going to convince the companies that right now,
[02:20:23.700 --> 02:20:26.140]   their lifeblood is your data to give it up.
[02:20:26.140 --> 02:20:27.820]   You know it would be interesting.
[02:20:27.820 --> 02:20:35.540]   I think there's a move pressure, I think, for people who don't necessarily want to bust
[02:20:35.540 --> 02:20:41.940]   Facebook or Google up, there's pressure to get them to open up, to federate data-wise
[02:20:41.940 --> 02:20:48.700]   or to make interacting with them and getting data in and out easier.
[02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:51.660]   So that might be a way that they could connect.
[02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:55.100]   It's an open framework.
[02:20:55.100 --> 02:20:56.100]   Yeah.
[02:20:56.100 --> 02:20:57.100]   Yeah.
[02:20:57.100 --> 02:20:59.620]   I mean, they must think that this is doable.
[02:20:59.620 --> 02:21:02.140]   They wouldn't be, you know, these great guys wouldn't be working on it.
[02:21:02.140 --> 02:21:04.340]   I hope it is.
[02:21:04.340 --> 02:21:07.340]   Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.
[02:21:07.340 --> 02:21:10.060]   BA Start has left the building.
[02:21:10.060 --> 02:21:11.060]   Mm-hmm.
[02:21:11.060 --> 02:21:12.140]   Rest easy, my man.
[02:21:12.140 --> 02:21:13.860]   The Konami Code.
[02:21:13.860 --> 02:21:21.580]   Was it actually an unintentional cheat code created by Kazuhisa Hashimoto.
[02:21:21.580 --> 02:21:22.940]   He passed away on Tuesday.
[02:21:22.940 --> 02:21:26.380]   He was just 61.
[02:21:26.380 --> 02:21:33.020]   He was working on a port in 1986 for the Konami arcade game Gradius.
[02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:35.020]   And he created that cheat code just for testing.
[02:21:35.020 --> 02:21:37.500]   He thought, well, nobody will ever figure that one out.
[02:21:37.500 --> 02:21:38.500]   No!
[02:21:38.500 --> 02:21:43.580]   It is an Easter egg that has been used in games ever since.
[02:21:43.580 --> 02:21:53.340]   And I love Konami's tweet with Kazuhisa's famous quote, "Up, up, down, down, left, right,
[02:21:53.340 --> 02:21:56.660]   left, right, BA Start."
[02:21:56.660 --> 02:22:02.780]   When I worked at the Globe and Mail, and we had the website wasn't that old, they
[02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:06.260]   were talking about some programmers and I were talking about stuff that would be cool
[02:22:06.260 --> 02:22:07.260]   to do.
[02:22:07.260 --> 02:22:11.460]   And one of them said, we should--I rigged up this thing where if you type in the Konami
[02:22:11.460 --> 02:22:14.700]   Code, you get all these flashing graphics and little--
[02:22:14.700 --> 02:22:16.700]   Oh, that's so cool.
[02:22:16.700 --> 02:22:18.260]   --and cross the page.
[02:22:18.260 --> 02:22:20.180]   So we implemented it.
[02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:21.700]   And then I tweeted about it.
[02:22:21.700 --> 02:22:23.940]   And then someone came and told us to take it down.
[02:22:23.940 --> 02:22:24.940]   What?
[02:22:24.940 --> 02:22:28.300]   Because we're afraid that readers would think that we'd been hacked.
[02:22:28.300 --> 02:22:31.300]   So they basically said you have to uninstall it.
[02:22:31.300 --> 02:22:32.300]   Oh, man.
[02:22:32.300 --> 02:22:34.380]   It was really--
[02:22:34.380 --> 02:22:40.740]   I would like to write a program that calculates the wasted amount of man and woman hours.
[02:22:40.740 --> 02:22:45.020]   People have spent typing up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA Start all the
[02:22:45.020 --> 02:22:47.100]   time everywhere just to see what would happen.
[02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:48.100]   Who thinks K?
[02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:49.100]   Just in case.
[02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:52.660]   Fortnite had it during their Black Hole event last year.
[02:22:52.660 --> 02:22:53.660]   Oh, it didn't?
[02:22:53.660 --> 02:22:56.220]   Yeah, a little special mini game.
[02:22:56.220 --> 02:23:01.820]   Stadia apparently has the Konami Code on the back of the controllers.
[02:23:01.820 --> 02:23:09.500]   I remember the gamer boy at the household bringing the Konami Code to my attention.
[02:23:09.500 --> 02:23:12.340]   He was just so thrilled when he found it.
[02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:15.540]   And I was like, yeah, that's been around since before you were born, son.
[02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:16.540]   God.
[02:23:16.540 --> 02:23:19.220]   That's 1987.
[02:23:19.220 --> 02:23:21.900]   It was Contra, the game that made the code known.
[02:23:21.900 --> 02:23:26.660]   You got 30 lives instead of three when you're playing, apparently, Contra was a--
[02:23:26.660 --> 02:23:29.620]   Game with some of the best theme music ever.
[02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:30.620]   Really?
[02:23:30.620 --> 02:23:31.620]   Yes.
[02:23:31.620 --> 02:23:36.900]   In Pennsylvania, also used it Metal Gear, Dance Dance, Resil, Revolution.
[02:23:36.900 --> 02:23:41.020]   You see it everywhere, up, down, up, down, left, right, left, right, BA Start.
[02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:43.060]   That's awesome.
[02:23:43.060 --> 02:23:48.820]   If you type that code on our podcast-- oh, I didn't know this, on our website.
[02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:53.380]   Patrick Delahannis just told me you can download all of our shows for free.
[02:23:53.380 --> 02:23:55.700]   Unlocks all of our shows.
[02:23:55.700 --> 02:23:57.620]   How many shows is that now?
[02:23:57.620 --> 02:23:59.420]   Patrick.
[02:23:59.420 --> 02:24:00.900]   All free.
[02:24:00.900 --> 02:24:05.820]   Just type it on the website and then all-- that's an amazing amount of content.
[02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:09.460]   At one point, I think it was like several months of nonstop listening.
[02:24:09.460 --> 02:24:10.460]   Wow.
[02:24:10.460 --> 02:24:11.460]   It's just a mind-boggling.
[02:24:11.460 --> 02:24:12.460]   Free.
[02:24:12.460 --> 02:24:13.460]   Wow.
[02:24:13.460 --> 02:24:14.460]   Absolutely.
[02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:17.660]   Don't tell anybody about that because that could be a problem.
[02:24:17.660 --> 02:24:23.060]   See, now you just open the floodgates for Mr. Delahannis to have to watch the bandwidth.
[02:24:23.060 --> 02:24:25.060]   Oh, oh, no.
[02:24:25.060 --> 02:24:28.380]   He's not going to talk to you about that.
[02:24:28.380 --> 02:24:32.660]   Would you like to do-- I think you should.
[02:24:32.660 --> 02:24:36.940]   You're going to do your last Black History Month pick of the week.
[02:24:36.940 --> 02:24:37.940]   Sure.
[02:24:37.940 --> 02:24:44.460]   There's actually two because this one was unexpected with Miss Catherine Johnson.
[02:24:44.460 --> 02:24:46.460]   Unexpected she was 101.
[02:24:46.460 --> 02:24:49.300]   Yeah, 101 years old.
[02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:54.660]   If you don't know who she is, she was one of the key people in the Apollo mission for
[02:24:54.660 --> 02:24:58.060]   mathematics and helping to handle all the calculations for--
[02:24:58.060 --> 02:24:59.060]   The Hidden Figures.
[02:24:59.060 --> 02:25:01.060]   Yep, the Hidden Figures.
[02:25:01.060 --> 02:25:04.580]   If you haven't seen that movie yet, run.
[02:25:04.580 --> 02:25:07.900]   That actually could be-- it is a great movie.
[02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:09.380]   Do not walk, run.
[02:25:09.380 --> 02:25:11.060]   She hints in, I think, that's her name.
[02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:12.060]   Plays her.
[02:25:12.060 --> 02:25:14.980]   What a-- that movie was so inspiring.
[02:25:14.980 --> 02:25:15.980]   It was.
[02:25:15.980 --> 02:25:16.980]   It made me cry.
[02:25:16.980 --> 02:25:17.980]   It was.
[02:25:17.980 --> 02:25:18.980]   It was just such a great movie.
[02:25:18.980 --> 02:25:23.660]   You know, you hear about a lot of that stuff and you think about, hey, she got that
[02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:28.060]   job at NASA at the Black-only side of NASA.
[02:25:28.060 --> 02:25:29.060]   So sad.
[02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:30.060]   Well, she had two strikes.
[02:25:30.060 --> 02:25:31.060]   She had two strikes.
[02:25:31.060 --> 02:25:32.060]   Because she was also a woman.
[02:25:32.060 --> 02:25:33.060]   Right.
[02:25:33.060 --> 02:25:36.140]   And there's a scene where they have to walk to another building because there's no women's
[02:25:36.140 --> 02:25:39.140]   bathroom in the building that they're in.
[02:25:39.140 --> 02:25:41.260]   It's just crazy the time.
[02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:45.940]   She was the third African-American to get a PhD in mathematics, graduated summa cum laude
[02:25:45.940 --> 02:25:51.460]   from West Virginia State with degrees in mathematics and French at the age of 18.
[02:25:51.460 --> 02:25:52.460]   Brilliant.
[02:25:52.460 --> 02:25:53.460]   Absolutely brilliant.
[02:25:53.460 --> 02:25:55.500]   You didn't find a job because she was black.
[02:25:55.500 --> 02:25:57.500]   So she became a school teacher.
[02:25:57.500 --> 02:25:58.500]   So crazy.
[02:25:58.500 --> 02:26:03.380]   Did you see someone mention how great it was that she had carefully calculated that
[02:26:03.380 --> 02:26:07.220]   she would die at 101 so that she would die in her prime?
[02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:08.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:26:08.220 --> 02:26:09.220]   Oh.
[02:26:09.220 --> 02:26:10.980]   I'm glad she lived so long.
[02:26:10.980 --> 02:26:11.980]   Man, wrist eyes.
[02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:12.980]   Nice.
[02:26:12.980 --> 02:26:15.420]   Now, talk about somebody who deserves a medal of honor.
[02:26:15.420 --> 02:26:16.420]   That's--
[02:26:16.420 --> 02:26:17.420]   Indeed.
[02:26:17.420 --> 02:26:18.420]   Amazing.
[02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:19.420]   Amazing.
[02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:20.420]   Amazing.
[02:26:20.420 --> 02:26:26.220]   She was Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong were able to set foot on the moon in 1969.
[02:26:26.220 --> 02:26:29.860]   Yeah, Buzz said if she said the numbers are good, then I'm going to go.
[02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:30.860]   That's right.
[02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:31.860]   Wow.
[02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:32.860]   She said so.
[02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:33.860]   What a vote of confidence, right?
[02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:38.780]   Because they're not doing this on a HP 99A or whatever.
[02:26:38.780 --> 02:26:40.500]   They're doing this on the chalkboard.
[02:26:40.500 --> 02:26:42.300]   Yeah, she's doing it all by hand.
[02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:43.300]   The chalkboard's--
[02:26:43.300 --> 02:26:44.300]   Yeah, she's doing it all by hand.
[02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:46.500]   We're so tall they had a climb of ladders.
[02:26:46.500 --> 02:26:47.500]   With ladders.
[02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:48.500]   Yeah.
[02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:57.460]   And just remarkable woman, condolences to the family, and thank you for your contributions
[02:26:57.460 --> 02:26:58.460]   to the community.
[02:26:58.460 --> 02:26:59.940]   And a medal of honor winner.
[02:26:59.940 --> 02:27:01.860]   Sure should be.
[02:27:01.860 --> 02:27:08.420]   And my next one is more personal, and I wanted to ask a question to you and Mr. Jarvis
[02:27:08.420 --> 02:27:11.460]   since you two are the old folks, if you will.
[02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:12.460]   Hey.
[02:27:12.460 --> 02:27:13.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:27:13.460 --> 02:27:14.460]   Hey.
[02:27:14.460 --> 02:27:15.820]   All right, so we have had--
[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:18.460]   I can't play this because Aunt Pruitt will take it down.
[02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:20.060]   Yeah, I'll take it down if you play it.
[02:27:20.060 --> 02:27:21.060]   So--
[02:27:21.060 --> 02:27:22.060]   No, you can play.
[02:27:22.060 --> 02:27:28.660]   But I put up a YouTube video from my channel, and it's basically just rehashing a conversation
[02:27:28.660 --> 02:27:30.460]   I had with my late grandfather.
[02:27:30.460 --> 02:27:32.460]   Can I-- I can't play all 10 minutes.
[02:27:32.460 --> 02:27:34.300]   Where should I go?
[02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:35.700]   Well, there's about halfway through.
[02:27:35.700 --> 02:27:36.700]   OK.
[02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:41.780]   It's just-- I want you to think about when-- when we heard that Kobe Bryant was killed
[02:27:41.780 --> 02:27:46.180]   and that horrible crash with all of those other people, we felt a certain way.
[02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:47.180]   You bet.
[02:27:47.180 --> 02:27:55.300]   Now, I want to think back to when more monumental-- I hate saying it that way-- people were assassinated,
[02:27:55.300 --> 02:27:56.300]   killed, or whatever.
[02:27:56.300 --> 02:28:00.820]   So think back to what you felt when Kennedy was assassinated.
[02:28:00.820 --> 02:28:02.060]   I'll never forget it.
[02:28:02.060 --> 02:28:04.060]   You know, and what about you, Mr. Jarvis?
[02:28:04.060 --> 02:28:05.060]   You know, what--
[02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:06.060]   I was in third grade.
[02:28:06.060 --> 02:28:07.060]   Can you remember that?
[02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:08.500]   Can you remember the feeling and just--
[02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:13.940]   I can remember our-- I was in a friend's school, Quaker's School in South Jersey in
[02:28:13.940 --> 02:28:14.940]   third grade.
[02:28:14.940 --> 02:28:24.220]   And the custodian for the school was a minister of a nearby African-American church who had
[02:28:24.220 --> 02:28:27.260]   to do that to earn money because the church didn't pay enough.
[02:28:27.260 --> 02:28:32.260]   I remember him coming to the little window and looking in to tell the teacher what was
[02:28:32.260 --> 02:28:34.500]   happening with tears in his eyes.
[02:28:34.500 --> 02:28:35.500]   Yeah.
[02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:36.500]   All right.
[02:28:36.500 --> 02:28:37.900]   I was same age.
[02:28:37.900 --> 02:28:40.940]   And I'll never forget walking down Thayer Street in Providence.
[02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:42.580]   I was walking home.
[02:28:42.580 --> 02:28:47.740]   And it was deserted, but all the stores had radios and speakers.
[02:28:47.740 --> 02:28:53.140]   And I'm walking down from store to store, hearing about the assassination.
[02:28:53.140 --> 02:28:58.900]   I remember watching Lee Harvey Oswald get shot by Jack Ruby on live TV.
[02:28:58.900 --> 02:29:02.060]   I mean, remember seeing Walter Cronkite crying.
[02:29:02.060 --> 02:29:05.580]   I mean, you don't-- even if you're only in third grade, you know, fully understand what's
[02:29:05.580 --> 02:29:06.580]   going on.
[02:29:06.580 --> 02:29:07.580]   You don't forget that.
[02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:08.580]   All right.
[02:29:08.580 --> 02:29:09.580]   It stuck with you.
[02:29:09.580 --> 02:29:12.380]   There was some type of emotion that you're never going to forget that.
[02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:20.740]   Now, my story with my grandfather, we talked about the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther
[02:29:20.740 --> 02:29:21.740]   King.
[02:29:21.740 --> 02:29:22.740]   Same thing.
[02:29:22.740 --> 02:29:24.580]   I remember in 1968 waking up.
[02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:27.060]   And Bobby had been shot.
[02:29:27.060 --> 02:29:30.740]   And then MLK got shot same year in 1968 devastating.
[02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:33.420]   I just felt like the world was coming to an end.
[02:29:33.420 --> 02:29:39.020]   And see, I'm looking at you in your eyes and I can just see that you can feel something
[02:29:39.020 --> 02:29:40.020]   with that news.
[02:29:40.020 --> 02:29:47.300]   It really takes you back when I spoke with my grandfather about this.
[02:29:47.300 --> 02:29:53.500]   He comes in, he says, I got home from work and I walked in the house to tell my grandmother
[02:29:53.500 --> 02:30:00.380]   hey, and instead of saying, did you hear about the news about Dr. King getting shot?
[02:30:00.380 --> 02:30:05.340]   He walks in and he says, they finally got him.
[02:30:05.340 --> 02:30:06.340]   Yeah.
[02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:11.340]   I've heard this story from so many African Americans because you knew it was going to
[02:30:11.340 --> 02:30:12.820]   happen.
[02:30:12.820 --> 02:30:14.740]   Even King knew it was going to happen.
[02:30:14.740 --> 02:30:19.980]   And I'm like, man, just you knew immediately, right?
[02:30:19.980 --> 02:30:24.740]   What thought process is that to say, okay, they finally got him.
[02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:30.260]   That was the way he and my grandparent, my elders was just living.
[02:30:30.260 --> 02:30:32.820]   That was the life of the 60s.
[02:30:32.820 --> 02:30:37.540]   And I'm so glad we don't have to deal with that type of environment anymore.
[02:30:37.540 --> 02:30:40.540]   But I just wanted to just raise awareness about that.
[02:30:40.540 --> 02:30:42.580]   And we got to continue to do good.
[02:30:42.580 --> 02:30:45.780]   And if you want to go watch that video, go watch it.
[02:30:45.780 --> 02:30:46.780]   It's there.
[02:30:46.780 --> 02:30:50.020]   It's just a different perspective.
[02:30:50.020 --> 02:30:52.300]   I'm so glad you made this.
[02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:54.860]   It's called finally got him.
[02:30:54.860 --> 02:30:56.900]   I'm so glad you made this.
[02:30:56.900 --> 02:31:00.140]   This is Ants personal channel on YouTube.
[02:31:00.140 --> 02:31:01.820]   Create and dominate youtube.com/
[02:31:01.820 --> 02:31:03.580]   Is it slash and prove it?
[02:31:03.580 --> 02:31:04.580]   That's it.
[02:31:04.580 --> 02:31:09.180]   PR you I made that video pretty much like a year ago to, you know, to the day.
[02:31:09.180 --> 02:31:13.780]   It's right about what's on.
[02:31:13.780 --> 02:31:14.780]   But thank you for watching it.
[02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:15.780]   Yeah.
[02:31:15.780 --> 02:31:16.780]   Thank you for making that.
[02:31:16.780 --> 02:31:17.780]   I think that's great.
[02:31:17.780 --> 02:31:18.780]   I think that's great.
[02:31:18.780 --> 02:31:21.140]   Jeff Jarvis, a number, sir.
[02:31:21.140 --> 02:31:23.180]   So this is a whole mess of numbers.
[02:31:23.180 --> 02:31:30.500]   The recent Horowitz put out an analysis they call the marketplace 100 of online marketplaces.
[02:31:30.500 --> 02:31:38.500]   And they got the gross merchandise value from an optimized credit card receipts from a source
[02:31:38.500 --> 02:31:41.180]   called second measure and then killed with 100.
[02:31:41.180 --> 02:31:43.620]   And it's amazing the list.
[02:31:43.620 --> 02:31:48.820]   These are 100 what biggest air V and B door dashes to card post mates.
[02:31:48.820 --> 02:31:49.820]   Yeah, I see them.
[02:31:49.820 --> 02:31:51.900]   But what are the 100 what?
[02:31:51.900 --> 02:31:53.740]   They're online marketplaces.
[02:31:53.740 --> 02:31:59.260]   Like based on a volume based on based on the I just said this a minute ago you got to
[02:31:59.260 --> 02:32:02.180]   listen to gross merchandise value.
[02:32:02.180 --> 02:32:03.980]   How is that even freaking mean?
[02:32:03.980 --> 02:32:05.620]   You mean how much people spend with companies?
[02:32:05.620 --> 02:32:10.660]   This was within rank using a common industry metric, which is extrapolated from how many
[02:32:10.660 --> 02:32:15.060]   total dollars consumers are spending against each company.
[02:32:15.060 --> 02:32:18.460]   This provides an approximate measure of a marketplace's scale and it's importance in
[02:32:18.460 --> 02:32:20.380]   the economy.
[02:32:20.380 --> 02:32:24.260]   Now mind you, it says here, by the way, that these things are becoming so important now
[02:32:24.260 --> 02:32:31.500]   ride sharing platforms alone account for roughly 1% of us household income.
[02:32:31.500 --> 02:32:34.860]   There are an estimated 75 million gig workers in the US.
[02:32:34.860 --> 02:32:36.220]   That's what this is about.
[02:32:36.220 --> 02:32:42.580]   Now what's amazing is the first four door dash or post mates account for three quarters
[02:32:42.580 --> 02:32:45.980]   of the revenue, 76%.
[02:32:45.980 --> 02:32:50.540]   So this is a dollars spent or is there a percentage of the total?
[02:32:50.540 --> 02:32:52.060]   It's just raw dollars spent.
[02:32:52.060 --> 02:32:55.660]   I believe so they could have said that simply yes.
[02:32:55.660 --> 02:32:58.780]   I don't I sounds like it's a different statistical thing.
[02:32:58.780 --> 02:33:00.700]   Let's see if you read it differently.
[02:33:00.700 --> 02:33:01.700]   Yeah.
[02:33:01.700 --> 02:33:02.700]   Above that.
[02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:03.980]   It's not I feel like it's not.
[02:33:03.980 --> 02:33:05.980]   Let me see.
[02:33:05.980 --> 02:33:10.380]   The top three are the companies on this list were then ranked using a common industry metric
[02:33:10.380 --> 02:33:13.100]   gross merchandise value.
[02:33:13.100 --> 02:33:17.740]   So they turned to data and optimized aggregated US consumers putting data captured via credit
[02:33:17.740 --> 02:33:18.740]   cards debit.
[02:33:18.740 --> 02:33:20.980]   Why is each of these in a?
[02:33:20.980 --> 02:33:21.980]   Oh, no, they're not there.
[02:33:21.980 --> 02:33:24.540]   There's just different categories categories are relevant.
[02:33:24.540 --> 02:33:25.540]   Stripper.
[02:33:25.540 --> 02:33:26.540]   Yes.
[02:33:26.540 --> 02:33:27.540]   Okay.
[02:33:27.540 --> 02:33:30.660]   Um, so they got the methodology all there.
[02:33:30.660 --> 02:33:33.420]   What's striking is all these I've never heard of.
[02:33:33.420 --> 02:33:36.060]   This would be more valuable if they put a number next to it.
[02:33:36.060 --> 02:33:41.380]   So I would really would be if you go down lower, you start to see the breakdown, but
[02:33:41.380 --> 02:33:49.620]   tons of these things, Rover, class pass, Zola, Turo, Spot Hero, Goat, I've never heard
[02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:50.620]   of these.
[02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:51.620]   Mm hmm.
[02:33:51.620 --> 02:33:56.260]   And they're they're the top hundred for what is becoming a huge segment of the economy.
[02:33:56.260 --> 02:33:57.740]   See, this is this thing.
[02:33:57.740 --> 02:34:00.340]   Gross market value that I don't I don't know.
[02:34:00.340 --> 02:34:01.340]   Spot here.
[02:34:01.340 --> 02:34:02.340]   I'm really.
[02:34:02.340 --> 02:34:03.340]   Either.
[02:34:03.340 --> 02:34:04.340]   Huh?
[02:34:04.340 --> 02:34:05.900]   What Matthew spot hero is useful.
[02:34:05.900 --> 02:34:06.900]   Okay.
[02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:07.900]   Okay.
[02:34:07.900 --> 02:34:12.740]   Because for all gross market value in the category says by cat.
[02:34:12.740 --> 02:34:19.380]   So what it's saying, I think is how dominant any individual company is in its category.
[02:34:19.380 --> 02:34:27.100]   So Airbnb has the largest share of the travel market of any company.
[02:34:27.100 --> 02:34:31.220]   Two and four door dash and postmates are both of the food and beverage category.
[02:34:31.220 --> 02:34:33.420]   So it's not the largest.
[02:34:33.420 --> 02:34:36.340]   Well, door dash is largest, relevant.
[02:34:36.340 --> 02:34:37.700]   I know it's confusing.
[02:34:37.700 --> 02:34:43.260]   Yeah, I don't think they're saying that Airbnb is related in any way to door dash.
[02:34:43.260 --> 02:34:46.460]   The comparison is their percentage of their category.
[02:34:46.460 --> 02:34:47.460]   Right.
[02:34:47.460 --> 02:34:51.580]   Is what I think I'm understanding, which is a very complicated, weird thing.
[02:34:51.580 --> 02:34:58.140]   So Airbnb owns 58% of this, all the spending, all the market value and travel.
[02:34:58.140 --> 02:35:02.340]   Door dash owns 57% of all the market value and food and beverage.
[02:35:02.340 --> 02:35:03.580]   Insta like that.
[02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:07.540]   And actually the numbers at 38%.
[02:35:07.540 --> 02:35:10.620]   Airbnb is 38 door dash 17 is to our 15 bomb.
[02:35:10.620 --> 02:35:11.620]   You got it.
[02:35:11.620 --> 02:35:14.420]   Postmates six and then goes into a long tail.
[02:35:14.420 --> 02:35:18.940]   Still pretty high, which is to say that in that, you know, I guess postmates, it only
[02:35:18.940 --> 02:35:21.780]   is it's it's a top four marketplace.
[02:35:21.780 --> 02:35:24.380]   It only has 6% of its category.
[02:35:24.380 --> 02:35:27.460]   Then there's a lot more.
[02:35:27.460 --> 02:35:33.540]   Well, no, no, no, no, actually, no, take that back down the, oh no.
[02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:35.300]   38, 17, 15 and six.
[02:35:35.300 --> 02:35:36.540]   Is that up to 76?
[02:35:36.540 --> 02:35:37.540]   Yeah.
[02:35:37.540 --> 02:35:38.540]   They're in different categories.
[02:35:38.540 --> 02:35:39.540]   That's what I'm super casual.
[02:35:39.540 --> 02:35:40.540]   You just love this is.
[02:35:40.540 --> 02:35:41.540]   I don't eat.
[02:35:41.540 --> 02:35:42.540]   What's the number?
[02:35:42.540 --> 02:35:44.540]   I didn't say we're all going to be.
[02:35:44.540 --> 02:35:54.460]   Some sort of GMV is something that economists, some sort of economist.
[02:35:54.460 --> 02:36:00.020]   The fastest growing marketplace categories are celebrity engagement.
[02:36:00.020 --> 02:36:01.020]   What?
[02:36:01.020 --> 02:36:02.020]   I know.
[02:36:02.020 --> 02:36:03.020]   I don't know what that means.
[02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:04.020]   This is Instagram.
[02:36:04.020 --> 02:36:07.540]   I think this is a joke.
[02:36:07.540 --> 02:36:11.180]   These it's like to understand a little more.
[02:36:11.180 --> 02:36:13.140]   I have to read this more closely.
[02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:14.300]   Yeah, I should have.
[02:36:14.300 --> 02:36:15.700]   What is a marketplace company?
[02:36:15.700 --> 02:36:17.180]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[02:36:17.180 --> 02:36:18.460]   What's goat?
[02:36:18.460 --> 02:36:20.460]   I don't know.
[02:36:20.460 --> 02:36:23.700]   I know it's greatest of all time.
[02:36:23.700 --> 02:36:26.220]   I know.
[02:36:26.220 --> 02:36:28.860]   These numbers are hurting my head, Jeff.
[02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:30.540]   Thanks for a number.
[02:36:30.540 --> 02:36:33.780]   You know, by the way, number thing was accidental.
[02:36:33.780 --> 02:36:36.060]   How did you get a spot of the show?
[02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:37.460]   You don't have to do a number.
[02:36:37.460 --> 02:36:39.700]   You said, Oh, Jeff, you get over the number.
[02:36:39.700 --> 02:36:44.340]   It's actually a pain in the ass.
[02:36:44.340 --> 02:36:46.900]   A little rebellion number.
[02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:48.540]   What do I do for a number?
[02:36:48.540 --> 02:36:51.140]   I spent an hour looking around freaking numbers.
[02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:53.980]   By the way, goat number every that's your job.
[02:36:53.980 --> 02:36:55.580]   Get ready for this show.
[02:36:55.580 --> 02:37:00.500]   Goat, which is one of the four fastest growing companies by year over your relative growth.
[02:37:00.500 --> 02:37:07.100]   Is a peer to peer marketplace for buying and selling authenticated streetwear and sneakers.
[02:37:07.100 --> 02:37:09.100]   You should have known that, Matthew.
[02:37:09.100 --> 02:37:14.660]   If you wanted to get your easy boost 350 V2 Earth, you would go to goat.
[02:37:14.660 --> 02:37:15.660]   Can you just say that?
[02:37:15.660 --> 02:37:16.660]   I have some more records.
[02:37:16.660 --> 02:37:17.660]   That's the easy boost.
[02:37:17.660 --> 02:37:22.020]   You know that the 350 V2 Earth, you know that.
[02:37:22.020 --> 02:37:25.060]   I see you wearing easy boosts all the time.
[02:37:25.060 --> 02:37:28.100]   Here's the Rio de Janeiro.
[02:37:28.100 --> 02:37:29.660]   Edit.
[02:37:29.660 --> 02:37:30.660]   This is easy.
[02:37:30.660 --> 02:37:36.260]   This is, you know what, Jeff, what you have brought us is a whole new world that I don't
[02:37:36.260 --> 02:37:37.260]   even understand.
[02:37:37.260 --> 02:37:38.900]   That's my point.
[02:37:38.900 --> 02:37:39.900]   That's my point.
[02:37:39.900 --> 02:37:41.300]   All this stuff you can go buy things.
[02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:42.300]   People are buying it.
[02:37:42.300 --> 02:37:44.260]   I've never heard of some of these.
[02:37:44.260 --> 02:37:45.260]   Are you fair?
[02:37:45.260 --> 02:37:48.980]   Are you an artificial without the hassle?
[02:37:48.980 --> 02:37:49.980]   Pick.
[02:37:49.980 --> 02:37:50.980]   Okay.
[02:37:50.980 --> 02:37:53.020]   How much do you think it would cost for a easy boost?
[02:37:53.020 --> 02:37:55.740]   No, they're not that bad.
[02:37:55.740 --> 02:37:56.740]   320.
[02:37:56.740 --> 02:37:59.220]   $320.00. The cheap.
[02:37:59.220 --> 02:38:00.940]   I was figuring at least 200.
[02:38:00.940 --> 02:38:03.340]   Well, it depends on the size.
[02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:05.780]   If you're four, it's cheap.
[02:38:05.780 --> 02:38:06.780]   Let's see.
[02:38:06.780 --> 02:38:07.780]   I'm a nine, $345.00.
[02:38:07.780 --> 02:38:09.020]   That's not too bad.
[02:38:09.020 --> 02:38:10.020]   That's crazy.
[02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:11.020]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:38:11.020 --> 02:38:12.020]   Buy new with defects.
[02:38:12.020 --> 02:38:13.020]   That's what?
[02:38:13.020 --> 02:38:14.020]   That's as an order.
[02:38:14.020 --> 02:38:15.020]   $530.
[02:38:15.020 --> 02:38:18.220]   I guess they're more expensive if they have imperfections.
[02:38:18.220 --> 02:38:21.060]   And then apparently the used ones are completely sold out.
[02:38:21.060 --> 02:38:22.060]   I don't understand.
[02:38:22.060 --> 02:38:23.220]   Yeah, because they're cheaper.
[02:38:23.220 --> 02:38:24.420]   They're $100 cheaper used.
[02:38:24.420 --> 02:38:25.860]   That's an ugly ass sneaker.
[02:38:25.860 --> 02:38:26.860]   Did you wear that?
[02:38:26.860 --> 02:38:28.860]   It looks like a lizard.
[02:38:28.860 --> 02:38:29.860]   Nope.
[02:38:29.860 --> 02:38:30.860]   Nope.
[02:38:30.860 --> 02:38:31.860]   That's the easy boost.
[02:38:31.860 --> 02:38:32.860]   Marsh.
[02:38:32.860 --> 02:38:35.700]   I think that's what Neil Armstrong buzzed.
[02:38:35.700 --> 02:38:37.860]   Oh, I know what this category is.
[02:38:37.860 --> 02:38:39.500]   It's an easy supply.
[02:38:39.500 --> 02:38:40.500]   Yeah.
[02:38:40.500 --> 02:38:45.460]   It's book a personalized video message from a celebrity.
[02:38:45.460 --> 02:38:46.460]   Okay.
[02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:49.140]   Those are very popular.
[02:38:49.140 --> 02:38:51.060]   Debbie Gibson, $150.
[02:38:51.060 --> 02:38:53.060]   Michael Rappaport, $150.
[02:38:53.060 --> 02:38:55.060]   Leo LePort, $2.50.
[02:38:55.060 --> 02:38:59.700]   Larry Thomas, the soup Nazi, $60.
[02:38:59.700 --> 02:39:00.700]   What?
[02:39:00.700 --> 02:39:01.700]   Really?
[02:39:01.700 --> 02:39:03.200]   Everybody's good.
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:06.100]   Jim O'Hare from Parks and Recreation, $135.
[02:39:06.100 --> 02:39:11.100]   Oh, I pay a lot of money to get runs.
[02:39:11.100 --> 02:39:12.100]   Yes, until we're gone free.
[02:39:12.100 --> 02:39:13.900]   How much is it cost?
[02:39:13.900 --> 02:39:14.900]   $1,000.
[02:39:14.900 --> 02:39:15.900]   Get a Gilbert Godfrey.
[02:39:15.900 --> 02:39:16.900]   $150.
[02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:17.900]   It's cheap.
[02:39:17.900 --> 02:39:18.900]   Oh, bless his heart.
[02:39:18.900 --> 02:39:19.900]   It's cheap.
[02:39:19.900 --> 02:39:20.900]   What?
[02:39:20.900 --> 02:39:21.900]   Settle.
[02:39:21.900 --> 02:39:22.900]   Settle.
[02:39:22.900 --> 02:39:23.900]   Come on.
[02:39:23.900 --> 02:39:27.500]   The guy who did, "You've got mail."
[02:39:27.500 --> 02:39:28.500]   No.
[02:39:28.500 --> 02:39:29.700]   It was selling.
[02:39:29.700 --> 02:39:31.200]   Ha!
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:33.500]   I bought, it wasn't too expensive.
[02:39:33.500 --> 02:39:36.620]   "You've got mail, you twit."
[02:39:36.620 --> 02:39:38.540]   I wish I could find that.
[02:39:38.540 --> 02:39:39.540]   Wow.
[02:39:39.540 --> 02:39:40.540]   Wow.
[02:39:40.540 --> 02:39:42.820]   Der Wood, his name was Der Wood-something.
[02:39:42.820 --> 02:39:44.120]   He was selling that online.
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:45.680]   Little he didn't live long enough for this.
[02:39:45.680 --> 02:39:46.680]   Maybe he's still alive.
[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:47.680]   I shouldn't say that.
[02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:49.540]   I think he's probably not.
[02:39:49.540 --> 02:39:53.220]   For the celebrity marketplace, he could really cash in now.
[02:39:53.220 --> 02:39:53.740]   Wow.
[02:39:53.740 --> 02:40:01.300]   Somebody got somebody who's that service and got a guy from an '80s or '90s boy band to break
[02:40:01.300 --> 02:40:05.300]   up with his girlfriend, I think.
[02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:06.300]   Wow.
[02:40:06.300 --> 02:40:07.300]   This is sad.
[02:40:07.300 --> 02:40:09.460]   This is a category.
[02:40:09.460 --> 02:40:12.140]   So like Kim Kardashian expensive?
[02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:16.140]   I'm not this huge, so hard of you.
[02:40:16.140 --> 02:40:20.140]   Anyways, I'm proud to be part of Cameo.
[02:40:20.140 --> 02:40:21.140]   Where?
[02:40:21.140 --> 02:40:23.140]   How much did you pay for that?
[02:40:23.140 --> 02:40:24.140]   I think you did.
[02:40:24.140 --> 02:40:32.780]   You were about more possibly give you a kidney at the right price.
[02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:33.780]   Nice.
[02:40:33.780 --> 02:40:34.780]   Gilbert got some.
[02:40:34.780 --> 02:40:37.540]   Somebody came up with this and it's an industry.
[02:40:37.540 --> 02:40:38.980]   It's a freaking industry now.
[02:40:38.980 --> 02:40:41.860]   Well, but I guess Gilbert probably goes in the studio, records 10.
[02:40:41.860 --> 02:40:43.660]   I'm going to make just my $1,500.
[02:40:43.660 --> 02:40:44.660]   And he's done.
[02:40:44.660 --> 02:40:45.660]   Easy cash.
[02:40:45.660 --> 02:40:46.660]   Easy cash.
[02:40:46.660 --> 02:40:48.180]   And he goes and buys some ez.
[02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:50.540]   The problem is, that's easy right there.
[02:40:50.540 --> 02:40:52.780]   That's just the left easy.
[02:40:52.780 --> 02:40:56.220]   I, the problem with it is you're going to throw your voice out because the temptation is
[02:40:56.220 --> 02:40:57.220]   no, you're not going to do 10.
[02:40:57.220 --> 02:40:59.660]   If I'm going to do 10, I'm going to do 100.
[02:40:59.660 --> 02:41:01.220]   That's a lot more money.
[02:41:01.220 --> 02:41:02.220]   Right.
[02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:03.220]   Right.
[02:41:03.220 --> 02:41:04.220]   Maybe I'll do two hundred.
[02:41:04.220 --> 02:41:05.220]   There's another use for your voice these days.
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:06.220]   You, yes.
[02:41:06.220 --> 02:41:07.220]   Gilbert, I don't know.
[02:41:07.220 --> 02:41:08.940]   Nobody paid for my voice.
[02:41:08.940 --> 02:41:10.340]   Sure they would.
[02:41:10.340 --> 02:41:14.780]   But remember that was the prize on, wait, wait, don't tell me?
[02:41:14.780 --> 02:41:20.060]   Was the, to get him to record your voice machine?
[02:41:20.060 --> 02:41:21.780]   Wait, wait, don't tell me.
[02:41:21.780 --> 02:41:22.780]   That was the prize.
[02:41:22.780 --> 02:41:24.500]   They had the great announcer.
[02:41:24.500 --> 02:41:25.500]   No, it's not that old.
[02:41:25.500 --> 02:41:26.500]   It's still on, but the announcer.
[02:41:26.500 --> 02:41:27.500]   NPR.
[02:41:27.500 --> 02:41:28.500]   Yeah, NPR.
[02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:33.580]   He passed away, but Carl Castle, to get Carl Castle to do your voice machine.
[02:41:33.580 --> 02:41:35.780]   Hello, this is Carl Castle.
[02:41:35.780 --> 02:41:37.780]   I only watched that.
[02:41:37.780 --> 02:41:40.780]   I listened to it once because Alonzo Bowden was on it.
[02:41:40.780 --> 02:41:42.380]   Wait, wait, don't tell me.
[02:41:42.380 --> 02:41:44.220]   The comedian Alonzo Bowden.
[02:41:44.220 --> 02:41:49.620]   Who was the famous announcer on the laugh, laugh and, was it on part?
[02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:50.620]   Gary Owens.
[02:41:50.620 --> 02:41:52.620]   This is Gary Owens speaking.
[02:41:52.620 --> 02:41:55.740]   Gary Owens, right.
[02:41:55.740 --> 02:41:56.740]   Live from Burbank.
[02:41:56.740 --> 02:41:59.780]   If you buy one Gilbert, you get one Leo free.
[02:41:59.780 --> 02:42:00.860]   Yes.
[02:42:00.860 --> 02:42:02.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:42:02.860 --> 02:42:04.140]   Do you have any Leo Decapels?
[02:42:04.140 --> 02:42:07.300]   You would like to pick Matthew or mention, you don't have to.
[02:42:07.300 --> 02:42:08.380]   I just, I'm asking.
[02:42:08.380 --> 02:42:09.380]   I don't want to leave you out.
[02:42:09.380 --> 02:42:16.940]   So I was going to pick the guys who programmed every possible melody.
[02:42:16.940 --> 02:42:18.940]   But you got to use that one.
[02:42:18.940 --> 02:42:19.780]   I stole it.
[02:42:19.780 --> 02:42:23.500]   But I did find one that I thought was amusing, but also disturbing.
[02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:31.780]   So do you remember there was an NSA program where they could basically record phone calls
[02:42:31.780 --> 02:42:36.740]   and text and capture them when they were searching for terrorists?
[02:42:36.740 --> 02:42:44.580]   So this program cost $100 million between 2015 and 2019.
[02:42:44.580 --> 02:42:51.020]   And they just admitted that they got a single, useful piece of information
[02:42:51.020 --> 02:42:52.060]   out of that program.
[02:42:52.060 --> 02:42:52.620]   One.
[02:42:52.620 --> 02:42:53.220]   One?
[02:42:53.220 --> 02:42:55.780]   This whole time they were saying, you have no idea
[02:42:55.780 --> 02:42:58.380]   how valuable this is in fighting terrorism.
[02:42:58.380 --> 02:43:00.740]   But we won't tell you, but you have no idea.
[02:43:00.740 --> 02:43:01.660]   Apparently it's not--
[02:43:01.660 --> 02:43:04.260]   A single one, $100 million.
[02:43:04.260 --> 02:43:06.420]   Yeah.
[02:43:06.420 --> 02:43:08.780]   And but now they have all the recordings.
[02:43:08.780 --> 02:43:10.220]   So--
[02:43:10.220 --> 02:43:11.780]   Now they got a J to start.
[02:43:11.780 --> 02:43:12.780]   OK, Google.
[02:43:12.780 --> 02:43:14.580]   Yeah, they sold them to go.
[02:43:14.580 --> 02:43:16.260]   Yeah.
[02:43:16.260 --> 02:43:22.140]   And here finally, my pick, the Smithsonian has just announced that they are going to put--
[02:43:22.140 --> 02:43:26.820]   they're going to digitize much of their collection, put images, recordings,
[02:43:26.820 --> 02:43:29.500]   all sorts of stuff from the Smithsonian.
[02:43:29.500 --> 02:43:29.980]   Millions of them.
[02:43:29.980 --> 02:43:32.340]   Millions of them in the public domain.
[02:43:32.340 --> 02:43:37.820]   19 museums, nine research centers, libraries, archives, the national zoo.
[02:43:37.820 --> 02:43:41.340]   If you're looking-- oh, they even have remixes.
[02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:46.100]   This is why you put stuff in the public domain, because of the way people can use it and have
[02:43:46.100 --> 02:43:47.460]   fun with it.
[02:43:47.460 --> 02:43:50.820]   All these images, all this fun stuff.
[02:43:50.820 --> 02:43:51.940]   Completely free--
[02:43:51.940 --> 02:43:53.020]   2.8 million.
[02:43:53.020 --> 02:43:54.380]   Oh, my media.
[02:43:54.380 --> 02:43:56.220]   And they're adding more, too.
[02:43:56.220 --> 02:43:57.660]   Yeah, they're constantly digitizing.
[02:43:57.660 --> 02:43:58.980]   This is our tax dollars at work.
[02:43:58.980 --> 02:43:59.620]   This is great.
[02:43:59.620 --> 02:44:00.660]   We do own this.
[02:44:00.660 --> 02:44:03.980]   Yeah, this was announced a month or so ago, I believe.
[02:44:03.980 --> 02:44:05.860]   I just saw the story.
[02:44:05.860 --> 02:44:06.740]   It's been a little while.
[02:44:06.740 --> 02:44:07.860]   So good.
[02:44:07.860 --> 02:44:08.740]   It's good stuff.
[02:44:08.740 --> 02:44:12.020]   Look at that one, honor king and racism.
[02:44:12.020 --> 02:44:17.580]   This is a poster carried in the 1960 at Memphis March.
[02:44:17.580 --> 02:44:18.740]   Outstanding.
[02:44:18.740 --> 02:44:20.220]   Isn't that great?
[02:44:20.220 --> 02:44:21.940]   So I thought I'd mention that.
[02:44:21.940 --> 02:44:29.820]   And you could find it at si.edu, the Smithsonian Institution, si.edu/openaccess.
[02:44:29.820 --> 02:44:34.700]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think we should wrap this up, because there's nothing better than
[02:44:34.700 --> 02:44:38.700]   going down to San Francisco and catching the coronavirus.
[02:44:38.700 --> 02:44:40.780]   From a bunch of hop-tep techies.
[02:44:40.780 --> 02:44:41.620]   Well, there is.
[02:44:41.620 --> 02:44:45.740]   They just announced there's a case in Northern California.
[02:44:45.740 --> 02:44:51.460]   So these guys are going to be on the air live 24 hours a day for the next 14 days.
[02:44:51.460 --> 02:44:52.460]   Actually, that's a good idea.
[02:44:52.460 --> 02:44:54.780]   We'll lock ourselves in the studio.
[02:44:54.780 --> 02:44:57.020]   And just quarantine.
[02:44:57.020 --> 02:44:58.140]   That was scared.
[02:44:58.140 --> 02:44:59.140]   Yeah.
[02:44:59.140 --> 02:45:00.700]   You don't want to do that, you don't have to.
[02:45:00.700 --> 02:45:02.980]   I'm trying to find a corner I could sleep in.
[02:45:02.980 --> 02:45:06.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:45:06.500 --> 02:45:10.620]   We don't mean July at the ailment and the danger, but no.
[02:45:10.620 --> 02:45:11.580]   What are you going to do?
[02:45:11.580 --> 02:45:12.580]   What are you going to do?
[02:45:12.580 --> 02:45:14.220]   You're going to wear a mask.
[02:45:14.220 --> 02:45:18.900]   You're going to sanitize and transport it to Sonoma County Hospital here.
[02:45:18.900 --> 02:45:19.540]   What?
[02:45:19.540 --> 02:45:20.420]   Here?
[02:45:20.420 --> 02:45:21.580]   Sonoma County Hospital.
[02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:22.100]   Oh, oh.
[02:45:22.100 --> 02:45:22.940]   That's not far from here, right?
[02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:23.740]   Yeah, the sheets.
[02:45:23.740 --> 02:45:26.140]   This is Sonoma County.
[02:45:26.140 --> 02:45:27.100]   OK.
[02:45:27.100 --> 02:45:27.580]   OK.
[02:45:27.580 --> 02:45:31.140]   So I guess it's OK to go to San Francisco.
[02:45:31.140 --> 02:45:32.020]   We do this show.
[02:45:32.020 --> 02:45:32.660]   I'm fine.
[02:45:32.660 --> 02:45:33.340]   It's going to be fun.
[02:45:33.340 --> 02:45:33.980]   I can't wait.
[02:45:33.980 --> 02:45:36.540]   Thank you, Matthew Ingram, for joining me.
[02:45:36.540 --> 02:45:38.820]   Matthew, I didn't mention this at the very beginning of the show,
[02:45:38.820 --> 02:45:41.300]   and I should have, is the Chief Digital Writer
