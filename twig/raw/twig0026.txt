[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.080]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.760]   It's time for Twig, this week in Google,
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.000]   the show that covers all of the latest news from not only
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.960]   the Google, but from the cloud.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.760]   Joining us now from Germany, are you there for the G7?
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.440]   What are you there for?
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.600]   No, I'm here for a conference called DLD,
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.160]   run by Burda, which is the big publisher in Germany.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.920]   And it's really quite a good conference every year.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.880]   So here I am, and then I go on to Davos,
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.880]   where I hope to call him next week.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.720]   Wow, that's exciting.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.440]   Jeff Jarvis, Jet Setter, blogger at Buzzmachine.com/journalistic.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.040]   Guru, and that's, I'm sure, why you go to conferences like this.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.440]   Is this scene the same in Germany?
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.600]   Well, I'll ask you that in a second.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.280]   But first, let's say hi to Gina Trapani.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.000]   He's also here, another proto-blogger, founder of lifehacker.com.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.720]   She blogs these days at smarterware.org, as well as lifehacker.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.200]   Abby.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.560]   Has a crushed cup from a submarine.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.840]   Yes.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.280]   That was cool.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.880]   It was pretty cool.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.800]   Gina was part of a--
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.360]   I don't know why the Navy did this,
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.560]   but they invited a bunch of bloggers to go on a submarine.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.560]   It was pretty amazing.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.040]   Yeah, I'm so jelly.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.440]   And then you must have gone out, because you wouldn't
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.880]   have have a crushed cup.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.880]   Yeah, we went out, and we dove down about 600 feet down.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.840]   So, I mean, not only am I one of the few civilians
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.640]   who have ever gone down and out on a submarine,
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.120]   but I'm one of the few women, because women
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.440]   don't serve on submarines.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.080]   So it was pretty, pretty exciting.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.240]   Wow, that's neat.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.640]   I've been--
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.880]   There was Jerry Lewis movie about that.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.280]   A woman on a submarine.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.840]   Something like that.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.840]   Wasn't it a pink-- it was like a pink submarine?
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.840]   Yeah, so yeah.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.880]   God, I wish you hadn't dredged that memory up.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.880]   Who should play you?
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.240]   [LAUGHS]
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.520]   I'm thinking Ava Gabor for the--
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.800]   So I've been on an active duty sub before,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.720]   and they cover up everything.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.600]   So you can't see it.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.000]   I mean, they have hoods that they put over everything,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.560]   and they never contemplated taking you out to sea.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.120]   So that's a big change for the Navy.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.880]   That's kind of a change.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.400]   It was huge.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.900]   It was huge.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.680]   We saw everything.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.600]   I mean, I had a video-- I was in the control room
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.160]   while we were doing the dive, and I had a video camera going.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.560]   And they said to us, hey, we'll let you know if something's
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.160]   classified, and we don't want you to take a picture.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.200]   But I got tons of pictures and videos.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.560]   It was kind of amazing.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.040]   They were really open, much more open than I thought they'd be.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.560]   It just shows the power of the blogger
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.040]   that these groups are aware of, the great PR value of taking
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.640]   a few people--
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.920]   because it used to be-- they'd always joke about bloggers.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.160]   You know, it's some fat guy in the living room
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.560]   with a neck beard and his jammies.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.000]   And it's really changed the attitude source blogging.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.680]   Definitely.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.180]   Definitely.
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.480]   I think it's right, too.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.280]   It's correct.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.000]   And what is the German attitude towards the end
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.840]   of the newspaper industry?
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.340]   Jeff.
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.800]   Uh-oh.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.040]   Jeff, you're sitting on your mute button.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.000]   Hello.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.440]   Right there.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.640]   Yeah, it's back.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.800]   OK.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.400]   It's getting rough here because they're
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.240]   trying to go after Google.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.520]   And there are those who are smart in this industry who
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.680]   are saying that's the stupid thing to do.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.800]   And there are those who are now kind of giving up
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.120]   and are trying to figure out what's what.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.680]   So now we've had the German government
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.920]   going after Google for antitrust, which I think is absurd.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.840]   But that's started by the publishers.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.120]   Publishers are threatening to pull out of Google.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.320]   It's a bit of a swords.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.760]   What's going to happen this week, Dave Drumman from Google,
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.480]   who's the chief counsel, is going
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.560]   to be here at this DLD conference with the top publishers,
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.120]   including Burda and Axel Sprager and others.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.320]   And I'm told that maybe there might be some conciliatory talk,
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.720]   but we'll see.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.720]   Neely Crozus back at this kind of interest
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.880]   is she was the European commissioner for competition.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.680]   And it was the one who went after Google
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.040]   and Microsoft and others, an Intel, too, I believe,
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.200]   that she retired and now she's being invited back
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.000]   to run technology to be--
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.680]   Composure technology.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.320]   So if Google felt a sigh of relief when Neely retired,
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.440]   I think it's--
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.760]   She's back.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.720]   I don't-- one of the reasons that they interviewed her,
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.440]   one of the reasons that they asked her to serve
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.220]   as the technology commissioner is because she's
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.800]   pro-net neutrality.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.360]   She seems like she's got some pretty--
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.480]   maybe it's pro-consumer ideas to the detriment
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.480]   of big companies like Google and Intel and Microsoft.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.640]   Well, they have different attitudes in Europe about privacy
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.240]   than we have in the US.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.440]   I wrote a column in the Guardian.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.440]   We could go about what I said was the right to link.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.200]   And if you think about it, what's public is public.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.800]   And we and the public have a right to comment on it
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.880]   and link to it and talk about it.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.520]   And if you try to take away that right
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.320]   to talk about what's in public, if you enable Google--
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.960]   if you tell Google they can't do street view because you
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.960]   might catch somebody going into an opium den.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.120]   What happens when a journalist catches a politician?
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.640]   Right.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.440]   Into that opium den.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.960]   It's tricky.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.000]   Isn't it?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.800]   It's very tricky.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.120]   And the kind of knee-jerk response about privacy
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.400]   and against America and against big companies--
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.160]   I'm not saying they're all I know American,
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.560]   but there is a bit of a knee-jerk response.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.200]   It takes Google up like tuna in the net.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   Right.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.640]   Unfortunately.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.760]   That came up in Secretary of State Clinton's speech
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.080]   on Thursday on internet freedom.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.600]   She was saying, we can't have anonymity on the internet.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.400]   And then somebody quite reasonably stood up and said,
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.680]   yeah, but what about whistle blowing and battered women?
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.280]   And she said, well, and then she just said,
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.120]   she said, well, you're right.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.560]   This is difficult.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.640]   What was the reaction to Hillary Clinton's speech on Thursday?
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.240]   Did you see anything while you were there?
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.480]   Not enough, from my view.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.840]   And I left Friday to come here, so I didn't maybe see much.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.760]   I wanted to listen to it.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.960]   I didn't have a chance to, but I wanted more reaction to it.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.480]   The only thing I saw was the Chinese government
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.840]   of-- I mean, there are no's in saying,
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.480]   how dare you criticize us.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.160]   What did you think of the speech, Shajina?
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.200]   I missed it.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.840]   I'm feeling--
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.240]   I'm feeling very bad.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.200]   I watched it.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.120]   I tried to watch it.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.480]   Well, it was morning time, our time.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.520]   It was breakfast time.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.280]   And I watched it as I was getting the kids ready.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.560]   And it was a very bland political speech, I thought.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.120]   But if you read between the lines,
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.880]   it was a little bit of saber rattling.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.680]   And I can understand why the Chinese government was
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.000]   a little perturbed by it, because she called out China.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.200]   She said, you know, we can't be hacking our companies.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.600]   And it was interesting, Jeff, because the Chinese response
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.640]   didn't come from a high-ranking Chinese official.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.400]   It came from a guy who was like the director of the online news
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.400]   association.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.800]   I love that you're doing criminal analogy now, Alia.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.520]   Well, it is criminal analogy.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.960]   It is great, yeah.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.000]   So I mean, it was on Xinhua, which
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.760]   is the official Chinese news agency.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.520]   So it was-- if you do the criminal analogy,
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.720]   well, they didn't want to have a high-ranking official say it.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.920]   But they wanted somebody to say it,
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.880]   and they certainly provided the channel, which
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.000]   gave it the official imprimatur.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.240]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.120]   It's like-- they're testing the waters.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.800]   And really what he said was--
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.960]   it's not the US's business.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.320]   There's no other company's business
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.800]   how China runs its politics, runs its country,
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.040]   and runs its internet.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.120]   And he said, the US has no right to criticize us
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.040]   for how we run our internet.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.000]   The implication being, well, look at how--
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.200]   look to your own, the mode in your own eye, or whatever it is,
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.600]   whatever the biblical quote would be.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.160]   Well, that's just the issue.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.040]   Is it their internet?
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.840]   Is it our internet?
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.360]   Right.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.200]   Who's internet, is it?
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.480]   Back to that idea that it's no one's internet.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.440]   Rebecca McKinnon, who covers China
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.760]   very well from her blog, talked about the idea of the need
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.360]   for an internet constitution.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.360]   And I thought about that.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.360]   I was going to blog about it.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.000]   I didn't.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.080]   And I thought, I'm not sure I want a constitution.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.160]   But I do want a bill of rights.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.480]   And I think at some point, we have
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.320]   to start to codify what we think are the rights of the internet.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:54.280]   John Perry Barlow wrote a wonderful rousing call
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.440]   to people of the earth on behalf of the internet,
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.520]   saying that the governments should stay out of it.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.400]   When some time ago, I was actually
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.200]   written in Davos in the '90s.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.320]   And it was kind of the declaration
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.360]   of independence of the internet.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.160]   And that took us to the point of understanding
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.080]   this is very different.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.760]   But we also do need, I think, some codification of our rights.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.240]   Well, it's also caused some real infighting.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.800]   I know at the EFF, where Barlow is a founder
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.680]   and a member of the board.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.320]   Because on the other hand, if the government
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.960]   doesn't get involved to protect that neutrality, who does?
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.360]   It is a form of regulation.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.160]   It's a mess.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.120]   It's a very difficult thing to talk about.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.040]   So a couple of stories in the Google verse this week,
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.760]   a big one.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.280]   And I don't know if it's just a rumor business week had it.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.200]   Or if it's really going to happen, my sense is it's true,
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.800]   is that Apple's talking with Microsoft
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.440]   to replace Google as the search engine on the iPhone.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.440]   They want to have Bing in there.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.240]   Yeah, no kidding, boo.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:04.240]   So for a company who's so dead set on making the user experience,
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.120]   absolutely perfect.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.320]   I mean, does Bing really provide the best search experience
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:08.800]   out there?
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.600]   I mean, this is clearly-- this is true.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.800]   This is clearly--
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.800]   It's politics.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.360]   It's a competition thing.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.360]   Politics.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   Sure.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.920]   This could be-- for a long time, Eric Schmidt
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.840]   served on the Apple board.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.360]   And it was clearly this nice, friendly, collegial relationship.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.480]   And then it's the phones that have finally
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.040]   got him at each other's throats, I think.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:32.560]   And the lack of multi-touch in the droid and now the Nexus 1
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.120]   has to be because of Apple, whether Google's afraid Apple
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.280]   will sue them over the patent or Apple asked them to.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.400]   But it has to be about Apple.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.360]   And it's a big liability on the Nexus 1,
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.920]   not to have multi-touch.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.640]   And then Apple's shot across the bow saying,
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.840]   we're going with Bing.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.560]   That's not going to make anybody happy.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.320]   That's terrible.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.000]   There's going to be revolt.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.440]   If they try to do that--
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.440]   It might be good for Google.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.680]   It might be one of those things that
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.120]   pushes people away from the iPhone towards the Nexus 1.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.040]   Don't you love Google being underdog?
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.320]   Yeah, not for long.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.960]   So you're in Germany.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.960]   Are you using the Nexus 1?
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.160]   I mean, it's a GSM phone.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.320]   It's a good phone for Google.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:14.600]   Well, nice.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.320]   Here's the problem.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:20.160]   I have a UK SIM with orange.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.560]   I put it in when I landed this morning.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.640]   And it does phone only no data.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.920]   I was with Dan Dubno, who does Gadgetov.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:34.560]   And he had his T-Mobile SIM from the US phone no data.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.600]   That's a real problem.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.640]   That's funny, because T-Mobile's Deutsche Telecom.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.800]   And for being here until Tuesday morning,
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.440]   it's not worth it for me to buy an on demand.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.280]   I'll probably in Switzerland.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.040]   I'll buy a Swisscom SIM and try that.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.640]   No, right now the hotel Wi-Fi is 20 euro.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.640]   I'm not going to sign up for that.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.520]   So no, I'm not using it.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.720]   Well, and here's the sad thing.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.000]   And your iPhone would have worked fine.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.240]   I mean, you would have had to--
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.200]   I have it with me.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:01.720]   OK.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.280]   I have not abandoned my iPhone.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.640]   I am loyal.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.160]   You got a reason.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.040]   I love my beer.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.400]   And now you have a strong reason.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.400]   I mean, that's a big one.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.320]   I thought one of the people--
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.240]   Yeah, that is a big one.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.680]   I thought it would work.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.720]   But even if the iPhone search being by default--
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.080]   Yeah, then what?
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.480]   You know, I put the Bing app on my iPhone, and it's not bad.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.720]   I don't think people wouldn't--
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.000]   to be honest, most people probably wouldn't even notice it.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.640]   And where would it be?
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.200]   It would be in the browser, being Safari.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.480]   Is that where we're talking?
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.280]   Or is it phone wide?
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.040]   I guess there is a phone wide search that pulls up a Google
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.520]   result.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.480]   There's the Google app on the iPhone, which actually is better
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.720]   ironically than the Google phone.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.480]   Right.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.080]   Oh, really?
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.880]   Do you think?
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.000]   What makes it better?
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.440]   Just because it's kind of all there.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.680]   So I can get from the Google app in the iPhone, I get maps
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.520]   and search and news and images and translation and everything.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.160]   Oh, Gina, you're going to have to school Mr. Jarvis.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:58.800]   I'm afraid.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.600]   That's just sad.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.200]   But the irony is that Google didn't do--
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.400]   come on, Google didn't do as good a job with its own app
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.960]   in Android as it did in the iPhone.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.640]   That's because it's not an app.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.080]   It's built into the Android.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.160]   Jeff, you've got to press that little search button
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.200]   in the lower right hand corner.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.000]   OK, you tell me how do I easily get to news on the Android?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.880]   Well, look, I did that.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.560]   I just typed in pizza by pressing the search button.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.040]   It finds phone contacts, yes.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.360]   But it also has search maps for pizza.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.680]   It has pizza hut.com website.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.920]   Search the web for pizza.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.800]   More Google results.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.160]   Let's see.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.560]   Let's see if there's news.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:39.520]   Let's see.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.160]   Here's Google.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.320]   Three additional results.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.320]   Let's see.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.360]   Maybe you're right.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.160]   Well, of course, maybe there's not any pizza news.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.240]   I should have said something more--
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:48.800]   Newsy.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.240]   --newsy.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.480]   But that-- so you would get news right away in the--
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.280]   Yeah, so if I go to the Google app in--
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.040]   I get my apps, mail-calendar-docs-talk,
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:05.480]   Gmail-calendar-latitude-docs-talk-tasks-reader-ook-4-1-1-news,
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.320]   book-reader, notebook-photos, or kit.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.600]   No, I get all of that, too.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.400]   I get all of that, too.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.400]   Where?
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.000]   Where?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.040]   It pulled up the Google page.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.080]   That's why.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:14.960]   That's the difference.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.640]   So it's not in the app you're saying?
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.920]   Yeah, that's the only thing.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.920]   It's like, if you--
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.040]   the irony to me of this is that Google didn't understand
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.360]   the power of its own brand.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.640]   And it services when it came to Android.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.160]   That's interesting.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.800]   I don't think they have a Google app.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.720]   Do they have an app on here?
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.240]   No, they don't.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.200]   No, because it's all kind of incorporated.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.520]   Yeah, it's about 10.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.600]   But we don't know where it all is.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.200]   Yeah, I mean, besides the widget, the search widget, which
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.240]   comes on the home screen.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.240]   I turned that off because it does the same functionality
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:46.960]   as far as I can tell.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.520]   It's just pressing the search.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.520]   As pressing the search, yeah, the magnifying glass.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.840]   And it takes up a lot of space.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.840]   Right.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.400]   Yeah, I mean, that's interesting.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.720]   I don't search news very much on my phone, I guess.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.920]   Yeah, Jeff's a more newsy kind of guy than you and me.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.280]   Yeah, he's a news guy.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.280]   He loves him.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.840]   He does the local search great, though.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.840]   I mean, it does.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.840]   No, it does.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.360]   And it does.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.200]   You're a problem of having-- since I'm doing my Android,
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.360]   my Nexus One thing is battery life has really sucked.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.560]   It takes some problems.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.600]   It takes some real management on the battery life.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.960]   For one thing, I don't know how Gina leaves her motion
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.840]   wallpapers on because that'll drain your battery in an hour.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.760]   I guess I don't stray far from home for very long.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.680]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.960]   One thing you have to know is that black uses less power
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.720]   than white on an OLED screen.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.720]   So if you have any interface that you can change to white
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.400]   on black versus black on white do,
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.680]   that'll hugely impact the power.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.200]   So I use--
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.360]   My university office has crappy reception.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.440]   Back to drain it.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.080]   When it's trying to look for the antenna,
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.080]   that really drains badly.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.840]   So another thing to do-- and I leave this widget on all the time.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.880]   And it usually is on, I think, by default.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.000]   Is this the wireless widget?
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.520]   You could disable some of these things.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.520]   So whenever I don't need Bluetooth, I'll disable that.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.000]   I'll turn off--
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.920]   But the thing I can't disable, which I want to disable--
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.880]   if I want Wi-Fi at my office, I want to disable the cell radio.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.240]   Oh, yeah, you can't--
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.360]   There's a way to do that.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   Well, yeah, you're right.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.080]   I guess you have to go to airport mode.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:13.920]   And then that's your--
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.320]   No, but then, you know, you got your Wi-Fi back on.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.880]   The only thing I'm told is you can tell it to go to 2G,
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.160]   but you think you want to be able to just turn off--
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.080]   That's a good point.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:23.880]   You can't--
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.640]   Yeah, that power control widget could use that.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.040]   It could be better.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.880]   It could be better.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.120]   Well, well, you know, this is all good input.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.680]   Let's hope that I've passed my return period, so I know.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.880]   You have.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.640]   Oh, so you're keeping it.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.560]   I'm going to blame you.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.040]   Jeff, I'll send you a check.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.520]   Your money gladly refunded by Leo if you don't.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.000]   If you don't come along.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.720]   Jeff, do you like the pull-down window shade?
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.520]   The notification--
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:50.880]   Yeah, I did that.
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.760]   I mean, I did that this week because of you guys.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.680]   I did go about four days before I got the plane
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:00.920]   to use the Android, use the Nexus 1 pre-consistently.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.280]   I like the notifications.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.640]   I think the notifications are one of the best features on here.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.920]   Yeah, it felt more comfortable.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.400]   It did.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.680]   So apparently, I'm told there is a widget that
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.280]   will turn off the cell radio.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.440]   I don't know if it must be a third-party widget.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.280]   Is that true?
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:15.960]   I haven't seen it.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.880]   Let me just see if it's in my widgets.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.440]   I think one of the things that I like about it--
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.680]   and you hit the nail on the head last week, Jeff, when you said,
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.760]   it's a phone for people like me and Gina who
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.120]   liked to geek around.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.560]   That was Gina's point, really.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.400]   Geeks was the sheep.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.760]   It's the cruel way she put it.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.520]   Me.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.000]   Me.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.200]   Well, for Geeks--
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.200]   It's really fantastic.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   I was baiting folks with that headline.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.800]   I think that's true, though.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.640]   But I said, "Andrew's for Geeks."
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.240]   It is for Geeks who want to take the time to really learn it
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.120]   and poke around, discover that kind of thing.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.040]   It doesn't have that instant groccability
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.080]   that I think the iPhone has.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.480]   You could make it, though.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.640]   I'll tell you what.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.000]   If I were going to give this to my mom,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.880]   I could set it up so it's identical to the iPhone
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.560]   with 16 icons on five pages, just the app she wanted,
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.120]   set the settings so she doesn't have to think.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.560]   You could make it like the iPhone.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.400]   The point is that you can get deeper than you can on the iPhone.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.040]   But I don't think you have to.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.640]   Well, the other problem is--
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.560]   this will change over time.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.960]   But I think you have to admit that the quality of the apps
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.760]   available is just simply better on the iPhone.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.840]   I would agree on that.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.120]   But--
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.840]   And I don't know when it's going to take over--
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.640]   I think we're very close to an inflection point.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.040]   I'm starting to see now more and more people do apps.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.040]   I just got this the guide, for instance,
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.680]   which was something I use on the iPhone
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.600]   and missed on Android.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.360]   It's out now.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.640]   Four squares out.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.600]   Gowalla is going to be out.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.640]   Every note is out.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.640]   Every note is out.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:43.720]   Well, it is.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.280]   Not good.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.440]   I think a lot of-- in fact, yesterday I
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.240]   haven't used the iPhone in about a week and a half.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.840]   And I turned on the iPhone just to see
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.600]   and look at the apps that I had on there and say,
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.640]   is there anything I really wish I had?
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.760]   But you could still go to the Mint website.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.800]   It's not the end of the world.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.600]   There's some weird ones like the Sonos,
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.920]   which I use this Sonos zone player, which is a speaker that
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.040]   uses Wi-Fi and has a wonderful remote for the iPhone,
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.000]   not available yet on Android.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.560]   Audible.com is the biggest one for me.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.880]   And I'll get the Audible reader on here.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.800]   Well, if anyone can get it on their U-Can app.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.320]   I'm pushing them.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.320]   They say they're going to have it before mid-year.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.680]   They are working on it.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.000]   But I think we're very rapidly getting to the point
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.800]   where there's a lot of quality applications.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.760]   There are now three very good and a new one.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.400]   Handmark's doing a new Twitter application.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.920]   Twitteroid has gotten, I think, very--
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.360]   what do you use for Twitter, Eugene?
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.280]   Are you using Csmic?
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.160]   Were you using Csmic?
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:39.960]   It's OK.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.120]   It's not as good as Tweety.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.480]   I think that Android really needs a good, awesome,
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.680]   incredible Twitter.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.760]   I'd revisit Twitter.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.360]   I'd revisit Twitteroid Pro.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.320]   I tried it.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.880]   I tried it, Leo, but I'm sticking with Csmic,
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.760]   and I can personally--
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.800]   Csmic is simpler, but Twitteroid Pro
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.360]   has all the functionality, in my opinion,
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.760]   of any of the iPhone apps.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.320]   How much effort does it take to port an app from iPhone
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.080]   to Android?
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.120]   Is it a complete just from scratch?
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.400]   It's a completely different-- it's
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.560]   a completely different development platform.
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.640]   Yeah, it's totally different.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.520]   From what I understand, I haven't done either iPhone
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.560]   or Android development, but it's a totally different thing.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.160]   Is Android Java or--
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.840]   Android is Java, yes.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.440]   Java.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.080]   Yeah, and iPhone is Objective-C?
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.240]   It's just like Mac development on the iPhone.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.040]   Right, right.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.480]   Yeah, so it's a totally different thing.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.640]   You can't reuse code or port code easily.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.840]   And I just think the APIs are different from what I understand.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.600]   On the other hand, most cell phone development
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.200]   was Java until the iPhone.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.520]   So there probably is a lot of stuff
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.280]   lying, code lying around that might be ported, just not
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.600]   from the iPhone, I don't know.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.920]   There's a great bunch of news apps.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.640]   Jeff, I have a whole page devoted to news.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.000]   I've got three news widgets here.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.080]   There's some good feeders.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.680]   I use feeder, F-E-D-R for feed reading.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.280]   And it's really great for that.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.640]   Thompson, believe it or not.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.840]   Thompson is really good.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.400]   Thompson writer is very--
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.360]   I think it's excellent.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.320]   And it has built-in delicious integration.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.000]   So this is something I couldn't do easily on the iPhone.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   I can actually share a story to delicious directly
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.520]   from the phone, as well as email, messaging, Twitter.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.000]   That's really slick.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.360]   So I've been very happy with the fact
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.600]   with the news situation on the iPhone.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.040]   And because the OLED screen's so good,
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.000]   I read a lot more news on the Nexus 1
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.240]   than I did on the iPhone.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.760]   I'm waiting for a Kindle app for the Android.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.080]   Yeah, there's another one that's whistling.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.480]   That's why I'd like to see for sure.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.480]   I need to.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.120]   Well, that gets us to another story.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.160]   Of course, Wednesday, Apple's going
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.200]   to announce the God tablet.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.880]   And if they don't, there will be tomatoes thrown.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.320]   If Steve Jobs had any guts, he'd do it from outside.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.880]   9.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.200]   I brought you the tablets.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.200]   He'd be cool if he came on stage with some big stone tablets.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.200]   He said, what do you mean?
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.200]   It was a big beer, Charles.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.160]   You just didn't have to be good.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.160]   This is the tablet of which I was speaking.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.560]   They better have a rotten tomato detector, though,
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.240]   as you go in, because I'll tell you,
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.880]   if they're not announcing a tablet,
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.280]   because this will upset everybody.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.120]   They'll be in uprising.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.680]   They'll be in uprising.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.440]   I'm going to be-- I did get an invite, so I will be there.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.080]   We're going to do, in fact, full day coverage of it.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.720]   Because I believe--
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.720]   What are you laughing at?
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.640]   Team coverage.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.240]   Team coverage.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.440]   I call this-- well, nobody else is going to do it,
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.080]   so I got to do it.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:35.560]   Oh, it's great.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.040]   It's great.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.480]   I call it our obsessive compulsory coverage
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.320]   of the iPhone, or the tablet, rather.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.320]   We're going to do it.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.560]   Start at 8.30 AM and continue coverage right
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.840]   through till 5 PM that day.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.440]   Because I'm of the opinion that there's a very--
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.920]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.280]   Well, if nothing comes out, if it's iPod socks again,
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.720]   then I'm in deep, deep trouble.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.640]   But then we'll have some good coverage on.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.480]   I'm really boring baseball.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.320]   That's not worse than that.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.720]   A boring baseball game where it's raining.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.880]   And the tall you see is the tarp and some sad people
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.880]   in the stands going--
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.880]   Hey, did you tell those guys worked so hard on them?
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.480]   You know?
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.840]   Socks.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.720]   They came out with socks.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.960]   Actually, I'll never forget going to Cupertino for us.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.080]   Steve Jobs' announcement.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:24.040]   And he announced iPod speakers and iPod socks.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.920]   And it was the most horrible feeling.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.160]   But you know what that-- in fact, they're still
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.200]   leaking stuff to the Times.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.400]   The journal today had yet another unnamed source
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.000]   from Deep Within Apple.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.800]   Saying, there's content deals, HarperCollins.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.320]   I believe New York Times.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.600]   I think television networks.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.200]   I think this is going to be a very interesting device.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.040]   And I think--
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.000]   That scares me a little bit.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.320]   I think with the New York Times going to its meat herd--
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.600]   lovely Rita meter maid this week,
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.160]   I'm afraid that we have media people thinking this
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.120]   is a great salvation.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.040]   It is indeed the coming of the Messiah.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.440]   And I think there's a lot of skewed thinking going on in media.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:03.960]   Oh, that was good.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.480]   That was good.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.080]   Yeah, Steve with the tablets, by the way.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.080]   That's good.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.760]   That's a good one.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.440]   You know, I fear these content deals.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.520]   And we say, OK, well, Jobs understands us.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.360]   And he saved part of the music industry.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.520]   And he'll save newspapers and magazines now.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.880]   Well, well--
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.120]   I'm sure Steve would like them to believe that
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.880]   as he makes these deals.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.800]   But I think people wised up because the record industry
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.480]   made the deal with Apple when they--
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.160]   oh, iTunes.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.120]   How hard could that-- how much trouble could that cause us?
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.760]   And I think everybody's gone, oh, we
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.640]   don't want to be the next record industry.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.440]   But what choice do they have, Jeff?
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.720]   Oh, none.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.920]   Well, yeah, they have a choice.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.960]   My argument is that in media now,
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.040]   content is a magnet that causes relationships.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.520]   And you have to get the value of the relationship.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.600]   And the idea of just selling content
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.840]   doesn't work anymore.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.560]   Sorry.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.240]   And the cost of content with things like demand media
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.120]   is going down to nil.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.800]   So the content business just ate what it was.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.320]   Folks, sorry.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.160]   Don't you, though--
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.320]   admittedly, it's not a savior.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.480]   But don't you, though, look at a new channel.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.040]   I mean, this is what Apple-- this is-- I'm sure the offer
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.640]   that Apple is proffering to these companies.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.000]   We can save you by providing a new channel that
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.760]   allows engagement, is easier to use, costs you less.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.720]   There's no dead trees involved.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.040]   We've got a monetization strategy.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:29.480]   We've got--
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.440]   It's called the web.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.680]   Well, but iTunes-- you could say, yeah.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.840]   But look, iTunes transcends the web and controls the channel.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.640]   And people do not buy music.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.280]   I guess they do.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.160]   They go to Amazon.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.440]   But iTunes still is totally dominant in that sphere.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.840]   And it's not exactly the web.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.160]   It's to the internet.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:49.840]   It's the internet.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.340]   Right.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.000]   But it's because the iPod became a must-have--
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.840]   Well, that's the--
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.520]   That's the offer.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.200]   That's the offer, is we are making the next--
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.200]   we're making the iPod for content.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.400]   Are you going to carry a device just to read?
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.160]   You carry a device to listen, but actually,
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.640]   that device is not your phone, which you also use to read.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.320]   So it's a big--
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.880]   It's a big device to carry around, probably
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.320]   a very fragile device.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.840]   I don't know if it's portable.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.760]   I think that--
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.240]   I read my iPhone.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.840]   I read-- there are times my iPhone.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.000]   I read books on the iPhone.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.680]   Well, I think Apple's content to have you do that.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.960]   And a slate may be in the living room
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.440]   where it replaces a TV, perhaps.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.760]   How big is that going to be?
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.760]   What's going to be--
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.920]   And are we in a beta-next world where, well, you can read
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.040]   The New York Times and your slate,
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.720]   but you can't on your computer?
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.520]   That'd be absurd.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.480]   What's going to do that?
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.200]   You don't think the Times will do that?
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.440]   Well, I don't know what the Times is going to do these days.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.800]   But that's playing to a very small, very limited
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:46.360]   audience.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.440]   It's very risky.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.000]   It's risky.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.400]   I lost--
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.280]   And don't forget, the Times made big, big deal out
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.240]   of its Times reader on the web with Microsoft.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.840]   And I made-- I was consulting for them at the time
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.240]   at about.com, and I made fun of it,
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.160]   and I got in trouble for it.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.520]   Well, so what?
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:10.520]   I got a reference to a reference to a reference to a message.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.880]   I said, "Babe, you didn't want to say that."
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.400]   Well, sorry.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.000]   That's what I say.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.840]   I'm going to say what I say.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.840]   It didn't take off the world.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.040]   The problem with this whole notion of the tablet
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.040]   is it's editors thinking that it's
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.960]   going to let them regain their control of experience.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.240]   And the lake has already broke--
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:26.880]   It's too late.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.880]   Too late for that.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.880]   Too late.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.480]   No, you're right.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.240]   If that's what their hope is, that's not going to happen.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.680]   And I don't think Apple can offer that.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.840]   All they can offer is another channel, but not more control.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:43.840]   So the question then is, OK, you're still going to get--
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.240]   I don't think anybody-- it would be
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.640]   foolish to close off the internet.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.800]   But would it be bad to have the internet end?
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:54.000]   Something where they could control it better, control
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.520]   the experience?
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.080]   But why?
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.680]   The link is a wonderful thing.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.200]   I don't--
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.920]   Well, you like the link, but what about--
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:04.760]   OK, but Leo, the iPod did not lead to us.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.520]   We can buy an album on it, but it didn't strengthen
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.400]   the stature of the album, the packaged music.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.360]   No, it killed it.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.200]   No, it killed it.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.200]   Yeah, it's single.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.320]   Same here.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.440]   It's even worse because you don't link from song to song.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.600]   I see what you're saying.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.000]   But you do link from article to article or piece to piece.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.080]   And that kills the packaged experience.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.880]   Well, if-- is the packaged experience all that they want?
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.280]   I mean, they cannot-- they live on an article by article
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:33.800]   experience.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.320]   Does that not work for them?
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.360]   Well, the Times is going to go to the--
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.640]   well, they read a meter made.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.240]   That's not going to work.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.120]   No.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.000]   So what the idea is, you hit somebody's articles
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.680]   in a month, then you get hit.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.160]   And why are you even about that?
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.160]   Some people criticize me, but I said that it's
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.920]   caulk-eyed economics because they're
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.360]   charging their best customer.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.960]   And the internet is in relation to the opposite.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.080]   I have your relationship.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.480]   Yeah, yeah, you're right.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.880]   The more they read, the more it costs,
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.480]   that's not what you want to do.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.160]   No.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.200]   So the people that work on--
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.640]   That's a scarcity of resource model.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.120]   It's a completely inappropriate model
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.240]   for an unscarse resource.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.520]   Can you go talk to them, Leo?
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.520]   That's treating it as if it's printed on dead trees.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.600]   Oh, it's costing us more.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.400]   No, it's not.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.200]   But then what do you do?
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.720]   You charge the guy who reads only one article,
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.080]   and then if you read five, you don't get--
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:21.640]   What do you do?
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.200]   You make your job to try to get the best relationships you can.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.040]   I hear in Munich, I walked today by--
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.520]   I was with Baratunde Thurston.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.120]   I'll tell you about that.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.040]   I love Baratunde.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.240]   We tried the end line today.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.680]   Yeah, we asked him to be on Twitter, and he said,
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:32.880]   I can't.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.440]   I'm on Munich.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.360]   I said, oh, I know.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:34.880]   I know.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.880]   I know where he is.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.380]   Yeah.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.240]   So we went out-- we had lunch today,
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.680]   and he'd never been in Germany before, so I said, you want to do it?
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.360]   You want to do the versed thing?
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.440]   So we went to a versed restaurant and sat down,
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.080]   and he had vice-versed, the white versed,
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.360]   and he ordered-- I know.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.440]   I don't like it as much.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.080]   I had the northern burger versed.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.200]   And he ordered a sauerkraut salad.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:55.760]   Fun.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.440]   You know what?
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.880]   And potatoes.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.200]   And the Germans-- they were sitting at group tables.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.120]   The Germans looked at him.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.160]   What he was eating, he laughed.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.480]   Father, they explained to Baratunde
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.000]   that he, that altogether, would be like an Italian
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.640]   putting chocolate sauce on pasta.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.280]   Sorry, I forget where I was going.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.720]   I don't know, but I like it.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.480]   Now you may be very hungry.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.800]   And I don't think chocolate sauce sounds so bad on pasta,
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.560]   so they're--
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.560]   --which was the chocolate sauce and which was the pasta.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.000]   Anyway, it sounds like fun.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.560]   Give a baratunde in my regards.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.560]   Instead of saying a little bit.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.800]   So the publishers, I think, is the pitch for Apple.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.760]   And not just publishers of printed content,
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.560]   but television and networks and music.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.760]   And I think that the argument from their point of view
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.240]   is, look, we're creating a new channel.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.080]   You want to hop on before the train leaves the station.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:59.160]   And I think these guys are going to jump.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.920]   What do you think the sales could possibly be of a tablet?
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.160]   Well, that's the question.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.400]   And by the way, this has got to be an expensive device.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.720]   It can't be cheap.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.240]   On the last--
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.640]   It's an addition to your phone, a smartphone,
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.760]   and to your laptop.
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.760]   What does the tablet really bring?
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.880]   Gina, you lost your devices.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.920]   Or you lost your net for this?
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.000]   You know what?
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.360]   I mean, I have a netbook.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.200]   I have a Kindle.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.000]   I have my phone.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.280]   I don't know.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.640]   I'm still not clear about what the target audience is,
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.600]   what I'm going to do with this thing.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.480]   So I'm going to keep this thing in my living room and watch it
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.440]   instead of my TV.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.760]   Can I hook it up to my TV?
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.160]   Is this just going to be like, I can get shows on it?
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.000]   I don't know.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.560]   Let me give you my prediction and see
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.040]   if this would make it more compelling.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.760]   What if it had Kindle-style free wireless,
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.680]   subsidized wireless effectively?
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.240]   So you never have to hook it up to a computer.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.200]   It just gets shows.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.320]   There's a $15 a month subscription
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.960]   to the top five shows on all the networks.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.520]   So it's kind of your television subscription device.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.720]   Yes, it hooks up to your TV.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.240]   It's like an Apple TV in that sense.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.280]   You can quickly hook it up to your TV or not.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.680]   Or you can carry it with you.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.200]   You might watch it in bed because it's
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.840]   going to be a 720p, very gorgeous, small,
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.280]   but very gorgeous screen.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.000]   Big enough, I think, to watch it in bed, watch it in the kitchen.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.440]   It's a reader, so your newspaper will also be on that.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.800]   Your magazines will be on that.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:16.720]   In a form, a UI that only Apple can design
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.480]   that would make it as appealing as a paper.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.880]   I think this is part of the problem
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.680]   the newspapers have to solve is what the times it's
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.840]   trying to solve with its application for Windows
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.640]   and its error application was, how do you
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.480]   make an electronic reading experience comparable
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.720]   to the paper experience?
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.680]   Everybody loves the paper.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.800]   You can scan it.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.680]   You can turn the page.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.440]   So if Apple can solve that, maybe give you
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:42.440]   something that is as usable as a newspaper,
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.560]   I think that's not a bad device, especially
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.800]   if the cost of the content subsidizes the cost of the device
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.160]   in the wireless.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.960]   Yeah, but if you have a browser on it?
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.960]   No, you don't have a browser on it.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.720]   You don't have a browser on it.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.640]   Don't forget it.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.640]   You might.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.240]   I think this is not aimed at people who use browsers.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.560]   Who's that, Leo?
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.720]   I think it's a crossover device.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.320]   I think it's a device aimed at people
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.040]   who don't have a computer.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:11.960]   Oh, how many--
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.680]   No, really, serious.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.800]   Yeah, maybe you're right.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.200]   Maybe that's a full-time idea.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.200]   Yeah, she has a computer.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.800]   Everybody has a computer.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.360]   So is this like the Chrome OS play,
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.440]   like the second computer, the secondary?
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.720]   Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.520]   But I think--
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.600]   Yeah, maybe it has a browser.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.160]   But the browser experience--
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.600]   Yeah, the browser-- he doesn't kill it
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.920]   because a browser experience is not
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.280]   going to be as good as a custom design interface for content.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.120]   You've all seen the video that Sports Illustrated did.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.440]   And the argument against that is that they could do that today
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.280]   on the web.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.280]   Right.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.560]   Well, in fact, look at these HTML5 examples.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.200]   We're now seeing not just from YouTube, but other companies.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:56.400]   Just look-- they look great, and they work in a browser.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.880]   So maybe you're right.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.760]   I mean, I'm not excited about the tablet.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.760]   I'm probably not going to buy one unless Apple absolutely
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:04.920]   blows me away with the UI.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.360]   I mean, this is the thing that I'm most excited about.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.360]   It's going to be a UI.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.360]   What are they going to do?
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.360]   It's got to be a UI.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.720]   Apple's UI, regardless of what a Google fan girl am,
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.920]   Apple makes does some incredible work in terms of interface.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.680]   So that's what I'm excited to see.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.080]   But yeah, I'm not like jonesing for a tablet.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.640]   I have an netbook.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.600]   So I don't know.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.400]   Maybe I'll change my mind.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.040]   Hopefully, maybe it'll change my mind.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:29.880]   I think they're going for the netbook crowd.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.960]   Problem is, the netbook-- one of the reasons the netbook succeeds
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.680]   is because it's 300 bucks.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.760]   And there's no way this is $300.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.720]   And it has a keyboard.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.800]   And it has a keyboard.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.600]   That's the thing.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.920]   I mean, am I going to type on this tablet?
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.800]   I think the bet Apple's making-- again,
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.040]   this is all tea leaf reading or criminology.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.400]   But I think the bet Apple's making
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.720]   is that the keyboard's necessary for content creation.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.720]   This is a content consumption device.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.240]   Right.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.600]   There's the heart of it.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.760]   We are all content creators now.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.200]   Not necessarily the whole world, but whatever we do,
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:02.440]   whether it's email or a video or a tweet or whatever,
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.920]   look at the frustration we all have had with the virtual keyboards
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:06.520]   on our phones.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.400]   Right.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.000]   And many times, I will think of something
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.080]   I want to tell somebody, and I wait until I get to my computer
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.000]   to do it.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.200]   Yeah, me too.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.160]   We are all content creators now.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:19.880]   That's the problem.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.800]   There is no such thing, I think, for anybody
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.960]   is content consumption.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.800]   The problem is that you add the browser,
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.000]   you add the keyboard, suddenly you've got a laptop.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.120]   And we already have that.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.600]   So I guess that's your contention, Jeff,
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.760]   is that there's no market for this because we already
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:36.800]   all have laptops.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.320]   And this is an imaginary market.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.480]   Well, that's where Google is seeing the world, obviously,
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.080]   that it's voice control.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:44.640]   Right.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.000]   When you get to voice control, then it
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.360]   obviates the need for the keyboard.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.960]   I picked up a magazine at the airport.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.040]   I forget which one it was.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.480]   I can't get the credit.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:59.800]   Are arguing that hand writing is dead.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.760]   There's no such thing as how to write anymore.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.720]   And I agree with that because I have the world's worst hand
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.520]   writing.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.920]   And my kids had to take keyboard early in life as a result.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.280]   Well, is there a point at which the keyboard dies?
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.280]   If the keyboard dies, then yes, the tablet makes sense,
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.720]   except for the pocket problem with the size of it.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.800]   And we're not there yet, though.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.760]   Is that Apple's huge?
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.960]   Remember back ladies and gentlemen to the new--
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:31.880]   And the first tablet, Gary Trudeau,
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:32.880]   and making fun of the new--
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.440]   It's a requirement.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.440]   Right.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.120]   And the notion of taking hand writing onto the computer
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.920]   is never going to work.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.600]   So will audio input work?
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.040]   Well, we're not there yet.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.840]   Maybe, maybe someday.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.720]   And who's going to be the better shots to do that?
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.440]   Google or Apple?
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.520]   Google has more samples.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.560]   Yeah, Google can own speech.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.080]   I think so.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:55.880]   I think Google already does.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.040]   I use the voice.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.160]   I think to me that's the killer kind of hidden feature
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:05.160]   in 2.1 and Android 2.1 and the Nexus is this speech everywhere.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.600]   Of course, Leo, you are a radio person who
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.280]   are very easy to understand.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:09.800]   It's true.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.960]   I speak most of the best.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:16.520]   No, I think you do speak carefully and say things like that.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.480]   But it works if you do that.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.120]   I've been dictating emails and mostly text messages very
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.040]   effectively.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.520]   But you have to enunciate.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:30.840]   The phone trains you because it doesn't work until you do it.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.080]   My teachers and parents tried it as you can tell.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:39.920]   So what about the contention that Google's position in China
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.840]   now is far more risky than it realized?
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.200]   That Eric Schmidt might have been right that this is a mistake
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:52.560]   to the point that these two handsets that we're going to be
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.960]   announced in China, two Android-based handsets from Samsung
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.520]   and Motorola, are now delayed.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.120]   And the contention that you don't mess with the phone
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:00.880]   industry like that.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:06.640]   These guys do not take kindly to delays in their handsets.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:13.800]   And this could be disaster for Android going forward.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.360]   Well, the irony here is that the question I saw asked today
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.520]   is, well, people are trying to buy Android phones without Google.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.800]   Maybe it'll just have Bing on it.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.000]   And as Sony Erickson says, they're going ahead anyway.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.680]   I don't know how they get to in Motorola and Samsung do not.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.720]   But this is a--
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:34.720]   I'm sure that Google's smart enough to have had this
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.480]   conversation of looking at the consequences.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.960]   They may have made a braver decision than even we realized.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.240]   Android is so customizable.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.600]   I feel like that they're going to be able to get around this.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.560]   But even if they have to change the default search engine to
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.640]   banger, buy do, or whatever, I don't know.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.880]   I think that they're going to figure out a way to get around
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.320]   it and to release the phone.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:59.000]   I can tell you back what Gina and Siva said last week up
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.920]   here that this was about Google protecting the cloud.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.280]   Yeah, makes a lot of sense.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.800]   But now, so you're saying--
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.760]   so will Google pull out?
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.760]   I guess is the first question.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:14.120]   Sounds?
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.880]   I was taught years ago a negotiation.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.720]   If you threaten someone and don't do it, then you're new.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.560]   You have to.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.720]   And China has, in a way--
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.480]   I mean, admittedly, a low-level official.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.440]   But China has said it in a way.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.360]   Screw you, Google.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.000]   So now, Google's move.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.840]   Yeah, and Google in a sense pulls out in a sense
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:34.080]   that anyone can find Google.com through mechanisms
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.000]   that's been talked about.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.920]   The problem is, they won't get the advertising revenue, but
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.920]   advertising is hard to sell in China.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.480]   Right.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.840]   So maybe they're not losing that much.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.600]   You think that it's not a big deal.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.600]   Wow.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.800]   Yeah, but how is this going to go down?
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.560]   I mean, isn't Google just going to show uncensored results
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.880]   and then China blocks it?
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.360]   No, no.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.960]   I think that what they said was that they're not--
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:54.240]   No, they shut down.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.080]   Yeah, they're going to--
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:55.720]   Well, that's the end.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.640]   They try to get the law changed.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.560]   If the law doesn't change, then they
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.720]   have to shut down because they're not
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.640]   going to break the law.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:05.640]   Steve Baumer at a conference on Thursday in Houston
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.720]   called Google's decision in a rational business decision.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:12.080]   He threw one of the busts that he went forward and back
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.480]   and forwards back.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.720]   According to Forbes, Baumer suggested that Google's decision
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.360]   to no longer filter out internet searches
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.280]   objectionable to the Chinese government was an irrational
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.040]   business decision.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:26.000]   After all, Baumer said, the US imports oil from Saudi Arabia,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.680]   despite the censorship that goes on there.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.160]   Quote, "The US is the most extreme when it comes to free
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.400]   speech," said Baumer, noting however that even the US
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.000]   bans child pornography while France bans internet access
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.680]   to Nazi imagery.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.320]   Interesting.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.080]   Steve has never held back from the opportunity
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:50.600]   to slime a competitor.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.280]   And it's never really been--
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:56.080]   I mean, come on, it's just Baumer.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.080]   There's no criminology when it comes to Baumer,
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.280]   which is what you get.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:06.240]   There was a link I didn't put up on the feed I'm trying to find
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:06.720]   right now.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.800]   I'll fail, but maybe Google operates
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.200]   as to the looked at Google's censorship of things
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.840]   country by country.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.640]   And it does raise a good point.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:20.760]   There's the Nazi stuff in France, and there's a Scientology
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:21.600]   stuff in the US.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.560]   And eBay and Yahoo and everybody go along with the Nazi
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:25.280]   filtering.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.800]   Right.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.200]   But I'm going to miss it.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:28.880]   Oh, here it is.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.720]   Yeah, it's a little waterproof.
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.080]   So in Google France, Erie in '88 is out.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.120]   In the US, zenu.net, which is Scientology.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:40.080]   In Australia, the Aboriginal and
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.080]   secular pediatric--
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.080]   Wait a minute, mind it.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.080]   Google filters out zenu.net results in the US.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:47.840]   It says here on blogoscope.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.040]   Let me see here.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.080]   Scientology sent Google a letter that complained about a
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.240]   particular page as part of the Digital and Millennium
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.600]   Copyright Act because it took what they said.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.760]   Scientology say was their own copyright and works.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.120]   So Google said over--
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:05.960]   They didn't say that.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:11.920]   So the point is they're following local law in Germany
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.320]   about the Holocaust, in certain news.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:18.440]   The Holocaust, the Holocaust lives, is filtered.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:23.120]   So I guess that's what I was saying is you can't tell us
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.560]   what culturally we don't want to publish.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.080]   You do it.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.840]   Why can't we do it?
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.040]   Right.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.760]   Like we said, this isn't just about free speech.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.760]   This is about the fact that they were being attacked.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.080]   And I think that Google couldn't deal with the fact that
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.560]   they were upon--
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.960]   that information stored in their servers that they were
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.640]   getting-- the hackers were getting access to.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.160]   The fact that they were available--
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:49.600]   that the hackers could get information about these
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.280]   people through Google services because they're
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.560]   available in China.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.480]   Does that make sense?
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.560]   I didn't explain that well.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.360]   But this is not about free speech.
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.920]   This is about the attacks.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.280]   That makes sense.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.600]   Yes.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.320]   So do you think, then, Gina, that was a mistake to raise
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.280]   censorship?
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.640]   Part of the argument has been that this gave Google
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.760]   its virtue points back.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.800]   But are you saying that that muddied the waters,
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.960]   that this was instead if they'd stuck with the cloud
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.880]   defense, they'd be better off?
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:24.960]   I mean, I think it's fine that they--
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.600]   I think the way that they handled it was fine.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.400]   I feel like they were really-- they were clear about the
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.720]   fact, like we compromised up to a point.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:35.440]   And then they did this surveillance.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.440]   There were these attacks.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:39.600]   And we can't stand to both compromise and deal with this
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.040]   kind of--
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.760]   the attacks at the same time.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.640]   So now we're not willing to compromise anymore.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.240]   I think it was fine that they brought it up that way.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.800]   But obviously, it's not a free speech.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.760]   I mean, if they felt that way, they would have done this
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.920]   five years ago.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.840]   It was definitely the attacks.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.480]   And for a bomber to make these statements when internet
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.200]   explorer had one of the biggest--
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.160]   I mean, Google didn't give them a favor.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.760]   It was IE's fault.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.800]   Yeah, I mean, really.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.640]   Add business decision.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.640]   No kidding.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.080]   Ever.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.560]   That's a very good point.
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.720]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.000]   Maybe if you would make your software more secure, we
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.040]   wouldn't have this problem.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.600]   We wouldn't have this problem, exactly.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.240]   I saw it on the link today in my search.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.440]   Again, I didn't call it a front feed.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.040]   But it said, you should update your internet explorer this
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.440]   way that way or just get rid of it.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.800]   I do recommend just get rid of it.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.400]   Just throw it out.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.840]   Well, that's what France and Germany said.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.040]   They said, you cannot use it.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.000]   Microsoft did patch that on Thursday, by the way.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.560]   That bug anyway was fixed.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.320]   You're listening to this week in Google.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.680]   Jeff Jarvis is here for you.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.960]   He's in Munich right now for the Bilderberg conference.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.560]   The GLD conference at Werta.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.680]   OK, got the name wrong.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.120]   But what the hell?
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.360]   Bilderberg sounds nice though.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:53.440]   It sounds like--
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.640]   That's another one, I think.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.680]   We can put together tweets.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:56.440]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.240]   I like that.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.240]   Jeff Falmer will start that next week.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:04.080]   And he's off to Davost next week, which will be fun.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:09.480]   Gina Tarpani also here with her submarine crushed cup.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:10.840]   And we're going to have more in just a bit.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.560]   But I want to mention my friends at Go to Meeting from Citrix.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:18.160]   Go to Meeting uses Citrix's top of the line remote access
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.800]   to make it easier for you to meet.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.320]   See, Jeff could have just stayed here
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:23.000]   and gone to the conference using Go to Meeting,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.720]   save himself thousands of dollars in airfare.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.400]   And been more effective.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.920]   We all have phone calls that we're on.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.680]   We wish we could show the person something,
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.120]   whether it's the PowerPoint presentation or the spreadsheet
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.440]   or the website or maybe collaborate on a document together.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.480]   And this is what Go to Meeting makes so easy to do.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.480]   You install it right now.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.920]   If I can install it for free by going to go to meeting.com/twig,
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.560]   g-o-t-o meeting.com/twig.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.400]   Take a minute.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.400]   Before I'm done, you'll have it installed and running.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.840]   Then, the next time you're on the phone, you say,
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:54.600]   "Here's what you do.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.600]   I want to show you this.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.600]   Go to Go to Meeting."
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.440]   And let me show you.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.440]   They go to Go to Meeting and boom,
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.440]   suddenly they're seeing your computer on their screen.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.240]   And you could share documents with them.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.840]   They can take control and they can show you something
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.200]   you could train.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:08.880]   It's incredible.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.440]   For sales presentations, product demos, training sessions,
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.760]   we use it here for collaboration.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.920]   We use it on Maxwell's house.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:19.000]   Ray can show us his illustrations, his screenshots.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:19.840]   It works.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:21.240]   It's in real time.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.440]   It's fast.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.280]   I think you're going to love it.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.120]   I want you to try it free.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.920]   Go to meeting.com/twig.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.000]   Save some time.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:28.720]   Save some money.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:29.560]   Same travel.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.600]   All that stress of travel.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.480]   Just use Go to Meeting.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.200]   Go to meeting.com/twig.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:39.400]   We thanks Citrix so much for supporting our show this week
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.240]   in Google.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:46.600]   Let's see, Google Voice Extension for Chrome.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.480]   That's interesting.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.040]   Gina Trapone, is that going to be your tip?
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.720]   I don't want to steal your tip ahead of time.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:53.160]   It's not going to be my tip, but it is super cool.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.920]   If you're using Chrome and Voice,
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.920]   definitely install this extension.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.120]   Put a little button on the top on your address bar
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.360]   or your status bar.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.360]   I'm not actually sure what that's called in Chrome.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.800]   It's called the Chrome in Firefox.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.800]   That's the thing.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.760]   Yeah, it's the Chrome in Chrome.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.080]   It's the Chrome in Chrome.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.200]   But it could be notifications when you have new messages.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.800]   You can initiate calls and text messages
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.240]   right from that one button.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:20.480]   It could be pretty sweet extension for Chrome.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.480]   I have to say, to me, that's the best reason
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.720]   to use an Android device.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:27.320]   It's just the integration with Google Voice is so wonderful.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.600]   Integration is fantastic.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.760]   Man, I don't use T-Mobile's voicemail at all.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.880]   It all just is basically visual voicemail
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:36.480]   with transcription from Google Voice.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:38.240]   Now somebody sent me a note saying, oh,
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.640]   you've got to stop plugging Google Voice.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.560]   I can't get it.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.240]   But I think they're sending out invitations now.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.320]   If you ask, if you go to voice.google.com
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.920]   and ask for an invitation, people are,
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.760]   apparently, getting them within a day or two.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   And of course, once you get a Google Voice account,
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.840]   you have invitations, too.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.520]   Yes.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.840]   And I love the idea that this is my one number.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:55.840]   I'll never have another number.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.680]   And everybody can call that number.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.680]   When I switch phones, it makes it so much easier.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.080]   Love Google Voice.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:03.600]   Yeah, it's fantastic when you get our new phone, for sure.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.120]   Like Google Voice fan.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.440]   There's people in the chat coming in, offering their invites.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:09.800]   OK.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.520]   Wasn't there a service once where you can do that,
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.720]   where you can start to create a market and invites?
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:14.220]   Yeah.
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:14.960]   I think it's still around.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.960]   But I can't remember the name.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.280]   There was a website where you would go and you would trade.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:19.920]   Yeah, a market.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.760]   It was such a cool idea.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:23.240]   Let me see.
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:28.360]   What other stories-- oh, France is getting involved.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:33.840]   Good old France is getting involved in digitizing books.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.080]   And even making noises about perhaps
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.560]   doing it in cooperation with Google,
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.480]   because, gosh, it is a big job.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.400]   It is a big job.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.360]   In fact, they're only doing 300,000 books.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:45.360]   Google's done millions.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.760]   France, though, has committed a significant amount of money,
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.040]   750 million euros, about a billion dollars,
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.200]   to digitize its libraries and museums.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.640]   And I think that's to be commended.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.040]   But Google's got 10 million books.
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.800]   They're going to take three years,
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.240]   and they're going to get 300,000 books.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.640]   So they do need some help.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.600]   Wasn't France one of the chief complainers
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.360]   about the Google book deal?
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:08.880]   They didn't want--
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.680]   You could have just stopped at the working players.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:13.760]   President Nicholas Sarkozy--
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.360]   I was going to get him trouble.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.040]   I love France.
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.040]   I'm a Franco file.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.760]   My daughter lived there for a year.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.960]   I go back there whenever I can.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.440]   But you're not far off.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:26.880]   Nicholas Sarkozy vowed France will not let itself
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.880]   be stripped of its literary treasures.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.960]   He says, in fact, he's criticized the library in Lyon
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.760]   for signing a Faustian pact to digitize books with Google.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.200]   So I'm glad they're doing it.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:47.480]   Look, this is absolutely the thing to do.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:48.320]   Digitize the stuff.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.520]   The problem is we have to come up with a standard
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.840]   so that everything is interoperable.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:53.680]   Nobody owns it.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.880]   And that's that whole point.
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:55.720]   It's the answer.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.680]   I mean, the problem was no one was doing it.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.120]   So Google stepped into the void,
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.400]   and then it got in trouble because it went too far.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.720]   But no one was doing it.
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:03.600]   Right.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.520]   But if them doing it motivates people to start doing it,
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.760]   then great.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.360]   What is the status for the Google deal?
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:14.560]   I mean, I know that the parties talking,
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:15.680]   are they all back at the table?
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.720]   I know that the original agreement is moot now.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:22.680]   Yeah, I can't-- oh, God, I'm forgetting
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.240]   that there was some shift to put it off by some time now,
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.120]   just because I can't remember what it was.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.840]   But knowing Google, they're still digitizing, right?
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:30.800]   They didn't stop.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.760]   You know, I don't know.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.400]   They do have agreements enforced with universities.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.120]   They certainly can do any books that are out of copyright.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.000]   Right.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.280]   It's the stuffing copyright, and who owns that and how--
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.160]   It's really the Orfeh and then.
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.160]   They were doing deals with you if they knew who you were.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.200]   It's really the Orphan Works, which is, again,
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.280]   a fairly tiny proportion of all this.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.440]   Right.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:53.960]   So there was a story in the New York Times today
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.880]   that among the top sellers on the Kindle
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.840]   are books that are free, the top downloads, right?
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:50:59.840]   Really?
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.640]   And so it had a young woman who wrote a book,
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.760]   and if you want to get published in a big way
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.240]   and get noticed, just put it on the Kindle for free,
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.760]   and you have a good shot at doing that.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:12.160]   And Chris Anderson, author of free, linked to that,
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:17.920]   argued that it was a substantiation of his model.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.200]   And so it makes you wonder that you get to the--
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:24.320]   Of course, the book is by definition digitized.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.880]   But the idea that there's going to be Orphan Works going
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.160]   forward in any way is kind of limited.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.000]   Again, go back to the earlier discussion.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.680]   We're all creators, and we now all have links to ourselves.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.680]   I think unless you have a story that we haven't gotten to,
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:43.680]   I think it's time to move on to our tip tool and number.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:47.280]   Any other stories going once, going twice?
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.160]   I was interested that I just saw before we got on that Google
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:54.640]   is adding-- if you search for, let's say, a museum
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.800]   and put in hours or a restaurant and put in menu
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.760]   in the search bar, they say they're
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.760]   going to come back and give you those results directly.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.800]   I couldn't get it to work.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.320]   That was my tip.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:05.840]   Oh, sorry.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:06.640]   I'll tell you what I'm--
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:07.640]   That's OK.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.140]   Stop.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:08.640]   You got it.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:09.640]   Don't work.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.800]   Zip it.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:11.360]   And that's OK.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.360]   I have others.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.480]   But yeah, we need to talk about that.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:16.880]   We need to use the Nexus 1 censorship.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.600]   Did you notice that, by the way, that when you say the F word,
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.720]   for instance, in the Nexus 1, to the dictation,
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.880]   it gives you hash, hash, hash, hash.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:24.880]   No, I did it.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.080]   That's so funny.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:28.120]   I'm trying to text somebody, F you.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.960]   And it goes, and you can't.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.120]   I haven't tried that yet.
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:35.480]   But what it tells me is that they're recognizing it just fine.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:37.800]   They just don't want to type it.
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.320]   Apparently very prudish.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:39.880]   Yeah, apparently.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.680]   I think it's just for you, Leo, because it knows you're
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.440]   an old radio guy.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.240]   Oh, maybe that's it.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.560]   It doesn't want to give me trouble with the FCC.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.240]   According to Google, we filter potentially offensive
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.680]   or inappropriate results because we
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:56.000]   want to avoid situations whereby we might misrecognize a spoken
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.520]   query and return profanity.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:52:59.760]   That makes sense.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.040]   Yeah, that sounds.
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:06.440]   So if you said fudge, and it comes back with the other F word,
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:06.760]   you would--
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.960]   Ramma, I love your fudge.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:12.320]   Now I'm thinking about it.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:15.400]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.760]   I just thought it was funny.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.640]   In fact, I said it as it is.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.240]   I thought, well, they'll know what I'm talking about.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.160]   Leo, I know you're going to talk about multi-touch,
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.280]   the multi-touch browser in a minute.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.680]   I'm not going to steal your thunder.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:30.840]   But another way to get multi-touch, the hard way
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.560]   to get multi-touch, you can now root your phone
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.200]   and install a ROM with multi-touch
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:38.880]   that will add multi-touch to the browser and the Nexus 1.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.200]   And I haven't done it because Jeff has gotten to me
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.600]   and I'm committed to being just a regular user.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:46.080]   It doesn't root my phone.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:50.000]   But the instructions are on the front feed.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   Yeah, and of course you have it on smarterware.org also.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.680]   But I would be less hesitant to root my phone
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:00.920]   if I thought there were an easy way to restore it.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.280]   I don't mind jailbreaking the iPhone
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.640]   because iTunes has a built-in restore
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.600]   and all you have to do is run that
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.720]   and you're back to the way you were
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.040]   unless you modified the radio or something.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:13.200]   But it looks like the only way to restore the Nexus 1
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.760]   is to use somebody's ROM that's posted on the internet
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.360]   and reflash it.
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:19.920]   Yeah, reflash it.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.760]   And that makes me--
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.520]   So there's a way to save a restore image.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.000]   And that's interesting.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.280]   So I rooted my G1.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.000]   And at that time, there was a way to save the current data
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.240]   your phone.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.760]   But that might not be the case anymore.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:37.560]   Yeah, I'm just kind of holding out.
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:39.640]   There are a couple of good reasons to root, right?
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:41.600]   There's tethering.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.680]   But you can do that with PDA net without tethering.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.200]   I did that.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.880]   Now there's multi-touch.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:48.240]   But there are more apps coming out now with multi-touch.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.400]   So maybe you don't have to root for that.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.760]   I was really tempted.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:55.360]   But then I thought, who knows what the quality of these ZLLs are?
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.560]   And the one thing I don't want to do
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.920]   is have an unreliable phone.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.320]   And when I jail broke the iPhone,
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:02.920]   it did really impact reliability.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.560]   So partly that's because I have to review this.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:07.200]   And I have to give people--
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:08.920]   I can't tell them what it's like to have a rooted one.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.240]   I have to tell them what it's like to have an unrooted one.
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.240]   Stop the phone.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.240]   But also, I'm just nervous.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:16.320]   If I could restore it, I'd be much less hesitant.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.240]   But also, I don't feel like you could buy--
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.320]   I spent 30 bucks.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.240]   But I bought PDA net.
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.480]   I don't mind that.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:23.720]   Far preferable to rooting it.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.400]   And I will say, before we got on tonight,
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.400]   I had a problem with--
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.480]   and I have no idea that was the PDA net or not.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.400]   But my connection here in my hotel room
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:36.120]   was getting very confused between ethernet 1 and EN2.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.080]   Yeah, that's on your Mac.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.960]   And I think you could fix that on the Mac.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:40.480]   OK.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.880]   But I think that's on PDA net.
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:42.840]   That inserted that--
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:46.800]   Yo, yeah, PDA net does create a new network interface on the Mac.
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:47.720]   Yeah, it does.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.200]   It does.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:55.040]   Well, let's get to our tip of the week, Gina Trapani.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:55.600]   Sure.
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:57.560]   So the tip is--
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:01.040]   Jeff brought it up just a minute ago in this week's--
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.280]   this week in search on the Google blog,
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.800]   they ran down a few new search tricks.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.840]   And this is just a real simple one.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.080]   If you add the word hours or menu
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:14.320]   to a search for a store or organization or a restaurant,
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.840]   you'll get the hours and the menu in line.
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.840]   So the example they give is if you search for a computer
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:21.520]   history museum, Mountain View hours,
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.560]   you'll see the hours of the computer history museum, which
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.120]   is-- which I highly recommend, by the way.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.400]   It's an incredible place right there in the search results.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.280]   And if you search for a sushi joint near you
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.880]   and include the word menu, you'll get a link directly
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:34.960]   to the menu.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:35.680]   Now, I tried--
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.080]   I don't get the menu itself, then.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:37.600]   You get a link.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.400]   No, you don't get the menu itself.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.200]   You get a link.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.960]   So when you do the search, you see a little snippet
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:42.800]   of a Google map.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:44.840]   And on the right side, you see the name of the restaurant
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:46.600]   and the address and stuff.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.640]   And then right below that, you'll see there's
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:52.160]   a little light blue link menu underneath.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.960]   And most of the menu searches that I tried
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:57.280]   appointed to all menus.com.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.120]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.560]   So they've added all menus as a--
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:04.360]   I mean, that's the only resource of menus I've seen.
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.960]   But maybe it depends.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.800]   My thought about this, Peter, does this lead away?
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.960]   Light liked the thing, whether in Chicago,
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:15.040]   and it gives you the weather in the search box, does this
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.160]   make Google more of a destination in the sense that you
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.160]   can do information?
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:21.260]   Yeah.
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:23.160]   I mean, they're definitely moving toward answering your
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:26.680]   question without ever leaving the Google interface.
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:30.600]   And there are a few other tweaks they made this week.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.800]   They launched rich snippets for events.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:38.760]   And a rich snippet will give you kind of information about
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:42.000]   days and times right there in your results.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.720]   So if you search for concerts in Santa's Day, you'll get
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:50.800]   actual concert listings and phone numbers to call and like,
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:53.080]   who's going to perform that kind of thing?
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:53.920]   Right.
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:57.480]   This is what Bing does, basically.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:02.600]   And now it also will provide answers to questions in line.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.880]   So kind of taking on Wolfram Alpha a little bit.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.880]   So I really think that Google is trying to become a
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.840]   destination or at least send you direct and one click
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:14.680]   exactly to what you need, like the menu link.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.600]   Well, that's how it should do it, I think.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:17.120]   It should.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:18.120]   It should.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.120]   It's a little bit easier.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.240]   I think that these things, people don't really even notice
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:25.560]   them until you search for weather and say, oh, it's
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:26.080]   raining.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:26.840]   Interesting.
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:28.560]   So I think there's just little tweaks here and there.
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:31.240]   But the hours of menu search, I think, is especially useful
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:32.760]   for mobile searches on your phone.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:34.840]   I bet you, most people don't even notice that anything's
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.160]   changed or anything.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:38.960]   They just say, oh, yeah, that's the result I wanted.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.760]   That's what I was looking for.
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:43.280]   Well, as they've always gotten better with snippets, you
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.040]   asked for this.
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:44.360]   Right.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:46.920]   And we'll show you that portion of the Wikipedia page that
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:47.440]   has it.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:47.960]   Right.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.200]   It would be a bit different.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:51.160]   But knowing that you can add, for instance, the word
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.280]   hours to the searches is something they need to publicize
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:57.400]   because that changes the syntax of the search itself or
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.200]   the menu.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:01.560]   And that's really, I think that's great.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:05.320]   Google blog.blogspot.com is kind of a must read for us every
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:08.800]   week because Google's very good about sneaking this stuff
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:09.800]   out.
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.560]   Yeah, they've gotten really good about blogging about it,
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:11.760]   too.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:13.440]   I mean, all their blogs.
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.800]   I read the Gmail blog, the voice blog, the regular blog,
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:17.560]   the reader blog.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:20.480]   I mean, really, every product blog is pretty active.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:23.600]   Yeah, I have a Google reader folder for all the Google blogs.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:28.680]   It's a very, very good read for doing this show anyway.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.960]   And they're doing really well on Twitter as well.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:33.520]   Oh, were they on Twitter accounts?
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:35.960]   Yeah, they're a lot of-- there's a Nexus One Twitter account.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.600]   There's a Google Wave Twitter account.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.080]   And in fact, Wave launched something new this week.
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.080]   It was very exciting.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:43.280]   Read-only access to waves.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.120]   Oh, finally.
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:44.880]   Finally.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.360]   Yeah, finally.
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.760]   Finally.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.880]   With Reply, only access to come.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.640]   Because people were trashing waves by just junking them up
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:52.600]   with stuff.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:53.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.560]   So if somebody gets in your wave and starts putting the
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:58.320]   word not in everybody else's sentences, you just demote
[00:59:58.320 --> 00:59:59.960]   them to read only.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.040]   Go back and play back.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.080]   Copy it to a new wave.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.440]   And you're good.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.400]   Now, I'm looking for-- and the main Google account does not
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.680]   have a list.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.920]   Somebody at Google needs to make a list of Google accounts, a
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.000]   canonical list of--
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:12.520]   Yes.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.520]   --tweet Google tweets.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:17.360]   Because I'm looking at the Twitter.com/Google.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.280]   And there's no list at all.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.120]   This would be a good place since you've got two million
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.960]   followers to--
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.640]   They should do a Twitter list.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.480]   A list.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.600]   Just canonical.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.960]   I do that with Twitter.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.120]   A canonical list of Googlers.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.120]   So we could find them all.
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.040]   There must be one somewhere.
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.280]   Maybe somebody will put that in the chat room if there's one.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:37.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:37.960]   I'd like to find that.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.480]   Your number of the week, Mr. Jarvis?
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.080]   Two numbers.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.320]   The first number is 48.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.760]   The next number is 2.75 billion.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.760]   The founders of Google, Sergey and Larry, are going to take a
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:55.640]   meherd five-year sellout of certain portion of their stock
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.600]   to diversify and do what people in their position do.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.920]   It will, at the end of that period, at current value, they
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.240]   mean they get 2.75 billion in cash each.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.360]   Of course, that will change because there are also a lot
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.400]   of talk this week about how Google's stock is very low.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.000]   All tech stocks are taken right now.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.080]   Google's a 550.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.480]   And part of this was kind of a knee-jerk reaction, some
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:16.880]   were saying.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.640]   But anyway, at the end of that, they would end up with 48%
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.360]   of the two of them.
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.680]   Oh, that's the voting stock.
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:30.200]   Their shares have 10 times the voting power of common shares.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.360]   But Eric Schmidt has 10% of the company, 48% is hard to get
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:34.680]   around.
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.120]   They're not really losing control.
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:40.400]   However, the two founders will go to below majority control
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.920]   on voting shares.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:47.440]   Until they make an amendment to the articles of incorporation
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.240]   that give them 15%--
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.960]   15 times vote.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.080]   I was just going to ask why they would do that.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.360]   But is that true?
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.200]   Are you--
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.520]   Oh, they can totally do that.
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:56.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.960]   OK.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.600]   I mean, you have to do it right.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.280]   There's ways to do it.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:04.160]   They make A shares, B shares, C shares.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.360]   And they make a multiplier.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.920]   I know because I got screwed by Paul Allen.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:07.800]   But that's a long story.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.800]   I won't even get into it, by the way.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.240]   Oh, Paul Allen got screwed by Paul Allen.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.400]   Paul Allen did it himself.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.400]   I know.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.320]   Can't really complain.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.320]   He lost more money than I did in the deal.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.480]   Comp Mike says the Google blog does, in fact,
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.960]   have a list from July anyway of Google accounts on Twitter.
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.840]   And there are a lot of them.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.120]   There are a ton of Google accounts on Twitter.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.200]   So I'll put this in the show notes.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.120]   Google accounts on Twitter include Google Google policy
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.520]   blogger, Google books, Google calendar, Google context,
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.600]   Google images, Google news on and on and on and on.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.080]   There's geo related ad related stuff.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.760]   20 ad related developer and technical related.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.320]   There's people.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.440]   And there's even regional.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.760]   It looks like they've been--
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.840]   Is there any-- the special in the restaurant today tweet?
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.000]   Oh, that would be good.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:54.640]   I'd like that.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.320]   Let's see.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:58.760]   Now, that must be somewhere else, I guess.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.240]   Google at work.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.600]   Google sites, Google toolbar.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.080]   Wow, look at that.
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:06.320]   And I guess even though this article is posted in July,
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.080]   it's apparently they're adding all the time
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:12.080]   because they have an asterisk next to new ones.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:12.760]   Oh, cool.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:13.480]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.000]   Good to know.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.160]   I will make-- you know what I'll do?
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.040]   I'll make a list on my site of all of them.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:18.560]   Google lists.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.480]   Good idea.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.880]   So 2.75 billion each.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.920]   That's nice.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.240]   Must be nice.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:25.680]   Wow.
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.720]   I mean, it's kind of a staggering number.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.640]   They could each buy a jet now.
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:34.080]   So we talked a lot about the Nexus 1, probably
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.560]   I'd nauseam for some of you.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.320]   But we all use the Nexus 1 phone.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.160]   And I mean, I have to say, I'm using exclusively no desire
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.680]   to go back to the iPhone.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.160]   And I--
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.600]   Well, Jeff's sort of begrudgingly.
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.240]   But we're working on him.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:51.600]   We've had to bribe Kajol, threaten him.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.600]   But we've managed to convince him to not turn it in yet.
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.240]   No, I turn him.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.040]   The iPhone is still my number one.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:57.840]   That's OK.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.440]   My heart.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.360]   That's OK.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:04.600]   Gina, my contention is you just have to use this enough
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.000]   to really get to know it.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.160]   And I think people come around.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.160]   I'm just loving it.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.600]   I almost am too much in love with it.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.320]   I spend a lot of time--
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.120]   special time, just me and the phone.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.280]   You're corrected right now.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.120]   I'm just videoing you.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.520]   He and the phone.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.720]   So but one of the big complaints-- and it really
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.720]   is a big complaint-- is that multi-touch while it's
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.640]   in the hardware and it's in the operating system
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.200]   is not in any of the Google apps.
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.880]   And it seems like a huge thing to leave out.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.440]   And it really is when you go to the gallery,
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.800]   you just want to pinch and zoom the pictures and you can't.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.160]   They just don't go anywhere.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.240]   But I did find a very good upgrade to the browser.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.280]   Now, one thing I-- you have to commend Google for.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.560]   Go ahead and try to change the default browser on the iPhone.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.560]   You can't.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.040]   Not easy to do.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.560]   Just as on-- you know, it would be on Windows and Mac
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.840]   to have a different default browser.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:55.040]   And I am really happy with this one.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.960]   It's called the Dolphin Browser.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.520]   It's been around since September.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.840]   The newest version just came out.
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.840]   Supports multi-touch absolutely.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.600]   Now, there's a free version that is ad supported.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.960]   But I paid a couple of bucks to get the full version.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:13.800]   It's probably using the same engine.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.160]   It's a very competent browser.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:18.640]   It seems to be exactly the same as the Google browser, except watch.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.400]   I can pinch.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.400]   I can zoom.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.280]   It's smart.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.280]   It reformats very nicely.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:29.680]   After you do the pinch, I have to say it's a really nice browser.
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:34.000]   Has a lot of nice features, including gestures.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   It has a built-in little magnifying glass.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.560]   I can see the page as a whole.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:43.880]   It also has great sharing features in it.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:48.440]   It has a home page that I kind of like that gives you access
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:52.320]   to all the Google features kind of natively on the home page,
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.480]   a very good bookmarking facility.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.520]   It has a read later feature, which is an instant paper,
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.720]   but it's kind of like the idea of you
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:02.960]   save the articles into one folder.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.920]   Good, delicious integration.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:05.960]   It's a very nice browser.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.520]   It's called the Dolphin Browser.
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.200]   And I'm using it.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.880]   You totally can say this is you are the default browser.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.360]   It has a huge number of setting capabilities.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.160]   There's all sorts of settings built into this thing.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.240]   So very happy with it.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.600]   And highly recommended, if you want to assure yourself that,
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:30.000]   in fact, it is possible to do multi-touch on the Nexus 1.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.520]   And I'm told this works as well on the Android.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.360]   Yes, you can.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.880]   And all you have to do is change the software.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.160]   And this is the one I recommend.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.600]   It's the Dolphin Browser.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:42.160]   You can find it in the Android Marketplace.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.480]   It's also themeable.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.600]   Although I haven't changed the theme, I like a kind of simple theme.
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.480]   A lot of nice features built into it.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.000]   And I'm downloading this right now.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.080]   Well, one of the things is it's great when people say, oh, yeah,
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:55.840]   nice Nexus 1.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.480]   If it only had multi-touch, and you can whip it out and say,
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.000]   look, I think that reassures people.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:01.640]   And I do--
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.440]   It's me having that map.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:03.400]   That makes a big difference.
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.360]   You've got to get it in Maps and Gallery.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:08.600]   And right now, you have to root as far as I know to do that.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.520]   But I'm sure that I have to think Google, at some point,
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.800]   is going to make that shift.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.640]   It's available in Europe.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:16.560]   I don't know why it's not available here.
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.800]   And as long as we're talking about applications,
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:22.600]   I know you're using Cismic, you guys, for your Twitter application.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.680]   I mentioned that a hand mark's got a new one.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.800]   But I really-- and I would encourage anybody who
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:31.040]   ever used Twidroid Pro to go back and re-examine it,
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.920]   because it has now become not only a very competent Twitter
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.760]   client, but I think a better Twitter client than even Tweety
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.880]   or Sipple tweet, which--
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:41.400]   or Bird--
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.560]   was it Bird Feed?
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.920]   All of which I've used on the iPhone.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.920]   I really like this one.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.280]   I've been using it very heavily.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:49.920]   And it has a black theme, which is very important
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:53.520]   if you're using the Nexus 1, because that OLED screen
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:56.040]   gives you better battery life with dark backgrounds.
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.800]   Doesn't use any energy to do a black pixel on OLED.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:03.640]   But the speediness of this is just of the Nexus 1.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.720]   It's just fantastic.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:06.680]   You're in love, Liam.
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.280]   I am.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:07.760]   It's my new--
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:08.280]   You are.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:08.600]   It's great.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:09.880]   I'm going to revisit Twidroid.
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.800]   I'm going to give Twidroid another chance.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.880]   I'd be very curious what you think, because yeah, I
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.160]   went to Cismic, but it's simple.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.560]   Twidroid, for instance, has the ability to have multiple--
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.200]   this is important to me, because I have multiple Twitter
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.040]   accounts.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.600]   Oops, let's go back here.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.520]   And it handles it.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.480]   I think it handles it quite well.
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:25.560]   So I'm in my main account.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.400]   That's the default account.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.760]   But if I want to go to another account,
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:28.760]   I just slide sideways.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:31.760]   It has a unified inbox, by the way, all accounts, which
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.480]   is very handy.
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.480]   And then account by account.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:34.880]   I can go through here like this.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.480]   And if you want to follow somebody, you press and hold them.
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:40.240]   And then it says, follow.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.240]   And it gives you the chance--
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.560]   I guess I'm already following them.
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.400]   But it gives you the chance to choose which account you want
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:46.080]   to follow them in.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.960]   So it handles multiple accounts very, I think, very nicely.
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:50.920]   How about list support?
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.280]   Can I have you just list?
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:55.800]   Cismic apparently has that.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.360]   But every time I try to look at just a list,
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.320]   I get a connectioner.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.360]   Like no matter what, no matter what kind of connection I have,
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.560]   wherever I am, I have to look at the C-level.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.040]   Oh, I have to go to account the has list.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.720]   So let me go to my main account.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.800]   If you go to an account that has lists,
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:16.560]   you pull up the main menu and it says View Lists.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.000]   Oh, these are lists I'm subscribed to.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.720]   OK, so I need to search for lists
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.560]   and other people's profiles.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.080]   OK.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.560]   And then you can subscribe to or look at the lists.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:28.440]   It has trends, very nice job with trends, I think.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:30.000]   I think they've done a good job.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.920]   Although trends have gotten really stupid on Twitter.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.080]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.680]   Really pathetic.
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.920]   I am proud to say that Twitter has redone
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.120]   the suggested user list.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.120]   And I am now not only verified, but I am
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.160]   suggested in their congratulations.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.400]   I saw that.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.400]   That's what you do to your followers.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.400]   Nothing.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:48.360]   And that's fine.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.360]   Actually, that's good.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.040]   Dave Weiner wrote a letter to Twitter's board saying,
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:51.800]   get me off that.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.960]   But it's not like the old SQL where you join
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.720]   and then you've got to pre-selected a bunch of them
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.080]   and you just press OK.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.600]   There's 20 lists.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:01.360]   They did it right this time where there's categories.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.760]   You pick a category you're interested in.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:05.640]   There's a large number of people in each category.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.160]   It's a much more sensible way of doing it.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.560]   Nobody's going to get a million followers just from being on it.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.480]   And I think that's fine.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.480]   That's a good thing.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.600]   It's a discovery tool, which is as it should be.
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.480]   We are out of time.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.320]   I can't believe it.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.360]   You must go back to you.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.200]   It's not pizza night now in Munich.
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:22.680]   It's--
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.280]   Shlaf.
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.280]   It's bedtime.
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.280]   Shlaf night.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:26.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:27.240]   All right.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.880]   I'll have some schlaf.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:32.960]   Oh, I went to the sauna in the hotel.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.160]   I went to a party.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:37.240]   And I came here and then I'm going to go to sleep.
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:39.280]   Schlaf's sleep?
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.280]   Schlaf's sleep?
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.280]   You're saying?
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.280]   Ooh, you're about to wind up.
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.280]   Ooh.
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.280]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.280]   Look at that.
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.280]   It's a nice hotel.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.280]   It's called the Charles Hotel here in Munich.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.280]   It's a new hotel.
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.280]   The conference will be up out.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.280]   It's very nice.
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.280]   Oh, very nice.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:55.280]   We'll enjoy your stay in Germany.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.680]   And then we'll talk to you next week in Switzerland at Davos.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.480]   I hope-- I hope if all works well, I'll be in the--
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:04.480]   I'm supposed to be the lone guy as the big sware goes on the last time Davos.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:09.200]   I, poor me, sacrificing for the purposes of twig, will be in the press room.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.200]   Don't do that.
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.000]   We have-- what you know is fine.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   It's fine.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   I'll be tired by that.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   It's fine.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   All right.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   Will you be wearing black tie?
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   Because if so, Gina and I can dress up.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   I'll be wearing a black tie.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   OK.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.320]   I've got to wear a tuxedo just to make it feel like you're not missing the glamour.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.600]   Me getting dressed up is me not wearing a t-shirt.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.000]   Oh, come on, Gina.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.080]   I know you've got a closet full of ball gowns.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.080]   Don't deny it.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.080]   I'm going to see the normal bollocks.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:38.080]   Gina.
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.160]   Oh, I don't-- now those, I'm sure she doesn't.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.160]   All right.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.760]   Hey, thank you, everybody.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.000]   Gina Trapani blogs at smarterwear.org.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.840]   It's a must read every day.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:48.840]   Great stuff there.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.680]   And of course, life hacker and Harvard Business Review and many other places.
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:53.760]   And a follower on Flickr.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:58.640]   That's where you'll see squished cubs and submarine photos from her recent travels with
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.640]   the Navy.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.640]   She's been traveling around with the Navy.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.640]   Well done.
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:02.640]   Yeah, you don't--
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.640]   Well done.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:04.640]   They're not vloggers.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:05.640]   We get around.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:09.080]   First female Submariner, Gina Trapani, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:12.920]   Jeff Jarvis is when he's not in Germany, is hanging out at the Buzz Machine.

[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:22.560]   School and of course, many other things.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:26.720]   Oh, let's say the Guardian podcasts.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.360]   Letter, is it letter from the US?
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.120]   That's Media Talk USA.
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.760]   Middle Media Talk USA, that's it.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:37.720]   And thank you all for being here.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.880]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
