[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500]   Brady Forest is here from the Ware Conference.
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.100]   We'll talk about location, open street maps, Google maps,
[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.900]   and maps of all kinds.
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.100]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.500]   Netcast, you love.
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.500]   From people you trust.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.500]   This is Twig.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.700]   Bandwidth for this week in Google
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.200]   is provided by CashFly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.600]   This is Twig.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.300]   This week in Google, episode 139,
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.200]   recorded March 21, 2012.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.800]   Wage cut.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.800]   This week in Google is brought to you by Ford,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.600]   featuring curve control to help protect against crashes on curves.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.500]   Look for curve control right now in the 2013 Ford Tourist

[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.500]   First of all, let's start with Gina Trapani,
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.500]   who is, of course, a regular, the founding editor of Life Hacker,
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.500]   blogger at smarterware.org, the author of ThinkUp,
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.500]   a great Twitter app at ThinkUpApp.com.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.500]   Hello, Gina.
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.500]   Hello, great to be here.
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.500]   Nice to see you.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.500]   Good to see you, too.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.000]   On the other side, we have Mr. Jeff Jarvis,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.500]   who today is in Stockholm, Sweden.
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.500]   Hey, what are you doing in Sweden?
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.500]   Hey, I'm speaking at the Web Days Conference.
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.500]   It's a never-word in Swedish, but I can't say it.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.500]   Tomorrow. And so, over here, one of my favorite cities on Earth,
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.500]   I actually, I'll tell the story tomorrow,
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.500]   but I actually came here the first time after having visited
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.500]   the first IKEA in America.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.500]   Wow.
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.500]   And I said, "Any country that can make this, I gotta go see."
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.500]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.500]   Well, he's in...
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.500]   Tell us the name of the hotel, because you're getting incredible bandits.
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   Yes, this is the Scandick Grand Central Hotel.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.500]   They're nice enough to have me in a conference room where I'm getting 58 down and 72 up.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500]   And I'm not pink, people.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.500]   I'm not pink.
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500]   There's no buffer, Blodie.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.500]   This is the best.
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.500]   I mean, I can't believe the quality.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.500]   This is fantastic.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.500]   This is better than satellite.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.500]   I'm moving to Sweden.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.500]   We should all move to Sweden.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.500]   All our hosts should live in Sweden from now on.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.500]   Yauskuye and Amlet.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.500]   Yauskuye and Amlet.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   Jeff is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York,
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   the author of Public Parts and Blogs at Buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   We also have a guest in studio with us, which is really nice.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.500]   Bradley Forest.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.500]   Hello, Bradley.
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.500]   Brady.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.500]   Not Bradley.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.500]   Brady.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   I added an L.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.500]   Good to see you, Brady.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   From O'Reilly, he is also responsible for the O'Reilly Location Conference,
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.500]   the We're Conference at We're Conference.com.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   Normally in Seattle, but down here, and it's nice to have you.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.500]   Thanks.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.500]   Welcome.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.500]   Appreciate you coming in.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   Location is big, isn't it?
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   Holy cow.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.500]   Yep, and Google is a big part of it.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.500]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.500]   In fact, you got a Google Map right on the front of your website.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.500]   There.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.500]   But also everything else.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.500]   So we'll talk a little bit about that as well.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.500]   But before we go much farther, breaking news, I think a huge story.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.500]   Zinga just bought OMG Pop for $200 million.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.500]   And Henry Blodges says they left $800 million on the table.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.500]   Really?
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.500]   You think it's a billion-dollar company?
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.300]   OMG Pop's an interesting company because they've been around for some time making apps that
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.980]   hadn't really gone anywhere.
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.940]   And then they made something called Draw Something, which came out last week.
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.940]   It was a Sunday.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.580]   I watched you play it for an hour.
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.140]   I played it on the air for an hour.
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.260]   It's one of the most fun things ever.
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.220]   The idea is it's kind of a dictionary, basically.
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.900]   I mean, there's nothing new under the sun.
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.340]   They give you a word.
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.340]   It's got them.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.460]   It's the Merv Griffin style of gaming in which really the game is trivially easy and makes
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.500]   you feel good about yourself.
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.860]   Merv designed Wheel of Fortune so that the contestants on screen were incentivized to
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.180]   be slow solving the puzzles the longer they went the more they'd make.
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.060]   And he's brilliant because people at home would solve them immediately because they were
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.020]   stupidly easy and they feel real and all the viewers go, "I'm so smart."
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.940]   And I'm smarter than that guy, unlike Jeopardy, which makes you feel stupid, Wheel of Fortune
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.940]   makes you feel smart.
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.380]   Hence Merv Griffin, multi-multi-multi-billionaire.
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.860]   OMG Pop, same thing.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.140]   It's a very simple game.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.540]   They give you words.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.140]   You can choose an easy word or a hard word.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.260]   You draw the word.
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.820]   Somebody has to guess it and they even get Wheel of Fortune style letters to choose from.
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.100]   And it's fun.
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.580]   You cannot really go wrong with it.
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.580]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.580]   Even if you can't draw.
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.620]   Are you paired randomly or?
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.620]   No, you choose.
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.860]   You can choose your friends.
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.420]   See, nobody draws that well, by the way.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.780]   Even my mom, who's an artist, her stuff looks like stick figures and crap.
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.780]   And that's the other thing.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.780]   Just because nobody on a...
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.140]   Now it's on Android, it's on iPhone, it's on iPad.
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.060]   But anybody's drawing with their finger.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.460]   Can't draw.
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.460]   Nobody draws...
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.300]   You can't draw well even if you're an artist.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.060]   Well, plus they feed you the letters like Jeopardy.
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.060]   It's very...
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.060]   It's very...
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.060]   It will be easier.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.060]   It can be easier.
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.860]   But Leo, you have a spin.
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.020]   You have a fablet.
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.020]   You do.
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.420]   Well, and that's...
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.060]   I have a little advantage.
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.260]   Unfortunately, I'm still a crappy artist.
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.420]   But I can play it on my note with my spin, my S-Pen.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.220]   And so I'm not drawing with a finger.
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.020]   I'm drawing with a pressure sensitive stylus.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.500]   And still my stuff looks stupid.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.300]   So there's no excuse, frankly, for how badly I play.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.340]   But it is a fun game.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.540]   It's actually more fun on the iPad just because it's bigger.
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.780]   It's going to say the bigger screen kind of gives you a little bit of an advantage.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.780]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.660]   Well, but then you're drawing with your fingers.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.660]   Right.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.660]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.740]   Anyways, $200 million.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.100]   And that's the funny part.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.020]   They could have gotten a billion, you think?
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.020]   No.
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.020]   I would...
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.020]   Well, so it's...
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.020]   Let's see.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.580]   Simon Calloff, CEO of Mobile Analytics firm, Flurry, according to Henry Blogg.
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.940]   It says that it's so way too early leaving 800 million on the table.
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.540]   Is that nuts, S, Henry?
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.100]   Based on draw something's early growth, no, it's not nuts.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.980]   But of course, that's just their one big success.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.980]   Right.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.260]   It's six weeks old, top app, 79 weeks old.
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.060]   Basically they made $200 million in six weeks.
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.060]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.660]   Top app in 79 countries been downloaded 20 million plus times, has 12 plus million active
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.580]   daily users, generates $100,000 of revenue per day.
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.580]   That's the interesting number.
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.580]   Yeah, but the company's been around for a long time.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.340]   So it's just like Rovio in that they had a string of games that didn't really go anywhere.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.780]   So it's not like they made $200 million in six weeks.
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.460]   But I think that's where the billion comes from because Rovio is worth a billion.
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.460]   But there's characters...
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.740]   On the strength of one, but there are characters.
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.900]   And they can sell action figures and plushies and pillows.
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.900]   And a movie.
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.340]   There's an Angry Birds movie.
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.340]   That's...
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.340]   I've heard that there's talk.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.340]   Of course there is.
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.340]   But here's...
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.380]   They want to go for like a Disney franchise around the characters.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.380]   That's worth doing.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.980]   Oh, wouldn't you go to a theme park with them?
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.540]   Oh, if I had a three-year-old, yeah.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.540]   Yeah.
[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.180]   Or if you're mad, you could throw this three-year-old.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.180]   No, just joking.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.420]   Here's an interesting chart from Silicon Alley Insider.
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.860]   Words with friends, daily active users plummeting.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.100]   Although, I mean, look at that plummet.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.100]   Look at the scales of those.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.100]   I mean, there's two...
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.100]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.940]   You know, the scales are totally off there.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.940]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:04.940]   But...
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:11.940]   Well, all I'm saying is...
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:12.940]   It took...
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.940]   This is a bit unfair.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:14.940]   The same story.
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.020]   It took AOL nine years to hit one million users.
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.020]   Facebook nine months.
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.020]   Right.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.020]   Brought something nine days.
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.020]   Wow.
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.020]   But that doesn't mean it's the next Facebook or AOL.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.020]   No, it doesn't at all.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.020]   Yeah.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.020]   No, it's a simple little...
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.020]   You know, if I'm them, I take...
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.820]   I take $200 million.
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.820]   That's...
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.140]   Yeah, and it wasn't a bad price for Zinga.
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.100]   They got tons of cash, right?
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.100]   Is it a...
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.420]   Well, I think that's a good question.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.980]   I think Zinga might have overpaid out.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.900]   Well, they got a hit game and they've been buying a lot of studios.
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.060]   So they already bought area code in New York to become Zinga New York.
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.060]   So this is just adding to that pool of developers.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.580]   They have Zinga Seattle.
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.580]   And it's just...
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.580]   Do you have a hit game?
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.420]   Pull it into the Zinga fold and then promote the next game.
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.420]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.220]   It's kind of like Cheeseburger where they kind of acquire new memes.
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.220]   Right.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.220]   Acquire the meme.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.380]   They don't just rest their laurels on Cheeseburgers.
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.100]   We're in the meme acquisition business.
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.420]   Well, I like that a lot, yeah.
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.420]   Yeah.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.420]   Makes sense.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.420]   That's why we're trying to brady.
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.300]   We needed somebody like him on this show.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:16.860]   Peter Kafka says, "We'll pay $184 or something and $30 million in employee retention payouts."
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.140]   See, that's the key because you hire these guys.
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.580]   You want them to do more games for you.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.420]   You don't want them to say, "Okay, you got OMG, pop, see ya."
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.420]   Right.
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.420]   And then...
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.420]   $30 million in retention.
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.340]   That's for how many employees you got, was it?
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.340]   I don't know.
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.340]   How big is it?
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:37.620]   Well, and then Anthony D'Rosa on Twitter says that Facebook drew 12% of its total revenue
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.340]   from Zinga in 2011.
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.340]   Yep.
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.580]   That's significant too.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.820]   And of course, Zinga has started its own webpage where you could play all the Zinga
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.540]   games minus the Facebook annoying interference from your friends and all of that stuff.
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.540]   He just played it.
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.380]   Well, and Facebook is hoping to roll out the credits program beyond just gaming.
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.380]   Right.
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.380]   So, hopefully it's dependent on...
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.380]   Facebook wants to be a global currency.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.380]   Exactly.
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.340]   OMG, pop is a 40% company in New York.
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.340]   40 people.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.340]   Wow.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.340]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.340]   That's for them.
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.700]   I have to say, it is a very derivative game.
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.980]   It is not anything that people haven't seen before.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.540]   There's nothing original in that game, would you say?
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:18.900]   Except perhaps the monetization, it's a free game and they make their money on in-game
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.860]   purchases, which seems now to be the trend.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.860]   Give away the game and then...
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.940]   So if you want more colors, for instance, you start with a very limited palette of colors.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.140]   If you want more colors, you can buy more colors.
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.700]   But you earn coins as you play, but most people are impatient.
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.060]   So this is one of those things where you can...
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.780]   I never gave them a penny, but if you want more bombs or more colors or more other features,
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.060]   you can pay for those.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.860]   And that's where they're making $100,000 a day.
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.660]   But still, $200 million, that's a lot.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.660]   That's $200,000.
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:53.500]   That's two years worth, three years worth, four years worth, six years worth, six years
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.900]   worth of $100,000 days.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.180]   I don't know if they're worth that much.
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.780]   That's a lot of money.
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.940]   Speaking of...
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.420]   We don't know how much money, but as speaking of acquisitions, it looks like Kevin Rose,
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.980]   our friend Kevin Rose, and Milk were acquired by Google.
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.620]   Kevin's first day was Monday.
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.140]   You got a haircut.
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.140]   Did he?
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.140]   I didn't see that.
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.140]   So he scheduled his haircut, according to his Google+ account.
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.140]   He's on site Google Haircut.
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.140]   Yep, boy.
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.140]   He has the fit of your haircut.
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.140]   He's freaking waiting.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.140]   He's been waiting, apparently.
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.140]   Nuglers get...
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.700]   First thing they do, they get a haircut and then they go eat lunch.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.700]   It's like the military.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.700]   Shave that.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:25.700]   Shave that.
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.580]   And if you're a new Apple employee, you get the shakedown from the security team.
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.580]   Yeah.
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.420]   You get fed disinformation for the first six months.
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.860]   And you get to work on non-existent secret projects.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.860]   Oh, man.
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.660]   Don't you want to go work for Google?
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.260]   It surprised me because...
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:47.140]   Now, there's still a lot of speculation about why Kevin went for this.
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.980]   We don't know how much money there was.
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.300]   The day before the news broke, they closed down.
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.780]   They were one and only product at Milk, which was Oink, which we liked.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.340]   But it was not successful.
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.500]   So they had no successful products.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:08.740]   Also going to Google Daniel Burka, who is a great designer, really talented designer.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.100]   And he did the dig design.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:17.580]   Not all of the Milk team has been invited to stick around, however.
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.740]   That's the way Google+ acquisitions work.
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.740]   The two developers moved on.
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.740]   They didn't want the programmers.
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.140]   They said, "We have plenty of...
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.140]   This is all rumor.
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.820]   Google's not saying anything."
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.660]   They said, "According to the stories, we have plenty of engineers.
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.660]   We need designers."
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.660]   But that's...
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.660]   Well, they do.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.180]   They need designers who understand social.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.180]   Yes.
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.180]   Yes.
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.180]   They really do.
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.180]   That's a big difference.
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.180]   You know what?
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.500]   I never really got into Oink, but when I heard about it, it struck me that it was sort of
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.980]   like, plus one, everything in the world.
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:50.980]   Right.
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.700]   So there's a synergy then between that.
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.700]   They're a little bit.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.500]   And dig, obviously, is similar.
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.380]   Plus one is similar to Dig.
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.900]   But it did surprise me.
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.700]   I don't know Kevin very well, but I know he's big into...
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.700]   He loves the iPhone.
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.340]   He talks about how he loves the iPhone.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.140]   Oink was an iPhone app.
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.980]   And he just posted on Google+ that he's looking forward to switching to Android, which is
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.980]   interesting.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.980]   So I don't know if he's on the Android.
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.860]   That was the rumors that he was going to go to work for Android.
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.620]   Now the original rumor was he would work for Google+.
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.940]   So it's all speculation, but that sounds like he's going to be starting to write for Android,
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:24.940]   not for iOS.
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.340]   Well, actually, I looked that up just now.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.940]   And the article that was posted on that on Android and me says, "Update, nope."
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.940]   Nope.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.140]   And you know what I was thinking about the designer thing?
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.420]   It's not that Google needs more designers or needs designers in a social.
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.420]   They need designers that the devs will listen to.
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.740]   Because I think that's the...
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.020]   I mean, it's such a dev-dominated culture there.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.020]   And...
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.020]   So the designers with the credit...
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.020]   So the designers with the credit...
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.020]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.020]   With developer Cred.
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.020]   And the product vision that they can get through the engineering...
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.020]   Kevin is not a designer.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.420]   Kevin's just a smart guy.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.420]   Daniel's a designer.
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.420]   Great product person.
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:56.420]   He's a great...
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.420]   Yep.
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.420]   Well, he's a great...
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.900]   You know, by the way, I'm a...
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.780]   I think Kevin's a good friend.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.820]   I offered him a partnership in Twit when we started, along with Patrick Norton.
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:06.820]   He declined.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.100]   He had better things to do, which was...
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.740]   He was right.
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.140]   But I don't know if...
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:17.220]   I mean, Dig was a good idea.
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.220]   I think it was a beautiful product.
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.220]   I didn't get a beautiful product.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.220]   I did get a beautiful product.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.820]   But no, I used it for a week.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.820]   Yep.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.820]   Didn't...
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.820]   Wasn't very sticky.
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.820]   I don't know.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.820]   It's an interesting thing.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.820]   It surprises me because Kevin is also an angel investor.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.820]   You know, he took money out of Dig.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:31.820]   He had enough money.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.620]   I don't think money is a motivator at this point.
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.340]   And he's invested wisely in many cases as an angel investor.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.580]   It surprises me that he wants a job as an employee.
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.620]   He hasn't been an employee since he worked at G4.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.620]   Well, come on.
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.420]   There's something about learning.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.180]   Going to a larger company, you get to learn how they do things at Scamier.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.660]   So maybe that's it.
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:49.660]   He wants to...
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.660]   He is a young guy.
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.220]   And then there's also just the scale of the products there at Google.
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.220]   Right.
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.100]   We tried to get Kevin on Twitter.
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.540]   He wouldn't come on, right?
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.340]   Do we ask him for a Montweg?
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.900]   I did not ask him for Twig.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.340]   Let's see if we can get him next week.
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.340]   All right.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.340]   Yeah.
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.340]   Let me ask a question.
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:10.540]   Guys, why Dig is where it is and why Reddit is where it is.
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.020]   Reddit almost immediately started beating Dig.
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.020]   I think Dig...
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.020]   Reddit came after Dig.
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.940]   Dig was the original idea.
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.740]   But as soon as Reddit came along, it immediately started beating Dig.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.300]   What was it that Reddit did better?
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.860]   Or did it?
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:30.220]   Reddit developed a very active community and I think they fostered the community better
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.220]   than Dig.
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.220]   Agreed.
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.220]   Dig got so...
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.460]   Dig got so game so early on that they had to start taking draconian measures to avoid
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.700]   gaming and that pissed off the community.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.860]   It just didn't feel...
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.660]   It may have been hoisted by its own success.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.900]   But it didn't feel as small and tight a community as Reddit did.
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.900]   I don't know.
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.740]   Chatroom, why did Reddit beat Dig?
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.020]   Dig this, he became a troll fest.
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.020]   Subreddits is a good point.
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.020]   Subreddits are great.
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.140]   We use subreddits for a couple of our shows.
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.020]   Tom uses subreddits and I think subreddits.
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.180]   But it allows porn.
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.700]   You know what?
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.100]   Don't undersell that.
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:18.580]   By the way, Google pulled a user created Reddit app from the Play Store because of the porn.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.140]   I didn't know Google was anti porn.
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.740]   I thought they liked porn.
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.740]   They restored it though.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:23.740]   They did.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:24.740]   Oh good.
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.740]   They did.
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.740]   They did.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:27.740]   It was automatic.
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.660]   The NSFW warnings kind of flag, I think, flag their review system.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.660]   I get it.
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.660]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.620]   Listen, I don't think this is about technical features.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.620]   You know, social apps community is its best feature, bottom line.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.620]   Right.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.620]   So only the community.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.180]   Certainly you have to have product designers that are listening to the community and adding
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.860]   in features that help the community help themselves.
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.300]   But yeah, it's definitely about community with Reddit and good designers, helping them
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.300]   along.
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.620]   Well, I like the subreddit theory.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.900]   Because I mean, you know, in Dig they have this sort of semi war on their most popular
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.820]   users like Mr. Baby Man.
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.820]   Right.
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.780]   And there can only be one Mr. Baby Man for Dig.
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:03.780]   Right.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.500]   Whereas with subreddits it didn't really matter.
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.500]   Everybody can have their own.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.900]   Well, that's the essence of scale, isn't it?
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.620]   Um, J.C.
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.540]   Calhoun in the chair room says that, you know, dig for ruined dig.
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.100]   And I think, I think to some extent it's, it's, it's true.
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.860]   There's that, there's that jumping shark moment for a company where a design goes too
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.660]   far or something goes too far.
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.900]   And I don't really understand the subtlety of what happened with, with.
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:29.260]   Somebody pointed out the irony of the fact that the Kevin Rose story getting bought by
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.580]   Google did not make it to the front page of Dig.
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.220]   It really tells you something.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.460]   Because it used to be if Kevin farted Dig would put it on the number, really the front
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.740]   page immediately on dig.
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:46.900]   I've got to admit, I was when, when, when business week put Kevin on the cover is the
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.220]   $60 million man, I think it was, you know, I wrote in my first book that Kevin was going
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.820]   to be the next Murdoch, the former Murdoch was evil.
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.820]   Well, wasn't as evil.
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.980]   Um, you know, and, and, and I still have a great respect for Kevin.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:00.980]   I like him.
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:01.980]   I adore Kevin.
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.860]   I think he's brilliant and he's wonderful.
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.060]   But I think it's a K, you know, the press, it's, it's a second novel pressure, right?
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:12.060]   You come out with dig and dig nation to the side and, and Kevin's personality.
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.900]   I think nation was Kevin's greatest success.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.060]   I think there's no question that was the greatest success.
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.060]   It really was.
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.060]   Yeah.
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.060]   And so it's a second act problem.
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.060]   Right.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:24.340]   And so maybe, you know, I, I agree with the idea that the large company, it was also that,
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.700]   that, that the pressure of getting milk going and saying, you know, maybe I don't have a
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.340]   great idea right now.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.140]   And to go to Google and learn, you're going to learn a tremendous amount.
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.140]   I think it makes sense.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:38.620]   I would still bet, you know, I'll, I'll bet Kevin long.
[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.100]   I, I, I would too.
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.100]   I would too.
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:45.020]   Although I shouldn't say this.
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:50.300]   If I didn't, if I weren't good friends with Kevin, I might say that the story here is
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:57.300]   how few great designers there are out there and how hard it is to find talent for a company
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.500]   like Google.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.500]   Mm hmm.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:04.020]   And, and I think that to me, that's what this indicates to me.
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:09.340]   But they pick up milk, which is not a huge, it's not, it's not OMG pop.
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.820]   But of course it didn't sell for 200 million dollars.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:16.980]   I, I don't think, but I think they really, I think they really, uh, good designers, talented
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:21.140]   people, people understand social are hard to find.
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.700]   And Google needs them.
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.700]   I am.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.860]   So, so I'm very jealous of Kevin.
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.860]   That's exactly it.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.660]   I think it's a really good move for Google.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.340]   I'm, I don't quite understand why it was a good move for Kevin, but good for him.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.340]   Exactly.
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.340]   Exactly.
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.660]   And I do think he's a, he's a great product designer.
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.860]   Or I didn't, didn't go big, but it was really beautiful.
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.860]   It was beautiful.
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.060]   And that's Daniel, that's Daniel right there.
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.060]   And really talented.
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.060]   Chris Hutchins, very talented.
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.060]   Really, it's a good group.
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.300]   What should Kevin do?
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.220]   What do you wish Kevin would do?
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.220]   Any word Google?
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.340]   I think Google plus needs his, I mean, that's, was the original idea was people thought maybe
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.740]   he'd go to Google plus.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.980]   But you know what he, where I think that the, the second theory that might be rings
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.020]   a little truer is YouTube.
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:08.260]   They need somebody, you know, Tim Shay at Next New Networks is the guy right now who's
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.620]   bringing in content to YouTube.
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:17.580]   They need somebody like Kevin who's really more of a foreground guy to cultivate and
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.580]   develop time.
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.580]   I never even thought of that.
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.580]   Right.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.580]   Yeah.
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.180]   So, so Tim Shay is really training people how to make good stuff.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.220]   Does Kevin become a star there?
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.580]   No, I think Kevin becomes behind the scenes.
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.580]   He's not behind.
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:36.060]   He's a foreground guy, but it's really about marshaling great talent and great content to
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.060]   YouTube.
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.700]   Clearly Google wants to do that.
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.200]   And that would be a great place for Kevin.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.300]   That's something Kevin loves, wants to do.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.300]   He brings the hip.
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.060]   How does he have a conflict of interest Kevin?
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.140]   How's Rev 3 doing?
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.980]   He is, I believe he has a stake in it.
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:50.980]   Is he on the board?
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.860]   I think he's on the board at revision three.
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.060]   I'm not sure.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.740]   It was his, you know, he started it.
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.500]   So I'm not sure what this, what this, but I, that's why the
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.700]   rumor, my thought, if they do do that, there's maybe they also acquire revision three because
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.740]   revision three is much like next to networks.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:06.740]   It's a YouTube.
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.740]   No, I see.
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.740]   I keep arguing here that Google can't own content.
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.700]   They may be stupid enough to go do it, but with national networks, they're basically
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.820]   sloughing off the shows and keeping the expertise.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.180]   Revision three is its show.
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.180]   No, that's not true.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.180]   Revision three pivoted.
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.180]   Oh, oh.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.220]   Revision three was a content creator.
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.780]   They've become a content aggregator.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:31.340]   Their biggest shows now are YouTube stars that they, just like next new networks, that
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.340]   they like, what is it?
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.340]   Epic Mealtime.
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:35.500]   Epic Mealtime.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.500]   All right.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.500]   That other guy, whatever.
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.460]   I don't know, a YouTube expert.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.460]   What's his name?
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.460]   Philip K.
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.460]   DeFranco.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.460]   Philip DeFranco.
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.460]   I think those people.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:49.300]   So their value is in what monetizing, distributing, educating all the above?
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.220]   Yeah, and they know how to create content.
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.260]   They know how to, they know how to, they know how to, they're very much like next to networks.
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.540]   That would be the argument against it, is there some redundancy there?
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.700]   I don't know.
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.340]   Just the thought.
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.340]   We're going to take a break.
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:05.060]   I think the big story or the one I'd love to talk about is what the hell's a Wall Street
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.060]   Journal smoking?
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.660]   They say big time search changes coming to Google.
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.660]   Really?
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.380]   We just learned how to use it, you know, that's what all looks due to them.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.380]   Really?
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.380]   Really?
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.540]   We've been waiting because that story was a week ago.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.620]   Still hasn't happened.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:22.620]   Maybe it's coming.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.620]   What are they thinking about?
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:29.940]   Before we talk about that, let's talk about go to my PC from Citrix, a great way to access
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:35.380]   your computer wherever you are, including, and this is what I love, from your iPad, your
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:40.900]   new iPad, it looks beautiful, your iPhone or any computer.
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.940]   And whenever you can get online, here's the deal.
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.260]   Go to the website, go to my PC.com.
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.580]   Use the offer code Twig, you could try it free for 30 days.
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:54.300]   Put it on your computer at work, back or PC, and then hit the road.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.660]   And the next time somebody calls you and said, "Oh, there's an emergency.
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.700]   We need you to do something at work."
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.020]   You just whip out your iPhone.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.020]   You say, "I got it."
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.500]   No problem right here.
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.860]   Your desktop computer is on your iPhone.
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.980]   And with that new retina display on the iPad, man, you see your whole desktop.
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:10.980]   It's gorgeous.
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:11.980]   It's the missing link.
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.940]   It turns your iPad or your iPhone into the computer at work.
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:22.100]   You could send, receive email, access any network resource, run any program, send, edit, save
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.260]   files from anywhere.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.260]   It's convenient.
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.100]   It's very reliable and really important now.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.100]   We see these more and more of these exploits with remote desktop tools.
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:37.860]   This one is secure and always has been 128-bit SSL, so you can use it anywhere.
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:42.620]   Use is natural versatile, so there's no need to reconfigure your firewall opening holes.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.300]   No, this works so great.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.300]   It is a lifesaver.
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.460]   It's easy to use and it's free for 30 days if you visit.
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.140]   Go to myPC.com.
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:54.500]   Click the try it free button, the offer code TWIG.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.660]   And then get the free app.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.460]   The app, they don't even charge for the app, so you can get it free on your iPhone iPad.
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.940]   Put it on everything so that you're always ready whenever you need to access your office
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:03.940]   PC.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:08.020]   Go to myPC.com, click the try it free button, the offer code is twig.
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:13.100]   We thank them and our good friends at Citrix for all their support.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.820]   So when did this Wall Street Journal come out?
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.140]   Came out a week ago?
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.220]   More than a week ago now.
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:24.220]   Saying Google is about to make one of the biggest changes in the history of offering
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.460]   web search.
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:34.020]   Semantic smarts, direct answers, the bingification of Google.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.380]   When?
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.020]   When did that happen?
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.420]   Over the next few, maybe it's still going to happen.
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.620]   Over the next few months, Google search engine will begin spitting out more than a list of
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.620]   blue web links.
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:48.300]   It will also present more facts and direct answers to queries at the top of the search
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.300]   results page.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.340]   I admit that's one of the things we talked about last week, didn't we, Gina, the calculator
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.340]   and all that?
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.340]   Yeah, converted.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:55.340]   Or, I mean, definitions.
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.340]   Definitions.
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.340]   Yeah, one box, yeah.
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.820]   Always have loved that.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.220]   So we're going to see more of that?
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.220]   No one.
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.420]   Yeah, that's what I've been saying for a long time.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.900]   Bradley Horowitz has been saying that Google is not just going to be 10 blue links.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.900]   He said that a month ago.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.900]   We've said it on the show ages ago.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:12.900]   Right.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.900]   We ordered it.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.620]   So we've seen Google going to answers.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.380]   There's nothing new here.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.780]   And Danny Sullivan did this great, great piece, just tearing this article to bits, saying
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:22.780]   exactly this.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:23.780]   You know, what's new?
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:24.780]   There's nothing new here.
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:25.940]   Hey, I already do.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.780]   I think you hit the nail on the head that the journal just started using Google.
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.020]   And so this is all new to them.
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.020]   Wow.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.620]   I want to see a piece in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.460]   Find anything on the web fast, this thing called Google.com.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.820]   Amazing.
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.980]   What is Google squared?
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:55.460]   That was their old kind of data app that came out right after Freebase.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.940]   And I think Fusion Tables is the successor of that last year.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.900]   Yeah, but Fusion Tables is their new one.
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.540]   It's still in the search.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.540]   Well, it's more of a data app that you can use on the side.
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:10.460]   So it's where you can gather, visualize, and share your data online.
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:11.860]   So that's a way of making data mesh.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:17.020]   What Danny says is, my take is that Google is pushing these technologies for good PR.
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:21.300]   In other words, the Google PR people are calling.
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.340]   Oh, that's kind of cool.
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.180]   Where do I find that?
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.100]   Fusion Tables.
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.820]   I'll just search for Fusion Tables.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:35.700]   Google's PR has been pushing this kind of in response to the negative coverage of Search
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:40.300]   Plus Your World to counter that bad PR.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.020]   And places like Mashable and Wall Street Journal are just saying, yeah, yeah, we'll
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.220]   write a story.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.620]   I guess for real people, it's news maybe.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.420]   Yeah, it does seem like it might have just gone.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.540]   Been PR gone a little bit, a little bit bad or a little bit out of hand.
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:01.740]   A meet, a single posted on Google Plus said saying, some recent news coverage sparked
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.100]   interest in where we are and where we're headed.
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.780]   And he basically said, we're improving our search every single day.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:13.020]   And we're trying to understand what you mean when you say, what is the deepest lake in
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.020]   the United States.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:17.700]   Right now, we don't know what you mean by deep or what you mean by lake, but we just
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.660]   try to pick a web page that gives you the right effect.
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:25.260]   We're working toward having-- we're in toward that semantic search where we do know what
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.260]   a lake is.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.580]   And we do know what deep means.
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.780]   And we will be able to give you an answer, similar to Wolfram Alpha.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:31.780]   Right.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.300]   This is what I love about.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.620]   I like that he was just kind of like, you know, this is-- this nothing has changed.
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:38.820]   We just decided to talk about it.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.660]   I gave an interview and hence the media coverage.
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.660]   Right.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.820]   He didn't quite say that, but that's what he was saying.
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.820]   He was reading between the lines.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:49.060]   So Brad was talking about this is the Fusion Tables.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.020]   Gather, visualize, and share your data online.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.740]   So is it an API to Maps?
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:57.700]   It works really well with Maps, but it's just what you can-- they have a lot of public
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.940]   data sets, and you can mash them together.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:01.940]   So--
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.260]   Ah, so the data and the map comes from Google.
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.260]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.260]   Ah, interesting.
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.260]   Well, public data sets.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.260]   Right.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.500]   So I mean, you could also-- AWS has a lot of public data sets.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.740]   It's a way of kind of locking you in.
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.740]   Right.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:13.740]   Right.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.580]   You know, there's a-- G-O-I-Q is another company that does exactly this.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:21.540]   So if I use Amazon Web Services, I get access to these special data sets.
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.540]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.540]   And thus, you don't pay for storage.
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:24.540]   You don't pay for transfer.
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.540]   Even better.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:29.540]   So it's a way of kind of keeping people in the system.
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:30.540]   Austin Globe.
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:34.540]   You know, down the line, you can picture AWS offering G-O data and mapping tiles.
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.540]   Right.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:36.540]   And open street maps.
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.540]   Right.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.540]   Interesting.
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.260]   This becomes terribly important in news.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:46.420]   And I'm trying to work on some grants, now, and some projects where, you know, we just
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:50.940]   have to make open data about government, from government, about our community.
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.380]   It's more of a standard.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:56.180]   And then once you have enough of it, then you start to get a critical mass of saying that
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:00.060]   you can treat it the same in 1,000 communities.
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.060]   And it scales.
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.060]   Right.
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.460]   And then if you get it in 1,000 communities, then the comparisons you can do in the higher
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.700]   level of data you can get is great.
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.260]   And we've just really got a push.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.300]   The problem is the news organizations aren't that data savvy.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:16.820]   It's hard to find data people because they take it's a special skill.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.780]   But there's a great opportunity there.
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.700]   Wait, so I'm on the, uh, the fact page for Fusion Tables.
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:27.500]   And my favorite one is how to work around the JavaScript restrictions on Google sites.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:32.500]   So if you want to embed a Fusion Table, here's how to work around.
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.460]   Here's how to hack Google.
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.620]   We have those restrictions.
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.620]   We're so sorry.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.540]   We're not going to turn them off.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.540]   But here's how you can hack them.
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.940]   And here's how to drop a cookie on an iPhone.
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.940]   Exactly.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:44.940]   Exactly.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.940]   Exactly.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:46.940]   Exactly.
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:47.940]   Exactly.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.180]   And it's Segal writing on Google+.
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:54.020]   Said some recent news coverage about Google has sparked interest in where we are and where
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.020]   we're headed in search.
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:30:00.620]   Let me just say every day we're improving our ability to give you the best answers.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.180]   He does talk about free bases.
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.180]   You did Brad.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:09.540]   So anyway, it's, I guess I think it's PR.
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:14.020]   I think it's Google PR saying, why don't you write more stories about our answers?
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.580]   Those are good.
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.580]   Those are really good.
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:25.020]   Somebody else said that the big story is Mac cuts and backlinks.
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.020]   So I'm going to search for that.
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.620]   This is from our chat room.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:35.620]   Apparently Google is going to penalize sites that use backlinks.
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:36.620]   Is that right?
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.180]   What's a backlink?
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.820]   I don't know.
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.260]   Let me see here.
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.460]   Whatever it is, it's bad.
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.460]   It's apparently bad.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:50.700]   And yet here I found a video on how to use backlinks.
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.740]   What's an effective tool for building links?
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.580]   I don't know.
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:03.980]   What they're talking about is that people who do too much SEO, you know, attempt to
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:08.180]   improve their Google search results with Google.
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:15.740]   Hey, just thinking will be punished for doing too much optimization.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:23.820]   They're changing their algorithm to punish websites that use unnatural sounding search
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:27.460]   engine optimization to increase their page ranking.
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.460]   Okay.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:33.940]   So the Google bot is going to figure out when the raising is unnatural for humans.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.860]   It's actually written for the Google bot.
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.860]   Yes, that's it.
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.380]   There's some recursion going on there.
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.380]   I like that.
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:40.380]   Yes.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.380]   Overly optimize sites.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:45.660]   They want to level the playing field for other websites who do not concentrate on optimization
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:49.940]   and it's no different from being Gina from being good at being able to figure out when
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.940]   you're getting pitched to line in a bar.
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:52.940]   Right.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:53.940]   It's true.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:54.940]   It's true.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.420]   The Google bots get to figure out when you're getting a bad line.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.740]   If I had a beautiful website, if I told you you had a beautiful website, would you press
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:03.420]   it against me?
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.020]   Now that's very interesting.
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:09.980]   Hey, honey, you want to parse?
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.780]   I'd like to scan your links.
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:16.980]   You know your robots.tech says no, but your website's saying yes.
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:17.980]   Yes.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:22.620]   It will target websites that have too many keywords on a page or keywords placed awkwardly
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.620]   in a sentence.
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.580]   Wow, I love that.
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:31.340]   They just kind of if you just like if you write in ungrammatically, you're put.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.580]   Get your punished grammatically incorrect sites.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.580]   Yeah.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.380]   Too many backlinks and don't have relevant content that solves a problem.
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.060]   It sounds like I mean, that's hard to do.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.140]   This is something a human would do.
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.140]   The backlink emperor is dead.
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.780]   I'm at once I got a ad here.
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.140]   This is from justaskim.com an SEO.
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.780]   Apparently she's an SEO.
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.780]   The backlink emperor is dead long live the backlink emperor.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:33:00.300]   Well, isn't it bigger that the, I mean, Google will never fully win this, but the goal
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.580]   is to kill the dark heart of SEO.
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.580]   Yes.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:04.580]   Kill it.
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.580]   Yes.
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:12.940]   Visualization is the first stab by the wooden spear in the heart of the dark wizards of
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:19.900]   SEO mixing my horror metaphors and constantly just trying now.
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.100]   Now it's a catch point too.
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.020]   If you're really good at SEO, I'm not going to hire you because you're too good because
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.460]   it's not going to work.
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.460]   Well, there's black.
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.460]   There's blackouts SEO, right?
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.460]   And there's why.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.580]   I mean, I think there's nothing wrong with a blogger or somebody setting up personal website,
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.580]   making sure their title is set.
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.140]   Yeah, you have a site map and, you know, right, but there's a line of manipulation.
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.140]   Right.
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.140]   Right.
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:45.740]   There's a line of manipulation and that line is constantly moving on both sides, right?
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.460]   The spammer finds the new way to do it.
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.940]   Google comes back and basically what they want to get to.
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.980]   And I think you said it's been important there, Leo.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:52.980]   You're recording that.
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.420]   It's about trying to become human.
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:55.420]   Right.
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.100]   And that's what she's booking Twitter are is us and human.
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.460]   And so Google, you want to talk about AI?
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.460]   This is Google trying to get more human.
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:08.500]   Yeah, I mean, Google's always said, just make good content.
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.620]   Make your site useful.
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:14.140]   And so what the problem is that it's a human can determine that very easily.
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.900]   We can look at a site that's SEO optimizing.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.700]   Oh, come on, please.
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:21.540]   You know, or a site that really is genuinely trying to make good content.
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.300]   It's hard to do it out algorithmically.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.740]   And I guess that's, you know, Google, these guys are smart engineers and I think they
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.740]   think everything is algorithmically solvable.
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:35.060]   And I think they're just checking the client lists of SEO firms.
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.420]   That's another way to do it.
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.580]   You know, that would be the way.
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:43.580]   So Matt Matt said this at South by this was, this was perhaps the nugget of information
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:47.060]   that came out of South by Southwest.
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:51.900]   He said that the new penalty be rolled out in the next few weeks.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:35:01.580]   There's the over optimized Matt cuts.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:07.060]   Danny Sullivan is a panel at South by the senior product marketing manager Bing was
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.060]   there.
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:14.220]   Who didn't say that in wife doesn't say the name.
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.140]   It was, you know, we can say whatever we want about Matt because he's currently on a news
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:20.100]   diet and I believe that includes the next month.
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.340]   He cannot listen to us.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.340]   Hey, you can't listen to us.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.340]   We can just talk about him.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:27.660]   How convenient right after South by and making this announcement.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:28.660]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:29.660]   Yes.
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.300]   Here's a transcription of Matt's audio.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.380]   What about the people optimizing really?
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.100]   I can actually play it.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.100]   Look at that.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.100]   How about that?
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.100]   We have the technology.
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.100]   All right.
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.100]   This internet thing is amazing.
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.100]   I've got the new art session.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.100]   Is this going to be the whole session?
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.100]   It is.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.100]   Do you need to talk with the engines?
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.100]   Dear being in Google.
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.100]   Help me.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.100]   All right.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.260]   That's the, I don't want the whole session.
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:51.220]   Here's the relevant paragraph.
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.220]   What about the people?
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:52.640]   I have the
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.640]   flashbacks.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.540]   You're standing out in the hallway in the convention center right now.
[00:35:58.540 --> 00:35:59.540]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:07.820]   In 2009, Matt did a video saying there was no such thing as over optimization and you,
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.300]   you would not penalize it.
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.700]   Now he's saying, yes, we will.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.060]   We will penalize you.
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:17.060]   What about the people optimizing really hard and doing a lot of SEO?
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.340]   We don't normally pre-announced changes.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.420]   This is Matt Cut speaking.
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.420]   But there is something we are working in the last few months and hope to release it in
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.620]   the next months or few weeks.
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.460]   We're trying to level the playing field a bit.
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:33.460]   All those people doing for lack of a better word, over optimization or overly SEO versus
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.380]   those making great content and great sites.
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.780]   We're trying to make Google bot smarter, make our relevance better.
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:44.780]   And we're also looking for those who abuse it like too many keywords on a page or exchange
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.700]   way too many links to go well beyond what you normally expect.
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.540]   We have several engineers on my team working on this right now.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.340]   His team is the spam fighting team.
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:58.660]   So they're basically saying we're treating SEO over optimization as a spam problem.
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:00.900]   Well, Matt knows all the SEO guys.
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:04.580]   I mean, he was the original Google guy who appeared in the news groups.
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.180]   And I used to work on In The Sin Search.
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.820]   In fact, that's how G9 Matt.
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:08.820]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.820]   I was at Microsoft.
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.620]   Microsoft bought a company I worked for Mango Music, which was kind of like Pandora back
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:13.620]   in 2000.
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:17.460]   I ended up bounced around for a while and ended up on In The Sin Search.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:23.140]   And I, during my first year on In The Sin Search, before we had launched with the new
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:28.660]   Search Engine, I went to SES, Danny Sullivan's show at the time, Search Engine Strategies.
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:33.420]   And I had a couple come up and yell at me asking why their lawn furniture site wasn't
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.060]   at the top of In The Sin Search.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:40.220]   And it was at that conference that I realized that the internet was not a shiny, bright
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.220]   park and Candyland.
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:43.660]   It was your moment of disillusion.
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:46.260]   It was my moment of disillusion.
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.660]   It was that show and working that booth.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.740]   The loss of innocence.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.740]   I remember the moment well.
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.740]   Sad moment.
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.100]   And trying to explain it to them was really depressing.
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.100]   Happened to me last week.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.540]   That's why I know all about that.
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:01.660]   I thought the internet was a bright, shiny, happy place for a long time.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:02.660]   And then milk was bought.
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:05.820]   And then milk was bought and it was all over.
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:09.460]   Well, so anyway, I can't say there's anything wrong with that.
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.460]   That's everybody knows that.
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.260]   You look, you go to a site that's doing it.
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.260]   You know immediately.
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.700]   You as a human know.
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.700]   We shouldn't.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.860]   We don't want to see those at the top of search results.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.060]   So I can understand why that's happening.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:30.220]   This kind of ties into the new spam box feature.
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:33.060]   On Gmail, be careful with this message.
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:37.020]   It might contain a virus or malicious file and then learn more.
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.860]   Why is this message in spam?
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.640]   Well because you marked this before or similar to messages that were detected by our
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.740]   spam filters, this is nice.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:48.200]   Yeah, this is a cool.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.200]   This is a really good feature.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.460]   I've had a few false positives in the past few weeks.
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:57.240]   I pretty much never look at my spam folder, but I realized that I'd missed an email and
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.180]   then found that it was in a headband spammed.
[00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:02.660]   And so this new feature will tell you why, which is helpful.
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.660]   Can you correct it though?
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:04.660]   You can't.
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:05.660]   It doesn't have a button saying.
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:08.100]   I assume if you un-spam it, that's a learning about it.
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.100]   Okay.
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.080]   Or if you respond to it, you are saying this is important.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.080]   You can say this is not spam.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:18.780]   So if it says the reason why is because you marked this person as spam before, you could
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.580]   go back and do that I guess.
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.580]   That would be nice.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.260]   Yeah, or if it's a link.
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.700]   I had the reverse happen this week.
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:28.580]   I used Priority Inbox and Kickstarter added their new follow feature.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:33.820]   And so I just got slammed with a rave level that's following you, which is awesome.
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:38.740]   But I kept unimportant in it and they just kept coming in.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:43.300]   So finally I just created a filter to remove it from my Priority Inbox.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.300]   This is good.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.280]   So here's free trial enlargement sent me a note.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.080]   Sossie Young College Hotties.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.320]   And be careful with this message.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.200]   Similar messages were used to steal people's personal information.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.960]   Oh, so it flagged it as a phishing attempt.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.840]   Because it has a link.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.800]   And then you can learn more.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.400]   This is good.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.400]   Good for Google.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.040]   That's a great educational feature.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.640]   So they're scanning the links inside messages.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:13.320]   If they know that one is malicious, they flag it.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.320]   I like it.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:19.260]   There's a couple other new Gmail features that just rolled out.
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.800]   Minor ones.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:26.060]   The buttons across your Gmail inbox, you can change the icons to be text labels.
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.560]   So in fact, just the other day I went to go mark a message of spam.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.720]   And I was like, which button is it?
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.680]   It's an exclamation mark icon that's not very clear.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.960]   But if you go into settings, you can change the button labels to words, which are just
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:40.760]   easier for people who are about eyesight or just forget what the exclamation point means.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.840]   And you can see that that was one little thing.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.360]   And then the other little thing is that you can label messages before you send them or
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.880]   as you're sending them.
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.920]   So if I'm sending Leo a message and I want to make sure I follow up with him in a week,
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.200]   I can add my follow up label as I compose it.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.520]   Whereas before you have to go label it after the fact.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.160]   So it's really neat to see that after all this time, Gmail is still--
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.520]   They're not resting on their laurels.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.520]   No, they're not.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.520]   Gmail is still getting better.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.240]   Gmail is one of Google's best products.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.880]   I think even better than search in some way.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.120]   So it's good to see that they're still working on it.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.280]   Why is this message in spam?
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:17.880]   It contains content that's typically used in spam messages.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.360]   It's good.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.200]   So this is really good.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:25.960]   I agree with the genome, but I just really do not like the redesign of the calendar in
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.960]   Gmail.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.760]   It's just it takes up way too much room.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.120]   I preferred the older.
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:37.080]   I got a long email from somebody complaining that contacts no longer had a call this person
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:40.520]   number button in it.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.520]   It's so funny.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.400]   You have Google wheeled such power.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.360]   Anything they change.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.640]   It affects millions of people.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.640]   It affects billions.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:48.640]   I mean, it's huge.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.640]   Right.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:53.880]   You mean the widget inside Gmail, the calendar widget inside Gmail or just calendar in general?
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:54.880]   Calendar in general.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.080]   I mean, I love the calendar widget in Gmail when it works.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:04.280]   I find it's like a 60% time I can add an event.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:09.160]   But no, just the amount of the header has increased on both of those apps.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.160]   Right.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:14.000]   Because they added the search box across like the unified search box across all the products,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   right?
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Well, and the black bar.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.280]   And the black bar in the same bar.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:23.200]   They just seem to add a lot of header space even beyond the site items.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.640]   I have a question, geniuses.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:29.600]   So Gmail's been telling me, ask me the question constantly.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.160]   Should Gmail be allowed to open these links?
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.040]   And then I go to the explanation page and I can't figure it out.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.560]   Oh, you're mail to links, you mean?
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.360]   So if someone's email address shows up on a web page, you can in Chrome now and a Firefox
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:49.800]   set as well, I think you can say, make Gmail, web based Gmail, my default mail.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.800]   Yes.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.800]   Drives me crazy.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.680]   So if someone's email address, it'll open up a compose page with the two field filled
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.680]   in.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.680]   It's pretty useful.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.120]   But I asked you every time.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.120]   No.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.320]   Oh, because I don't answer it.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.320]   Because the explanation page was awful.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.400]   And it's asked me several times because they have many computers, right?
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.520]   So each computer asked me again.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.520]   Right.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.760]   While I'm on the subject of things that drive me crazy, when I was going back and forth
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:22.360]   today, trying to test this with Eileen, once I get signed, I have two Gmail accounts
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.360]   open, right?
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:30.880]   And I have things that string off of that reader and plus and so on out of each one,
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.880]   different things.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.720]   And I want to get them both run and it works fine for a few weeks.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:39.120]   And suddenly, if one thing hiccups, trying to get them back, both running without killing
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.720]   each other just drives me nutty.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:47.520]   You almost understand the switch user dropped out.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:53.560]   That happens to be as well.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:57.360]   This switch user works kind of like Brady said, like 60% of the time.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.360]   It's great.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.360]   You can be excited to do accounts.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.360]   But if one gets signed out or your cookies get screwed up somewhere or you go to an app
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:06.280]   that doesn't support, like if I go to check out, yeah, things get screwed up and you have
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.280]   to reconfigure.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.920]   Now, that's not just you, Jeff.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:12.880]   That's I think that's across the board.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:16.960]   You know, I suddenly reminded I use a Chrome extension called to pain that I just tweeted
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:22.240]   about to you, Leo and to Gina, that allows me to shrink the black bar.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.400]   So there you go.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.400]   Wow.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.400]   It's nice and tiny.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.400]   Yep.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.400]   It makes way.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.400]   It's really nice.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.600]   Oh, I like that.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.800]   We're going to take a break.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.160]   When we come back, $150 Nexus tablet.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.600]   Now, this is a rumor I like.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.600]   We know that $99 was the right price for the HP touchpad.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.480]   How much would you pay for a Nexus tablet?
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:52.600]   But first a word from Ford, the Ford Motor come Ford motor from the fork.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.600]   Ford.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:45:00.760]   I called it the toward forest the other day, the Ford Motor company for calm slash cars
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:05.920]   slash tourists wants to talk a little bit about some of the technologies they're putting
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:11.680]   into their new vehicles in particular, this 2013 tourists with curve control.
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:16.080]   Actually, if you go to Ford.com slash cars slash tourists, you'll see a whole bunch of
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:23.480]   new technologies in the Ford tourists, the adaptive cruise control, the collision warning
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:29.120]   with brake support, the torque vectoring, of course, that great eco boost engine we've
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.120]   been talking about.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:40.040]   But let's talk about this curve control 100 times a second, 100 times a second every 10
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:46.960]   milliseconds, the car's computer looks at the roll rate, the yaw rate, the lateral acceleration,
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.960]   wheel speed and steering angle.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.120]   It's what it's doing though.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.920]   So that's the roll rate, the yaw rate, the lateral acceleration, the steering.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:58.480]   It's trying to figure out if you're oversteering, if you're trying to turn the car faster, they
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.280]   can go.
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:05.120]   And if you, if it says, you know what, you're going to, this car is going to break away.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:11.720]   It immediately takes action, it reduces the engine torque, it applies four wheel braking,
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:17.400]   it slows the vehicle up to 10 miles an hour per second, wet or dry payment.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:21.520]   The upshot of this, and you got to watch the video because there's a really dramatic video
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:27.640]   of this, is that your car just corners beautifully, much more securely.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.680]   You don't even know, you don't even know it.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.440]   It just does it for you.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:36.840]   I think, you know, what happened is, as technology improves, we can make these cars safer and
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.400]   safer and safer.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:44.280]   And, and, and it's not building an autonomous car, it's building a car that helps you drive
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.280]   better.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:52.580]   And I'm just, I'm just really impressed with how Ford is, is putting engineering front
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.960]   and center, making 21st century vehicles.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.960]   If you want to find out more, that's the thing to do, but you go drive one of a Ford
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.800]   dealer near you.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.880]   Or visit the website, Ford.com/car/touris.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:08.800]   And look at, watch the video of the car with the curve control without the curve control.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.320]   It's really amazing.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:15.200]   Ford.com/car/touris.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.680]   And we thank you so much for their support.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:18.840]   I see World's Colleidion here.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:23.680]   I imagine Matt cut saying to a SEO guy, you're over torquing.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:27.160]   Break, break.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:31.520]   Leah Buskell joined us on triangulation this afternoon, by the way, 4 o'clock Pacific,
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.760]   7 p.m. Eastern time.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.000]   She was a founder of TaskRabbit.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.960]   It's such a cool story.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.920]   She and her husband were talking thinking, you know, they're really out of, we ought
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:43.640]   to be so cool if we could find somebody to do this chore for us, what it was, putting
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.640]   together the furniture.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:45.640]   I can't remember.
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.160]   It was something like putting together Ikea furniture or shopping.
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.040]   And she said, there ought to be an app for that.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.800]   She's also an engineer at IBM, I believe.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.800]   Oh, she's smart.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:01.600]   So she wrote the software, they put out this app and they just recently got it.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.160]   Huge.
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.720]   Was it $21 million in venture capital, something like that?
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:06.720]   Yeah, she's great.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.720]   She's speaking at where?
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.240]   Actually, she's one of our main stage speakers.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.560]   I guess it is a location-based thing, isn't it?
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.920]   A geo component to that.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.880]   Sure, because you don't want to help her in New York City doing your shopping in San
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.160]   Francisco, it wouldn't help you.
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.160]   Waiting for your iPad.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.160]   Wouldn't that?
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.160]   Oh, that's what you needed.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.760]   Oh, I know people who did that.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.320]   Pay somebody to get in line for you.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.320]   Well, it's more important for the iPhone 4S than the iPad.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:31.160]   The iPad can go right now and get one, I think.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:36.880]   The Wear Conference is coming up April 2nd through 4th in San Francisco.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.560]   So Brad is responsible for this conference.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:44.960]   So tell us a little bit about, I mean, this has just taken off the last couple of years.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:49.080]   When Marissa Meyer was put in charge of location at Google, then you knew this is important.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:54.600]   She spoke last year and this year we have Brian McDonald, BAM speaking.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:59.280]   And he was one of the co-founders of Keohol with John Hankey.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.280]   Keohol was who?
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.040]   Keohol is Google Earth.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.040]   Google Earth.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:10.000]   So I mean, back in like 2006 when Microsoft, when O'Reilly launched this conference, 2005,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.640]   we had Brett Taylor take the stage, now CTO Facebook and launched the Google Maps API.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:17.640]   Right.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.600]   And when we ever launched Google Maps wasn't in the cloud.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.480]   I mean, we like, it was not there.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.600]   They were still working on it.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:26.680]   And Google Earth launched at where?
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.840]   Virtual Earth launched at where?
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:32.040]   Street View launched at where?
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.840]   And this year we've got a lot of great speakers.
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.640]   Google's going to be there.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.640]   Four squares going to be there.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:42.360]   And you know, one of the big things that we're going to be talking about is kind of the place
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:45.160]   of Google Maps versus OpenStreetMap.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.160]   Right now.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.160]   Yeah, that's going to be how discussion is it?
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.160]   It's a very interesting.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.160]   It's a big topic right now.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:56.880]   The way I look at it is Google changed the web forever when they released Google Maps
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.880]   in Windows 5.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:58.880]   With an API.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.880]   With an API.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.960]   Well, with an unofficial API that was hacked within 48 hours by Paul Rautomacher and Adrian
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.120]   Halvadi.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:11.520]   And then five months later when they released a formal Maps API and they completely democratized
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.960]   mapping on the web.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.040]   Not the data underneath, but mapping in general.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:18.160]   And suddenly a website could put maps on it.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.160]   Right.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:24.840]   And in the past fall, they've decided they've started adding significant costs to using
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.800]   their maps.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.560]   And that is driving a lot of companies.
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.880]   Street easy, a New York company, Four Square, another one.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:34.880]   Even Apple.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.640]   Well, I think that's a different strategic bet.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.480]   They just don't like Google.
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:43.560]   You know, I mean, Apple has bought, they bought C3, they bought PlaySpace, they're going
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:44.560]   to do it themselves.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.560]   Well, they bought.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:51.480]   So, you know, one of the things that's happening with OpenStreetMaps is people start to look
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:55.960]   around, well, wait a minute, I'm going from free with Google Street or Google Maps to
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:59.600]   suddenly have to pay, in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars for it.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.600]   Right.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.600]   Is there another option?
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.160]   And when they see OpenStreetMaps, suddenly they're like, oh, but I can have a little more
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.400]   control.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:09.120]   The cool thing about OSM is it's open source.
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:14.400]   It's volunteer driven, 400,000 volunteers with GPS's or even without because what you
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.800]   can do is if you know an area, you can correct the map.
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:21.720]   You just sign up for an account and you can say, no, no, no, that's a one-way street now.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:27.520]   So presumably with that kind of crowdsourcing, these would be really reliable up to date maps.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:33.280]   The only negative is in sparsely populated areas that the maps just disappear.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.280]   Really?
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:38.080]   You know, but it's competitive with Google and its many places.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.960]   Certainly in populated areas, no question.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:44.240]   You know, they both have their strengths and weaknesses.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.240]   Okay.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.240]   And I mean, Google has--
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.480]   Google buys its Mac data, right?
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.480]   They used to.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.480]   They used to buy from Tele Atlas and NFTEC, which used to be independent companies.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.240]   And now they're doing a lot of their own.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:58.200]   So if you look at the bottom right-hand corner of Google Maps, you can see who the data provider
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.200]   is.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.200]   Right.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.760]   And about a year and a half, two years ago, they switched over to doing a lot of their
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.760]   own data.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.320]   Is that in the process, the street view process or--
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:11.040]   In the process, street view, they've got, you know, hundreds of cars that they send around.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:15.920]   And then also Map Maker, which is an online tool where you can correct streets, you can
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.880]   correct that dead end where your house is.
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:23.000]   So in this case, when we look at Petaluma, where we are right now, that's Google data.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   Yep.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.120]   And edit in Google Map Maker is a button right next to it.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.120]   Now tell me about that.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:29.280]   Well, if you click on that, you could fix it.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.280]   Exactly.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.720]   I'll open street map very similar.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:38.760]   So they have taken on this task of basically allowing people to change their maps.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.360]   Tele Atlas does the same thing.
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.760]   I think I'm not sure if Bing does or not.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:46.040]   Well, I mean, Bing Maps has now become Nokia Maps effectively.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.040]   Right.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:53.040]   You know, that was part of the Windows Mobile deal was Nokia took Windows Mobile Bing,
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.880]   Microsoft took Nokia Maps.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:55.880]   Hey Brady.
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.880]   It's Map.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.840]   That's still in the play in any way at all.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:03.520]   As far as I know, they are the second largest kind of mapping site.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.800]   So it goes Google, then Map Play.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:05.800]   Realist and then Bing.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:06.800]   Bigger than Bing.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:07.800]   Wow.
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:08.800]   Yeah, that's my understanding.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.680]   That's about 35%, 30 something percent.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.000]   And where does Map Quest Maps come from?
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   Are they now?
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.680]   They probably use NapTech to tell you, but they also have been investing in OpenStreetMap.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:22.960]   And the founder of OpenStreetMap is now at Bing, Steve Coast.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:23.960]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:26.080]   He went there about 16 months ago.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.720]   And so you've got two of the biggest brains, you know, in the geospays.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:33.640]   You've got Steve Coast, and then you've got Blaze who created photosense.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:34.880]   You know, maybe you've seen the TED Talk.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:35.880]   Yeah, that's amazing.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.720]   He's one of the chief architects in Amazon.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:39.000]   That's brilliant stuff.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.200]   But on the other hand, I love the idea of having an open, I mean, look at this.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.680]   This is our data.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.200]   This is the earth.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.480]   I love the idea of it being open.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.360]   What about companies like FourSquared?
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:53.080]   Do they obviously create their own database?
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.640]   You're always adding venues.
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.800]   Do they then sell it?
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.800]   No, not yet.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.040]   So they have a large POI database at this point.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.040]   Well, you know, Instagram uses it.
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.040]   Instagram uses there.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:06.520]   When you go to locate on Instagram, you'll see a powered by FourSquared.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:08.920]   Is that free or are they licensing that?
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:09.920]   I wonder.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.240]   We don't know.
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.640]   There'll be...
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.640]   It's free, I think.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.680]   And then there's companies like SimpleGeo.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.640]   There's interesting stuff coming out in that space.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.920]   SimpleGeo is no more.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:25.560]   SimpleGeo was bought by Urban Airship about two months ago, and the engineers went to
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:26.560]   Urban Airship.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:30.320]   Urban Airship is a Portland-based company that does messaging.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:34.440]   So the idea of SimpleGeo was it was a back-end provider of map information, then they were
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.760]   aggregating data from all sorts of places.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:41.880]   And so if I wanted to do a new app and I needed that data, I could sign up and get the SimpleGeo
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.880]   database.
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.520]   Was Urban Airship going to continue doing that or something?
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.080]   It doesn't seem like they are.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.080]   That's very interesting.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.520]   But maybe it wasn't a good business.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.880]   Well, down in LA, there's factual.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.040]   And they do a lot of great stuff.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:58.600]   And Tyler Bell, who used to run Geo for Yahoo, is down, is working for them as a VP.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.600]   And then...
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:03.920]   But the people are really going to capitalize on this switch to OSM, our development seed,
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.960]   which is a company out of DC run by this guy, Eric Gunderson.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:11.040]   And that's who 3DZ and 4-square both used.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.600]   And yeah, I was chatting with him the other day.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.640]   And it's really, like in the past year, the data's gotten better.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.240]   And the open stack has gotten better.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:22.160]   So Leaflets is a JavaScript control for maps.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:26.920]   Mapbox is development seed's product that they serve the maps from.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.760]   And then TileMill, which lets you make your own tiles.
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.240]   So what company is that pretty?
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:33.240]   It's a seed?
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.240]   Development seed.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:39.320]   Because think up uses the Google Maps API and they're deprecating version 2 and I'm
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:40.320]   charging.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.480]   And think up installs don't get enough views to go to the charge tier.
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:47.080]   But because think up's open source, I've been sort of thinking about using OSM.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:51.480]   But I started to look at OSM and I didn't see a lot of API information.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:56.520]   So is development seed kind of offering an API for easy kind of...
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.520]   Oh yeah.
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:59.520]   I would go check with them.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:00.520]   I can put you in touch with Eric.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.520]   I mean, I'm sure he's...
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.320]   The other thing to consider Gina is map abstraction.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.320]   Okay.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:10.160]   And map abstraction is a JavaScript framework that lets you easily switch between say Bing,
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.040]   Google, Yahoo.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.320]   And it's just a framework.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.320]   So the...
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:17.160]   Also the abstraction layer on top of the APIs that you write to.
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.160]   Very cool.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.160]   And if Google says, "Hey, we're going to charge you," you say, "Well, I'll use Bing and you
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.400]   don't have to do anything new."
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.400]   Very cool.
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.400]   Very cool.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:28.000]   You know, with 4-square switch to OSM on their website, right?
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.720]   But not on their mobile apps.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.960]   And that's me signal like, "Oh, the API.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:35.040]   There isn't a good mobile API quite yet."
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.040]   So in my head, I kind of...
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:37.040]   Oh, I think...
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.640]   Oh, the API must not be as good.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.640]   No, I...
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:40.640]   It doesn't sound like that's not the case.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   I think it's a...
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:44.560]   I think it's just a matter of like working through all the bugs.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:48.440]   I think updating a mobile app that you have to release through Apple probably takes a
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:49.440]   little bit longer.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:52.920]   Plus, you know, mobile is their lifeblood.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.920]   So they got to be careful.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:55.920]   The website, they've got to...
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.920]   Try it out.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:57.920]   See.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:58.920]   Try it out.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.800]   Well, before you, you know, buy it.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:05.320]   The nice thing that both Apple and 4-square did, they made their own tiles on top of the
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.320]   OSM data.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.600]   So they actually look beautiful.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:11.440]   The OSM data, hey, it looks like everybody's a map.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.640]   But it's important to release.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:16.640]   Like Google Maps enables mapping across the web right now.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:17.640]   Right.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:18.640]   And it really...
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:19.640]   It's key.
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:20.640]   It's absolutely key.
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.640]   It's the web in that way.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.960]   So was it in the end, back to where you started, Brady?
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:28.240]   Was it a mistake for Google to put a paywall up?
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.120]   It depends on their goals.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:36.400]   I mean, they claim that I think only 1% of sites will be affected by this.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:40.440]   And gathering all that data is very expensive.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:42.240]   They needed to monetize it, I understand that.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.240]   Pay for it somehow.
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:46.560]   It does feel like a little bait and switch though, where they will give it away until
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:47.560]   you're dependent on it.
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.800]   Now we're going to charge you.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:53.160]   I mean, but without Google, they would have already been paying tons.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:56.520]   So in some ways, you could look at this as we're no longer subsidizing a market and
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.760]   they're allowing startups to thrive.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:57:59.760]   One thing that's scary...
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.760]   And they're leveling the playing field.
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:05.360]   Scares me about OSM when I hear that their leader went to Microsoft, things like that
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.360]   is...
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:10.080]   I remember what happened to CDDB when it was sold to GraceNote and all of a sudden this
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:14.640]   database that had been created by users freely giving their time suddenly became a commercial
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.040]   database.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:19.720]   And in effect, they capitalized on the efforts of users.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:23.520]   Is there anything to guarantee that OSM data stays open and free?
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:26.600]   I think the licensing is much stronger around that.
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:31.400]   Also, I think Microsoft now understands the value of open and open source.
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.080]   And if they were to try to take that...
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:35.080]   I hate to see that.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.080]   I don't think they could.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:39.160]   I mean, just the licensing on OpenStreetMap just wouldn't allow them to do that.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.880]   Steve doesn't own that.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:47.040]   So I think it's actually like a great endorsement for the open model.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:51.400]   And they have to get permission from the people who contributed the data to change that licensing.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:52.400]   Good.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:58.320]   But I don't think there's anything that's going to change the licensing of OpenStreetMap.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:01.240]   At least by Steve going to Microsoft.
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:02.240]   I don't think it has anything.
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:03.240]   Okay.
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.240]   I hate to see that happen.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:08.360]   A number of the other people on the board of OpenStreetMap would not allow that to happen.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:11.920]   So now, OpenStreetMap lacks the satellite images.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:12.920]   Those are expensive.
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.120]   And obviously, you're not going to do that in an open source for you.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:20.760]   But companies like DigitalGlove make the satellite images available to the OpenStreetMap folks
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.480]   to create new maps.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.880]   So they start from the satellite?
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:25.880]   Well, no.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.280]   It's more that they can use that in some areas.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:29.280]   They start like in the US.
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:32.040]   They use the Tiger data, which was released by US.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.120]   But in say Haiti.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:37.640]   So when Port-au-Prince had the earthquake, they needed maps.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:42.520]   And so DigitalGlove, and I forget the name of the other company, my apologies, you guys,
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:46.760]   immediately sent their satellites there and then made the images freely available so that
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:52.880]   OpenStreetMapers around the world could create new maps and let people know.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:54.080]   Same thing happened with Katrina.
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.840]   Really great stuff.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:57.920]   And that was, you know, OpenStreetMap has saved lives.
[00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:03.840]   And the humanitarian OpenStreetMap team is currently still working in Haiti and in Indonesia.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.840]   And actually, I hope to go to play with them this summer.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:07.840]   Neat.
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:08.840]   That's really neat.
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.840]   Oh, good for you.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:10.840]   That sounds awesome.
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:11.840]   It's a vacation.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.840]   It's what we call vacation.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:14.840]   That's a fun vacation.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.640]   - It's a, it's a, it's a bradycation.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.180]   (laughs)
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.360]   - Brady you are a fountain of knowledge,
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.460]   that was a great segue.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.100]   - I am fascinated by location.
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:25.880]   I think it's a, it's really an exciting area.
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.080]   And I certainly talk a lot about it when,
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.240]   as we talk about Google 'cause clearly,
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.140]   Google understands that, I mean,
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.400]   look at Eric Schmitt's pants example.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.020]   That search, and tying search to location
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:37.880]   really adds to the value of the search for search.
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.800]   - Oh yeah, totally, yeah.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.680]   - Cool.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.000]   - And I really want, is my phone,
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.200]   my phone knows where I am.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:44.560]   - Right. - I want it.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.320]   - I want all the services online
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.600]   to know where I am based on my phone.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.160]   Like I want, I want context,
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.560]   I want location added to everything.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:58.720]   When I wanna share it, based off of the smartest server.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.520]   - You kind of, I mean,
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.320]   you get some Wi-Fi act, location.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.520]   - You get some, yeah. - Yeah.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.360]   But it's very granular, it's not very granular,
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.040]   it's very macro.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:11.240]   So moving along,
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.160]   Nexus tablet, according to Android and me,
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:20.160]   the Asus Nexus tablet may be priced as low as $149
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.680]   for a seven inch tablet.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.600]   That does, you know, we know that $99 was enough
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.480]   to sell the HP touchpad to millions.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:35.200]   The Amazon fire selling quite well, $200.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.320]   Is this a sweet spot?
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.240]   Would you run out and buy another tablet
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.320]   for $150?
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.240]   It's a quad-core Tegra 3.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:48.200]   - $150 is very tempting.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.160]   - I don't even know if they can make it at that price.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.120]   - They're even affordable.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.040]   - Yeah.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.040]   - Yeah, I mean, that's close to an impulse buy.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.360]   - Would Google be subsidizing at that price?
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.360]   - I don't know.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.200]   - I mean, I don't know.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.040]   Look at the question,
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:02.880]   whether we buy another one,
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.960]   though we would.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.520]   The question is obviously whether
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.480]   this would increase the volume immensely.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:09.680]   And then we throw in a new number I just saw.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:10.880]   I won't use this as my number.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.840]   And I got it because I can't remember the source.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.760]   I saw it just before show time.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.360]   That
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:21.080]   activations of smartphones in China
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.800]   just exceeded those in America.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:23.640]   - Wow.
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.120]   - The only basis, right?
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.200]   So you start to go back to everything
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.600]   we were talking about mapping,
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.640]   go to the $150 tablet,
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.200]   look at Nokia's,
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.400]   why is Nokia's still,
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.480]   even though it's on death throes in our view,
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.480]   why is it still huge?
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.680]   Because it's an inexpensive phone
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.040]   that owns that part of the market.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.400]   I was just talking with an executive here in Stockholm
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.960]   and saying,
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.040]   we're all iPhone people,
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.800]   but saying that Android's going to take over the world.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:54.160]   Yeah, I think $150 really starts to motivate people
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.480]   who never were considered tablet to get one.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:01.120]   - Did you get the Google wage email?
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.080]   - Aw, talk about the final mail in the coffin.
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.880]   I got that email and I was like,
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.280]   oh, this is a joke or it must be spam.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.720]   Like one of my friends is messing with me.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.040]   No, no, like this was the email that went out.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:13.880]   - Same.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.360]   - Not also reminding everyone that Google way
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.040]   was shutting down, wave with a V,
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:21.400]   but the from name was Google wage with a G.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.040]   So it was a typo in the from.
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.600]   So, you know, the G's right above the V on your keyboard,
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.520]   but it was just like, I think,
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.760]   I mean, it just seemed like it's just sad,
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.200]   but yet appropriate ending too.
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:37.800]   - It's like there's one intern responsible at this point.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.960]   That's it.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:40.960]   - Google wage.
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.880]   It was a good run Google wage.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.480]   (laughing)
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.200]   - I'm sorry, I shouldn't rub it in.
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.440]   - No, it's okay, I'm glad.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.760]   It's cathartic for me.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.360]   - The good news is they are putting spell check in docs.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.120]   I don't know if it's related,
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:59.320]   but they're gonna have web based spell check
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.400]   built into docs.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.600]   - This is really cool.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.880]   - Yeah.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:08.880]   - 'Cause it's spell check that learns from Google's index.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:11.560]   So if you type, you know, "Ekland" is in "Ekland,"
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.160]   it knows to suggest Iceland for the first Ikland
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.640]   and Ireland for the second one.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.800]   - Wow, wow.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.840]   - So that's, it's really smart.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:23.360]   - That is much better than anything we've seen before.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.440]   - That is for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.480]   - We're right about it.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.320]   - Yeah.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.160]   - In six months.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.000]   - In six months.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.240]   (laughing)
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:34.680]   - The email could have come more, more appropriately
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.120]   from Google Wake.
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.200]   - Oh. - Oh.
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.920]   - Now that would have hurt.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.640]   - And we have to go tight. - It's too far away.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.200]   - Google Wake.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.040]   - Aw. - Aw.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:48.920]   - Let's see what else.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:52.240]   I'm just looking, we have a few more stories we could get to,
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:55.800]   or we could take a break and get our tool tip and...
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.640]   - Let's see here.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:57.640]   - Number of the week.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:58.760]   I don't want to skip anything,
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.360]   but there's an awful lot more privacy probes,
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.120]   of course, the Wall Street Journal writing about...
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.080]   - About this.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:09.400]   - You know, they also, by the way, just so you know,
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.440]   that it's not limited just to Google,
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.640]   the Wall Street Journal had a headline today,
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.200]   about Apple.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.400]   I got it, that was actually,
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.080]   let me see if I can find this.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.800]   It was talking about the Apple iPad.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.520]   It was a great article.
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.280]   (mouse clicking)
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:38.400]   And it was, it just showed that at this point,
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:43.400]   they called Apple faces concern over iPad Speed Trap.
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:49.360]   Video Speed Trap lurks in new iPad.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.800]   It's something, I think what's happened is,
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.320]   they've told the headline writer's of the Wall Street Journal,
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.880]   please drive traffic,
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:58.640]   because the story basically says,
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.880]   the new iPad's LTE is so fast,
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.520]   you may be tempted to watch more video than before.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:06.520]   That's the story.
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.360]   - What?
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.520]   (laughing)
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:09.680]   - That makes no sense.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.320]   - That's the speed trap?
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.440]   - That's the speed trap.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.200]   Watch out, you might have to spend more money
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.200]   because it's so fast.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:23.000]   Not that, you know, 'cause,
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.760]   and I think what they want to encourage people to think
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.200]   is because LTE downloads so fast,
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.680]   you'll be paying more money for your bandwidth,
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:30.920]   but that's not the case,
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.200]   because a movie is a gigabyte,
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.280]   is a gigabyte, is a gigabyte, you watch a movie,
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.400]   it doesn't matter how much faster it is,
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.520]   you're using the same amount of data.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.320]   So what they're really saying is,
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:43.480]   but because it was so easy to watch that movie,
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.360]   you'll probably watch a lot more,
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.240]   and then you'll have to pay more.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:51.840]   - What I saw was tweets from people were saying that
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.520]   they realized that watching a whole movie
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.040]   is pretty much the month's allocation,
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.080]   and I think what that means is,
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.680]   they never watched movies before,
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.160]   'cause they couldn't-- - Okay, right.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.000]   - 'Cause it's a gigabyte.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.040]   - They said, "Oops, this doesn't take you very far,
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.840]   "it's a rotten deal, that's a story."
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:07.840]   It's a very different story.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.680]   - It's a different story than the speed trap
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.040]   lurking in the new iPad, what they should say for--
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.800]   - That's the worldview of the Wall Street Journal now,
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.720]   is always, you know, bad technology.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.640]   - Right, it's very interesting.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.240]   I mean, I think that, I mean, it's not just Google,
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.080]   it's not just privacy, it's, you know,
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.280]   even Apple, which, as we know, the Journal loves.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.320]   - Yep.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:31.480]   - Google defends hosting site under attack
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:36.480]   from the MPAA hotfile.com is in trouble
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:41.800]   with the Hollywood folks.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.520]   It's an internet locker service,
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.200]   the Motion Picture Association of America says,
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.360]   "People are putting pirated films on there."
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:55.200]   Google has filed an amicus brief right on Google
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.280]   saying hotfile is protected by the DMCA.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:01.720]   Of course, remember that YouTube would also be under fire.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.440]   And it's important that people understand
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.480]   how the safe harbor provision works.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:12.800]   So Google filed in favor of a friend of the court brief
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.720]   in favor of hotfile, thank you.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.720]   - No, they definitely have a horse in this race,
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.560]   but it's nice to see them stand up for the little--
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.480]   - Yeah. - Little, little.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:20.320]   - Yep.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:25.320]   - And here from All Things D, Comcast Verizon say,
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:29.400]   "They're itching to fight Google and Apple."
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:34.800]   This is Peter Kafka writing,
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.400]   so there's a hearing today,
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:42.000]   Comcast Verizon testifying in front of a Senate subcommittee
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.720]   saying why it's okay if we work together.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.200]   (laughing)
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:51.920]   We really, it's not a bad thing
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.520]   by enhancing the cable companies
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.280]   and Verizon's own products and services.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:59.000]   The Comcast Verizon joint venture will compete
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.960]   with similar solutions from AT&T
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.600]   dish Google, Apple, Microsoft, and others,
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.720]   spurring them to respond perpetuating a cycle
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.880]   of competitive investment.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.920]   So it's okay if Verizon and Comcast team up.
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:16.840]   Nothing to say about that.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.000]   Moving on.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.200]   I'm just throwing these, I'm throwing them out
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.360]   if you have something to say.
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.320]   - Orables.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:24.760]   - You can say something about it.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.520]   Let's see, another Wall Street Journal headline,
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.600]   "Amazon adds that robotic touch."
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.200]   - I had to say a fairly cool story.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.440]   I read it to New York Times though,
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.680]   but this is Amazon buying Kiva--
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.520]   - To be clear.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.680]   - Second largest purchase, the Kiva--
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.520]   - It's almost a billion dollars.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.360]   - It's almost a billion dollars.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.120]   $775 million.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.760]   - Right, and what I didn't realize about them
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:47.400]   is that what the robots do is they pick up
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:50.840]   an entire rack, it looks like a rack,
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:55.480]   and bring it to the pick and ship person.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:58.120]   - People have, I'm surprised Mike Daisy
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.520]   has not done a monologue on this.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:02.080]   People have said that it is horrible,
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.400]   he's busy doing other things.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.120]   It's horrible-- - It's poor robots.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:08.680]   - Those poor robots, the life they lead.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.800]   No, no, people do say it's not fun working
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.520]   at an Amazon facility being the pick and pack person.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:17.240]   I imagine it's hard work being a warehouse worker in general.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:21.240]   - So having robots do the heavy lifting is kinda cool.
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.520]   - You know, back in the early days, at Christmas time,
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.880]   all of Amazon would empty out,
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.320]   and everyone from execs down would be at the warehouse.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.160]   - Right.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:31.600]   - And it was only in the past four or five years, I think,
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:32.640]   that that stopped happening.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.080]   - Craton Barrel's using these robots, gap.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.840]   - And Amazon wants to have services for everything.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.920]   And like, you know-- - And believe it--
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.600]   - And believe it for your stuff, basically.
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:47.360]   The Kiva robots cost between a few million dollars
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:49.640]   to as much as $20 million.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.680]   - What fast is this, by the way, Brady,
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.920]   is that the email I just sent you a little while ago,
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.080]   or we'll go to send you.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:57.920]   - Oh, about 10?
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.320]   - I'm fascinated by the mail industry, right?
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.680]   The first class letter is dead,
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.680]   it subsidizes other mail, which includes advertising,
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:05.720]   that's gonna go.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.560]   And the only profitable portion of delivery,
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.600]   of course, is physical goods.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.080]   And I've been arguing for a long time
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.560]   that retail at a local level becomes more and more inefficient.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:20.200]   It's only good for things that expire,
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.480]   or things that require immediate gratification,
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.280]   whether that's certain things at the drugstore,
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.800]   or whether that's, "I gotta have the new
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.520]   "watch me call it pad."
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.600]   But other than that, retail's gonna shrink and shrink.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:35.200]   And so, every time Amazon makes consolidation
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.840]   and fulfillment more efficient,
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.840]   watch out for the consequent effect on local retail.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.080]   - Oh, I mean, in Seattle, we have Amazon Fresh.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.480]   And I'll tell ya, it's awesome.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.320]   - What's that?
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.320]   - Oh, it's grocery.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.440]   - Amazon delivers your groceries.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:53.040]   - I could have, you know, I'll be home in Seattle tomorrow,
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.280]   I could have my food waiting for me.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.040]   When I get there, you can get, I think you can get booze.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:01.280]   You can definitely get, you know, frozen goods,
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.280]   you pick the delivery time,
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.400]   it drops it off at your door.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:05.520]   It's great.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.840]   And they have CDs, DVDs, books, various electronics,
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:09.600]   if you need it.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.440]   - Cool.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:14.120]   - And it's something like, if you order enough in a month,
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.800]   you become a big reddish.
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.880]   (laughing)
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.120]   - All right, I got one for Jeff.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.840]   The New York Times has now said,
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:24.640]   not 20 articles a month, you only get 10.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.960]   That's it.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:26.800]   - Yeah.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:33.240]   Listen, people think that I'm against paying for content
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:37.800]   and insert plug for Gutenberg the Geek or two books here.
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:39.120]   I'm not.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.960]   And people think that I've said that paywalls
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:41.800]   will never work,
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.120]   or I've said that it'll work with the New York Times.
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.840]   And it has worked with the New York Times.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:45.880]   The question though,
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.200]   always becomes what's the definition of worked
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.880]   and will it work for others?
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.440]   So what's happened here is the Times has always had levers.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.280]   And they went to what they, in one sense,
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.600]   is a high number of pages
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.920]   before you hit the wall, 20 pages a month.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.720]   And very few readers hit that number.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.160]   And those who did, who were the most loyal,
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.880]   got subsidized for the last six months or so
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.440]   by a big advertiser.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.280]   So now the Times is saying, okay, well,
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.480]   we didn't die there.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.480]   Let's change the lever and try to get more of it.
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.840]   Now, a couple of things about this.
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.240]   One is the Times can afford to do this,
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.400]   but other newspapers can't because the Times is sells
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.240]   advertising and it's such a premium
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.520]   and other crappy newspapers can't.
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.160]   So the Times doesn't want to sell out.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.360]   It doesn't want to sell what the market will bear.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.920]   It doesn't want to reduce the cost of its inventory.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.520]   It actually once sold in the inventory, just less of it.
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.720]   But it has to maintain its prices at a high level.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:40.800]   So it can afford to do this.
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:41.640]   It can also afford to do it
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.480]   'cause it's the New York Times
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.080]   and it's that goddamn good.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:49.960]   Now, the contrary of this,
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.880]   is the tragedy to me in this,
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.720]   the unspoken story in this,
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.480]   is that when the Times tells us
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.560]   that very, very few people ever hit 20 page views a month,
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:02.100]   that's a terrible commentary on its engagement.
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:04.840]   - Yeah. - And more on their trekking.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.040]   - It's true. - Right.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:06.880]   - But one of the other, right?
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:07.920]   - I think it is the engagement.
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.840]   I think that this is true of news sites generally.
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:10.920]   When we did research at CUNY,
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.280]   we found that news sites as a rule
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:15.640]   have about 12 page views per user per month,
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.880]   whereas Facebook gets that every day.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.520]   I'm not saying newspapers should be Facebook,
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:23.400]   but I am saying that the target's somewhere in the middle.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.840]   So, to me, strategically what the Times should be doing
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:28.200]   is coming up with ways,
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:33.200]   instead of lowering the wall, make more people hit it.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.880]   Or I wrote a post a few weeks ago,
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:38.680]   looking at the idea of a reverse pay meter.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:40.800]   I know some sites that get traffic
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.840]   from out of their market that is useless to them.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:43.880]   So, when I've told them,
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.280]   and I'm supposed to get any of the paint walls,
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.120]   I've said to them, put them in a paint wall,
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.560]   where after the first page, you get hit.
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.560]   Because those people are not valuable to you.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.760]   You can't monetize them.
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:56.560]   They actually cost you money, the minimus, in bandwidth.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.920]   And what you should be doing instead
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.400]   is rewarding the people who bring value to your site.
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.400]   They bring value to your site by reading you,
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:06.080]   by clicking on your ads, by contributing content,
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.400]   by recommending you, by doing tasks.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.080]   All these things, if newspapers looked at themselves
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:13.560]   as being in the relationship business,
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.760]   instead of the content sales business,
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.280]   it would turn the economics of the paint wall 180.
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.800]   But, having said all that,
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.360]   see you started me, Leo.
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.800]   - I knew I would, I just wanted to--
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:25.640]   - I just wanna-- - I just wanna--
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.720]   (laughing)
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.200]   - I mean, said all that, yes, the Times is magnificent.
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.400]   I pay for the Times, we even get it in paper.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.040]   Thus, I get the paper free online.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.600]   - That's how I get it. - I use this app.
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.560]   I would continue to do so.
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:42.640]   However, on my iPad, I'm gonna confess something
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.320]   to you about my iPad in a second.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.920]   On my iPad, I read the Times,
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.280]   and I now read the Economist.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.720]   I tried, for example, a New Yorker.
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:56.400]   It's still, even virtually, piled up in the corner unwread.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.240]   (laughing)
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:00.440]   - I know, but at least it takes up no space.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:01.880]   - So, I didn't wanna pay for it.
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:03.400]   So, I canceled that.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:05.440]   Before the show today, in fact, while I was sitting
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.800]   in my cozy conference room here, killing time,
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:12.360]   I was looking at the apps, the magazine apps,
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:16.200]   and so on, in the news store, newsstand for Apple.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.840]   And I can't find anything I really wanna buy.
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:21.720]   So, the notion that the Times paywall works
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:24.760]   is true for the Times.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.480]   Though it has an impact, I think,
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:28.320]   on the strategy of the Times and how they think,
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.800]   but that's their decision.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.360]   But I also caution it's not gonna work universally.
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.320]   - Jeff, can you be-- - And I'm gonna make
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.400]   a confession now, go ahead.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:38.360]   - Yeah, yeah, no, I wanna hear your confession first.
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.520]   - iPad confession? - Yeah, it is.
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:41.960]   - Oh, it's different, it's a different confession.
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.440]   All right, well, let me put this out there.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.800]   Like earlier, you said that you thought
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.960]   that the Times needs to concentrate on its engagement.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.920]   So, do you think that they should do something like,
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:53.680]   if you've got more than 1,000 Twitter followers,
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.400]   and you tweet a New York Times link,
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:59.160]   then you get to look at 30 pages a month
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.480]   versus, you know, like-- - But I'm saying--
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:04.520]   - I'm talking about this. - Yeah, and obviously,
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.240]   Jim-- - That's a good idea, I like that.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:09.400]   - That's right, just thinking of the 101 ways
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.400]   this could be spammed and gamed, right?
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.440]   - Right, right. - Well, he would be thinking this
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:14.800]   if you were watching us.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:16.600]   - Yeah. - But you're missing Matt,
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:17.760]   but you don't know you're missing it.
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.240]   - Mm. - Mm.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:22.440]   - Anyway, right, I think what you have to do
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.640]   is look at the relative value of readers.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.520]   And one company I know started looking at the value
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.600]   of readers like in market versus out of market.
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:33.960]   And it's a huge gap, but that's a kind of negative valuation.
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.360]   If you look at the positive valuation
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:39.040]   of how people can contribute to the value of what you do,
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.440]   right, so number one, I think is recommending what you do.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.400]   And if that, the pure link wouldn't work
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.360]   because obviously you created Twitter account,
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.080]   nobody reads and you do it to get the reading.
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.960]   You've got to have some, you've got to have some
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:54.040]   Twitter clout and it has to have some market value.
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:55.360]   And there was just a study, oh, God,
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:59.040]   I have to put it in the, oh, who did it?
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:01.120]   Somebody just did a study.
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.960]   Aaron, chat room helping, but you're not,
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.840]   you're not media wonky enough to have read this.
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:09.240]   That finally gave some a monetary, oh, googled it,
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.720]   googled it.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:13.960]   Of course, they wrote a post giving a monetary value
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.240]   to social links.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.000]   - Really, you're right, I wanna see that.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.040]   - Oh, it's, oh, chat room helping, oh, chat room.
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.400]   Look at all the Google blogs, real quick.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.880]   There's three of them, a diagram.
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:29.040]   One on top of the other and it shows what the value was.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.800]   Now, come on chat room, come on, you can do it.
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.600]   Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.720]   - It's so similar to clout with the K,
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:37.240]   what they're trying to do is like give everybody a score
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.080]   for a number of ways to show them.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.000]   - Is this based on their post rank acquisition?
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.800]   - I think about it a bit more, what they're doing is
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.880]   they're giving a financial value to social links.
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:52.240]   - This is why we get knocked off every time on YouTube.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.720]   It's that. - It's on my fault.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:55.200]   - It's your fault.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.920]   - Well, my singing of it was so bad
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:58.200]   it would have got us knocked off.
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.280]   - Here, boy, look at this.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.160]   - There we go.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.720]   - Look at that, chat room is so good.
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:06.040]   Kurt, our winner from analytics, the analytics blob in Canada.
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:09.320]   - Awesome. - There we go.
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.640]   - Right, so social values.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.880]   - Best chat room ever.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:15.160]   - Capturing the value of social media using Google Analytics.
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:19.520]   So tell us what this, what we're looking at.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.080]   - So it tells you, well, it tells you that there are a lot
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:24.400]   of circles and you can make points with circles.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:25.240]   Let's see.
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.240]   (laughing)
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.160]   - I understand that.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:31.040]   - There are 20,000 in a given population
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.920]   or intellectual population was there 20,000 conversions.
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.760]   Of that 11,000 were assisted social conversions.
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:41.080]   And of that 2300 were the last interaction
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.080]   was a social conversion.
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:44.920]   That's why you can give them credit.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.440]   And it gave a monetary value to all of that.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:50.080]   So the conversions, and I don't know what the definition
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.840]   of the conversion was in this context,
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.440]   but it's relative.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.440]   It was worth $113,000.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:58.480]   The assists were worth 48,000 of that.
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:00.960]   The last interaction was worth 8,000 of that.
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:04.360]   So obviously, if you can manage this
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:05.800]   and get more of those last interactions,
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.000]   you can make a lot more money.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   So out of 424 assisted conversions,
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.160]   they put a value to that, you know,
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.320]   so you could know what to do.
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:20.360]   Then interestingly, the source of assisted conversions,
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.440]   number one, T.CO, which is Twitter,
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.560]   number two, plus.uron.google.com.
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.800]   No, it's not dead, folks.
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:28.640]   Three, Reddit.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:30.080]   - It's half the size of Twitter.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.240]   And Reddit's again, you know, a fifth the size of it.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.160]   But--
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:36.480]   - So, you know, I don't know what the methodology is.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:40.000]   You know, we can, but this to me is really, really valuable
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   because it starts to put numbers behind the link economy
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.280]   and the value of those things.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:49.360]   So now, Gina, don't get me started.
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.680]   - Back to your question.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:56.480]   So yes, if you could monetize the value
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:57.880]   that you bring the New York Times
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.480]   when you specifically tweet an article,
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.680]   the New York Times would be very wise to say,
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:03.760]   "Thanks, Gina.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:06.600]   "Here's 20% of that value that we recognize
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.520]   "because it's incremental to us because of you."
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:11.440]   And you know what, we're not even gonna pay you that.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:14.600]   We're gonna do it as a discount against your sub.
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.320]   And ideally what's gonna happen here
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.200]   is you're gonna end up with a hundred year credit.
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.240]   You won't care because it's non-money then.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:25.280]   It's non-money to you because you'll never pay.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.240]   And you're still motivated to play the game.
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.200]   It's non-money to the Times
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.400]   because the Times is obviously making more
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:35.360]   from your value than it would from your subscription.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.400]   That to me is the way that you've been thinking about this.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.240]   And they're doing the opposite.
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.080]   Why?
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:40.440]   Because they think they're in the content selling business,
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.160]   not in the relationship of data business.
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:44.600]   You shouldn't have got me started.
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:45.440]   - Wow.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.280]   - Wow.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:49.000]   - I would fear and look forward to the future
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000]   where my Twitter follower count
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.280]   or Facebook subscriber count or cloud score or whatever,
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.040]   sort of earns me freebies.
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.520]   - Well, cloud does, right?
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.360]   - Passively, or--
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:21:59.200]   - Cloud does.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.040]   You get stuff from cloud.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.640]   It's all crap, but--
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.480]   - Isn't that how you ended up in that Vegas club?
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:05.200]   (laughing)
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:07.480]   - You get stuff for having cloud.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:09.680]   I haven't looked at it in a while,
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.640]   but I think I got like coupons for stuff.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.080]   Perks, cloud perks, right?
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:14.920]   - Turned off their email.
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:15.760]   - Did you guys do that?
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.960]   - Me too, I don't want any perks.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.440]   - Did you do the $5 for $10 Amazon thing this week?
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:21.280]   - No, what's that?
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:22.280]   - Well, I did.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.120]   - Yeah.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:23.960]   - I did.
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:24.800]   - What?
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:25.640]   - I tried to use my Amazon gift certificate
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:29.080]   to get the deal, which wasn't gonna work.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.440]   I know, that was awful.
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.520]   It was almost like stealing.
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:35.480]   If you get, you pay $5 and you get $10.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.600]   It was Amazon local thing.
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:38.200]   - Is there a way of thanking you?
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.120]   - Try to get more business.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.760]   - Oh, it's Amazon local, okay.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:41.600]   - I'm not a local, I don't know.
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.200]   - Look, my cloud's just plummeting.
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.160]   Oh my God.
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.000]   - Oh no.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:46.840]   - I've never looked at my cloud.
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:47.960]   I have zero idea.
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.360]   - So here, let's see our perks.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.200]   Let's see what--
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:52.280]   - I'm gonna give you a cloud badge just for that.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.880]   - I don't have any perks.
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:54.960]   - I really have never looked.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.320]   - You haven't participated.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.000]   - Oh, I haven't participated.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.120]   But where can I find out what perks I get?
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:02.600]   Where do I get them?
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.320]   I want some perks.
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.840]   - We've updated our times to policy
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.000]   to continue participating in cloud.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.600]   - Yeah, I think I signed out of cloud
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.720]   and now I'm back just for you.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:15.680]   Giving K's, it's just so stupid.
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:18.440]   - And you're gone again.
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:19.880]   - Yeah, I should sign out.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.680]   Yeah, I should just sign out again.
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:25.240]   All right, let's get to our tip.
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:28.160]   This is not a tool that I would like to share with you.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.200]   Let's get to our tip, our number,
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:31.400]   and we're gonna have two tools
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.000]   because Brad's gonna do a tool
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.440]   and I'm gonna do a tool.
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:35.800]   Double tool time. - Double tool.
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:36.840]   - Yes. - Double tool.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:38.560]   - Double tool time.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:41.400]   So let's start with you, Ms. Gina Trapani,
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.840]   your tip of the week.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:45.600]   - My tip of the week is thanks to Eileen.
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.080]   Thank you so much.
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:49.480]   humblebundle.com.
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:53.400]   It's a bundle of games and apps for Android, Mac,
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.680]   and Windows and Linux.
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:00.280]   And you buy them for a price that you choose.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:01.760]   All the money goes to charity.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:04.520]   There's 12 hours left as of right now.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:06.480]   So hopefully by the time this podcast goes out,
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:07.560]   the audio and the video goes out.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.520]   People still have time to purchase it.
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:12.000]   And yeah, it supports charity.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.720]   You can unlock the games on Steam.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:16.960]   Looks, lots of good titles here.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:19.480]   And they would retail for $57,
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:20.720]   but you can pay what you want.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:21.600]   And it all goes to charity.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.240]   So it seemed like a really good cause.
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.920]   Eileen, had you done, this is humblebundle too.
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:26.920]   Did you do the first one?
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:29.880]   - The last one had like World of Goo and Osmos
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:31.680]   and really cool games. - Oh, yeah.
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:32.520]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.360]   - I haven't done this one yet.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.960]   - So these are never before seen.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:38.680]   - Yes. - Game for Android.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.040]   - Two, I don't understand.
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.480]   It says for Android, but it's also for Apple.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.920]   It's for anything.
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:46.240]   Or no, this bundle is for Android too.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:49.640]   - It's for a lot of platforms.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.480]   - It says the games were created on Mac, Windows, Linux,
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.120]   and Android. - Android, yeah.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.560]   Yeah. - I'm confused.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:55.800]   Well, anyway, they work everywhere.
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:58.280]   In fact, Windows users are buying much more
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.080]   than Mac or Linux users.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.960]   So get on it.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.520]   - So get on it, yeah, get those numbers out.
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:07.200]   - You could choose any amount from $100 to a custom amount.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.480]   And then how you divide it,
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:13.360]   developers get some, charity,
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:17.640]   and a humble tip goes to humble bundle itself.
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:18.480]   That's neat.
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.880]   So everybody wins.
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:21.880]   - Yeah. - Good one.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:24.280]   - Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.040]   - I've got a few choices.
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.760]   Today is Twitter's sixth birthday.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.720]   - Today? - Today?
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:31.320]   - 2006, it started.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:34.080]   I signed up in December 2006.
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:36.080]   - You are the pioneer.
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.000]   - But see, I quit.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:37.840]   - I would love you.
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:38.880]   - I quit. - That's right.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.600]   - And like, February, March 2007.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.280]   - 'Cause you're like, this is stupid.
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.280]   - No, I liked it.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.120]   - Don't 'cause you were mad.
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:45.960]   - I was mad. - I was mad.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.440]   - You toyed over torqued.
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.720]   - No, I got mad 'cause I thought that they were a silo
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.200]   way back then.
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:53.680]   (laughing)
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:57.240]   And I didn't like the idea of contributing all this content
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.920]   to somebody who was gonna hold on to it.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:25:59.760]   So I quit.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.600]   - Aw. - Yeah.
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:01.960]   - Yeah, it's cool that I am.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.920]   And then, Justin and Zarek,
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:06.520]   you joined in September 2006, probably.
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:07.880]   - Brady? - Yep.
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:09.080]   - Brady? - That's how you get to be
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:10.720]   in the first name club.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.800]   - Yeah, you have your name at Brady.
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.880]   - Yeah. - Wow.
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:15.000]   - Except Leo won't find you
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.320]   'cause he's looking for Bradley.
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:17.840]   - I know, so that's me.
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:18.680]   That's just me.
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:20.560]   - You and my seventh grade teacher.
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:22.800]   - Yes. - Bradley.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:23.800]   Why didn't you do your homework class, right?
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.280]   - Brady falls in the forest.
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.600]   (laughing)
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:28.160]   - And there's no one there.
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.960]   So, 2006, wow.
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:35.160]   And so early, too, March 2006,
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:38.720]   but it didn't really take off until South by Southwest in...
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:41.320]   - 2007, that's my first. - She does 70 years later.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.160]   - Yeah, it was a year later.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.040]   That's when it had its big.
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:44.120]   That's when I finally signed up.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:45.840]   I said, "I keep hearing with the stupid Twitter thing.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.560]   "Let me just sign up and post my first tweet."
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.200]   I'm in the under one million club.
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:52.120]   You can see if your user ID,
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:55.800]   if my user ID is just under, it's like 930,000.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.080]   I take a lot of pride in that.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.640]   That's my early adopter.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.480]   - I'm mad at myself for quitting
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.200]   'cause I would have like a really no number.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:03.280]   What is your number?
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.560]   - I think it's like 5,000.
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.520]   - Wow.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.360]   - Nice.
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:09.080]   - So, you can enter your Twitter username at Twiberthday,
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:13.960]   TWBIRTHDAY, and find out when you joined Twitter.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.120]   But it won't find my first one.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:15.960]   It'll find my...
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:20.600]   Justine Azarek talked me into rejoining in April, 2007.
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:22.640]   - I like the was born on Twitter.
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.960]   - And my godfather, this is the first person I followed,
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:26.640]   was Ms. Rogue.
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.280]   - My godfather was laughing squid.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:31.160]   I'm in the 92nd percentile.
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.080]   - Wow.
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.080]   - I'm in the 95th.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.280]   So how could that be?
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.240]   - You have Ms. Rogue.
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.320]   - Oh, I was looking at Ms. Rogue.
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.920]   She joined in July.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:40.760]   - Yep.
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.440]   - That's Tara Hunt, of course.
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:43.680]   So let me back up.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.760]   So I'm in the 82nd percentile.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:48.000]   That's fun, isn't it?
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.280]   You could see who your first follow was,
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:53.400]   and when you join, and you get a little birth certificate.
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:54.760]   But that's not my tool.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:55.880]   So happy birthday, Twitter.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.720]   You got another number?
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:57.560]   Go ahead.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:58.400]   - Happy birthday, Twitter.
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:59.240]   Well, it's been a while real quick.
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.400]   - After this interesting, on March 18,
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.000]   a weekend day, which is important to this tale,
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.960]   Google's share of the browser market exceeded that of IE.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:06.800]   But only for one day,
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:09.480]   'cause that's a weekend day when we have a choice.
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:12.880]   But it shows where it goes here that I think the IE,
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:15.920]   the EU went after IE, evil Microsoft,
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:16.920]   with Internet Explorer,
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:18.280]   was gonna take over the world.
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:19.280]   Never mind.
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.440]   - We're gonna buy that.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.920]   - Well, that's what happens when you stop working
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:23.640]   on something for about five years.
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:24.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.080]   - People stop using it.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:29.720]   Plus, you know, you don't put it on a platform like the Mac,
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:31.360]   which is beating now on you.
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:33.800]   And then I want to make a little confession here,
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:35.120]   just to forest all things.
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.800]   I'm gonna return my second iPad.
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:38.440]   But what?
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.120]   Oh, wait, I'm only doing it.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:43.880]   I'm only doing it because I made a mistake at an AT.
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.200]   - You want Verizon LTE?
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.480]   - I don't have Verizon and it's still unopened.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:49.040]   So I don't pay the $50 charge.
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:50.440]   I'm gonna, but yes, folks,
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.800]   I am gonna return a second iPad.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.600]   But I do love-- - Oh, no reboxing.
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:55.960]   Come on. - No, I can't reboxing
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:58.040]   'cause I didn't have a restocking.
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.200]   - Oh, I didn't even take it on a shipping box.
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.040]   - Oh, wow.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.480]   - Yeah, no, I think Verizon's the way to go,
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:03.920]   especially you're in New York, right?
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:04.760]   You'll get great. - Yeah.
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:06.480]   - You'll get great performance.
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:08.000]   - Well, the Wall Street Journal scared me, so.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.960]   (laughing)
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.240]   - All right, I got a silly tool,
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:13.240]   but I thank the chat room for this one.
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:18.240]   They recommended Yumli, which is a semantic search
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.200]   for recipes.
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.520]   It understands what you're saying.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.440]   And the best, and one of the things they've added now
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.560]   is they have a Facebook app.
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:30.600]   So when you search for English, cucumber, vodka, and fusion,
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:33.440]   everybody on Facebook will know what you're up to.
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:37.320]   But my favorite, oh, it has some nice filters here.
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:40.640]   You can have it less salty or more salty,
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:43.840]   less savory or more savory, sour, bittersweet, spicy.
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:45.440]   You can have food allergies.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.320]   You can say-- - Some of the Canadian service.
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:49.000]   - I'm a Pescetarian.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:54.440]   You can, or a vegetarian or a vegan.
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:58.280]   Got nutrition, time and price, time and cooking, of course.
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:01.560]   This is a very nice search engine for recipes,
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.760]   but my favorite part is it's social.
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:07.000]   And if you turn on the social, you can have friends.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.560]   Your friends are in Yumli are called taste buds.
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:13.120]   (laughing)
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.760]   And I like that.
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.360]   That's the only reason I'm recommending it,
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:18.560]   'cause you can have taste buds.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:19.400]   - Brain shot.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:20.720]   - Yeah, put it on.
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:25.360]   But Brady has a very good, very good one.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.160]   I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you--
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:28.680]   - Or you could just bring up the--
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:29.520]   - Oh yeah, okay.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:32.480]   - Well, if you have some fun searches you wanna show--
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:33.440]   - Sure, yeah.
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:35.000]   - We've talked, I think we've talked a little bit about
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.680]   if this, then that before, but let's see what a master
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:41.680]   of geo location can do with IFTTT.
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:45.920]   - Oh, this is gonna be good.
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:47.480]   - .com, yeah.
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:50.680]   Yeah, so I don't know if we'll have to do anything magic
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:52.360]   to his, that's gonna do that.
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.400]   And then can you see him?
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:54.800]   - No, I don't.
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:58.200]   - You have to probably change your resolution on your,
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:30:59.800]   I don't know, it should be the same.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:00.640]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:01.480]   - Ah.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:02.720]   - Yes.
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:05.480]   - Yes, he's going to 1080, right?
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:06.560]   Is that what you did?
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:07.480]   - I just turned on the mirror.
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:08.760]   - It's the master of Ignite.
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:09.840]   Yeah, mirroring is what you want.
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.840]   You're the master of Ignite, you should know how to do this.
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:12.680]   - I--
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:15.680]   - An Ignite master should know how to immediately take--
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:16.960]   - We take an hour ahead of time.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:17.800]   - I know.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:18.640]   (laughs)
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:19.480]   - That's, yeah.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:20.560]   - So do you-- - Are you finding me, Eileen?
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.400]   - No.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.560]   - Jeff, well I'll do it here.
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:23.720]   You walk me through--
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:24.560]   - But you gotta give--
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:25.400]   - I--
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:26.240]   - Check the cord.
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:27.080]   - Here you go.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:28.160]   - T-T-T-T-D.com.
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.880]   - So if this and that, if you go to,
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:32.240]   if this and that.com/WTF.
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:34.400]   - W-T-F, I love that.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:37.960]   - Then, I have too many T's in my AFTTT.
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.240]   - I do that sometimes.
[01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:40.080]   - It, it, it.
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.560]   - If it's.
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:43.040]   - So basically, if this and that,
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.040]   lets you tie together different services.
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:48.440]   So I can tie together, Evernote, Gmail,
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:50.640]   Four Square, Instagram, Buzzfeed.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.360]   So, you know, as I like the joke,
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.280]   you know, I can automate my watching of log,
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:57.120]   or, you know, finding log cats.
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:59.600]   But I use this for stuff like,
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:01.800]   I send all my Instagram photos to Facebook.
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.800]   I have all my Four Square check-ins
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:06.160]   go to my Google calendar,
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:08.360]   so I can look back and see where I actually went.
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:13.360]   I have some selected tweets go to Google Talk.
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.840]   If I favorite a song on SoundCloud,
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:17.120]   it goes to Dropbox.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:17.960]   - That's cool.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:21.720]   - All my Facebook and Instagram photos go to Dropbox.
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:24.840]   All my Insta paper links go to Evernote.
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:27.280]   And so it's like Yahoo pipes,
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:28.920]   but much easier to use.
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:29.760]   - Yeah.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:30.760]   - I've described it as like Yahoo pipes,
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:32.440]   but designed by 37 signals.
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:33.280]   - Yeah.
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:36.560]   - So it's like very straight to the point and opinionated.
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:40.040]   - So for instance, if I posted a new bookmark to Pinboard,
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.560]   then it automatically tweets it.
[01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:42.720]   - Yep.
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:45.720]   - And if my mom emails me.
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:46.560]   - Then it goes to us.
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.400]   - And it goes to us.
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:48.880]   - Yeah, Texas means is mom just emailed you.
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.360]   She'll be very happy to know.
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.800]   - And there's tons of recipes.
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.400]   There's about 40 different services you can tie together.
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:57.800]   I like just browsing the recipes,
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:01.080]   which is how you share what's been done before.
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:01.920]   - This is a good one.
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:05.240]   When Amazon adds a new album to its top free albums,
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:06.080]   that's good.
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.080]   - I get that for the Kindle top books too.
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:08.920]   - Yeah, that's nice.
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.960]   - If it's raining tomorrow, send you an email.
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:11.800]   - Yeah.
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:13.400]   - You could automate thanking people in Twitter,
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.080]   which doesn't seem like much of a thanks,
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:17.240]   but I guess it's something.
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:19.920]   - Thank you for following me.
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:21.760]   Ooh, start a Gmail, send it to Evernote.
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:24.080]   That's kind of awesome, actually.
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:25.880]   Archive my tweets to Google Calendar.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.040]   - They've really added stuff since I've seen it last.
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:29.520]   - I bet it's all user-based.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.920]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:31.760]   - Yeah.
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:34.520]   - What do you imagine the business model is?
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:37.760]   - Well, I mean, geez, I don't know for sure.
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:39.000]   But I mean, you could easily picture this
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.360]   for the enterprise, right?
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:44.720]   You know, letting folks sign up for enterprise accounts?
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.680]   - I don't want to die.
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:48.160]   - Yeah, no, neither do I.
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.320]   I mean, I would pay for this in certain cases.
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:51.480]   - It's like you unravel.
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:53.840]   It's like pulling one thread from your sweater
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:56.600]   and you're going to end up in a bundle of yarn, right?
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.920]   - Well, it's like a, there's a great post
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:01.280]   by the fellow who runs Pinboard, Masha,
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:04.640]   about why you need, you should yell at anybody
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.360]   who doesn't charge for the wrap.
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:07.200]   - Right.
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.040]   - Because then it will go away.
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:08.880]   - That's why I like Pinboard.
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:11.040]   - And you're totally right about if this and that.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:14.160]   And I, they just came out in the past year
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.000]   and they've got some amount of funding,
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.120]   but not so much that I think they can just,
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:20.880]   you know, last forever without revenue.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:22.320]   So I'm pretty sure they have plans
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:23.800]   as they're perfecting the service.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:27.280]   But I really do see a lot of enterprise uses for this.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:31.080]   Just kind of like the GitHub model of it's free
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:33.640]   if you use it publicly and you pay to use it privately.
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:35.000]   - I like this. - Which I think is a great,
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.480]   I think is a great model in general
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:37.480]   for these types of services.
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:39.200]   - Sync readability to InstaPaper,
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:40.400]   then I don't have to choose.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:41.240]   - Yep.
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:42.080]   - I like that.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.080]   - What I would really like, the number one feature I would like
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.640]   and this is more on Markoside is InstaPaper content
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.840]   goes to Evernote.
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:51.640]   'Cause almost anything that I read on InstaPaper,
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:52.640]   I wanna be able to search for it.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:53.480]   - You wanna save on Evernote.
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:54.600]   - On Evernote, yeah.
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.600]   This has a nice Evernote integration.
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:57.440]   - Yep.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.960]   - If I mentioned on Twitter, give me a call
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:01.520]   and tell me who said what.
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.940]   It'll phone you.
[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:03.780]   - Wow.
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:04.960]   (laughing)
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:05.800]   - I like that.
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:08.360]   - I love that except for when,
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:11.040]   whatever the Brady quarterback guy is playing.
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:11.880]   - Yeah, you know.
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:14.120]   - I get lots of like, go long Brady.
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:14.960]   Go long. - Go long.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:15.800]   - Go long.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:16.800]   - Yeah, that's not really.
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:17.960]   - It's a different Brady.
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:19.040]   - I just started blocking people
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:19.880]   who don't know how to use Twitter.
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.060]   - He's the Brady.
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:22.880]   - Is he?
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:23.720]   - I don't know.
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:24.560]   We never bought him.
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.880]   - I'm saying Brady's the Brady.
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:26.720]   - This other guy's this corner.
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:28.440]   - Now we've got a Tebow store coming up.
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.520]   Tebow Brady is gonna be huge, by the way.
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.560]   I don't know, it's a sports video, but I don't.
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.520]   (laughing)
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:35.360]   - Thank you.
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:36.440]   It's so nice to have you Brady for us.
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:39.280]   If you haven't yet signed up for the Wear Conference,
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.440]   not much time remains.
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:43.360]   It's coming up April 2nd through 4th in San Francisco.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:46.360]   Go to WearConf.com.
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:50.120]   - We've got a 25% discount for everyone watching.
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:51.160]   Sorry, I'm not kidding. - What do I type?
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:52.480]   What do I type?
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:53.320]   Twit?
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:54.160]   - Twit.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.000]   - That's easy.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.560]   Register online right now.
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.240]   These are all the various,
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.600]   they even got an exhibit only for 25 bucks,
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:04.400]   but if you use Twit, you'll save some money on that.
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:05.240]   This is great.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:06.640]   - Buy yourself a latte.
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:08.200]   - Yeah, thank you.
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.280]   Very nice, thank you Brady.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.440]   Really appreciate it. - Thank you for having me.
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.040]   - Yeah. - I was glad
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.800]   that I was down from Seattle to be here.
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:14.920]   - I am really glad too.
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:18.400]   And you should go to Google I/O, everybody,
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:21.040]   and watch Brady's Ignite presentation,
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:23.240]   'cause Jeff Jarvis will be one of those speeches.
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:27.960]   - Yeah, and we'll put out like a call for talks for that.
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:29.600]   - It's so much fun. - Ignite is so much fun.
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:30.880]   - Ignite is awesome.
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:32.320]   And last year as it was at Google I/O,
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:33.160]   it was particularly good.
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:34.000]   I've been to a bunch of them,
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.720]   but the Google I/O won, I do remember it.
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:36.560]   It was really good.
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:37.400]   - Yeah.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:38.400]   - Unfortunately, Jane's addiction
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.320]   was practicing upstairs during it, so.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:41.160]   (laughing)
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:42.600]   - But we got beer.
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.560]   - Well, that's good.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.680]   Brady for us, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:49.120]   Gina Tarpani is at smarterware.org
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:52.600]   and thinkupapp.com and of course on Google+,
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:57.600]   and that's, oh, and that's it, that's all.
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.080]   And she wrote the book on Google Age.
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:03.480]   (laughing)
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.320]   - That's it.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.680]   - After city Shiva for it.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:06.680]   - It was a great book.
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.120]   (laughing)
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:10.800]   - Now I think there's an app in this.
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.120]   There's an app of Google Age.
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:12.960]   What could that be?
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.160]   It could be like a database of wages or something.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.000]   - Okay, yes.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.120]   - It's where you only get paid by Google Wallet credits.
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:19.720]   - Yes. (laughing)
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:21.320]   That's what I thought you were gonna do the five bucks for,
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:24.920]   'cause everybody who has a Google Wallet got five bucks extra
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:28.360]   'cause they did such a crappy job, something, I don't know.
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:29.200]   Thank you, Google.
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:30.360]   How many people, that means tells you
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.600]   they don't have very many users at Google Wallet.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:36.880]   - Yeah, they're wanting more, that's for sure.
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:37.760]   - We'll give you five bucks.
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:38.920]   There's probably five people.
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:40.440]   It's nothing.
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:44.000]   Jeff Jarvis is at BuzzMachine.com.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:44.840]   That's his blog.
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:49.360]   He's also in Stockholm speaking.
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.760]   - Yo, scuyevia and omelette.
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:54.400]   - Are you gonna talk about public parts?
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:55.400]   - That's all I'm gonna say tomorrow.
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:56.240]   We're gonna go upstairs and say that.
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:57.480]   - Public parts.
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:00.240]   - Yes, I'm gonna ramp it up a little bit.
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.760]   I'm gonna act like the Wall Street Journal
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:04.160]   and get a sensationalistic and say that our internet
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:05.520]   is in danger people.
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:06.360]   - Ah.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:09.040]   - And this is like where they protect freedom.
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:10.320]   - So we need them.
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:12.920]   That's why you have so much bandwidth.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.960]   BuzzMachine.com, buy the book.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:15.800]   - Thank you, Jeff.

[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.120]   Gutenberg the Geek.

[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:05.920]   on before you buy.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.000]   (laughs)
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.600]   Dyson vacuum.
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.160]   Oh, that's my favorite too.
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:13.120]   Yeah, I have the cordless, which is amazing.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:13.960]   - Really cordless.
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:14.800]   - Yeah.
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:15.640]   - You're the one with the balls
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:16.520]   so you can kind of like moving around
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:17.760]   and tuck it under.
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:18.600]   Yeah.
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:19.880]   Did you get a haircut?
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:21.200]   Looks good.
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:22.040]   - Looks good.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:22.880]   - Yeah, I know.
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:23.880]   - What chicks know that stuff.
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:24.720]   - It's good.
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:25.560]   - It's good.
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:26.400]   - Thank you.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:27.240]   - It looks cute.
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:28.080]   - You know what?
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:28.920]   - It's part of their brain.
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.880]   - Everyone is exactly right.
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:32.360]   - You're not pink, yeah.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:34.240]   You look great in Stockholm.
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:35.800]   - So I'm just, I have to move here
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:37.560]   and just take out a room in this hotel.
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:38.680]   - Absolutely.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:40.800]   - It looks like it's so square and severe.
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.720]   Look, I thought you were in a radio station.
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:44.160]   (laughs)
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:45.000]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:45.840]   - Where are you?
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.920]   - I'm in the, what are we dicing on?
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:50.720]   I'm in the Scandic Grand Central Hotel
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:53.640]   and my room, I did a Skype call this morning on video,
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:55.640]   on audio and it just didn't work at all.
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:57.480]   I thought, oh no.
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:39:59.760]   So then I did a speed test later in the day
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.960]   and in the room on wifi,
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:06.200]   I was getting 12 up 17 down.
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.560]   (whistles)
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:10.760]   And Eileen never satisfied.
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:15.080]   Said, well, if you got that room with a hard wire,
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:15.920]   why don't you go try it out?
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:18.920]   So I'm in a conference room and I got 52,
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:20.880]   72 down and 58 up.
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:24.160]   - Good.
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:25.680]   - Claire, you are clearing.
