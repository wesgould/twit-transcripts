[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.000]   Jeff Jarvis and Stacey Higginbotham are here.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.300]   Rondamario joins us.
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.700]   Mars Technica, he'll talk about his story.
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.600]   I love leaving the nests about Tony Fadella and Nest
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.600]   in the terrible situation there at Google.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.600]   We'll also take a look at Google's machine learning
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.400]   and Watson.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.600]   Watson's got a recipe he wants to cook for you.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.600]   It's weird.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.600]   It's all next on Twig.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.600]   Netcasts you love.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.600]   From people you trust.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.000]   This is Twig.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.400]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.800]   CashFly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.400]   This is Twig.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.800]   This week in Google, episode 356, recorded Wednesday, June 8,
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.800]   2016.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.800]   No, slow or go.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.800]   This week in Google is brought to you by Veridesk.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.800]   Veridesk easily converts your existing desk or cubicle
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.800]   into a standing desk.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.800]   So you can switch between sitting and standing
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.800]   to stay fit and active at work.

[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.800]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   And we've got a Googly group together to talk about
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.800]   Google, Facebook, Twitter, the Twitterverse journalism.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.800]   What's wrong with the world?
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   Jeff Jarvis is an expert at all of the above
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.800]   from buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.800]   And CUNY.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   And the, uh, CUNY School of Journalism.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.800]   He's a professor.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.800]   Nice to see you, Jeff.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   Good to see you.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.800]   Back home.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.800]   You flew home early just for this.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.800]   Thank you.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.800]   Yes.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   I was supposed to be on a nude flight and I got on an 8 AM flight.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   Out of Heathrow, it's okay.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800]   It's okay.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   I'm neurotic and get to airports wildly early.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   You know, in Heathrow, the sooner you get there, the better.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   You should get there the day before.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   Actually, Turbo II with United is nice, though.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   Oh, good.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.800]   Well, yeah, it's rest of us.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.800]   Heathrow is only a nightmare if you have to transit, like,
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.800]   if you go full on airline to another, you know, uh.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   Everybody agrees.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   Oh.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   And I've got a bad foot right now in the walk, in the distance
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   of the walker.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   Ungodly.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   Fine.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.800]   I'm home.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   Okay, we're here.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   No more problems.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   Stacey Higginbotham is also here.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.800]   Great to have you from Stacey on IOT, our new star.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   Love having you on.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   And look who else we brought just for you.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   Ron Amadio from ours, Technica.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   Great to have you, too.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   Always good to have you, Ron.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   Always.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   Always fun to be here.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   Did you have a good Google I/O, Ron?
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800]   We haven't talked to you since.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   It was awesome.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   Google I/O is always like the most fun thing ever.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   I'd have I/O every week if they left it up to me.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   This was an interesting I/O because on the surface it looked like it wasn't really, you know,
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   it was just a lot of me too products like catch up products.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   But I felt like, and I think we talked about this last week, it really was almost a, um,
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.800]   a sea change for Google, almost kind of a course correction to move into machine learning
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   and, uh, and smart bots and things like that, smart assistants.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   You agree or disagree?
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   What did you think of it?
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   They've been pushing the machine learning thing for a while, I think.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   So it was, I thought that was just kind of a continuation.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.800]   I did think it was interesting that they moved into into smart home stuff.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   Like I'm super pumped about Google Home just because I love the echo, but it's really kind
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.800]   of dumb.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.800]   Like you can't you can't get it to answer a lot of questions or anything.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.800]   Um, but the for me, the most fun is always just roaming the, I guess this year it was
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.800]   roaming the parking lot, but you know, just wandering around and saying to people and
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.800]   me and everyone and doing demos and stuff.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.800]   It's always fun.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.800]   I feel, you know, I, I can't remember if we talked about this last week, we had Kevin
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   Kelly on, uh, actually his interview on triangulation airs Monday right before our
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   WWDC coverage.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   We taped it last week.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.800]   I think I, I don't think we talked about it because I think it, but one of the things he was
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   talking about is, uh, machine learning slash artificial intelligence.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   And he said, just as when you had electrification, everybody looked at what they were already
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.800]   doing and added electricity to it.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.800]   A farmer would take a pump and say, you know, that would work a lot better if we were electric.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.800]   Uh, and, and similarly the internet, we, we, we applied a thin layer of internet to, to
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.040]   everything from travel to hotels.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.200]   And it changed everything and it spurred a whole year of innovation.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.280]   He says that's the next thing is applying a thin layer of machine learning to everything.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.600]   And that's, that's kind of what Google Home is an echo and is putting some machine learning
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.920]   on these devices, uh, makes them a heck of a lot more useful, right?
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.920]   Absolutely.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.560]   Google has a big list of stuff now that does machine learning.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.040]   I think it's like the Google photos, uh, search does all sorts of crazy machine vision stuff.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.720]   Um, uh, inbox has smart replies where it will kind of type most of the message for you.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.720]   That's all machine learning.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.680]   Uh, they were doing, you know, their crazy go thing, which they're going to take on.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.320]   They did beat the fourth best go player.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.880]   Now they're going to try to be the best go player in the world.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.560]   Uh, so it's going to be the ghost Super Bowl.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.920]   I'm super excited for that.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.360]   I hope they bring back the same, the same announcers as last time because that was, they
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.360]   were great.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.760]   We're not saying I loved watching that.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.080]   But, uh, do you agree Stacey that that, I mean, I think this is where innovation happens
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.040]   is you take existing stuff and you add in this case, intelligence to it that, well, look
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.040]   at your car.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.040]   Yes.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.800]   And well, and you could look at everything.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.080]   And I think with what Google was talking about is they started putting the story around
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.080]   it.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.280]   They've been investing in machine learning for forever.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.280]   Years.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.640]   Um, and the stuff that people are trying to do with this is freaking amazing and, but
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.760]   we also talk about it like it's better than it actually is.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.200]   So if people don't actually understand what's happening, they're like, ah, we get all the
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.240]   conversations about machines taking over the world, killing off the human race.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.680]   But we also have these crazy outs, outsized expectations for what it's going to do.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.600]   And we're so not there yet.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:38.160]   Well, just as in 1995, the internet coding you applied to the thin candy shell coding,
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.720]   you applied to magazines.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.720]   It wasn't so hot.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   Oh, sure.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.720]   But we've come a long way.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.720]   Go ahead, Jesse.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.000]   No, no, I'll let Jeff go and then we'll go back to Stacey.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.840]   No, I think the big thing that I see is that in a machine learning world, in a conversational
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.000]   world where it can anticipate your questions, get you answers, it disambiguates media so
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   much more.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   There's no need to go to a destination.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.520]   There's no need to go to a place to get something that the machine can get it for you and
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.000]   can dissipate your needs and bring it to you, which is great.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   It'll be wonderful.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.120]   But where do we, um, put ourselves, support our brands and all that?
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120]   Very unknown.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.120]   And that's what people are struggling with, isn't it?
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.120]   Oh, you bet.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.600]   There's like Google now, which is not the smartest thing, but it is smart.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.720]   That offers me websites that I visit a lot.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.920]   It offers me the topics I'm interested in, like Kim Kardashian.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.600]   I keep trying not to click on it, but when it shows it to me, I'm like, oh, you know,
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.720]   but it's figured that out and it actually figures out the places I go the most.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.960]   So in a way, it helps me stay in touch with brands that I might kind of forget about.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.440]   So that's the kind of positive side.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:56.480]   I was going to say though, what we don't know yet is the big shift in monetization, the
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.260]   big economic shift that's going to come from AI.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:04.440]   So if you think about the internet as a distribution model and what that did there and then the
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:10.080]   way that that was kind of monetized, I'm very curious to see what changes with AI.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:16.360]   Well, monetization is a big topic right now because of ad blockers.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.240]   I'm seeing more and more sites not let me in.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:28.480]   And I just saw a story that the New York Times is about to block the blockers and say you
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:37.560]   can't read the content on the New York Times if you've got an ad blocker running.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.080]   This is a very interesting times we're struggling.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.520]   These guys are really struggling.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.440]   But the thing, I was part of a post up later in the run and I was three conferences in
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.520]   Europe this last week.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:58.080]   And at one of them, three, which is a carrier in the UK is going to cut all ads for one
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.840]   day on mobile.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.480]   Oh man.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.640]   And much fear about this, much, much.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.120]   Oh man.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.600]   And there are those that say let's get all these big players together.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.560]   Let's pull a table or swift on them and let's all boycott them.
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.640]   As somebody who started the room and said, do we really want to be in the position of
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.560]   standing with the advertisers against our users?
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.040]   Our users are using the ad blockers because they're pissed at us.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.560]   We got to deal with that fact.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.840]   And I think it's just simply true.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.520]   We have to reinvent as I said before, we have to reinvent advertising rethink what it
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.240]   is, rethink where the value is.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.160]   Just irritating people with messages is not going to work.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.720]   The thing that struck me from this tour is how much everybody is now agreeing that the
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.320]   reach business model, just volume for volume sake is gone.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.320]   It's dead.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.320]   We killed it.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.320]   You were.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.920]   This trip was three different publisher summits in Europe.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.960]   One was the Springer distributed content summit in Berlin.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.200]   I talked to you the night before that last show.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.640]   And then I went to Newsgeist, the European version in Bilbao, which was fascinating.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.640]   That's a Google event.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.360]   Google brings together about 115 news people.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:10.640]   And then I went to Google News Publishers Day, run by Google Play, full disclosure.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.920]   I take no money from Google as a fee.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.560]   Google and Springer did pay for much of my travel over.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.080]   So you know.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.080]   And so it was fascinating.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.520]   We can talk about this more later, but it was fascinating to see, for me, just to Stacey's
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:32.240]   point, there's a recognition happening that we cannot save the old business models.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.320]   And what comes next, how we do it, is they're dying for subscription.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.920]   I don't think that's going to do it entirely either.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.760]   But the idea of just getting more and more ads and the pro and more crap in people's
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.960]   eyes, that's not a winner.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:51.560]   I hate to be in that position of trying to solve this because people aren't going to
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.480]   pay the risk the New York Times and everybody else is running.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.160]   And I'm seeing it more and more.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.000]   As you put up that banner that says, either pay us or turn off your blocker, I turn around
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.600]   and leave.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.080]   Yep.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.640]   That's a risk.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:11.400]   I'm working with the Guardian on membership, which is a model that I do believe in.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.880]   I think people will pay as, but they'll pay for different motives.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.080]   They may pay as a patron.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.080]   People pay NPR.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.080]   They don't pay for access to content.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.200]   They pay because they believe the country needs it.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.120]   I pay the New York Times and they won't listen to me on this.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.960]   I don't pay them for access to content.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.960]   I pay them because the New York Times is important.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.960]   Right.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.960]   But then don't abuse me in return.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.960]   That's the issue.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.400]   Or not say the New York Times ads are far better than other sites.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.000]   A part of the problem.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Go ahead, Sissy.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.840]   Oh, this is kind of part of that patronage model or membership model.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:49.480]   The information, which is a Silicon Valley publication, after Tony Fadel on Friday said
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:55.240]   he was leaving Nest, they actually, within an hour of the news being out, pushed a subscriber
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.960]   conference call to have the reporters online talking about what this meant.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.320]   Which I thought was very interesting.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.320]   I didn't join it.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.320]   I meant to.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.320]   I didn't get around to it.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.320]   Did you join it?
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.320]   I did not join it.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.320]   I'm a subscriber.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.320]   I should.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   Yeah, but that was the problem.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.200]   But that's why that happened late on Friday.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.000]   Anyway, that ties to your membership model, Jeff.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.840]   That's really, because paid content isn't just, here's our page of what we always made.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.840]   Get it.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.040]   Paid content is things like events.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.160]   Buying a book, buying a ticket.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.160]   That's paid content too.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.640]   And I'm all for that.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.520]   I think that works.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.280]   But just the idea that you should suddenly pay for what you can get.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.000]   You work commodity business.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.800]   Information is a commodity.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.640]   And just because I think my pros is so brilliant and wonderful and special, the part, the same
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.880]   information somebody else imparts, doesn't mean you should pay me for it.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.160]   I'm sympathetic.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.800]   If people blocked our ads, we'd have no way to monetize.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.280]   And I couldn't keep doing this period.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.920]   I mean, I, you know, and your ads are not irritating.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.720]   Well, if you, something, they're irritating, full sum do, but they're not enough.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.840]   If you suddenly decided this is why you're very careful about this.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:05.320]   And I was telling you, I quoted you in Europe because I've had this crazy idea that we should
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.960]   do our own ad blocker as publishers.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.120]   What that really means is just we have our standards.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.280]   And you do that.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.600]   You have your own ad blocker.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   You pre-block ads.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.600]   Yeah, we do.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.600]   Yes, that's a good point.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.600]   Get it again.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.600]   Right.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.640]   He says, again and again, how you throw, you turn away more ads than you take.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.160]   And that's really important because it's exactly what you're doing.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.160]   You're the pre-blocker.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.580]   I mentioned that at the IAB, the Interactive Advertising Bureau, up fronts in New York
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.280]   City a couple of months ago.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:37.040]   And there was an audible gasp from the advertisers in the audience because I think that's kind
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.040]   of unheard of.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.400]   Nobody turns down money and says, well, no.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.160]   But to me, it's a long-term investment, right?
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.400]   Because I know if I, if I crapped this thing up with ads, I wish that the other publishers
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.360]   had turned down the belly fat ads, right?
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.040]   We wouldn't have to use ad blockers.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.640]   Well, and I, well exactly.
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.640]   So there are two things on this.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.480]   I talked to a publisher who was laughing and he said, you know, the secret that nobody
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.120]   wants to say, I never thought of this before, was that a lot of the reason for ad blockers
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.560]   is probably not because of the ads that we have.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.400]   It's probably because when it gets rid of one porn sites and it takes off every other
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.400]   ad there is.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.840]   Well, that's the problem with ad blockers.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.840]   It does it everywhere.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.160]   And that's, you know, Gina could award you.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.600]   We somehow went up in sex.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:24.080]   But, but, but, but, uh, during fireball, John Gruber has one very minor to, you know, completely
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.440]   unobtrusive ad, but that gets blocked along with everything else by ad blockers.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.440]   Exactly.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.440]   Exactly.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:35.080]   And, and that's why Marco Armance got, he was doing an ad blocker for iPhone.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:40.720]   He decided to get out of that business because he realized it was blocking ads on that were
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.720]   tolerable.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:47.280]   Uh, but then you do things like adblock plus does, which you have the acceptable ads policy.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.360]   But that's, that's, that's, that's pure blackmail.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.080]   But that's what, and then you get accused of.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.080]   Is it?
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.080]   Oh, it's awful.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.880]   But what, what they say and that we interviewed them, uh, they say, well, no, no, look, we,
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.840]   okay, two things and maybe they shouldn't mix the two.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.240]   We think that there are some ads that are fine and they should, if we have a standard
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.120]   for acceptable ads, we shouldn't block them.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:13.760]   That means that people with unobtrusive, not bad ads, ads that don't have flash ads that
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.120]   don't give you malware should be allowed through.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.560]   The problem is they ask those companies for money and they say, well, we got to pay for
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.120]   this service that we're providing.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.560]   So that's how we monetize it.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.560]   And that's where you get that.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.400]   It's clearly a moral hazard.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.400]   It's extortion.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.960]   Uh, but you do see the, well, they say, no, it's not extortion because it has to be an
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.240]   acceptable ad.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.240]   We set the standard.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.240]   Yes.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.240]   Yes.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.240]   Right.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.240]   But they take money and makes it extortion.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.680]   I mean, if they said, if they had just said, let's make an alliance of like good ads that,
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.480]   that treat users respectfully, I think that would be one thing.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:51.600]   But that they, they block your ads and then come to you as a, as a publisher and say,
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.600]   hey, give us money now.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.600]   That sounds like extortion.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.600]   That sounds like extortion.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:16:01.160]   That's a real stop taking money away from you is, is really bad and gets them very hostile
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.760]   reactions from, from websites, uh, newsguys.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.000]   Um, and this is, is Chatham House rules.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I won't say who said it to whom, but, but well, it's to whom is going to be obvious.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.640]   Well, and editor there are top, top editor there went after Google pretty strongly saying
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.040]   if, if these things are evil, what are you doing?
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.920]   Google paying for the waitlist?
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.720]   You should be, you should be leading the way.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.720]   They do.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.720]   They're, they pay for acceptable ads.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.080]   And it was very funny moment because the PR guy in the room was kind of like, well,
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.080]   that's not my choice.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.480]   Somebody else at Google.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.480]   Well, Google's got another response there.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.760]   They're, they're doing AMP.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.000]   This is Google's response.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.960]   They, and this is where I've always, to me, I'm also had issues with this.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:47.480]   AMP is Google's way of, of responding to the, the burden that ad tech adds.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.400]   And I think ultimately it is an ad standard.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:55.320]   In fact, they're now, as you can see, bringing new ad types, including some pretty annoying
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.920]   ads, what they call the flying carpet ads.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.320]   These are the ones, that's this.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.240]   See that over in the right here where you're trying to read something as you scroll, you
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:11.480]   scroll through the ad and then this advertisement is scrolled up and it says keep on scrolling
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.480]   to read more.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.680]   So this is the problem when it, when they pay stops to the publishing industry, I was,
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.680]   I just wrote a big post.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.120]   Google any better than adblock plus.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.640]   Well, what, what asked you want to see?
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:29.120]   I, like, this is, this is something that I think it's worth instead of just complaining
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:33.400]   about this, we should talk about, well, what's a, what's a good ad?
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.640]   What does that look like for precisely?
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.640]   Precisely, Stacy.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.120]   Well, I think that's what it is.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.480]   So, okay, let's see.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.880]   Let me read the acceptable ads policy and see if you, we would agree on the, on the one
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.400]   and I feel, I kind of feel like these guys are getting a bad rap that I think they are
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:56.240]   adblock plus is trying to, they probably shouldn't combine it to money, but, uh,
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.240]   No, they should.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.240]   It's, it's a period.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.240]   Period.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.240]   You're right.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.240]   Stacy, there should be, there should be a jury, a council of the public.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:11.400]   Is there, isn't there an ad for ties meant group at this?
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.400]   There is.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.400]   There's an IAB.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   IAB, thank you.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.720]   I was like, God, what is it?
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:22.720]   And they have a, so here's the acceptable ads ads are acceptable if they do not disrupt
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.720]   the user's natural reading flow like a flying carpet ad.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.720]   Okay.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.720]   They have to place a top.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.840]   Yeah, I think that ad, that ad definitely disrupted my reading.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.280]   So that would not be considered an acceptable ad whether you paid them money or not.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.840]   Ads should always be recognized, recognizable as ads.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.800]   They shouldn't be mixed in with content in such a way that they, they look like the content.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.000]   The side, they have size limitations.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.560]   Hold on, hold on, hold on right there.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.160]   That's in the moral hazard category.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.520]   That's because they don't want native advertising because ad blockers don't know how to block
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.520]   native advertising.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.880]   Well, come on.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:02.680]   This is, this is Google allows tabula and outbrain, which would not be allowed and
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.680]   accept the ads.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.680]   That was another big discussion.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.760]   Those are the, those are the, if you like this, you'd like to see more of this and they
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.800]   are not, they don't say advertisement.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.160]   They are not distinguishable.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.480]   Well, I absolutely agree.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.480]   They send you to order.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.720]   Well, well, you not so far this acceptal ads policy is more rigorous than Google zone
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.720]   app policy.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.520]   The limitation neither is independent.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.700]   Neither is independent and Stacy's point is exactly right.
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:34.600]   What you need is some kind of independent body that represents the public that says,
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.600]   we know you have to make money.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.000]   We know you're going to have ads.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Okay.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.240]   Here is the definition of quality and here is the definition of irritation.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.320]   That only comes if there's some measure of independence.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.920]   Yeah, I think also it needs to be somebody that understands the realities of journalists
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.280]   needing to get paid.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.760]   So you know, you could, you could make a list, which I don't know if adblock did this, but
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.960]   you could like make a list of requirements and publishers might look at that and say,
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.680]   yeah, there's no way we could operate with ads like this because we wouldn't earn enough
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.680]   money.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:09.240]   Like where is the, this is acceptable to users, but is it acceptable to publishers in that
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.680]   they will make enough money to continue operating?
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:19.680]   And everyone has to abide by them because this is something I'm discovering is I get
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.920]   so many requests for like sponsored content or native ads on my site, which is, you know,
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:30.200]   relatively small and niche, but I don't do it because it's not, it's not what I want
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.840]   to, I don't want to confuse my users.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.360]   And it's very frustrating because enough other people do it.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.800]   They're like, I'm willing to have you use your name to buy line something on my stuff, but
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.720]   I'm not willing to, you know, advertise against your reporting.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.280]   And I'm just going to take my money elsewhere, which that's their business.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.280]   That's fine.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:55.760]   But the fact that there's plenty of even relatively decent brand names willing to do native advertising
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.520]   is detrimental to journalists who are trying to actually do what I think of as journalism.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.080]   I just, I think if there's, I think there's a conflict of interest with this acceptable
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.320]   ads, then there's a conflict of interest with Google's suggestion.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.320]   I am.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.560]   Google's an ad company saying, well, here's what this way.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.280]   That's why that's why AMP is an open standard that it needs to be governed by an open standard
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.280]   body.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.280]   That's what I've always said.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.280]   And it's not.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.280]   It's early days.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.200]   It could become one.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.400]   It could and must become one.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.640]   Otherwise it will lose that credibility to add plus credit.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:33.480]   Acceptable ads is a policy not just ad blocks, plus many other ad blockers adhere to this
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.920]   policy as well.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.720]   What do you guys think about different ads on mobile versus the web?
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.640]   I know it's hard to, but I mean, because there's some things I'll tolerate on the web that
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.640]   I just like.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.640]   Right.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.240]   Well, that magic carpet doesn't even make sense on the web.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:52.120]   It only makes sense in a mobile space where you're scrolling with your finger in a limited
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.040]   column.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.720]   So there are clearly ads that are targeted at mobile that don't show up on your desktop.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.320]   So there must be a way to, you know, there is a way to distinguish the two.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.320]   I think that's not a bad idea.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.560]   I think you make an excellent point.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:09.800]   Certainly they say, for instance, the size of the ad depends on the size of the page.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.920]   So you know, you can't, you know, limit it.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.040]   It's got to be a percent, not a pixel number, right?
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.040]   Because I'm sorry.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.040]   I interrupted you.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.040]   What was the other criteria?
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.040]   Did I go through more?
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.040]   There's some I think text ads with excessive use of colors and our elements to grab attention
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.760]   not permitted.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:34.880]   Automatic images are fine, but they don't allow flash ads for ads and lists and feeds like
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.480]   a podcast feed.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.440]   There are restrictions.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.160]   Search ads, there are restrictions.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:47.600]   This is, I think I would, you know, I understand the potential conflict of interest here.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.680]   On the other hand, I like these acceptable ad standards.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.680]   So here's what should happen.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.680]   Here's what should happen.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.160]   But what, what ad block blossom do, what Google should do is the same.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:03.000]   They need to push into a true open source project, be fundamental underlying work.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.240]   If you want to make money on top of that in some way, they do.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.240]   Then you can put their, they're not.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.240]   They do.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.880]   No, no, the acceptable ads database is used by other blockers.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.880]   Free.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.880]   But who sets the standards?
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.320]   Yeah, there's, there's no reason to say.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   That's the problem.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.320]   No, no, no, no.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.320]   The moral hazard.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.320]   No, no, no.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.320]   They say by an independent committee.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.640]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.640]   Let me see here.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:30.360]   They had a 20 leading publishers, tech companies, journalists, advertisers, non-profits and
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.560]   academics.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.120]   They're formulating an acceptable ads committee, which will take over the initiative sometime
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.200]   next year.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:42.000]   This was, okay, this was 11, 2015.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.560]   I, I think, you know, I understand why people are, assume that this is a conflict of interest
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.240]   and is shady.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.400]   But I'm not convinced it is after talking to these guys.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.080]   I felt like they had, they were trying to do the best that they could and who I think
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.080]   an ad blocking company.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:02.080]   And by the way, you can use their ad blocker and turn it off so that you don't see any
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.240]   ads acceptable or not.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.760]   It's all expensive as it's run this and run something much cheaper, get a grant from some
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:13.200]   foundation which they could do and make it a truly open, decent project.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.200]   B.S.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.160]   As long as they're making, I mean, as long as there, there's a profit making operation
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.000]   which it is, there's another company called Flatter, which could make it go up and they're
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.080]   going to work with acceptable ads.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.200]   I saw them in a conference in Amsterdam.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.040]   I'm just forever dubious the way that's set up.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.040]   And the way they've acted is extortionate.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.040]   That's my problem.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.160]   They've, they've blown it for me lifelong because the way they have acted.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.720]   Well, is there evidence that they've gone to somebody like Google and say, Hey, some,
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.480]   your ads are blocked by our acceptable ad policy, but we would look the other way if
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.120]   you'd give us money.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.720]   But the ads still have to, I think the ads still have to be adhered to the acceptal ad
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.720]   policy.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.160]   What if you, what if you do an acceptable ad that you don't pay them?
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.160]   That's the issue.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:56.880]   It's, they say 90% of the licenses that we grant are granted for free to smaller entities.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:58.880]   Okay.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.000]   So if you're a larger and if you're larger and you have a license fee because you can afford
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   it.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And afford what?
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Afford being being blackmailed?
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.600]   That's covered for them.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.600]   That's pure cover for them.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   It's BS.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.000]   As Ron said, all these companies that are employing journalists and have these high expenses,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.400]   they won't, they won't like, they won't whitelist you if your ads are not acceptable.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.400]   Right.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.400]   They won't.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   Why might they whitelist ads that are unacceptable?
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.400]   They won't buy this.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.240]   You think they'll pay them?
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.240]   That's the issue.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.520]   How about Proctor and Gamble wants to run ads and they feel like all of their ads are
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.520]   acceptable.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.440]   And then this company is like, no, but if you pay us, we'll whitelist you.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.080]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.520]   I think that's the point Jeff and Ron are trying to make.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:47.520]   Well, I would say they charge people some amount of money.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.360]   They should be open about how much money they are.
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:55.880]   They say it's 30% of the additional revenue created by whitelisting.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:02.280]   So the additional revenue you make from those whitelisted ads, 30% goes to adblock plus.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.280]   That's insane.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.880]   That's an insane.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880]   Apple charges.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880]   If you sell something.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.360]   Yes, for an app store, which they host and because it's a closed system and all that.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.000]   But again, that's only the top 10% of traffic generators.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.680]   They determine who's the top 10% based on how much ad blocking they're doing for those
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.680]   entities.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:26.320]   Those are entities that in great measure have journalistic costs and are suffering.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.520]   Well, no, no, no, mostly it's like Google.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.160]   It's the big ad tech network.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.840]   A tool is so acceptable and so friggin wonderful.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.720]   I don't know if they whitelist tabula or not.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.400]   I really don't think they would based on their criteria here.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.920]   So this does two things.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.200]   It pushes people.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.880]   First of all, it's only the top 10% of traffic generators.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.920]   The other 90% don't pay anything are still whitelisted.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.760]   The top 10% the ad tech companies that make the most money from advertising, they say
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.520]   if you want to be whitelisted, you're going to have to give us 30% of the additional revenue
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.920]   from whitelisting.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:01.920]   That doesn't seem unreasonable.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.920]   Yes, it does.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.920]   It's crap.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.080]   This is like, it's just like so much more.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.680]   What's the alternative which is we'll block everything and then you don't get any alternative
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:14.680]   is that you have a truly independent not for profit organization doing this.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.680]   I'm all for profit.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.840]   You know me at every time on the show, I doing what?
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:22.120]   Depending on the ad blocking doing the ad setting or doing setting the standard.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:26.720]   Well, I think that there's an extra what's and then and then in terms of the actual blocking,
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:27.840]   then you can have an open source structure.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.480]   You can get any blocker you want.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.320]   If it does, that's why I've argued the publishers should create their own ad blocker.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.400]   What's funny is ad block plus gets heats on both ends because users say, well, this should
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.400]   be acceptable.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.360]   It should be turned off by default.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.240]   We should decide if we want acceptable ads.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.080]   And then the advertisers and people like you say, well, this is unacceptable because
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.640]   we don't want to have to pay for people to see our ads.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.560]   I think you need to find a solution right now because you're in a world where people
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.560]   are just going to block ads.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.560]   I agree.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.760]   And by the way, there are a lot of ad blockers that just block everything.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.760]   Period.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.760]   Yes, I know that too.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.760]   I know that too.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.760]   I've written about this.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.360]   I've argued that we in publishing is what Stacy said.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.360]   We in publishing have to come up with our own standards.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.600]   If you look at courts, a great story from courts in the early days, one of the founders,
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.080]   I don't know which one really hated advertising.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.800]   And I said, if we're going to have advertising, this is what it's going to be.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.760]   Let became an editor setting a structure for acceptable ads at courts.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.480]   And courts does court says native advertising, but it's good, clearly labeled.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.920]   And I think they do a good job because editorial took a role of responsibility in advocating
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.000]   for the public that we serve.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.200]   The problem with advertising on websites is we we screwed the public.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.200]   Right.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.200]   More crap at their eyes.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.200]   Right.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.200]   They messed up their own fault.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.360]   I don't deny that.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:45.340]   But the solution is not another conflict of interest, which which go rightly on both ad
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:49.440]   block plus and Google are in that conflict of interest and Google's talking about having
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.040]   its own acceptable ads policy.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.080]   Well, they have a similar conflict of interest.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.960]   This needs to be some kind of independent organization.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.920]   And it's not the IAB because that represents independent.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.280]   They represent advertisers and advertisers.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.280]   Right.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:05.880]   It's not the digital content next form of the online publishers associations.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.880]   That's publishers.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.680]   It needs to be somebody independent who also understands, as Ron said, the other really
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.200]   important point that we need.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.760]   We need the eggs to feed the journalists.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:22.560]   Do you all unblock ads for specific sites like I like daring fireballs on my unblock
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.320]   ads on those sites?
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.360]   Actually, I don't run an ad blocker unless I'm on my phone.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.360]   Okay.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.200]   Well, no, that's the best place to do it.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.440]   But you do do it on your phone.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.440]   I do.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.440]   The irony is you can't do it.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.760]   I guess it's not exactly an irony.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.520]   You can't do it on an Android.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.760]   You have to run a separate browser.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.480]   Google Chrome, the default browser in Android does not offer blocking.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.760]   Yeah, where you have to root and that's a big mess.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.720]   Well, there's ad block plus has a browser for Google for Android and stuff.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:57.000]   And Google to their credit at least doesn't block that from the store.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Should we mention the other case of pre ad blocking that made news this week?
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.360]   I put it under numbers on the company.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.360]   Preads locking.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:09.800]   Pread like you like you add blocks in before you buy your ad is blocked before you buy
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.400]   Buzzfeed turning down $1.3 million in Trump ads because they were equivalent in Jonah's
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.160]   words to cigarette advertising.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.000]   Oh, how?
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.960]   Yeah, that's harsh.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.680]   Oh, they cover all his other.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.280]   Stuff anyway, so he doesn't really need to buy the.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.280]   Oh, he doesn't.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:30.400]   In broadcast, you cannot turn down political ads.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.640]   So broadcasters are by the FCC prohibited from turning down.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.360]   Actually, you have to see what the rules are.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.160]   But I think there are some standards you can.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.160]   There are standards, obviously.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.000]   What they do is that's why they fairness doctrine.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.240]   Yeah, that's your time.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.280]   But that's not really to air.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.000]   I mean, ads, does it?
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.400]   Well, some of them say that we will not do any ads run issues so they don't get.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.320]   You know, abortion ads, they don't like or gun ads, they don't like.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.440]   So they just turn down all ads on issues, which is not great.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:05.920]   I mean, look at the, you know, the industry broadcast industry so heavily regulated.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:12.000]   I have to take regular tests for a clear channel because I still do a radio show.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.960]   No, I take I take tests every quarter about what the rules are and what.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.920]   Text on on Morris code to no tests.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:26.680]   On like Paola and the, you know, clear channel got handed a massive fine for playing something
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:32.960]   and ad for like White House down that had EA emergency activation system tones in it.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.960]   That's right.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.760]   That's a huge multi million dollar fine.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:43.640]   And so now I have to take a test every three months on whether what tones I can play.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.640]   It's incredible.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.880]   Let me see what the okay.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:51.720]   Here's the pre election political advertising compliance checklist.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.480]   This is from the radio advertising bureau.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.520]   So this is not from the government, but it is.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.520]   Okay.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.240]   So you have to on your public file contain all requests for free and played political
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.680]   time and their disposition.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:10.880]   So you know, clearly they want you to disclose as BuzzFeed did, whether you turn something
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.880]   down.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.440]   I don't know what the rules you can't you have to charge.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.680]   You have you the lowest, you can't give them a deal.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.680]   Right.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:24.280]   So you end up charging the top rate, the rack rate for the ads.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:33.080]   I don't know if I'm going to be able to find the rule, but I'm pretty sure it's, you know,
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:37.800]   as you as you might imagine, if you hold a license from the government to broadcast
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:44.080]   and TV or radio that they don't want you to turn down ads for people you don't agree
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.080]   with.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.240]   They want everybody have access to those channels, right?
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.480]   Those also the argument of public airwaves and such.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.480]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.480]   That's what I was going to say.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:57.840]   You know, BuzzFeed's not, you know, doesn't have that nor do I have those restrictions.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.600]   So orders of cable network, right?
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.680]   Cable does cables FCC regulated.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.680]   Absolutely.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.680]   Are they regulated on that?
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.680]   They may be right.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.720]   Are they are they regulated from?
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.880]   Because the FCC stuff is over the public airwaves, which is brought down.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.280]   Oh, I think FCC has some.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.880]   The cable industry does do local and municipal franchise grants now.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.040]   There's levels.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.220]   So maybe there's something there.
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.200]   Not actually.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.200]   I'm not a telecommunication.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.480]   That's why you can say I can say dirty words on cable.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.280]   And that's why Howard Stern can say, well, yeah, no, but I mean, FCC is not completely.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.760]   I know people think they're stupid, but they might have different rules.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.760]   No, no.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.320]   They just don't have a legal right to.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.320]   Okay.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:49.960]   I think they do, but because remember that cable companies have a monopoly because the
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.960]   FCC allowed that.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.960]   That's a state.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:55.840]   He says that's a locally granted monopoly.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:01.120]   So when the FCC approves mergers like big cable mergers, they can put conditions on things,
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.040]   but those conditions don't necessarily.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.600]   I read through the time Warner cable in charter conditions.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:13.800]   And then there may have been something in NBCU in Comcast.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:22.440]   So Comcast buying NBCUniversal, they did make some conditions around content, like minority
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.440]   owned stations and some things like that.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.960]   But that falls apart after a certain timeframe.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.160]   I can't remember if it's seven days.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:33.840]   Yeah, they do regulate the prices for advertising on cable television.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.840]   There is a political.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.120]   In cooperation with local franchisean authorities.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:44.720]   It's in the FCC rules title 47 of the Federal Communications Commission communications act
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.920]   1934.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.480]   They have to maintain a political file.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.320]   They do all a lot of the same things.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.200]   I think there are different rules perhaps for broadcasted cable, but they are absolutely
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.480]   regulated even satellite.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.480]   Okay.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:07.960]   So when it comes to speech, well, like I said, you can have different rules.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.560]   You know, there's also the children's hour.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.840]   They allow you to say certain things after 11 p.m.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.320]   There's stuff like that.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.000]   You know, who is a legally qualified candidate for office?
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.760]   The equal opportunity access to advertising and to interviews and cable.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.360]   Yeah, this is yeah.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.520]   The political file.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.120]   I mean, you got me?
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:36.240]   Well, I, you know, relevant sections of the SEC's rules dealing with cable television
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.000]   systems.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.680]   It's not the same, but there's definitely I mean, these are all this is cable rules like
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.160]   we're looking at scrolling by.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.920]   I don't help rates and classes of time sponsored by identification.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.320]   This makes sense.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.920]   I don't I think it should be regulated.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:58.400]   Oh, I'm never a favor of regulating speech.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.400]   Anyway, let's put it this way.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.160]   Buzzfeed is not regulated.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.160]   We know that.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.760]   And so they could turn down Donald Trump.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:12.200]   But I wonder, is that a good thing?
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.640]   If they're transparent about it, sure.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:22.360]   I mean, I want to Facebook said we will not allow a Donald Trump page or any Donald Trump
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.840]   commentary.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.800]   We have a story on that about the whole rape thing, right?
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:33.800]   Your users revolt and then presumably you either modify your position or you just stick
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   to it.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.040]   So Buzzfeed can get away from this because they're not dominant.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.520]   No, they can't away with it because they were transparent.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.520]   They're pure media.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.720]   Your argument is the Facebook's not, but what about let's push this.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.920]   What if Donald Trump or a pack for Donald Trump try to put it out up saying that Mexicans
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.440]   are all rapists and murderers.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.440]   That's different.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:56.280]   They're turning down all advertising by the Republican candidate for president of the
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.280]   United States.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.280]   Yeah, very differently.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.480]   Well, because he has said that all Mexicans are rapists.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.480]   No, because they disagree with him politically.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.280]   Oh, they're saying I think it's unprecedented.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.280]   This is unprecedented.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.560]   Yeah, I'm not sure it's about that.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:15.320]   What if what if Vice said we're not going to take last election cycle.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.160]   We're not going to do any ads for Barack Obama.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.800]   We'll take all the ads from it.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.800]   Romney.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.800]   And I think what would happen to Stacy's point.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.360]   I think I think the users of vice would probably have a proper fit.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.320]   But at some point, this is only if somebody's got a reactant in sanity that we have in
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.320]   Donald Trump.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:34.160]   I think the difference is that it's a platform.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:40.080]   And when you claim to be a platform, you, a certain amount of neutrality is expected
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.320]   where BuzzFeed is just a news outlet and they can have a point of view.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.320]   It's okay.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.320]   But it's a powerful.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.800]   No, I'm going to disagree.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.400]   So I think Facebook doesn't, they can do what they want.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.720]   And I think it's important for people to remember this.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.120]   So if Facebook says we don't want to run Donald Trump ads or we don't want to run Hillary
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:01.400]   Clinton ads, I mean, in DC, Facebook's lobbyists are mostly Republicans.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.760]   So let's take it.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.440]   Hillary Clinton ads.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.440]   They can.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:11.280]   And you know, as long as I feel like as long as they say something to people say, hey,
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.880]   you're never going to see this here because we don't agree with it.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.320]   I'm actually okay with it.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.440]   And if your users are mad, your users are going to tell you.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:24.280]   And then we can have a really interesting conversation about the power of platforms and
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:29.440]   having one monopolistic, like one set of monopolistic tech platforms on the internet.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.200]   And that could be really good for us.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.440]   I think you're right, Stacey.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:37.560]   And I think for if you consider a platform, you know, if we argue with media, I actually
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:42.400]   am not sure it is, but fine for this discussion, argue that it is, then for government to
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.160]   tell them what they have to take, I find great problems with that.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:52.240]   Just as when you disagree, though, with the FCC requiring the cable and broadcast television,
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.760]   except ads from Donald Trump, do you disagree with that?
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.760]   Yes.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.760]   Yes.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.760]   You don't think the government should be in that.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.760]   It's a little irresponsibility.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.800]   If somebody puts up a Nazi ad, even if you're writing for president, well, there are rules
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   that you should not.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.400]   Yeah, there are rules about like lying and pale.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:12.920]   But if it just says something that you find absolutely important and offensive, it's it's
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.640]   why should you be different from another media outlet?
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:19.680]   Because this is about free speech and free speech includes what you don't say, what you
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:24.120]   do edit, which is I've got water about that recently.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:29.120]   And the fact that when this, when this, I think BS, Gawker story about the supposed
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:34.280]   anti-conservative stuff at Facebook trends went on, then a member of Congress called him on
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:38.920]   carpet and they went, we in, we in press, we should have been rallying behind Facebook
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.440]   and said, don't you dare go to Congress.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.360]   You do not answer to Congress for what you say and don't say.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.360]   That's the first amendment.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.760]   That is exactly what the first member is about.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:51.760]   Is that Congress shall not pass laws regulating the press and speech.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.400]   Shall not, period, very simple.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.040]   That's when that's the essence of the first amendment.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.280]   You can't tell me what to say.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.080]   You can't tell me what not to say.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.640]   And at the end, I answer one of my public and my customers.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.000]   But clearly, yeah, I understand what you're saying, but clearly that is not how we've
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.440]   been doing business up to now.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.320]   And it's been, and I hate the FCC for it.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   Okay.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.200]   I've written cover stories about about, and this is Howard Stern got driven.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.000]   And I argue that, I'm going to say a word now, watch out, put it in the rundown.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.720]   Bull is political speech.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.120]   Now the fact that you're going to have to knock that out there because in this case,
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:30.280]   you're dealing with a private argument, which is, which is, I just choose to.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.640]   You choose to, but Apple Apple could do it with that.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.200]   I just choose on broadcast.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.240]   We were on broadcast, right?
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.600]   And BS, I'll be, I'll be okay now, is political speech.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.360]   If you can't call BS, what is more political speech than that?
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.040]   How is it that we decide that that's nasty?
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.480]   Who decided that's nasty?
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.760]   Who set that standard?
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.920]   Government should have nothing, not a zero to do with that.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.920]   Nothing.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.920]   Wow.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:58.280]   So in these FCC rules, because I've been looking at them, because I think we're a little confused,
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.920]   and I'm not ready to be like, I am the authority because I've read a couple of these pages.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.520]   I love having you on the show Stacey, you're kidding.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.800]   But they have, under the broadcast rules, and this, this is kind of interesting, broadcasting,
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.840]   they have a prohibition against broadcasting false information.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.840]   Right.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:19.760]   Because you can't broadcast false information, oh, but it's only during a crime or catastrophe
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.880]   if the licensee knows the information is false, which in a lot of ways would exclude a lot
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:25.880]   of--
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.880]   No, ads are different.
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:31.040]   People, I think people always thought that ads had to be true.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.480]   That's the FTC.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.920]   That's the FTC.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:40.000]   And they don't really, they're not that stringent.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.880]   Generally truthiness.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:42.880]   General truthiness.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:51.480]   But I don't actually see under the cable and satellite specific stuff about political ads.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.480]   And that's what I'm going to do.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:57.200]   Well, keep going, because there is a whole section that talks about who is a candidate,
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.200]   who's not a candidate.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:02.240]   They have to maintain what's called a political file, which shows to the public what they've
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.160]   turned down, what they've accepted.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.600]   And I think that's great.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.240]   I mean, that's kind of a bare minimum.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:13.400]   What I don't know is what the rules are on you must accept political advertising.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.400]   I know broadcasters are required to accept-- I believe-- actually, I shouldn't say I know.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:21.240]   I believe broadcasters are required to accept political advertising.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.600]   Oh, they quite like getting political advertising, because it's--
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.040]   Yeah, that's why I don't know, because they would never turn it down.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.120]   By the way, BuzzFeed turned out $1.3 million from Trump.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.440]   This was not a small buy.
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.440]   And I love it.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.160]   Jake Baroubi, who's a senior advertising executive at the Daily Caller, said, "Hey,
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:42.520]   I'd name--" which is a conservative news website, "I'd literally name my first-born
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.960]   Bernie Clinton for $1.3 million.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:49.360]   I can't imagine turning down that kind of money for any reason."
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:54.920]   So I guess you could say it's a principled stand, but it worries me a little bit, but
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.760]   it would only worry me if there weren't other sources of news than BuzzFeed.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.520]   Yeah, but there's a point-- I'm not going to get you in trouble with your audience and
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.880]   go into political stuff.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.640]   So folks, I'm just going to do this for the sake of the argument.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.520]   OK, OK, let me do that, please.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.720]   Well, just flip it.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:11.720]   Just use the other candidates.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:17.320]   No, no, no, I'm going to say that if Hitler ran for president at some point, what's the
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.280]   line of responsibility?
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.280]   And the platform is the Jews are evil.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.280]   Yeah, I understand.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.280]   But at the point--
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:28.040]   If the Republican Party nominated him, I guess you'd have to-- well, no, even then.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.520]   What if the Republican Party has gone crack?
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.520]   No, you're right.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.280]   You should be able to say, "I'm not going to take ads from this guy."
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.280]   You're right.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.280]   I think you can be selective.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.280]   Do it another way.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.280]   What if you're Fox?
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   And Hillary Clinton wants to run an ad saying, "All Republicans are Donald Trump is this
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.280]   or that."
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.280]   Right.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.920]   I think Fox has a right not to run it.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.920]   OK.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:48.920]   No, good.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.920]   We're done.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   All right.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920]   I think you made an excellent point.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:55.160]   Well, I don't want to belabor it.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.560]   We will talk about the Supreme Court--
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.560]   Quite special, Leo.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.880]   That's what I do is belabor it.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.520]   We will talk about the Supreme Court and the Google Class Action lawsuit, which the Supreme
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.720]   Court has agreed, can continue.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.440]   And just a bit.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.440]   Lots more to talk about.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.440]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:16.360]   Professor Jarvis from the City Universe at New York, where he's a widely respected liberal.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.960]   How do we help the Potency Williams?
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.920]   No, I think I'm strong thumbing.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:31.960]   But anyway, also, Ron Amadio from Mars Technic, who is wisely just stepping back a little bit,
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.120]   just taking a little step back.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.120]   We'll get to gear.
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.120]   We'll get to the geek stuff, damn it.
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.120]   The saw is worse.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:43.560]   And we will also continue with Stacey Higginbotham, our newest member of the crew.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:50.240]   So glad to have Stacey on IOT and Gigastacey joining us for the show today.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.240]   I will be soon.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.560]   I will be standing up as I do my show.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:54.400]   I like to stand up.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.280]   I always did the TV standing up.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.960]   And I often did radio standing up.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:03.080]   A standing desk is awesome because it kind of keeps the blood going and stuff.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.400]   But sometimes you want to sit down.
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.400]   Sometimes you're tired.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.400]   You don't want to stand up.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.320]   Wouldn't it be nice to have a desk that could do both?
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.720]   Well, Veridesque can.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:10.840]   That's where the name comes from.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.000]   It's a variable.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.800]   Veridesque.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.280]   If you spend a lot of time sitting at your computer, you should know that being sedentary
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.580]   is widely agreed.
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:21.440]   Being sedentary is not good for you.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:25.640]   Mayo Clinic says sitting puts you at a greater risk for obesity, increased blood pressure,
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.080]   high blood sugar.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.080]   It's nice.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:32.800]   It's just nice for your energy to be able to stand and sit and move around.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.840]   Veridesque is so great because it sits on top of your existing desk or cubicle means
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.560]   no boss approval required.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.920]   There's no installation or assembly.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.320]   Either it just comes in a box.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.440]   You take it out, you put it on your desk.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.720]   And suddenly, put your gear on it, your monitor's on it.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.920]   You can raise and lower it.
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.080]   Veridesque is adjustable.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:55.960]   From 11 different height settings, you just put your fingers on your handles on either
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:56.960]   side.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.280]   It's spring loaded so you don't have to f- it up.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:03.120]   It's just up and down no matter even if you have a couple of monitors on there.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.120]   And it's affordable too.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:09.360]   Prices start as low as $175 with free shipping in the continental United States.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.720]   Lifehacker called Veridesque, one of their five best standing desks.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:18.720]   It's been featured on product hunt, gear patrol, and we are very happy to have Veridesque
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:19.720]   in our new studio.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:24.840]   Much as Pied Piper did in their new offices in Silicon Valley, of course, they got kicked
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.840]   out of those offices after about four episodes.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:30.560]   But we're going to happen for a little longer than that, I hope.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.280]   We just love the Veridesque.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.040]   All our new, all our desks in the new studio are going to be Veridesque.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:40.160]   Veridesque.com, if you want to learn more, check out their wide range of height adjustable
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:45.720]   desks, your desk, your cubicle, no boss approval required.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.560]   In fact, it's all likely that the boss will come over and say, "Where'd you get that
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.560]   I want one?"
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.120]   And make sure you tell them you heard about it on Twitter.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:56.280]   A-R-I-Vera-D-E-S-K.com.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:01.400]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:05.880]   Android M, the name is going to be unveiled in a few weeks.
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.320]   What do you think, panel, nutroll?
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.320]   Wu.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.320]   Nougat?
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.320]   Nutella?
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.320]   Nutella.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:20.400]   It's amazing how much they've turned the name into a, into like a news cycle thing where
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.120]   it's like, "Man, whatever, just call it something."
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.720]   Yeah, it's just a code name for crying out loud.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.440]   We know, I mean, it's Android 7, right?
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.400]   I mean, it's just a code name.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.400]   It's beyond 6.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.400]   Yeah, who knows what they'll actually...
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.640]   Oh, it could be 6.1, I guess, huh?
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.560]   Yeah, or 5, or I don't know.
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:39.960]   They go crazy with version of this.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:44.560]   But I wonder if that means like release is coming in a few weeks or what?
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.560]   It's supposed to be...
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.200]   No, it's supposed to be Q3, right?
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.200]   Is that in a few weeks?
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.200]   I don't know.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.200]   No.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.200]   No.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.200]   Okay.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.200]   Please.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.200]   No.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.600]   So, yeah, they tweeted, "Thanks for your submissions.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.440]   We'll reveal a new name in a few weeks."
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:10.800]   And they did that today, so with a little, a little pretty little video.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:16.200]   You know, I just want to say, the problem with Nutella courses is commercial, but you
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.200]   can make your own Nutella.
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:22.120]   I was at Whole Foods the other day.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:25.440]   And you know how they have the peanut grinder and the almond grinder and you make fresh peanut
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.680]   butter, almond butter?
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:34.440]   In the middle, they had hazelnuts and chocolate chips, and you grind it and it goes in together
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.200]   to make a delicious treat.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.200]   Wow.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.200]   Make your own Nutella.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.760]   Not Nutella trademark.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.760]   It's not Nutella.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.760]   What is it?
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.760]   Nutella.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.760]   Nutella.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:47.760]   Oh.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:51.080]   I should have looked carefully and see what the sign is.
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:54.200]   Maybe there is such a thing as a non-Newtella Nutella.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:57.760]   It was so good, by the way, much better than that plastic stuff.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.080]   Hazelnut chocolate spread?
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.080]   That's...
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.720]   Android hazelnut chocolate spread?
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:03.720]   No.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:04.720]   No, it's going to start with the end.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.720]   It's going to start with the end.
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.880]   Chocolate hazelnut spread is what they call it.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:08.880]   Oh.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:09.880]   You looked it up.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:10.880]   My chips is looking it up.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:11.880]   Yeah, it makes sense.
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:15.080]   You would emphasize the chocolate first as opposed to the healthier.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.960]   It looks a little like baby poop.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:18.960]   But it's...
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:24.000]   They have a recipe and ingredients online at Whole Foods.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   Well, what is in it?
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.560]   Just hazelnuts and dark chocolate.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:32.000]   One third cup almonds, one third cup hazelnuts.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   Oh.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   I'm sorry, one and one third cup hazelnuts, one and one third cups sweet and plain almond
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   milk.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   Oh.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   One cup pitted dates.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   No, this is not what...
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.280]   Unsweetened cocoa powder, one tablespoon pure vanilla extract.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.280]   No.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.280]   No.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.280]   That's terrible.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.040]   That's one kind of healthy.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.040]   No.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.320]   This was hazelnuts and dark chocolate chips.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:56.240]   In a thing, you turn the knob and it...
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:00.840]   And again, it has this kind of...
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:01.840]   Not that.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.840]   That's a spread.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:03.840]   When does Twit do a clean?
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:04.840]   A good difference.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.840]   This would be a good podcast.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.600]   I would love to be on the cooking show.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.600]   I'll tell you why.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.080]   The studio in the kitchen making some...
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.480]   There's no news in a spare.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.280]   I guess this is a wise friend of mine.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.600]   Why did you were pitching an Asparagus story?
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:21.040]   What was the one we worked my friend Joan Finney when we worked on Epicurious?
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:25.160]   Oh, I had to do a news section because there's no news in Asparagus.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.240]   Well, that's true.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:33.000]   But we found the news in Nutella or Nutroll or New Gitter, NuttyBuddy or Nurds or...
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.720]   Yeah, there's not that many options.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.800]   I can't believe they made like a submission thing.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.800]   So crazy.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.360]   Like there's probably only 10 names you could come up with.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.360]   It actually worked.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.360]   There's gotta be Nutella.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:44.440]   There's gotta be an end pie of some sort, right?
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.440]   Or cake?
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.440]   No?
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.440]   I'm really having...
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.440]   Nilla vanilla wafer pie.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.440]   They said it didn't have to be a dessert.
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:53.440]   Are they gonna break press a...
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.440]   What?
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:55.440]   They said that.
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:56.640]   Oh, yeah, they said it could be anything.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.240]   Nutella really is in a dessert.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.240]   Let's be honest.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.240]   It's a breakfast spread.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.040]   No, that is a dessert.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.040]   In my house, that is a cigar.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.640]   Is it no food or a woe food?
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:09.440]   Oh, you have a classification system, Stacy.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.440]   Tell us more.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.440]   Yeah, go.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.440]   No, woe, slow and go.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.440]   Oh my God, I need this.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.440]   Oh, that's amazing.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.840]   Do you have colored stickers?
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.440]   No, no, that's crazy talk.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.440]   That's insane.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:23.440]   Wait a minute.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:27.440]   No, go, woe or slow.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.440]   What does woe mean?
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:32.440]   No, woe, slow or go.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.440]   So, no is absolutely not.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.440]   It's like jello shots.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.440]   You cannot have jello shots.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:38.440]   No, that's go.
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.440]   Well, age dependent.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:42.440]   Our classification is.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:46.440]   It's like cake or pies or.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.440]   So a little bit.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.440]   A little bit is good for you.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.440]   Slow is.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.440]   Nutella would be a woe.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.440]   Nutella is a woe.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.440]   Yeah, Nutella is a woe.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:59.440]   And then slow is things like, I don't know, mac and cheese.
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:02.440]   And then go veggies.
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.440]   I have got to adopt this.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.440]   Is that your invention?
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.440]   No, no.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.440]   My daughter came home from school with it.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.440]   This is awesome.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.440]   Oh, no, go, woe or slow.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.440]   Do you add?
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.440]   I was strictly to you here to this.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.440]   And where does Chipotle fall on the scale?
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.440]   Me, that's a go.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.440]   It's pretty cool.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:23.440]   For a lot of people, that's a go, go, go, go, go, go.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:24.440]   Is it a go?
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.440]   Was it a stop for a while?
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.440]   Was it a woe for a while?
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.440]   Not for me.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:30.440]   Depends how you feel about it.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:32.440]   It would just be, you know, you know.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.440]   I'm from Texas.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.440]   We really got a lot of people.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.440]   There's strong evidence now.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.440]   What did I read?
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:46.440]   I read a study of children in Finland and then across the border in Russia.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:53.440]   And the children in Finland had a much higher incidence of asthma and other autoimmune diseases
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:56.440]   than the children in Russia, even though they grew up in almost identical climates.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:01.440]   The only difference was the finish were very clean.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:06.440]   They were even genetically similar because, you know, the cross-border pollination.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.440]   But the fins were too clean.
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:14.440]   And so the kids were not exposed to the flora and fauna.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:18.440]   And they actually think it comes down to gut to the gut flora.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:20.440]   Oh, like your bio?
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.440]   I can believe it, like more diversity in your gut flora.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:30.440]   What they did is they examined the gut flora and they found a significant difference between those two groups.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:34.440]   And then they were able to, I have to find this study because it was fascinating.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:46.440]   And then we're able to kind of look at other groups and see that in fact this might be well related to the immune issues and asthma and other things.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.440]   So.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.440]   Okay.
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:54.440]   If you're in Finland, whoa, if you're in Russia, go.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:57.440]   Poor Ron's thinking, what am I doing here?
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:03.440]   It's like, well, no, I'm getting tweeted that there's a, you know, Apple announced that, um,
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:06.440]   they rearranged their app store split.
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.440]   So it's, uh, what is it?
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.440]   It's not 30% anymore.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.440]   No.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.440]   Is it 1585?
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:18.440]   They re-announced the app store split to 8515, like share with the show.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.440]   That's huge.
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.440]   And Google was just like, yeah, we're going to do that too.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.440]   It's cool.
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.440]   That's just happening.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:25.440]   Yes.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:32.440]   Four hours ago, Apple details, app store changes, including new subscription revenue split and search result ads.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:33.440]   Ooh.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:38.600]   Uh, this is Phil Schiller's doing.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:44.640]   He added the app store to his role at Apple, uh, just six months ago.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:49.920]   Apple's going to start showing search ads for apps in its iOS app store search results
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:50.920]   for the first time.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:56.760]   So I was at a Google Play event in London, uh, just yesterday.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:02.680]   And they said that, uh, the average number of users has 16 apps they use per month.
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:08.120]   Are apps, um, trailing?
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.360]   Is that the problem here?
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.440]   Apps are people who start using apps as much.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.760]   Actually, that, I remember that's, that's a normal person.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:15.760]   Yes, I know.
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.200]   But that's, but then when you get to scale, that's the issue.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:22.600]   But if, but on your front page, on your iPhone, how many icons?
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:23.600]   It doesn't matter.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:26.720]   I mean, do you use, I've got tons of icons that I, I, but on the front of reality.
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:28.560]   Which is the stuff that you use most.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.960]   Yeah, that's even there.
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.920]   That's not, that's like 20, right?
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:33.920]   Hmm.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:36.120]   Oh, depends on what we have there.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.560]   I, we've talked about this before.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:40.080]   I'm willing to bet most people do not add many apps.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.080]   They just use the apps.
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.080]   The phone comes with most normal people, right?
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.240]   And those that like I got dual lingo salted in there, which is right.
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:50.720]   I'm trying to get myself to use it because I want to learn what's managed, but I don't
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:54.680]   I have 200 apps on my Android device, but I guarantee you I don't use.
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:57.560]   I have Kindle there, but I don't read Kindle every month.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:00.360]   I read books other ways.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.640]   You know, I'm off the there.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:02.640]   Does that count?
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:06.680]   I mean, it's just so, so, so is the app business just not as good as we thought they're trying
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:11.160]   to encourage more to maybe maybe I mean, there's no lack of apps.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.320]   And don't forget, here's the other thing.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:20.440]   I think I think I met with the PA, the program, what have you called product manager for
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:27.720]   the apps in London, really, really good guy and found it, you know, really fascinating
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.640]   to keep thinking about the impact of instant apps.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:33.240]   I also talked to another guy who was giving this talk at this event.
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:38.880]   I wanted to learn more and their presumption is that people, you know, they recognize huge
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:41.720]   friction to download their number to use an app.
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:42.720]   Huge friction.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:46.800]   Every publisher says those are amongst valuable users, but there's so few of them and it's
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:48.320]   really hard to get them to go.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:52.480]   So if you can pull a chunk of an app into the web, what's going to happen?
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:56.280]   Or is this going to act as marketing for the apps where people will download it?
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:59.760]   Maybe in some cases, but in a lot of cases, they'll never use the app.
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:02.720]   This is the way you'll get engagement with your app is by chunking it out.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.200]   No, I love this.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.240]   This instant app thing is great.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:12.920]   By the way, just to clarify, the new deal that Apple's offering is not for app purchases.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:14.440]   That will continue to be 70 30.
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:19.160]   This is for subscription apps where there is a regular subscription.
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:21.880]   And I'm going to tell you exactly why they did this.
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:29.320]   Subscription-based apps will see that models change to 85 15 if the customer subscription
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:30.720]   has been active for at least one year.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:34.520]   So the first year will be 70 30 subsequent years will be 85 15.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.160]   Oh, is it too addressed?
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:38.120]   Issues from like Spotify and publishers?
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:39.840]   Yeah, that's what this is.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:41.360]   Yeah, publishers have been saying screw you.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:42.720]   I'm going to take it out.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.560]   That's exactly what this is.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:49.760]   And I bet you there's significant pressure from not just Spotify, but Amazon.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:50.760]   Washington Post.
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:51.760]   Washington Post.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:52.760]   The Economist.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:54.760]   The FTE.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:55.760]   All the publishers.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.240]   Less so Amazon, Amazon.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.320]   Because those are individual purchases, aren't they?
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:01.240]   So it wouldn't be Amazon.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:05.400]   I feel like Apple really wants to get the Amazon app on the Apple TV.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:09.840]   And Amazon is saying, and I think they've said this publicly, we've got to have a better
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:10.840]   deal.
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:14.320]   It's going to be 70 30 thing when you when people buy stuff.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:19.520]   So so Apple, I think is changing the split after the first year of the subscription,
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:20.520]   right?
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.800]   Where Google's doing it right away.
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:22.800]   Interest.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:26.600]   Oh, hey, they had to jump in and one up.
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.600]   Competition, baby.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.040]   Free market, baby.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.760]   Can you say capitalism?
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:32.760]   Sorry.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:38.680]   On Android last, I saw the average number of apps installed was 95, which sounds insanely
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:39.680]   high.
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.080]   I believe though, that only 16 are being used.
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:43.440]   I was going to say installed.
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:45.880]   I totally would buy it.
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:50.200]   Google will offer app developers same revenue sharing terms that Apple just announced, except
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.840]   that it starts instantly.
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:53.000]   Wow.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   Now wait a minute though.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.840]   Let me look at that because Apple did not change the rev share.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:57.840]   This is only on subscriptions.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:59.240]   So it's only subscription.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:02.840]   Is this it for all of the Google Play Store or just subscriptions?
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:05.400]   Oh, pricing plan.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:13.720]   It'll be a strategy, find a revenue, giving app developers the ability to scroll up a
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.000]   little more.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   Other way.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   Other way.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   That's a good one.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.200]   Yeah, I don't want to see this.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.600]   No, it says the second paragraph.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.680]   It says it will move from a 70/30 subscription.
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:24.680]   For subscriptions.
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:25.680]   Per subscriptions.
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:26.920]   Okay.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:33.120]   So not for in-app purchases and not for app buys, but for renewing subscriptions.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.120]   So yeah, that is.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.880]   I mean, what are your subscriptions?
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:39.960]   It's mostly music and newspapers, right?
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.520]   Publications.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:45.240]   You might have like a smart home kind of device, like a camera subscription, but you're not
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:47.480]   going to buy that through that app.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:49.000]   These language learning things.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.080]   There's lots of them.
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:52.080]   Okay.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:53.080]   Oh, there are lots of them.
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:56.760]   Yeah, headspace, our advertiser headspace, the meditation program.
[00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:57.760]   That's a subscription.
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.520]   Yeah, that's a great up API.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.680]   You can use it for whatever you want.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.680]   I would assume.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.080]   I think that's a no.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:29.160]   That's a no.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:34.960]   Ron, I'm sure you're watching Lenovo's Lenovo Motorola's feed this morning.
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.680]   What did they announce?
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:38.680]   That's tomorrow.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.280]   Oh, I thought they were doing it today.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.920]   I thought it was tomorrow.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.920]   The might of Z.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:44.920]   I did not watch it.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.080]   Oh, well, neither did I, but I guess if it's tomorrow, that's why.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.960]   Yeah, tech world is the ninth.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:50.960]   It's not the ninth, right?
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:51.960]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.160]   Yeah, it's weird.
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.720]   Lenovo wants to host like a, I don't know.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.760]   It's like kind of a developer conference.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:03.160]   It's like it's clearly that they want to emulate like Google IO and WWDC.
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.480]   Samsung does that too, but who goes, right?
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.000]   But it's like Lenovo doesn't have any platforms.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:14.360]   At least Samsung makes like Tizen and there's some APIs, but Lenovo only ships like Windows
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.360]   and Android devices.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:20.320]   So I don't know what people are going to do at this thing, but yes, it's tomorrow in
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:26.080]   San Francisco, we're expecting to see like a new Motorola phone, either the new, the new
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:31.080]   like Motorola flagship, I would assume, which is going to be called the Z or the X maybe.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:38.560]   And then there's going to be a project tango show going on too, which Lenovo is making
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.200]   the first project tango device, which is, which if you don't know, project tango is
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:46.880]   kind of like a, imagine like an Xbox Kinect slapped onto the back of a smartphone like
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.360]   you, you, it's computer vision.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:54.520]   So like you point it at a, at a scene and it can take like a 3D map of it and kind of
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:02:01.000]   pass it off to developers and that'll do things like indoor mapping or funky augmented reality
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.200]   video games, stuff like that.
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.320]   That's really not a consumer product is tango.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:09.680]   I mean, yeah, this is the first consumer project tango device.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:10.880]   What am I going to use that for?
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.600]   I'm not saying it's going to be good.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.880]   You could super impose things like I look at something like that for like assembling
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.360]   Ikea furniture, right?
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.960]   You could super impose it.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:21.960]   All right.
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.960]   Okay.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.880]   So it's like augmented reality.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.720]   Well, there's an AR component.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.120]   It's not just that.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:32.400]   There's also, I mean, the mapping stuff is actually kind of cool.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.720]   But again, it doesn't it relies on you looking through the world through your phone, which
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.400]   is kind of a lame thing.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.920]   It really seems like one day they're going to strap this to like a funky version of Google
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.560]   Glass.
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.240]   And you know, you just need to get all the programming done and then you kind of replace
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.880]   the camera part with like a transparent sheet.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:50.880]   I still think like.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.600]   You will the augmented reality.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.000]   Line people.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.280]   I think I think that that that yeah, that if you could use it with audio cues and buzzing
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.520]   you have to keep knowing a space.
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.480]   Yes, have to feedback to say, don't go that.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.480]   Whoa, go slow.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:13.320]   You know, you that that or you say, this is where I want to go and it helps you find
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:18.880]   something knowing the space and then also knowing objects in the space where the hell
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.880]   would I put my blank?
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.960]   Oh my gosh.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:26.600]   Tracker has that they got in July.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:31.280]   They're going to launch their Atlas plug and tracker is that device thing.
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:35.080]   Actually, I think they're an advertiser on this show.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:40.160]   The it what it does is you can actually ties into the Amazon Echo and you can say.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.760]   Echo where are my keys in?
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:46.200]   She'll be able to say in the living room.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:51.800]   So that it's an outlet plus the trackers like the individual tracking units that are going
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.080]   to create this.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:59.080]   So if you think about that plus, you know, for haptic feedback on like a phone or something
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.120]   communicating that same like.
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.120]   You're getting whatever.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.120]   Yes.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.880]   Do you know how it gets its location?
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:07.880]   It does.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.960]   I do.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.680]   It's Bluetooth and Wi-Fi triangulation.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:15.760]   How does it know what the living room is versus.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:16.760]   Wi-Fi triangulation.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.760]   Wow.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.520]   The problem with Wi-Fi triangulation, I understand because there's a lot of Wi-Fi access points,
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.320]   but are there a lot of Bluetooth?
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:28.680]   Are you going to be a lot more Bluetooth than the Bluetonex Gen Bluetooth standard is going
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.280]   to have Bluetooth mesh.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.040]   Actually, yeah.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.840]   And I've talked to the thing and they want to do.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.520]   That's a good idea.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:39.120]   So then you have indoor location.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.280]   So I mean, it's not here today.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.280]   It could be.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:46.880]   But I think now that I think of it, when I pair, you know, turn on pairing on my phone,
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.040]   I do see a lot of things.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.720]   I see the Roku.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.720]   I see remotes.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:55.400]   There are other things normally, normally you don't want your Bluetooth to be visible.
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:56.480]   I mean, that's a big deal.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:01.600]   You don't leave your phone or your Bluetooth device in constant pairing mode because you
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:04.320]   don't want to be visible and be snarfed.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:07.960]   But maybe these new devices, especially with Ellie and whatever they're coming along with
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:08.960]   Bluetooth 8.
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:13.000]   There'll be always for something.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.280]   There'll always be kind of saying, hey, I'm over here.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.840]   I'm over here.
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:22.240]   And you can't, you know, with Wi-Fi, you could triangulate the signal by signal strength.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.200]   You could actually do pretty good location.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.200]   And there.
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.200]   So I don't know.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.200]   I think it's neat.
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.880]   When they come out, I'm totally going to get one so I can, it's actually three of them
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:35.440]   for sitting throughout my house and then I'm going to play with this because I'm so
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.440]   sick.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.440]   Great IoT story.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.440]   Yes.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.440]   Can I?
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.440]   It is.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:44.160]   Can I, can I just, since Stacy brought up this topic, I just wanted this most amusing
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.520]   thing I learned when I was gone for this week.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:47.520]   What?
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.520]   She mentioned, she mentioned IKEA chair.
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.240]   And that was an off topic, but I got to say this.
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:57.600]   I heard a speech at a newsguised from the holder of the only IKEA chair at a university
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.600]   in Sweden.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:02.600]   Isn't that just too great?
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:06.240]   Oh, that's an endowment I'd want.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.240]   Isn't that great?
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.240]   IKEA chair.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:14.040]   Do you have to assemble it himself or did it come crazy?
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:19.120]   That's actually known as "huh" right there.
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:22.240]   Google did an interesting, well, I guess we should take a break.
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.240]   I'm just looking at the time.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:27.200]   You let me take a break and then we'll come back and talk about a new app from Google
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.160]   for iOS, not Android.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.440]   They're doing more of this lately.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:31.440]   I'm worried.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.440]   Yo.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.840]   This is like Microsoft, right?
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:38.000]   Microsoft, not for their phone, but for everybody else's phone.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.120]   So Google, really?
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.520]   First a word from Atlassian.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:45.840]   If you're a programmer, a developer, if you work on a team, you probably use Atlassian.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:46.840]   I use Atlassian.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.720]   We use Atlassian all the time.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:56.160]   We first got introduced to Atlassian's JIRA, which is an incredible project management tool
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:02.080]   for agile teams, for teams working on a project, even really complex projects.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:06.640]   It lets you keep track of issues, keep track of who's doing what, what the assignments
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.640]   are.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:11.480]   If you're designing our new website, that's my first introduction to it.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.160]   We use it all the time now.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:17.640]   Developers for our new apps are using it.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.640]   It's great.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.000]   In fact, we use it for maintenance too, our maintenance contract on our website.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.800]   We can put up problems and have them solved and have them prioritized.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:29.360]   Assign track and manage tasks no matter how complex the project gets.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.240]   JIRA is awesome.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:36.920]   There's Confluence, which lets you create and share content, organize results, bring
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.080]   team members up to speed.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:45.480]   We use Confluence as a issue ticket within the enterprise.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.880]   Russell uses this.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.480]   HipChat, we live on HipChat.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.480]   HipChat's awesome.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.720]   In fact, I get HipChat notifications all the time.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:58.240]   I was just showing my notifications on Windows Weekly because we're working on the new studio.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:05.280]   Of course, when you're working on a new studio, we've got architects, contractors, engineers,
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.800]   lighting, camera guys, wiring guys.
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:10.880]   There's a big team involved.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.240]   HipChat, everybody puts everything into HipChat.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.480]   We actually trained some of the people who had never used it before because they'd send
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:18.480]   emails and something like that.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.480]   No, no, put it in HipChat.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:21.560]   Then it's all in one place.
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.080]   It's both synchronous and asynchronous.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.560]   You can have real-time conversations.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.240]   It's kind of like an instant messenger that way.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.720]   Everything is there.
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.040]   There's great history.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.040]   You can go back.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:35.240]   You can see Ryan's putting his designs in there because it handles it.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:39.680]   It images just fine, handles all sorts of integrations with all sorts of devices.
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:43.120]   We have it integrated with Panopta, for instance.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.600]   Now I get alerts.
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:50.120]   If our server goes down or there's issues with the mail, it is amazing.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:54.560]   Then Bitbucket, which lets you test, review, and manage code in real time.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:00.320]   This is a company doing solid tools for people who are getting things done.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.920]   We love all the Atlassian programs.
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.320]   I think you will too.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:08.320]   If you aren't using Atlassian yet, go to Atlassian.com and see how JIRA and Confluence
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.680]   and HipChat and Bitbucket can give your team everything you need to organize, discuss,
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.080]   and complete.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.720]   That's really important.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:19.920]   Great artists ship complete shared work.
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:28.280]   Atlassian helping teams everywhere team up to create what's next.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.280]   I love Atlassian.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:32.480]   I have to say, we live on HipChat.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:38.240]   JIRA is amazing if you've never used JIRA and you get the board and then you get the burn
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.920]   down and it shows you graphs.
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.360]   It's just really incredible.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:42.640]   I've never seen it.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.520]   Anything like it.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:47.640]   Let's talk about the Google Motion Stills app.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.680]   I don't have an iPhone with me, so I wasn't able to try it today.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.640]   Have you tried it yet, Ron?
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.520]   No, I have not.
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.000]   I have an iPhone somewhere around here.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.680]   There you go.
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:05.240]   I can already make gifts, so I don't know.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.600]   Well, I have to tell you.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:10.560]   This takes those great live photos that the iPhone does.
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:14.440]   That was something Apple added with the iPhone 6s, I guess.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:20.120]   The idea is you take a picture, kind of like what HTC did with their ZOAs.
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:24.400]   You're taking a still on the key and it takes a while to train yourself is to put the camera
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:29.440]   up, wait a moment, take the picture, and then leave the camera up because you're going
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:33.000]   to get not only the still, but a three second video around the still.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.160]   Then when you press and hold the image, it comes to life.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.160]   It's very cool.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.360]   It's a Harry Potter kind of a thing.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.080]   The way Apple does it is incompatible with everybody.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.960]   I'm sure Google did this because people were uploading these live images to Google Photos
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.280]   and saying, "What happened to the live?"
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:54.360]   Because really what it is is a still, a JPEG still, and an MOV file, a low-res MOV file
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.000]   shot at the same time.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.160]   Apple's put out an app, this is iPhone only, that will take those photos and turn them
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.600]   into animated GIFs.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.560]   By the way, do some smoothing.
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:10.560]   This is Paul Therrot has been using it, so I'm going to steal some stuff from his site,
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.560]   Therrot.com.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.680]   The animated GIF is great because that works everywhere.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.080]   The smoothing is important because as you probably know, if you've ever used the automated
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:25.360]   GIFs from the Google Photos, if you take a burst, it will say, "Hey, I could animate
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.160]   that," but they're often very jerky.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.480]   The smoothing is kind of neat.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.320]   Only negative is this stupid logo.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.320]   See this?
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.080]   That's on all your pictures.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:38.560]   Maybe just on your GIFs.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:44.920]   Google had said they plan on building this into Google Photos at some point.
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:50.360]   It will actually make it to Android eventually.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:55.200]   The HTC thing is interesting because when they did the whole Zoe thing, they had to
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.200]   do the same thing.
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.520]   They had these three second videos and they had nowhere to put them because if you upload
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.560]   them to YouTube or something, that really sucks.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:09.160]   HTC's response was to build an entire social network into the Zoe app and you could share
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:12.760]   Zoe with your friends who are also HTC customers.
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:15.440]   It was totally ridiculous.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:20.720]   Turning them into GIFs is a good solution for getting that content out to actual social
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.720]   networks that people use.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:24.520]   Yeah, you need a standard, don't you?
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:27.680]   I'm going to look at my assistant here.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:35.160]   What's fun, let me see if I have any animations, what's fun is the way it will take burst mode
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:40.480]   photos and animate them.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:43.280]   I guess this is asking if I want to create an animation.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.000]   That's no good.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.480]   There should be a section called assistant that would have.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.480]   Yeah, I'm in it.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.480]   I'm just seeing.
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:53.000]   It has a lot of, because my son graduated from high school a year ago, so three years
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.040]   ago, so I have a lot of pictures.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.040]   Here we go.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.720]   Here's an animated picture of our kickies.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:07.520]   See, the reason that looks like that is because it was three photoshopped close in time,
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:10.240]   but not with the intent of animating them.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:14.920]   But if they had some smoothing and interpolation and stuff, that could make it more interesting.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:15.920]   I don't know.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:17.400]   I kind of like the glitchingness of it.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.080]   It's a little bit, it's like a flip book.
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.480]   It is like a flip book.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.560]   I feel like the internet loves stuff like that.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.560]   Yeah, well, we're getting used to it.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:32.280]   The demo on this is from the Google research team, which is pretty crazy.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:38.360]   The demo of it is like the stabilization wasn't just the weird YouTube stabilization where
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.760]   everything kind of turns into jello.
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:47.960]   They had like, it looked like they were getting some kind of point cloud out of your video.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:51.160]   They showed little dots on everything in the background.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:56.040]   It was getting kind of like a real 3D look at things and then could use that to stabilize
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.040]   the camera.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:02.200]   It seems like the stabilization would be really good and advanced, especially coming out of
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.920]   the research section.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:10.240]   I have to say, I just love Google Photos, the fact that they made a photo album out of
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:12.080]   my son's graduation.
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.040]   I forgot this was 2013.
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.440]   It's just really great to have.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.120]   In fact, I sent a link.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.760]   I saw this in my photos.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.360]   I said a link to my son.
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:24.000]   I said, remember this day three years ago?
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.160]   Isn't that cool?
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.280]   Just that it does that for you.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.000]   I love that.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   So you said they're putting more AI.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.400]   They're going to do more with the photos.
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:35.640]   Well, photos already uses AI for all of the search stuff.
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:42.040]   You can type in cars and it will recognize that there's cars in your thing and show
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.560]   them.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:49.720]   It sounds like this thing uses a good amount of machine learning too to train the video
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.080]   stabilization software.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.080]   I'd guess.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.080]   Interesting.
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:58.360]   I like it when companies take this stuff that's in the labs and just put them out as
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:02.520]   not necessarily a complete product or just do it because it's fun.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.520]   It's cool.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:11.080]   So Facebook has done a similar image search on like if you search horses, it will show
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:14.360]   you pictures of horses, for example.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:19.440]   So they're doing a similar thing with their AI and our machine learning efforts.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:22.760]   And then I'm just offering this is what everybody does.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.040]   I was like, oh, I can do that.
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:25.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.040]   We got that.
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.760]   Yeah, they're using actual, but they're there.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:33.520]   If they haven't applied it, they're starting to apply it in different parts of their business.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:39.680]   So they used machine learning for images to do their maps for showing where internet connectivity
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:42.560]   wasn't the they took it.
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:51.440]   They took the machine learning model that they trained to recognize geophysical things.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:56.320]   They took satellite maps of the world and then they used their machine learning model
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.200]   to figure out where people lived.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:04.680]   So they could figure out where to try to fly their drones or they're doing the drones,
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:05.680]   right?
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:10.400]   Yeah, their lasers, their balloons, their everybody's doing it all the same stuff, right?
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:18.320]   And the shutter stock actually uses a similar machine learning algorithm to show you.
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.320]   And this is kind of interesting.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:26.760]   The best possible outcome or the best possible photograph to purchase if you search for like
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:33.880]   horses and they said that they saw I think it was an 80% increase in their sales in the
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.440]   first week, which is pretty cool.
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:40.840]   And that's actually it's worth saying that they optimized for a different.
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.760]   Uh oh.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:43.960]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.720]   Oh, yeah, I was like, did y'all lose?
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:51.080]   But they optimized for sales versus like accuracy of the image or something you might
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:54.760]   like more, which I think is cool.
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.480]   I don't know.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:00.360]   One thing I don't want Google to do is compose music.
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.360]   Oh, that was terrible.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:07.560]   They're calling it Project Magenta, which by the way is not just for music.
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:10.680]   Magenta is machine intelligence in the arts.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:11.760]   So it's going to do music.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.760]   It's going to do hearts, it's going to do stories.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:18.480]   I was asking Carson if he could find the Magenta music to play for us.
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:24.520]   This is the first machine made song from Google's Magenta.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:31.440]   Now I have to point out that it only is using four notes, C, C, G and G, which sounds like
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:34.600]   two notes to me, but I guess music people know that there's differences.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.360]   I don't know.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.760]   Um, Carson's looking for the song to play.
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:46.200]   Uh, yeah, I mean, but again, we're in the infancy and these are two year olds, basically.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.160]   This is the very beginning of machine learning.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.840]   They haven't learned much yet.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:54.240]   Yeah, I don't see how generated music is particularly interesting though.
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.320]   The art thing is really weird.
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.320]   Look at this.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.440]   This is kind of psychedelic, isn't it?
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.440]   It's very Geiger.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.440]   HR Geiger.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.440]   I'll wait.
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:04.440]   Hold on a sec.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:07.440]   There you go.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:18.440]   It sounds like a three year old at a piano.
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.320]   They just do four notes.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.320]   I don't know.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.760]   Because it's a brain that's not so smart.
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.760]   I don't know.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.320]   I was going to say it's probably limiting the game to be.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.320]   Here comes the drum.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.320]   Oh, okay.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.760]   So boring.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:34.560]   I don't know.
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.560]   Is it boring?
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.360]   It's dopey.
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.480]   Yeah, not impressed.
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.320]   Okay.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:51.920]   Now listen to this and look at the psychedelic art that I've got on my screen.
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.200]   Now what would you say?
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.800]   That's the art magenta made.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:57.800]   That's at least weird.
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:00.920]   That's like beyond something any person would say.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:02.080]   I kind of like this.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.160]   It's very, like I said, HR Geiger.
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.160]   Okay.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.800]   Enough for the Googly CCGG.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.520]   They're totally different.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:14.560]   One is very cheerful and happy and innocent sounding because it sounds like a kid's playing
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:15.560]   it.
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:21.000]   And then that art is like the dark underbelly, the internet.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.120]   And the art is also like extremely complex, which is what this stuff is good at, I feel
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:26.120]   like.
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:27.120]   It's not, is it?
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:30.200]   Yeah, I think anybody could pound away on four notes and come up with something like
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.200]   that.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:36.160]   But if you handed me a pencil, I could definitely not draw whatever that weird black thing was.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.720]   Here's a video.
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:40.720]   This is not working.
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:42.360]   I don't know what's going on there.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:50.160]   A video based on Deep Dream, which is that Google AI, you know, that looks at stuff and
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.160]   then does stuff.
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.360]   It looks like an LSD trip.
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.360]   It does.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:55.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.360]   It does, doesn't it?
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:04.720]   There's probably some something to be derived from that observation, but I'm not sure what.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:05.720]   I don't know.
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:10.960]   I would say so for creativity, I have to say this is actually way more compelling than
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:15.600]   IBM's Watson creativity efforts, which were around cooking.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:18.240]   I mean, the results of that are awesome.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:19.840]   Have you had any of Watson's cooking?
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:20.840]   Oh, yes.
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.600]   Is it whoa or go or slow or no?
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.600]   It's delicious.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.600]   It's very different.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:26.600]   Really?
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:27.600]   Where have you had it?
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.600]   Tell us about it.
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.600]   Oh, okay.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.600]   It was South by Southwest.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.600]   I think it was what year is it?
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:33.600]   Okay.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:34.600]   It was 20.
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:35.600]   A human did it, right?
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.320]   I mean, the recipe was for Watson.
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:42.760]   Watson takes like a bunch of different things, like including like what flavors are paired
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:46.560]   in different regions and then it's got a thing that says like, these are the types of things
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:49.320]   people are most attracted to from a labor profile.
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.320]   Sweet and salty and right.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:57.720]   And it spits out random recipe pairings and then someone from, I think it's like, maybe
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.640]   it's the cordon blue school.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:00.920]   Maybe it's somebody else.
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:03.040]   They actually cook it.
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:09.360]   So they did this awesome dinner at South by and the coolest and most delicious pairing
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:14.160]   was like these olives and cherries, like top and odd kind of thing.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.400]   And it was delicious.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:19.400]   They, but some of them olives and cherries top and odd.
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:21.400]   It was.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.160]   Food only a computer could generate.
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.000]   I don't think a human would think of that.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000]   Well, that's, I thought it was really exciting because sweet and salty.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.800]   I mean, you wouldn't think of it in there.
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.640]   You go and they have the cookbook and I've seen the cookbook, but I've not made anything
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:35.640]   out of the cookbook.
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:36.760]   So I can't tell you about that.
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:39.000]   We can put that on our, our, our kitchen.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000]   I'm going to get.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   I'm going to get that cookbook.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.520]   I bet I'll send it to you.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:47.080]   Not sold in stores.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.280]   It is sold in stores, actually, I think.
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:22:00.940]   stories. U.S. Supreme Court is going to let the Google advertising class action suit go forward.
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:05.840]   They let standard lower courts decision to allow class action lawsuits. That doesn't mean
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:11.700]   it's going to the Supreme Court, but they didn't block the lower court from having the
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:12.700]   trial.
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:19.100]   It's a fairly limited, I think there's a case here too. It's from 2004 to 2008 and the Google
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:21.760]   was putting ads on junk pages.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.260]   People were paying for it.
[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:28.900]   Accused Google violating the California Fair Advertising laws because it told advertisers,
[01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:34.420]   misled advertisers about where the ads were going to go.
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:40.980]   The ad words of course puts ads next to search results, but Google should also have told
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:45.820]   the advertisers it would also appear. Their ads would also appear in undesirable places
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:51.260]   like error pages and parks domains.
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:55.260]   But I don't think Google did that on purpose, right? Isn't that ad words?
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:59.220]   I mean, yeah, people are free to put ad word blocks.
[01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:00.220]   On anything they want.
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:01.220]   Right. Yeah.
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:02.220]   Yeah.
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:04.620]   But I think Google has some measure of standards they need to set up.
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:09.460]   Yeah. But I mean, if I, if I, because it's just an in bed, if I have an AdWords account
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:15.980]   and I put AdWords on my 404 page, I mean, it was very common practice to do that with
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:16.980]   the...
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:17.980]   It was the time, yes.
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:18.980]   Yeah.
[01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:24.220]   With the search errors or with parking domains. A lot of you see a lot of parked domains that
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:26.660]   would just have a whole three columns of ads.
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:30.260]   I don't know. If you buy Google AdWords...
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:34.660]   Well, I was in the early days.
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:35.660]   Yeah.
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:39.300]   I was just going to say, I would think this is fixed today and this is just a really old
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:40.300]   lawsuit.
[01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:41.700]   Right. That's what I'm all abstaining.
[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:49.220]   I think it was an issue and it was fixed. And then one damages, which is, you know...
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:53.380]   Apparently you can, you can thank Scalia for the Supreme Court not getting involved in
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:24:00.980]   this. Normally the Supreme Court did not like to take class action suits, but Scalia
[01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:01.980]   loved him.
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:08.940]   I don't know. And so he didn't love him in the sense he loved class action suits, but
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:11.740]   he would take them in order to overturn them.
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:17.500]   He didn't like them, but he loved to take them, if that makes any sense.
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:19.620]   I just put something on the window that I think will interest you.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:20.620]   Yes.
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:29.900]   So Zuckerberg just hired college humor co-founder Ricky Van Veeing to become the head of global
[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:35.420]   creator strategy for Facebook. And in our constant discussion of whether the platforms
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:38.340]   have their own content, this looks like an interesting turn.
[01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:40.980]   Yeah. I mean, that's hiring a content guy, right?
[01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:41.980]   Yeah.
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:42.980]   Yeah.
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:43.980]   You got to have a Facebook original series.
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:48.220]   Well, it's a question. We focused on getting more interesting stuff into Facebook's live
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:52.180]   video as well as 360 video format.
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:56.700]   Note, of course, they're paying some celebrities and media companies, including Vox, which
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:58.980]   writes about the story to make video.
[01:24:58.980 --> 01:24:59.980]   That's interesting.
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:00.980]   That's your time for others.
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:04.420]   I'll be working with all types of creators and organizations to figure out how best to
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:08.020]   use the biggest network in the world to better connect people with engaging and meaningful
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:15.900]   content. He wrote in a Facebook post, reporting to VP of content, Nick Gruden. Nick is a good
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:22.780]   guy who also works with a lot of works of news at a very high level in the company.
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:28.140]   So I thought this really interesting move. My friend, Fred Graver, who's now a Twitter
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:33.220]   ex, big TV guy of his own sort, just tweeted about it.
[01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:37.220]   And from the chat room, this is cool.
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:40.220]   Bonapétit has a website, IBM chef Watson.com.
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:42.660]   Oh, there you go.
[01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:48.620]   Where you can get help from Watson. So pick an ingredient. And here, let me start. Let
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:52.700]   me go back to the beginning because this is kind of cool. So it's empty. You can look
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:26:00.500]   for ingredients. So let's say what goes well with aged rum and pumpkin strawberry and clove
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:07.100]   would be good. So here's aged rum stuffing, pudding. Here's an age rum sandwich featuring
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:13.180]   ground chuck, honey, aged rum, French bread carrot, pumpkin, green, olive oil, strawberry
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:14.180]   and clove.
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:16.180]   Yeah, I like that there's no picture for that one.
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:22.740]   Yeah, I mean, yum. Nobody ever made that one. Here's aged rum, fish dish, aged rum.
[01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:29.180]   So this is a, how about it? Chini di pepe and aged rum. I don't know, but it makes a great
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:41.340]   linguini. Wow. Okay. Okay. Pick a degree of guys. You can actually see I'm mixing and
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:46.740]   matching here. Now I've got a drum lasagna featuring a chini ingredient. I would have
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:53.620]   thought I okay, you can't add an almond macaroon to aged rum, a chini di pepe and Aleppo pepper.
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:56.620]   Can you? Nope.
[01:26:56.620 --> 01:27:07.420]   No, no recipe with this makes sense at all. Let's take out a few of these and orange juice,
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:14.140]   chicken pineapple and red wine, celeriac, apple and coffee bean. And you're going to
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:18.220]   go that's weird. Yeah. But I can see how that would help. Okay.
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:24.740]   How about a red wine spritzer? Oh, this sounds horrible. Red wine, soda water, celeriac,
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:30.900]   lime juice, apple and coffee beans. Only a computer could create that. Although apparently
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:37.500]   somebody has what's that horrible black goo that Brits like Marmite? Marmite? Should
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:43.740]   I see what we can do with Marmite? I can do with Marmite, but nothing goes with Marmite.
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:51.580]   I may are Marmalade. They don't have Marmite. They Marmalade. What's the Australia? I saw
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:58.860]   you. Vegemite. That's a brand name though. Oh, you're so smart. This is why you get the
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:06.900]   big bucks at ours. Technica. No, those are brand names. That's why. Wow. This is I think
[01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:12.540]   Brussels sprouts are an edible myself. Oh, yeah. People love Brussels sprouts. I'm trying
[01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:19.180]   to think of sunshokes. Those are pretty important. I like sunshokes. How about if you take a
[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:23.580]   little Brussels sprouts onion powder, grape and cranberry and you can make Brussels sprouts
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:34.020]   spaghetti. Lisa doesn't like Brussels sprouts and I have been trying. Oh, they are. They
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:38.220]   are they are cabbages that were at three mile Island. Yeah. No, they're delicious. I
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:48.300]   love them. They're definitely a go in my house. Like go throw those out right now. What did
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:54.740]   you say that you can't cook with anything with Stacy? Sunshokes. Sunshokes. What are
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:29:00.740]   sunshokes? Are they like artichokes? Jerusalem artichoke. Oh, that's what it is. Yeah, Jerusalem
[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:06.140]   artichokes. Watery kind of thing. So a little, a little Fresno pepper, a little sunshoke,
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:12.740]   some chive and onion. You've got sun joke. That's real. Sun joke to stada. Oh, that's
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:19.140]   weird. Sun joke. Pazole. Oh, add a little chicken egg yolk, egg, onion, Fresno pepper,
[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:25.060]   goat cheese, chive salt, milk and butter milk. And you got a sun joke. Casserill. How do
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:28.940]   they get the picture? Somebody must have made it. Yeah.
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:36.860]   Bon Appetit. I mean, IBM probably paid Bon Appetit a lot of money to run some of these
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:42.620]   secret test kitchen. But it's brilliant. It's brilliant. I love this. This is a great page.
[01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:50.340]   IBM chef Watson.com. I am. Thank you chat room for coming up with this. They call it
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:59.780]   cognitive cooking. Let's get cooking. Wow. You can also choose a dish or pick a style.
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:04.340]   It's an anniversary. Let's have the computer cook. Tomato strawberry coriander and sweet
[01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:12.740]   paprika. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Happy anniversary to made a brand. Oh, right. Happy anniversary
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:21.100]   to made a pasta salad. How about honey? I made you an anniversary to me tomato sandwich
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:25.340]   with egg champagne vinegar green peas to made a strawberry pita kosher salt soy sauce,
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:33.380]   that's us. Colored greens, coriander, sweet paprika and a grand clove of labor. Okay, maybe
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:40.820]   not. Mm. Mm. So what's his name? Who's the Washington Post columnist who said that if
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:44.420]   Trump became the nominee, he would eat his column. Yeah. Do you see all that? And he
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:50.300]   had and so he had bigger chefs come in and cook it up. They cooked his column. Oh, that's
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:55.300]   not going to be here. It's going to play. Yeah. This is why I like working on the web.
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:31:02.180]   Yeah. Well, you know what? So the Russian River every year has a slug festival trying
[01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:06.380]   to turn a band. That's right up the roof. They ran up the road from us. What about slugs?
[01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:13.260]   Slugs are on the list. Sorry. You could try snails. That's an actual food. I had to be
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:17.660]   a judge. I had to be a judge at this like at this like festival. There was there was a
[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:19.380]   slug of Roni, the Russian River treat.
[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:34.980]   I don't know. So the trick was snails. If you want to turn snails into escargot is and
[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:41.920]   we used to do this. You got to get a big barrel of cornmeal and you put the snail in the corn
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:50.520]   meal and it eats its way out and it gets rid of all the slime. Wait, does the snails eat
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:57.200]   their way out? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hey, we got to talk about nest, don't we? Oh, yeah. Thank
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:06.680]   you, Ron. Thank you, Ron. So Tony Fidell leaving the nest and I loved the story after
[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:15.080]   this is, let me see if I can find this story. After this is Roni Manio. I love his stuff.
[01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:23.800]   After nest was acquired, I also love your illustration, Ron. After nest was acquired
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:30.520]   by Google, they had they were offered unlimited funds and basically told, and it doesn't matter
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:36.440]   if you have anything, you know, make anything an unlimited budget. No results quadrupled
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:43.440]   its employees. It sounds like a mess. Was his all Tony Fidell's fault? Yeah, I think
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:48.920]   so. I mean, he he's from the Apple School of Thinking, like he used to work at Apple.
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:53.480]   So he wanted to make himself the center of everything at the company. So it's it's kind
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:57.960]   of hard to blame anybody other than him. And I feel like it definitely went down like
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:02.760]   a firing because they announced they announced he was leaving on like a Friday afternoon,
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:08.880]   which he said I've been thinking about this since last year. Sure. Yeah, sure. The Verge
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:17.040]   reported that he actually told them in December, he told. So I'm not saying that that's what
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:23.720]   happened by the way. I'm thinking of having a heart attack in December. I'm thinking just
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:28.720]   write this all down of firing myself in December. And then when it happens, see, you can just
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:35.560]   say, you know, I told you in May, June. So the Verge story actually talked about in
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:42.280]   it ties to what Ron's story did, which was he came on a this vision visionary guy and
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:47.920]   he thought he was going to have like YouTube runway. Yeah. And in now with alphabet, the
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:53.160]   alphabet rejiggering last year, he suddenly was like going to be held accountable for sales
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:58.880]   and product deliveries and less vision. So no wonder, I mean, I can see how someone like
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:05.280]   Tony Fadel with the best stuff. Well, I feel like I feel like Nest was the kind of inspiration
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:11.560]   for alphabet where they he ran his own company just inside Google and they they kind of came
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:16.680]   up with the alphabet thing. Yes, but remember this is the first alphabet company part of
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:20.880]   it. So there were it was kind of a double edged sword or maybe a carrot and a stick
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:25.600]   because partly they wanted to give CEOs more control over their company and be able to
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:30.800]   say to somebody, Oh, no, no, you're not just a employee at Google, you're the CEO of Nest.
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:36.440]   But at the same time, because of accounting reporting, their results would be public.
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:40.280]   So there was some accountability as well. So yeah, you're going to get more autonomy,
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:44.440]   but also we're going to pay more attention to how you're doing. And you did feel like
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:49.280]   the heat was being turned up on Nest like that, that that Larry and the others are kind
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:52.760]   of starting to look over there and say, and I don't like what's going on over there.
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:35:00.840]   I mean, go ahead. No, you got it. They they had what I was just going to say, they they
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:05.680]   had like a four times increase in their employees and they are they already had the smoke detector
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:09.920]   and the thermostat before they joined Google and and under Google, all they did is buy
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:15.040]   Dropcam and like rebrand it. And when you're alphabet, you've got to say like, Hey, you
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:22.120]   need to deliver more than yeah, than just these tiny little minor updates. And and they couldn't
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:26.920]   and there's all sorts of stories about the the stuff that they were working on that just
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:31.120]   was never good enough to see release or that they never wanted to release. And they just
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:35.520]   sucked up a ton of resources and sat there and spun their wheels and and yeah, it seems
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:42.680]   like he got fired. So you want to devil's advocate perspective? Sure. I think they did
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:47.440]   a lot of things. And if you look at it as a long term vision works with Nest took a lot
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:53.000]   of resources and they were trying they did not succeed utterly with that. But that was
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:59.080]   a really good program for pushing interoperability in the smart home on the Nest platform. So
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:06.040]   I would say that I mean, they went from nothing to more than 80 partners. So in that was all
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:10.480]   individual efforts. And then the other thing is they they created the thread protocol.
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:16.120]   Again, these are not things that you can sell. So if you think of Nest as a hardware company,
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:20.800]   you're like, Oh, guys, you're sucking wind. If you think of them as pushing forth a vision
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:26.960]   for the connected home, they were actually doing that. It's just you can't monetize that,
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:30.600]   which is big problem. It feels like it's something that's true. Stacey, the other question I think
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:33.840]   that the story is pointed out is what have they done for you lately? Right. I feel like
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:38.920]   at some point, Google soured on Nest. Like they were high on Nest. They were excited. They
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:44.720]   gave them half a billion dollars to buy Dropcam. And then at some drop cam founder left with
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:50.680]   a big fit. Yeah. And at some point, Google soured. Google made them buy Dropcam. They
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:55.960]   started they had started that acquisition before they bought Nest. Okay. I mean, I'm
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:37:01.000]   sure well, they gave them Dropcam. Yes, they can see they're writing on the wall or in rich
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:07.240]   Osterlo who came to Google from Motorola then left and went to Lenovo but came back to Google
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:13.400]   to Google, by the way, not to alphabet or nest to Google and was put in charge of hardware
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:22.520]   that maybe the original plan was nest is going to be our hardware home division and then maybe not.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:28.840]   Like there was there was a flip at some point. Yeah. I love this paragraph from Ron's article.
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:34.520]   He says in 2015, Nest posted job listings for its nest audio team. The team would be responsible
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:41.080]   for quote developing an audio roadmap for nest products and quote industry observers suspected
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:45.960]   the audio team was building a smart Bluetooth speaker, but Google beat Nest to the punch of
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:51.400]   the Google home. According to the report from the information, when Nest found out about Google
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:57.000]   home, it asked to work on the project with Google. Nest's request was turned down.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:04.200]   Corporate politics. Yeah. Somebody soured on them. I'm sure that Tony Fadal's personality
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:09.640]   didn't help. Oh, yeah. Because he's kind of. Well, I think, yeah, and I think it's clear Google was
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:16.840]   staying away from smart home stuff. And now they're not right, which I think definitely means nest.
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:21.320]   They felt like nest was some kind of failure and they just needed to go off and do their own thing.
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:26.600]   Nest has something called a project. Flintstone that they had been working on
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:31.240]   for three years. It had been killed or changed so many times you report that one former employee
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:39.240]   called it tombstone. What Flintstone was a was a home security system. And
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:44.920]   you say Flintstone seems like another case of nest being too slow for Google.
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:49.560]   Google's on hub router performed some of the functions that nests Flintstone was at one time
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:55.240]   meant to perform. In other words, Google once again looked over the wall over the transom said,
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:59.640]   you know, let's do it ourselves. These guys are never going to finish. Yeah, that's the thing
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:06.680]   about the works with nest program is it's like, why is my thermostat the hub of my household?
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:12.200]   Like, it's the last place. It doesn't seem like it's a cohesive vision that they tried to build.
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:16.360]   They're just like, well, this is what we have. So let's build it into the thermostat when really
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:21.640]   it should be in some kind of a box that's that's kind of separate from everything. And that's what
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:27.240]   Flintstone sounded like it was going to be. But it just hasn't happened yet. That's actually a big
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:32.280]   contentious point in the smart home is where that stuff should live. And a lot of there's a huge
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:36.200]   number of people who are like, screw the hub, you know, this stuff shouldn't live there.
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:40.680]   Samsung's putting it in televisions because they're like, it's a device that people already have.
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:45.640]   You don't want to buy another thing. That's why they threw it into nest. And the idea with
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:54.760]   their weave protocol, the nest weave, not the Google weave, which does a lot of the same things,
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:40:01.720]   but is different because they're not friends, was that it wouldn't eventually live in just the nest.
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:06.360]   It would or the thermostat it would live in everything. It's a mesh. It's a mesh protocol.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:14.840]   Yeah. So I mean, there's again, I think what happened is the smart home looked really
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:20.360]   awesome for a little while and people were like, yes, yes, go, go. And then they're like, oh, whoa,
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:28.920]   this is confusing. Nothing's interoperable. Do we lose her? No,
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:33.640]   we lose her. She stopped for some time. You weren't interoperable there for a moment.
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:39.080]   So this is the first day when it's really hot. And when it gets really hot, the beginning of
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:45.160]   every season summer, I have to call time order because my cable, like the frequencies get messed
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:51.320]   up. That's too hot, man. Wow. It's really weird. I know they have to come out to the box and fix it
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:58.200]   there. How how telling was it when Brad Fitzpatrick, who created LiveJournal is now at Google,
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:05.320]   created a video in February saying, do not buy a smoke alarm. They false alarm and are
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:13.720]   unhushable pieces of crap. But I mean, this is not a good ad from somebody who ostensibly works
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:18.520]   under the same corporate umbrella. Now, admittedly, Brad Fitzpatrick probably gets to do whatever he
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:25.960]   wants at Google. But I think that's a sign that Google had said. Yeah. Yeah. The hate internally
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:30.440]   from Googlers was pretty, pretty crazy. You can see some of the pictures down there that they made
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:37.400]   and yeah, the YouTube video. That was probably a big part of it. The, the employees kind of like
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:42.840]   rised up and started to complain about the company. They put these on internal message boards at
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:49.560]   Google. Yeah. Nest, Alphabet, Goodwill. It's a wedge. In terms of what you build a hub into,
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:53.000]   though, I don't really want to build into anything at this point because smart homes are so
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.440]   kind of new and flaky that I just want to be able to take the hub and throw it in the trash when
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:01.800]   something better comes out. Like, I don't want to build into my television because I'm going to
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:07.320]   keep the TV for years and years where the smart home stuff knows. Most people don't want to
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:13.400]   deal with that. I mean, like, I'm that way too. I've got four hubs because why not? But most people
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:19.240]   are like, I don't want to hub. They don't want to. I think, I think most people are content with
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:24.520]   standalone devices that have their own apps. You know, my, my sprinkler has its own app.
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:30.040]   My lights, they have their lights have their own app. My doorbell has its own app. My hue lights
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:36.120]   have their own app. And that's easier, I think, for most normal people than getting a hub working
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:41.480]   with a single app. Yes, it totally is. Although if you want to tell me what you've got, I can
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:46.840]   totally recommend hubs and things. I have the latest smart things and I just never never set
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:53.800]   up. No, really? What do you like? Smart things. It's open and awesome, but it's like not as reliable.
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:59.080]   Well, that's my point exactly, which is you spend all this energy getting everything working
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:05.640]   and it's a house of cards. Yeah, it really is. And so I agree with you, Ron. I mean,
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:11.000]   I'm gonna, I'm gonna wait and and maybe this will all shake out. Maybe it won't, but at least I can
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.200]   still sell it, sell it with my doorbell rings and I can turn off my sprinkler. And I'm just gonna
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:23.480]   leave it at that. I don't mind. That's why I have 200 apps on here. So, so I think the question is
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:31.400]   next is what does Nest do next? Now that they have a new CEO, the CEO, I'm not gonna get his name
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:37.080]   off the top of my head. It's like, Fa. Marwan Fa's Fazen Fa.
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:44.280]   Fa. Fa. Fa. Fa's he bear? What? He used to work at Google. He was in charge of when they had
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:50.920]   Motorola. He was in charge of the Motorola home division. Marwan Fa was. A lot. Yeah. And all he
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:56.200]   really did with the home division was ship it out the door. He sold it for like some billion
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:03.720]   dollars to to Aris like six months after he he took it over. So in the article, he's like a
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:09.240]   spin he's a spinoff guy, right? He's a cell. He's an M and A guy. Yeah, in the article, I had
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:13.080]   kind of speculated that he was like the Grim Reaper at Google where he just kind of shows up and
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:18.520]   pounds up ourselves. But but during the show, an article came out at the Verge, I think it was,
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:25.000]   where they found Nest released like an internal, an internal memo that said, we're not gonna sell
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.160]   the company. We're we're totally gonna get all those products that we were working on. We're
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:33.560]   totally gonna make those and like release those as real products. And they're very much at like
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:39.960]   stay the course right now. Yes, that which is insane to me. Like I can't imagine Nest being
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:44.840]   any good. If I were Fa. Fa was, I would tell the employees that until we got the sale.
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:52.840]   So go ahead. Oh, no, I was gonna say I saw your story and I started thinking about
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:59.560]   Nest and what it has to offer. And because it has such rigorous terms of service and privacy kind
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:05.400]   of standards, if it were sold as a standalone company, what you're selling is the millions of
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:09.000]   Nest customers with a device that don't pay a subscription. So you're getting the data.
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:15.400]   You're gonna have to support this device for like 10 years. So you're buying an obligation
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:20.840]   basically to support this in the cloud. And it's unclear if you can change the TOS or not.
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:25.560]   I mean, you could always try it, but the FTC is kind of like keeping an eye on stuff like that.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:30.760]   And I guarantee they would look at this. So then what is the business value of Nest?
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:38.920]   And while I'm looking at Nest, like what is left for Alphabet to use and like when you set up a
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:45.800]   company where you are the Steve Jobs in this company, where every minor decision runs through you,
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:51.960]   and then you leave, like what is left of that company for Alphabet to salvage. And we've already
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:57.560]   heard about employee exituses there and people like crying in the bathrooms and how it's a bad
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:04.040]   place to work. I can't imagine many of the good people still hung around. So I don't know what
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:09.640]   Google thinks they're going to salvage from Nest. Wow. Well, they could just like,
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:17.480]   I think there is a huge opportunity to sell these devices. I think it's probably going to be more
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:23.640]   interesting to sell them through different channels. So not direct to consumers because most people
[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:28.120]   have purchased a Nest if they're going to purchase it, I feel like, and the smart home is totally
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:35.880]   stagnated. So I would look for him to do deals with Comcast, with AT&T, with anybody who's doing
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:43.320]   those kind of sales to customers, like the mainstream America. And then also, Nest did some deals for
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:49.720]   with ADT. It was like a promotional deal. You got ADT Pulse, you got a Nest along with it. ADT Pulse
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:55.640]   is their security plus home automation product and the deals with insurance companies. And this guy
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:00.440]   he's got the experience to do that kind of thing and ship
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:08.120]   that ADT board, right? He was. And he actually was on the technical advisory board when they
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:15.080]   started doing their smart home efforts. So he's not, I mean, he's aware of this space. So I'm
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:21.720]   I tried to talk to him. They were like, Nope, not going to talk to you Stacy. So we'll see. I'm
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:28.040]   hopeful because I think it's a different it's a strategy shift. And I'm not sure if in the long
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:32.600]   term alphabet is going to want this, but I don't think they're going to be ready to let it go
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:41.160]   just yet. Because it's still a space that is going to do something. It will be useful. It's just
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:46.040]   we're not sure how yet. I think the most valuable part of Nest is the devices that they have made
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:51.400]   and the install base that they do have. But that's all in the past. I think it's the day of Nest.
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:57.480]   The future of Nest is the least valuable part. Like I don't think there's a serious company there
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:02.840]   in place that can do great things in the future anymore. I think all that kind of got dismantled
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:11.320]   or quit or left. What do they pay for it? 3.2 billion. Yeah. Plus another half a billion or so.
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:17.880]   Not as bad as Motorola. And at the time Nest was selling about 40,000 thermostats a month.
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:26.040]   Yeah. What are they selling now? Is it gone? They will not tell you. Yeah. No, they said 50%
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:31.400]   year over year every year. So if you know what year they were selling that amount, you can do some
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:36.520]   math. Right. When when was that? They bought them in January 2014. Are they announced? Did they
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:43.240]   announce the deal then or did they? Let me find the 40,000 number because. Well, anyway, if they're
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:49.000]   growing 50% every year, that's good. That's what they told you, Ron, after your article got published.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:55.400]   Yeah. Yeah. My my PR letter. But but. I'll have you know, 50% a year.
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:49:00.200]   Either he's growing 100% a year. Your house is growing 50% a year.
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.000]   Axel Rose.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:14.760]   In the last two weeks, Axel Rose has filed 11 DMCA takedown requests to Google saying,
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:19.880]   I don't want those pictures of me from this 2010 Winnipeg concert where I'm really fat and it's
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:25.960]   become a meme. I want them taken down. That's that's going to work. Yeah. Yeah, that always works.
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:35.080]   Yeah. That's going to that's going to work. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. This is a website, the best fat
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:42.680]   Axel Rose memes on the internet. I think actually he should probably contact Tra Tumbler. Get those
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:50.920]   get this taken down. Yeah. Was it a DMCA takedown? It was a DMCA. I own those pictures of the fat
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:56.120]   Axel Rose needs to move to Europe and do a right to be forgotten. Yeah, right to be. But I mean,
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:01.160]   is his claim that he owns the pictures because he's in them? Like that's not how it works. Yeah, I know.
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:07.000]   I know. Yeah. Were they taken by his concert photographer or something? And
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:12.920]   someone got I mean, because Beyonce tried that. Did that work? Did that work for Beyonce? Well,
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:19.400]   actually, I think she she may have like, I think she banned photographers that weren't
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:23.960]   certified or something from her. Yeah. That's what she ended up doing, right? That's dumb.
[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:31.240]   Ah, you know, Beyonce is she can do no wrong. In fact, I didn't say that everyone. I did not
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:36.280]   say anything bad. Are you are you in the what do they call it? The beehive? The beehive?
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:43.000]   Beehive? I think it's beehive. I am not. You're not beehive? They're going to be mad at me.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:50.520]   I'm in the beehive. Oh, I'm not Beyonce. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When we went to the Super Bowl,
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:56.280]   we saw Beyonce when you sat in your seats. This was in New Orleans about three or four years ago
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:51:00.440]   in the Niners were there. They had a little package. You know, you always get a little something
[01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:07.880]   to hold up or show and they were finger LED finger rings and they the instructions said
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:14.440]   when Beyonce when Beyonce sings, put a ring on it, you all have to go with your finger ring.
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:20.280]   Right. I think Tyler Swift does that at her concert. She has everybody gets synchronized
[01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:27.080]   lights. Yeah. Yeah. It's cool. I guess. Hey, it would have been more cool if we'd won the game.
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:37.000]   Yeah. Anything else? I'm just looking here. I don't see anything really worse.
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:42.920]   Anyway, we've had a good show. Let's let's end on a high note. The fat axle rose meme.
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:50.600]   I'm going to say Beyonce. Beyonce is the high note. We're going to come back after this break
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:55.080]   and get your number, Jeff. If you've still got one, we didn't use it on there. Oh, yeah, I got one
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:59.720]   there and any tips or recommendations? Our guests are on a Mario from ours, Technica.
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:07.240]   And our regular, I'm pleased to say co-host Stacy Higginbotham from Stacy and IOT have for us.
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:14.520]   But first a word from texture. I know I still love magazines. I know journalism is in trouble,
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:19.320]   but there's still great long form journalism being done in some of the best magazines in the
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:22.760]   world. Every week, there's something in the New Yorker I want to read every month. There's
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:29.080]   something in Rolling Stone or Vanity Fair, wired that I want to read. But if I were to
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:33.720]   subscribe to all those magazines, my coffee table would break under the load. And I certainly
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:38.360]   not going to buy individual editions in the newsstand that I'd be hundreds of dollars a month.
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:43.160]   That's why texture is so cool. It's like Netflix, but for magazines that have been
[01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:48.920]   watching, you can binge read. And this is what you need for your summer, man. Take all the magazines
[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:56.360]   that you love on your iPad or your phone or your Android tablet. Read them. It's every page is in
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:53:03.640]   the newsstand edition plus back issues plus bonus features you can't get on a print like videos,
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:08.600]   National Geographic's in their interview magazine, Men's Health. And stuff maybe you wouldn't
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:12.200]   subscribe to like I don't know. I like every once in a while like to flip through Vogue or
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:18.120]   Sports Illustrated or Esquire. There's something in there. I want to read. It's all there.
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:25.000]   The world's most popular magazines. And if you don't know what to read, their editors have top
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:30.440]   stories and new and where these sections plus curated sections with specific topics so you can
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:35.080]   dive deep into interviews and stories in an area that you're interested in. And sometimes,
[01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:42.840]   you want to know, so what's happening with Beyonce? How's that Jay Z thing working out?
[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:47.960]   You can read your people magazine or your entertainment weekly or, you know, that's all in there. I love
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:55.080]   it. Texture.com/twig. You try it free. Really get a sense of it. Texture.com/twig. You'll gain
[01:53:55.080 --> 01:54:00.440]   immediate entry to all the top magazines, including back issues, bonus video content. And it's free
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:11.960]   right now for a limited time at texture to ext like text, ure.com/twig. They've reimagined
[01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:16.040]   the magazine experience. And I think they're keeping magazines alive. I love it. I really love
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:20.200]   it. I'm glad they are too. Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:26.040]   Before I start, I want to just one mention one thing that I mentioned earlier briefly, but I went to
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:34.280]   I use a three. I'm making a three three. Three is good. Love three. I went to a Alshesprager
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:41.080]   session summit on distributed content with 25 publishers, then newsgeist with 150 people in
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:46.600]   business, then 100 people at a Google Play event. And I wrote a piece on a medium about this just
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:52.360]   before the show I dashed about. Really? I mean, man, you're good because this is a nice piece. I
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:59.480]   would never think you just dash plain helped. Dear plan. Yes. Do I slept on getting Google and
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:07.960]   publishers to share love and data? So just the quick thing here is that I found that publishers
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:13.960]   have been saying we want data. Google give us data. And Google says, well, you don't know what you want,
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:17.960]   and you won't know what to do with it. So I went to these conferences saying we've got to get more
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:22.520]   specific about what our desires and goals are. And by God, it kind of worked. People
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:29.480]   had ideas about how, for example, Google could help improve the recommendations we make to our
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:34.840]   readers, maybe eliminating something called to Bullen. I don't know. Also, if Google knew that
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:38.440]   you were a subscriber to the New York Times when you search on a topic, shouldn't New York Times
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:44.520]   topic, content come up because you subscribe and pay for it. Maybe to protect privacy, we need to
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:49.960]   have a framework to categorize users and content in ways that Google could share with us Facebook,
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:54.760]   publishers could share with each other. So the only point is that I have a constant quest for
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:59.960]   peace in the kingdom and trying to bring publishers and platforms together to do things rather than
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:05.720]   just fighting and presuming evil of the other or stupidity of the other as the case may be.
[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:10.600]   And it was a heartwarming, productive week, I think. We'll see. I'm an optimist, but
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:18.440]   I think it was a week of jet lag well spent. So I just wanted to kind of plug Google and
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:24.280]   Springer and all the publishers and editors who came all in good faith and a lot of good
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:28.440]   discussion and good efforts. And so that's it.
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:32.760]   I saw that picture of you and Richard Gingris. Yeah, it was funny. Yeah, it's what he wanted
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:37.720]   because we're sort of double ganggers. Yeah. Well, you both get the beard and the black and
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:43.480]   I think so he's still in charge of Google News and promoting AMP and
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:48.040]   Yep, exactly. Listening to publishers. Was he doing was he the listener in chief?
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:52.680]   Yeah, for for news guys, he's kind of the MC. Yeah. News guys is an
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:56.280]   unconference. So you went up with like 60 different sessions on a lot of fascinating topics.
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:01.560]   That's great. I love that stuff. Stacy, what do you what do you like in these days?
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:05.880]   Okay, I have to first correct myself from last week when I said that Kevin
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:12.920]   worked for Kevin Tofel. Kevin Tofel worked for the Chromecast team. That was wrong. I was I was
[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:19.080]   I was all excited. I was right. I was I was blinded by the chrome. He works for the chrome at work
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:24.520]   and the Android at work teams. So keep that in mind, y'all. And here is my recommendation.
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:29.240]   This is only it's not only for parents, but with summer coming up, this is a game.
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:35.080]   Oh, I want a game. Good. It's a forbidden island.
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:39.400]   Forbidden island in okay y'all. This is like the most complicated game you
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:42.680]   want to buy it right now, but it's awesome. It's a
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:48.280]   I love work. It's it's a collaborative play game. So you play all together as a team and
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:53.240]   your goal is to catch all of those four little pieces before your island sinks.
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:59.240]   And there's limitations on how you can play. I like it that is a cooperative game. That's cool.
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:04.840]   My daughter hates playing things that are super competitive. Right. So she loves this game and it's
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:10.440]   like I said, it's complex for I mean, it's complex to learn. It's not actually that complicated.
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:12.520]   Your daughter's a little young for this age. 10 and up.
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:16.600]   She's going to be 10 in August. I guess this close enough.
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:24.200]   I'm a 2010 mens of favorite brainy games winner. So it's it's fun. You'll it's a strategy game.
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:28.840]   So I totally recommend it for if you're bored this summer and you want to hang out with your
[01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:36.040]   kids. Have you ever played the resistance? Let's see. Oh, no, I haven't. This is
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:44.120]   this is not for your kid. This is for 13. I think teenagers love this because it's really
[01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:50.600]   some people are spies. Some people are resistance is kind of werewolf with us with a kind of a
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:56.440]   hunger games feel to it. It's really good. It's really fun. And there's a lot of strategy.
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:59:03.000]   Oh, I like it. It's challenging. Yeah. It's a kind of a I like you know what board games
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:07.960]   summertime and board games. They go to get 100 degrees here. So I'm going outside.
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:10.520]   Oh, geez Louise. Wow.
[01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:15.480]   Ronamadia, what are you doing these days? What are you excited about?
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:22.520]   Well, my I was going to recommend a YouTube channel to everybody. It's called Captain Christian.
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:29.480]   And it's a don't worry about the name. It's it's like a video essay kind of thing on on like geek
[01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:34.520]   culture. So a lot of it has to do with superheroes lately for some reason. But there's there's one
[01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:40.200]   about like the X-Men where there the movies are like ashamed of the X-Men costumes and
[01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:46.280]   and how important color kind of is to the design of the X-Men and how in the movies everybody just
[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:53.560]   wears black leather and it's and it's super lame. But it's a the videos are all like incredibly
[01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:58.680]   well done and and well edited and narrated and everything. And the channel only has like 80,000
[01:59:58.680 --> 02:00:03.880]   subscriptions. It's pretty new. Right. I mean, it's only like two months old. Right. Yeah, it started.
[02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:08.680]   It started about two months ago. But the the content is excellent. And definitely something I
[02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:14.760]   would recommend people subscribe to if they're into kind of fun little dissertations on on whatever
[02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:23.160]   the geeky topic of the month is Captain Christian with Kays. Yes. And so this is nerd culture, baby.
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:30.520]   Nerd culture. Very nice. But yeah, in terms of tech stuff next week, we've got or know what
[02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:38.120]   tomorrow we've got the Lenovo tech world. And you said the Moto Z. Is that going to be like a
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:44.520]   Moto X like plus two or the new Motorola flagship? Yeah. Is the that's at least what the rumor
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:49.000]   mill says. Regardless of what the names are and out to be who cares. It's just going to be this
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:55.400]   really weird thing that has like modules again, like the G5. Like there's a set of like pogo pins
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:01:00.600]   on the back where you can clip stuff into it. Is the G5 even out yet? Oh, yeah. Oh, that's out.
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:13.160]   People have it. See any phone you ask is within arms read. And then what else there's something
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:19.160]   else going on that I was going to. I don't remember. But well, there's going to be Project Tango at
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:24.040]   TechWorld. And and that's all I can think of. I guess if I think about it, they couldn't really
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:30.440]   follow the Moto X with the Moto Y. It's like Moto X is every year. We'll see this year Lenovo
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:37.560]   is really taking over Motorola and ruining them. So it's going to be some fun.
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:46.360]   It'll be fun. Gonna be a good time. All right, kids. What fun this was always a pleasure.
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:52.600]   And we got some good stuff going here. Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York and Buzz
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:59.400]   Machine.com his blog and don't forget his books. He's sparing news. What would Google do? Public
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:07.720]   parts. Gutenberg the geek. Yes, those are all real titles. I'm not making those up. And
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:13.160]   dot NYC. Have you got a solid day for that yet? Are you still trying it out? No, we're still
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:16.360]   we went. I think we took your good advice and Lisa's good advice. What we're trying to do is kind
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:21.960]   of get our act together and figure out what it is first and then do it every day. Yeah, a lot
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:27.080]   of every day, every week. No, so, so yeah, so we're also you're traveling a lot soon, right?
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:33.640]   That's actually I think I'm through the worst of it. Oh, good. I think. Okay. So we'll see you next
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:40.520]   week. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Next week. No, next week. I got you sent the whole calendar.
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:45.400]   Yes. But you got the calendar. We'll be complicated. Yeah, I won't bore the audience with that now.
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:50.360]   It's a complicated relationship. Thank you, Jeff. Thanks to Stacey Higginbotham. Don't forget her

[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:21.640]   It's much better than requires no man. It's climate appropriate. All right. Well, that would be a
