[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.000]   >> This is not right.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.520]   Gina's first, she's on the left, I'm on the right,
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.600]   the world is completely messed up now.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.000]   >> It's time you got the pride in place.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.320]   Better billing for JJ.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.200]   Does anybody ever call you JJ?
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.440]   >> Yeah, it doesn't work.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.840]   >> When you were little?
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   My friends, my mothers in school would call me Jarvis.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.920]   >> Jarvis?
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.320]   >> That's very English public school of them.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.520]   >> And Jarvis, get in here and shine my shoes.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.080]   Jeff Jarvis is blogs at BudgeMachine.com.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.800]   He's also the author of What Would Google Do and is a professor of
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.240]   journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.880]   >> You better not.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.880]   >> And he's in his library today, I like that.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.280]   You have a very nice, there was an article in the Yale alumni monthly about
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.720]   somebody who stole a Yale Law School dining hall chair and wrote and
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.000]   has it still and it looks like that chair over your right shoulder looks exact.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.920]   >> That's my father-in-laws, my late father-in-laws, Dennis off his chairs.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.440]   >> Oh, they're cool.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.920]   >> They're very classic.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.400]   >> Yeah, they are.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.080]   >> Man, I wish Dennis off his still-head chairs like that.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.520]   >> Yep.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.600]   >> Take some of the sting out of the root canal.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.000]   >> And here's the lady who takes the sting out of every day.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.160]   She brings sunshine everywhere she goes.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.400]   Gina Tarpani of smarterware.org.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.280]   You're in an office today, what are you up to?
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.400]   >> Yeah, no, I'm in my regular, my regular office.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.240]   >> Okay.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.400]   >> I just, I don't take care of my internet connection.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.640]   I'll email you about that.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.480]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.880]   >> But yeah, just I'm in my, yeah, yeah, we'll talk about that.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.640]   But no, I'm just in my regular home office today.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.000]   >> Awesome, I'm standing up.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.320]   >> I am standing up.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.640]   >> Oh, your desk is not what I envisioned looking at it on Smarterware.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.640]   >> Really?
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.200]   >> Yeah, I would have thought it would have been a little more oke-y and neat.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.960]   >> What is it?
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.240]   >> Is it Ikea?
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.320]   >> It's fine, it is.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.200]   >> I don't know, but I just, I don't know.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.320]   I wasn't want to picture it.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.920]   I'm just, it's nice, it's nice.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.080]   I'm not knocking it, it's nice, but it just wasn't want to picture it.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.440]   >> People looked at it and said, is this where you do twig from?
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.440]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440]   >> What the hell's the story?
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.440]   >> It's just a table.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.280]   >> It's just a table.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.720]   >> Did you see the King's speech yet?
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.440]   >> I did.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.680]   >> And he built him a desk in Buckingham Palace.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.240]   Here's the picture of her desk.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.720]   No, yeah, this is a computer, it's a classic computer desk.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.160]   >> I mean, it's an Ikea desk that's like modular and I know there's a lot of wires in that picture.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.800]   I didn't stage that very well.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.520]   >> Who cares?
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.160]   It's the shoes I'm worried about.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.920]   It looks like you jumped out of your shoes.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.760]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.320]   >> Well, I put the shoes for scale because I was trying to show that it was high up, you know?
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.760]   >> I get it.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.600]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.320]   >> Because I raised it to standing.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.760]   >> Jingle starts here.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.760]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.440]   >> Here's the shoes.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.280]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.440]   >> Gina's mysteriously been erased.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.440]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.120]   >> But you know, there is a program, Leo, that programmer, Cleveland, I think, worked
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.000]   on one to erase the people from Google Street View.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   >> The neutron bomb program.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.520]   >> Right.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.200]   >> But it occasionally messes up and it leaves shoes and dogs with leashes.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.200]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   >> That's exactly what happened to Gina's desk.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.760]   >> Yeah, it got neutron bombs.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.960]   >> She got neutron bomb.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.760]   >> So why work standing up?
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.320]   >> You know, because I'm using this program called Rescue Time, which kind of monitors
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.600]   what you do on your computer, how many hours you spend in different things, which is interesting
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   in and of itself.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.440]   But it also gives you, like, emails you then end of the week and says you spent this many
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.440]   hours at your computer.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.440]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.440]   >> So, week before I was-
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.440]   >> Jeff just shuttered.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.440]   >> Jeff just shuttered.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.440]   >> I know.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.440]   >> He said, why don't you- >> I don't make this much time on Twitter, you-
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.440]   >> Yeah, I don't want to know.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.440]   >> There's that.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.440]   >> I don't want to know.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.440]   >> There is that.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.840]   But week before last, I get the weekly summary report and I find out that I was on my computer
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.840]   for 48 hours.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.840]   >> Right.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.080]   >> Which is an unusual.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.080]   So that's 48 hours that I'm sitting on my ever-expanding-
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.200]   >> She thinks that it impacts your buttocks.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.560]   >> I don't know if it impacts- >> Because I think I'm sitting on a ball might help, but
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.560]   I don't know.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.600]   Maybe it's making- I never- Do you think Eileen, am I getting wider?
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.800]   Eileen just gives me such a-
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   >> Secretary spread.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.800]   >> So that's interesting.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   >> It's more about my posture and it's just more about wanting to be like more.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.800]   More active.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.120]   I tend to kind of look forward when I sit in my desk.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.120]   >> Oh, I agree.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.120]   >> I just felt like I want to burn more calories.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.120]   >> And you know, really what I want is that treadmill computer.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.120]   >> Right.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.120]   >> I was just going to say that.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.040]   I was just going to say that Leo, you have to now send us all treadmills for the work
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.040]   that are helpful.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.040]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.040]   >> This is the mid-step.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.880]   So you shouldn't go from like sitting to walking.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.880]   >> Right.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.880]   >> You should go to standing for a while.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.640]   So this is kind of the mid-level between the sitting and the treadmill desk.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.160]   >> You know, for you, I like stand-up desks.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.560]   I think Thomas Jefferson, a lot of people used stand-up desks for years.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.560]   I would hear, but this, maybe I could, maybe in the new studio, I'll make this stand-up.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.040]   Because I don't, I don't, I, in television, I always work stand-up.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.560]   The reason I sit on a ball is because it approximates that kind of live standing as opposed
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.240]   to sitting slumped in a chair.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.240]   >> Well, right.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.240]   I mean, you, the pot, the ball works really well for you because you get the posture benefits
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.120]   and you're also, your core is always engaged, right?
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.120]   Because you're balancing.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.120]   >> Something's engaged.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.120]   >> It's really good.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.120]   It's a good idea.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.280]   I have to tell you, the first week, which was last week, I was in pain.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.280]   My feet really hurt.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.280]   In fact, during the show, my feet hurt.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.760]   >> You need good shows, shoes, yeah.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.760]   >> Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.440]   That's why I have my running shoes on.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.400]   I bought one of those kind of squishy mats.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   >> That's a good idea.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.880]   >> But this week, it's much easier.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.920]   So I've already lost like a pound and a half.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.680]   I mean, literally terms down working.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.680]   >> What?
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.680]   >> That's really great.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.200]   >> I mean, I'm also sort of working on losing weight in other ways, like in the regular ways.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.120]   But I feel like there's just a more efficient way.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.120]   >> So walker-mole-y on my toe.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.120]   >> No more chip-pole-y.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.920]   Hey, but no, look, this is what the other thing that I do with having the ball is great.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.360]   You get some weights and you have a line around and every once in a while, you can do,
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.520]   you know, there you go.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.200]   >> People at home listening are going, what the hell?
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.080]   It's this week in sweat.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.280]   >> I will crush my back.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.440]   What I like to do is play the Glee soundtrack and just dance while I work.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.440]   >> Oh, there you go.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.240]   >> Oh, please do it for us, Gita.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.240]   Please do it now.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.240]   >> I've already danced for you guys.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.240]   >> That's physical.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.240]   >> Nobody tends to kind of shift in the dance.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.240]   >> Exactly.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.240]   Exactly.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.240]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.240]   [LAUGH]
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.240]   >> This is more energy.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.640]   You know, thinking on your feet, getting moving around, getting the hip action going.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.320]   >> I think that's actually really true.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.960]   It's so easy to sit in a chair in slum.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.000]   But when you know you're spending 48 hours a week slumped in a chair, I don't care if
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.960]   you're feeling all self-conscious.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.960]   I just got to keep moving.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.960]   >> I just bounced Jeff.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.960]   >> Jeff.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.960]   >> Jeff.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.960]   >> Jarvis the slug.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.960]   >> The Internet is funny.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.320]   It's been a long time since I've written an article that got a lot of attention.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.600]   I haven't been at Life Hacker for a while.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.320]   I wrote this article about a standing desk and it just got so much attention.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.320]   I just had- >> No.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.840]   >> Internet is just such a funny place.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.920]   People are like, well, you're going to get varicose veins and there are all the effects
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.560]   associated with standing too much.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.880]   Because people get so kind of like riled up about these things.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.240]   I didn't check with my doctor.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.560]   This is just sort of like I would like to stand a little more.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.280]   I'd like to mostly stand versus- >> Right.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.960]   I think that's really good.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.240]   It does hurt your feet after a while.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.000]   I always stood in television and that would be several hours a day.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.640]   This treadmill desk is very intriguing.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.640]   Somebody's making one, right?
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.640]   There are desks that they built to fit on top of treadmills.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.640]   They're expensive though.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.640]   They're really expensive.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.760]   A lot of people will mod or buy some treadmill off a Craigslist or a cheap one.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.200]   >> Yeah, this is not that bad for a desk, 479.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.800]   But the idea is that you could then put it- >> Over.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.800]   >> I don't know.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.800]   That's not going to work for me.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.040]   >> I can't imagine me doing this show like this.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.600]   >> Well, you put the treadmill at a very, very low speed.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.600]   >> Right.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.400]   Well, obviously- >> What is your real-
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.400]   >> I can't.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.800]   >> We are actually enabled- >> We enabled the chat room to control
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   the treadmill.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.440]   >> No bad idea.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.720]   >> If we start talking about glee, they speed it off the punishment.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.160]   >> That idea.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.560]   I did want to, and I still may do this, attach an inflation pump to my ball that would be
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.280]   actuated by donations.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.920]   So if people gave money, the ball would inflate.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.520]   If they took away money, the ball would deflate.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.920]   And I could just, you know, I'd be going up and down all the time.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.960]   >> How often do you have to inflate, Leo?
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.440]   >> Oh, I inflate.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.920]   No, no.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.920]   There's some seepage.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.360]   >> Something's not wrong about that.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:41.560]   >> Occasionally, every, I'd say every month or so, I'll break out the pump and inflate
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.560]   it.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.560]   >> Okay, that's not bad.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.560]   >> Not bad.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.560]   >> There's very little leakage.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.960]   These things are pretty damn robust.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.960]   >> I might be a little combo.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.960]   >> You said you have a pop one.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.920]   >> I pop, okay, well, there was a time.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:00.280]   Colleen, who used to be our studio engineer, found exercise balls from a company called
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.160]   Vallejo, they were cheaper.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.800]   But they were not.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.760]   They were not, they were not as good.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.640]   They were cheap Chinese knockoffs.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.640]   And I blew out two of them before I realized, you know what, there really is a difference.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.240]   So you want to get one with thick walls.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.600]   So I sit on a brand that's called the Antibirst.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.960]   It's the Gopher Sport Antibirst Ultra Fit Stability Ball.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.080]   Hey, don't get me started, Jeff.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.080]   >> Anything that I make you want to stand, it's blowing out two balls.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.600]   >> Nothing worse.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.360]   >> It's this weekend ball.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.720]   There's video on YouTube.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.880]   And what happens is basically it's like when somebody pulls out a chair, you go from zero
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.880]   to 60.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.720]   I mean, it's like there's nothing there and then you're on the ground.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.280]   I mean, it's just instant.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.600]   It's not like a sudden, you don't, there's no intermediate.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.560]   You're supported and you're not supported.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.080]   >> And this happened during a show?
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.080]   >> Oh, I have.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.080]   >> There's video on YouTube.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.080]   I'm surprised you haven't seen it.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.080]   It's actually pretty funny.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.240]   Because what happened is I could hear a hissing.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.280]   This is another lesson.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:04.600]   I could hear a hissing and I thought, oh, you know me, I'm a little bit of a clown.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.400]   So I thought, oh, this will be funny.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.880]   I'll sit on the ball and slowly descend.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.440]   Okay, these balls do not slowly deflate.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.240]   So I sat on the ball, I sit there for a while and then it goes, boom.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.760]   And I'm on the ground.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.400]   And I didn't hurt myself, but it was a humorous moment.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.280]   I'll show it after the show.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.280]   >> Oh, yes.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.080]   There are many YouTube links in the chat room.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.080]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.440]   The chat room knows all about it and they celebrate it.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.360]   So let us talk about Google after all that is why we are gathered here today.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.800]   It's so funny because I should let people know this.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.560]   Really for us, it's just a social hour of this show.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.240]   We're just getting to get, so we have to kind of force ourselves to talk about serious
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.360]   subjects because frankly, you know, we're just chatting away here.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.240]   But there is news.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:58.040]   You shared a really great link and I hope nobody gets fired at Google for this from the XDA
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.680]   developers forum.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.160]   This is XDA developers.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.320]   It's like where you go to find out how to root your phone is.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.680]   Oh, there, sorry, that's my farm.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.680]   Never mind.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.160]   There we go.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.480]   Is this where you go to root your phone, Gina?
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.880]   Is that what this kind of is?
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:16.320]   >> Yeah, this is a place where there's advice and information and discussions about rooting
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.160]   and firmware mods for sure.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.840]   So somebody joined it with a phony name and there's only one post and the post is they
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.920]   claim to be a Google employee.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:32.840]   The post says the Samsung secret why Galaxy S phones in the US are still running 2.1,
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.160]   which is by the way a huge source of dismay for Galaxy S owners.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.720]   I like the Galaxy S hardware.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:44.200]   He says, I'm going to step across the NDAs and explain the issues.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.920]   Does this person claim to work for Google?
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.840]   I know at the end.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.000]   Some might wonder why I didn't deliver this over a more legitimate news channel, a short
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   answer.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.520]   I don't want to lose my job.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.640]   However, I appreciate transparency, which is why I'm here.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.240]   This person could, I suppose, be working for Samsung, not Google.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.520]   >> I think Eric would be happy to run the tech WikiLeaks.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.520]   Ericton should.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.480]   >> If he would stop feuding with Josh Topolsky, maybe he could.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.040]   So Gina explained the story here.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.600]   What's going on?
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:21.360]   >> So the story is that the reason why the Samsung S owners don't have the latest version
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.640]   of Android, actually not the latest version 2.2, which is Froyo.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.080]   >> Yeah, the latest is 2.3.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.080]   >> Right.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.080]   The latest is 2.3, right.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.920]   But these people just want 2.2.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.280]   Froyo is not a technological one.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.280]   It's a political one.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.880]   So now correct me if I'm wrong about how this works, Leo, but just to summarize, the
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:45.360]   issue is that this person is saying is that Samsung wants to charge users for the update,
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.720]   for these new features.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.400]   So it doesn't want to push the over the air update could go out.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:54.640]   It's not a technical technological problem, but that Samsung wants to charge for the update
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.160]   because it's a feature update.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160]   That's kind of the simplified version.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.200]   He explains, he or she explains here that money change hands, when there are different
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.960]   types of Android updates, there's critical updates, there's maintenance updates, and
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.960]   there are feature updates.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.080]   >> Right, and the update to 2.2 is considered a feature update.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.160]   >> Critical updates are free because that means there's a problem, and so they're going to
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.160]   do that.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.080]   Maintenance updates are basically free, but you have to pay a lot, he says, for feature
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.080]   updates.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.280]   >> Yeah, that's what he's claiming.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.160]   Now, you know- >> Now if you go back, by the way, this
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:29.720]   comes from the days when you had a Motorola Star-TAC phone and Motorola, you know, Motorola
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.880]   would send you a critical update or a maintenance update.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.440]   No big deal, they're going to push that out.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.160]   The carrier is going to push that out and Motorola is not going to charge you.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.280]   They need to do that.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.920]   But if Motorola says, "Hey, we can add this shiny new feature to a Star-TAC," but you
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.040]   got to pay us for that.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.360]   That made sense in that era.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.360]   >> Right.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.000]   >> But the Android era doesn't make sense because there's so many updates.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.480]   >> Right, it doesn't.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.280]   So he says, "Now, here's where the politics come in.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.320]   Most US carriers aren't very happy with Samsung's decision to charge for Android updates as
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.680]   feature updates, especially since they're essentially charging for the Android open-source
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.920]   projects efforts, and the effort on Samsung's end is rather minimal.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.720]   As a result of perhaps corporate collusion, all US carriers have decided to refuse to
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:15.160]   pay for Android 2 to update in hopes that the devaluation of the Galaxy S line will cause
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.120]   Samsung to drop their fees and give the update to the carriers.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.400]   The situation has panned out differently in other parts of the world, but this is the
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.280]   situation in the United States.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.760]   Now- >> There's a copy-
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.640]   >> There is a- >> There is an update, which I'm looking at the
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:34.840]   Gizmodo post about this, and Gizmodo posted Samsung's official response.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.400]   Samsung does not charge carriers for updates to new versions of Android.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.640]   We are working to make the Android 2.2 Froyo upgrade available to all US Galaxy S owners
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.040]   as soon as possible.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.760]   Due to the complexity and unique functionality of each Galaxy S device, we are performing
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.200]   additional testing.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.320]   Samsung's feels it is important to make Android 2.2 Froyo upgrade available only after we
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:57.080]   feel we can give the millions of Galaxy owners a simple and reliable upgrade experience.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:02.400]   Except they've done it already in Europe on essentially the same hardware, right?
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   >> Right.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.400]   >> Right.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.360]   >> So it's kind of not credible.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.360]   >> Right.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.360]   Exactly.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.000]   >> I can't do it.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   >> It's a brand problem.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.080]   >> Because now I got my Galaxy tab and that makes me very nervous about living two years
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.600]   with this, so they better be very, very strong.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.520]   Even if they were thinking about it, they better be very strong to pull back.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.280]   >> Are they saying, Gina, that the Galaxy S devices in the US are somehow different than
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.280]   the Galaxy S devices in Europe?
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.560]   >> I mean, due to the complexity and unique functionality of each Galaxy S device, that's
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.400]   what they seem to be talking about.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.880]   It just doesn't make sense.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:44.080]   The whole thing is just crappy and it makes me even more determined to just sort of wait
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.440]   for the official, you know, whatever the official sort of Google device is, right?
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.360]   >> Well, as we should point out that this Google device that's current, the Nexus S,
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.520]   is a Samsung Galaxy S basically.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.520]   >> Well, right.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.560]   >> But Google says we'll keep it up to date.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.840]   Now who pays that fee?
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.880]   Because this is a T-Mobile phone manufactured by Samsung.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:11.520]   It's an official Google phone, but still does T-Mobile pay Samsung for the updates on this
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.520]   thing?
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.520]   I mean, I'm very confused.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.520]   >> That's a good question.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.520]   That's a good question.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.800]   >> And this Google guarantees will be updated.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.440]   Maybe Google is going to subsidize it and say, well, if there's any carrier fee, we'll
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.520]   pay it for T-Mobile.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.520]   It's unlocked.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.520]   >> Right.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.520]   >> I'm very confused.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.520]   >> Right.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.360]   It seems like Google would pay that fee, right?
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.360]   Because they want to get out.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.520]   They want to sell the new phone with a new operating system.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.160]   Speaking of, my Nexus S still does not have gingerbread.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.160]   >> What?
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.160]   >> What the hell?
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.360]   >> But that's a Google phone.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.360]   >> It's going on.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.360]   I know.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.120]   And it was the next few weeks, several weeks ago.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.120]   What's up, Google?
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.120]   What is up?
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.040]   >> So maybe my plan to stick with Google devices isn't a good one.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.400]   >> Well, you got to stick with the latest Google device, apparently.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.440]   This is, by the way, this hurts Android.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.440]   >> Right.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.840]   >> And it's up to Google to really, if you want to protect Android, you've got to solve
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.840]   this.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.040]   >> Well, there were stories this week about the lag in updates across the entire product
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.040]   line.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.480]   And it's really bad.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.320]   I have the latest version of the iPhone operating system, but I don't have the latest
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:20.440]   version of the Android and huge chunks of the customer base are left behind.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.440]   That's just no good.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.360]   >> Well, and I'm going to channel Google right now.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:33.040]   Oh, Google's response, I'm making this up, is that where you can always root the phone.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.040]   >> Well.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.960]   >> Because it's open, you can root it.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.880]   >> That would be the unofficial Google engineer response.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.880]   [laughter]
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.560]   >> I think it's kind of parallel to response given that's why we make it so easy to root,
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.520]   so that if you want to do something the carrier and/or manufacturer don't support, well,
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.520]   no problem.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.520]   Just do it.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.520]   >> Right.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.520]   >> Well, can I jump the up?
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.880]   >> You go to XDA developers, you get the ROM.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.880]   >> Okay.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.320]   >> And in fact, Gina, you could do that to the Nexus S or Nexus One rather right now.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.320]   >> The Nexus One.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.320]   >> I could.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.240]   >> And somebody who has a Galaxy phone, I presume can do that.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:16.120]   >> Yeah, but that still makes it into a geek device that's 0.1%, 0.001% of their audience
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.160]   is even capable of knowing what a root is.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.360]   >> Well, isn't that after all what people are saying about Android versus iPhone?
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.520]   >> But that's not a business model.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.520]   >> No.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.880]   >> The business model has to be that this thing is simple, you do it, it's taken care
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.120]   of, it's done.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.960]   And that's the beautiful thing about Google updates is they just do just happen.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.800]   You don't have to do the manual.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:36.800]   They do just happen.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.800]   They should happen.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:45.120]   You don't understand architecturally why it's so hard, why it takes so long to mod a new
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.680]   version for a phone.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.680]   I don't get it.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.680]   >> Well, the story with Gingerbread is they haven't open sourced it yet, right?
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.320]   2.3 is not yet.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.160]   You have to wait till the source drops.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.360]   Then the manufacturers will get the chance.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.080]   So the source has dropped for 2.2.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:05.080]   So allow them a month or whatever to hack their apps to work with 2.2 if they need to.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.320]   So 2.3 I can understand.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.920]   But 2.2 has been out for six months for a while.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.200]   >> Yeah, it's been out quite some time.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.960]   >> Now here's Google's information on the distribution of Android versions.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:25.360]   87.4% of Android phones are now at 2.x up from 55% in July.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:31.120]   And more than half of all phones out there are using Frojo 2.2, which has been out for
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.720]   seven months, according to this.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.880]   >> But that's low.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.040]   That's my point.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.560]   >> Yeah, and that probably 95%.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.560]   >> And this is global.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:44.240]   I'm sure if you had that number in the US only, it would be a much lower share.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.000]   Although the Droid, the Droid incredible, the Evo 4G and all and the desire are all updated,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   right?
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.800]   Frojo's share in one month, on August 2010, Frojo's share grew from 5.5% to 28% when
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:02.920]   the big Droid Droid incredible Evo 4G and desire phones got updated.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.240]   >> I don't know, I think this is a big problem for Google because I think I'm starting to
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.960]   hear customers complain.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.920]   I think they are more aware than one would guess of what version they are using.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.200]   And it doesn't sit well for people if a later version is out but not available on their
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.200]   hardware.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.200]   They don't like it.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.400]   >> Yeah, I mean, I guess in some--
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   >> Go ahead, Junior.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.080]   >> No, I was just going to say it's frustrating.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.600]   It's very frustrating.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.600]   I want gingerbread.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.000]   I really breaded my next spoon.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.440]   >> Yeah, of course you do.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.680]   So compare this to Apple, right?
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.720]   So Apple is going to come out with the iPhone 4, one presumes soon.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.480]   They'll be a new operating system.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:45.640]   Apple in the past has delayed the operating system rollout to earlier devices by sometime,
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.640]   right?
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.640]   Two, three months.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.120]   I guess it's not that different from Apple or is it?
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.560]   >> Well, it's different because you know it's going to happen.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.920]   >> Yes, yes.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.680]   >> So you buy an iPhone, you know, well, I'm going to have what I have.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.680]   >> So that's simple.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.120]   That's a matter of communications and transparency about how you operate, which by God, Google
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.120]   should do and the phone company should do.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.120]   I dream.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:10.600]   >> Jeff, I never knew you were such a dewy-eyed optimist.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.600]   A little Pollyanna.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.600]   >> I was on glee there for a moment.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   >> He's a geek.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.600]   >> I wasn't--
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.600]   >> Is it different?
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.600]   >> I was in my high school play.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.600]   >> Oh, yeah, what was it?
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.600]   >> Oh, wait a minute.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:30.240]   >> Don't say, don't say, I'm guessing you were Nathan Detroit and guys and dogs.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.240]   >> That's for him.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.240]   >> No, no, no, no.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.240]   >> No, no, no, no.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.240]   >> No, no.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.240]   >> No, no.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.240]   >> No, no, no.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.240]   >> No, no, no, no, no.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.240]   >> No, no, no.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.240]   >> No, no, no.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   >> No, no, no.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.240]   >> No, no, no, no, no.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.240]   >> Did you do the Woody?
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.340]   >> Jackie Gleeson played the part in the movie.
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.280]   >> Hamana, Hamana, Hamana.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.920]   >> Love Jackie Gleeson, really.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.920]   >> Go figure.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.880]   >> Sorry for that interlude there.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.860]   >> No, like I said, it's just us getting together.
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.860]   >> It's just chatting.
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:56.860]   >> It's just chatting.
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.260]   >> If I could put a fence up for us, it's a coffee-clatch.
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.940]   It's a cracker barrel.
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:02.940]   >> Cracker barrel.
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.260]   >> Ooh, I could use crack.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.260]   >> Power by Android.
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.260]   [ Laughter ]
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:13.060]   >> You know, is the iPhone update different because Apple delivers it through iTunes?
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.460]   It's been a really long time since I've had an iPhone, but when you upgrade your iPhone,
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.540]   you do it by syncing through iTunes on your computer, right?
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.700]   It doesn't happen over the air.
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.300]   >> Does not do OTA, yep.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.180]   >> So this is what Apple controls this process.
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.340]   >> Not only does Apple control it, they pay the bandwidth.
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.340]   >> Right.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:35.940]   >> And, you know, they clearly extorted that from AT&T as a condition of getting the iPhone.
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:36.940]   And they --
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.940]   >> It's control.
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.140]   >> And they were in the position to do it.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:44.260]   And this was always my complaint a little bit about how Google handled Android was that
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:50.820]   they didn't -- well, I wish Apple had made an open GSM phone, but they wouldn't have
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.020]   been able to do this.
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:56.220]   Google made the open phone, and as a result, doesn't have the ability to extort that, right?
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.500]   Anybody can do an Android phone.
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.660]   Google doesn't have the say.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.660]   So what are they --
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:04.060]   >> Right, but Google -- but only the phones that get the Google logo have to meet certain
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.060]   requirements, right?
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:11.260]   So Google could use that to make -- to create situations that treat users better than this.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.940]   >> Can you tell me which phones have the Google logo?
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:14.940]   >> No.
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:15.940]   >> No.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.340]   >> That's a pretty big deal.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:23.420]   I mean, the major manufacturers are doing that, right?
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.460]   I mean, they're getting -- they want -- in the ad, they want to say, "Powered by Google."
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.260]   That's, I think, a big thing.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.260]   >> Yes.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.260]   >> No?
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.260]   >> Yes.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.740]   >> That's why I guarantee you.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:39.940]   That's why Verizon spent so much money on the Droid campaign to create a brand that is
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:40.940]   not a Google brand.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.940]   It's a very strong brand, by the way.
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.940]   Even Regis.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:44.940]   >> I saw that.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.500]   >> And even Regis -- >> I saw that.
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.500]   >> -- I saw that.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.500]   >> -- I saw that.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.500]   >> You were -- >> I saw that.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.500]   >> -- spectacular.
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.500]   >> Thank you.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.500]   >> You were a spectacular one.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.700]   >> I showed Regis the Atrix, the Motorola phone, and he said, "Is it Droid?"
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.660]   >> "Is it Droid?"
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.660]   >> "Is it Droid?"
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.780]   And I was kind of -- to be honest, I was a little taken aback.
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.780]   It's like, "What?
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:02.980]   You know that?"
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.580]   But that shows you the effect.
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.460]   I mean, look, Regis, he's 80 years old.
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.180]   He's not tech literate.
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.460]   In fact, when I was -- you'll see next couple of weeks I'm going to show him how to tweet.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.660]   And when I said, "Okay, now you click the tweet button with the mouse," he literally lifted
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.980]   the mouse up and started to go to the screen.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:19.980]   So, yeah.
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.220]   So he's not -- I mean, look, not to knock Regis.
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.700]   He's an amazingly sharp --
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.700]   >> Very sad.
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.700]   >> -- with it.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:27.700]   Great.
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.900]   One of the great performers of all time.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:33.420]   So I'm not knocking him on, but I'm saying he's not a computer whiz.
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.420]   And even he knew he's at a droid Leo.
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.580]   >> They paid Lucas Films to build that brand.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.580]   >> They built a brand.
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.660]   And it doesn't say powered by Google.
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.340]   Droid, powered by Google.
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.340]   It's Droid.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.340]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.340]   >> But it was Droid with Google.
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.220]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.140]   I think the Google brand does have a lot of sway there.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:57.820]   And I wish that Google would take the attack that they take with video codecs with Android
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.700]   a little more and kind of insisted.
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.500]   >> Let's talk about H.264.
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:02.500]   Now it's been a week.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.780]   We've absorbed the dropping of H.264.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:06.780]   We talked a lot about it.
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.820]   If you didn't hear last week's twig, Kevin Marks was on.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.820]   He was great.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.380]   He explained it all.
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.780]   We've had time to think about it.
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.100]   Either of you feel a little bit better about Google dropping H.264.
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.300]   Because I'll say upfront, I kind of do.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.500]   I kind of -- I kind of -- maybe I'm a true believer.
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:27.460]   But I kind of think that they took a pretty big hit in the name of openness.
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.460]   You feel better, Gina?
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.740]   >> They definitely took a pretty big hit.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.820]   We were pretty hard on them.
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.020]   I do feel a little better about it.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.220]   Although I have to say I'm just looking at the Engadget article now.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.180]   Do they issue sort of public defense?
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.660]   >> Well, it wasn't a --
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.780]   >> It wasn't very public, or was it?
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.780]   >> It was public.
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.620]   But I don't think it was that compelling.
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.460]   They basically just reiterated, no, we did this for openness.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.460]   I don't think that they --
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.460]   >> Right.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.980]   I mean, the core of this argument is like we're not evil.
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.980]   Like we're doing this thing that could be interpreted as evil or not.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:00.980]   Just trust us.
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.500]   Our motives are not evil.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.860]   >> I don't think that's a good argument.
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.340]   Trust us.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.900]   We're not evil.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:08.900]   Trust us.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:09.900]   Really.
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.340]   >> We care about the future of the web.
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.900]   We want to make it open.
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:14.900]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:15.900]   >> I mean, yeah.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.100]   >> I mean, you know, it carried water for me because I believe fundamentally that that's
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.100]   true.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.780]   I know too far too many Google people, which is always a mistake.
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:24.780]   I admit it.
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.620]   In fact, one of the things I've always done in my career is distance myself from the
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.380]   companies I cover because once you start knowing them and liking them, it's very hard to believe
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.380]   ill of them.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.380]   >> Amen.
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:34.380]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:35.380]   >> So maybe I know them too well.
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.380]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.380]   I admit to that too.
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.380]   Possibility as well.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:42.660]   >> But all the engineers I know at Google really are highly committed to open.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:48.900]   And so I find it -- I mean, even if corporate says no for business reasons, I think that
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.980]   that's not going to -- they're not going to -- the troops at Google are not going to
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:52.980]   go along for the ride.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:59.020]   And I do believe you could say, look, we understand WebM may be slightly -- may be slightly
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.620]   encumbered, may not be desirable.
[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.420]   Yes, nobody's using WebM.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.260]   No browser supports it.
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.460]   But we want to put a -- you know, a flag in the sand.
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.660]   We want to say, opens better.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.020]   There's going to be some pain.
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.260]   We're going to suffer some pain.
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:21.020]   I understood their argument why we're -- but don't confuse flash because we said that
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.220]   this de facto helps flash.
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.060]   But they said, okay, yes, maybe.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.420]   But don't confuse flash with H.264.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.900]   These are different things.
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.300]   There's -- what we're talking about is the video -- and I did say this last week -- it's
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.620]   the video bracket -- bracket, video bracket thing.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:42.540]   What is HTML5 going to do when it sees bracket, video bracket?
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.180]   And you can all add plugins.
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.420]   You can all add plugins for every codec you want.
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.420]   That's fine.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:52.380]   But we want to put a stake in the sand to say, well, what it should do is use WebM.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.620]   It should use an unencumbered --
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:57.820]   Well, isn't that a different way to say it, Leo, is that that's a default rather than
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.820]   support.
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.380]   They said we're going to stop supporting H.264.
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.300]   We're not going -- we're going to make it a plugin.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.300]   You can ship the codec with it.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.300]   Yes.
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.300]   But default to WebM.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:13.340]   If you use Windows and Chrome, you don't -- it will support H.264 because Windows builds
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.340]   in the codec.
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.220]   Well, the Chromium project never supported H.264.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.220]   They're --
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.220]   Nor did Mozilla.
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.220]   No, nor did Mozilla.
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.220]   Right.
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.940]   But the Chromium and Chrome are different, right?
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.700]   So Chrome is the Google product that they're going to ship.
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.500]   So they used to support H.264.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.300]   Chromium didn't, but now they're not.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.420]   I think, honestly, this is just a bad PR move.
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.860]   I think that's what I'm saying is I think you could say it differently and say we're
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.780]   going to default to open now and it would have been everybody would have hugged them.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.820]   I think the problem is it's too technical of it.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.380]   I think that kind of was what they were saying, but it's just technical.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.300]   They said bracket, video, bracket.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.300]   But I don't think most people, you know, most even technical people say understand the
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:55.780]   difference between a plugin and native support.
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:02.660]   And the pro -- you know, there has never been in HTML a definition of what happens when
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.220]   you see video.
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:09.260]   In every case, up until now, when you see video, you have to have a plugin.
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.540]   The browser, HTML does not support video.
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.460]   HTML5 will support a video tag.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.820]   What happens when that tag happens?
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.480]   What does a browser do?
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.100]   Does it go out and launch a plugin?
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.100]   Well, it could.
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.380]   In fact, it will have to in Safari.
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:26.460]   It will have in fact -- and that's why Google says we're going to make web end plugins
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.460]   for Safari.
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.260]   We're going to make a web end plugin for I9.
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.460]   But that's interim.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:36.540]   The real question is if it's an HTML5 browser and it runs across a tag, it has no plugins,
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:40.700]   it has no flashes, nothing installed, what's it going to do when it sees video?
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:47.540]   And we believe that all browsers should default to a baseline of web end.
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.540]   That's fine.
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.220]   If you want to add more, that's fine.
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.500]   Is the precedent set by Apple, right, with Flash?
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.900]   It sounded like that.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:55.900]   You're right.
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.900]   You know what?
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:57.900]   That's exactly right.
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:58.900]   You hit the nail on the head.
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.860]   In the context of what Apple did, it sounded like they were doing the same thing.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:02.860]   Exactly.
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:03.860]   That's the PR problem they had.
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:08.420]   And so it was so easy to say, you can install whatever you want, folks, but we are now going
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.420]   to default to open.
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.260]   What do we find?
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.260]   Perfect.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.260]   You're right.
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.020]   We're going to not support Asia 64.
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.860]   That sounds like such a Steve Jobs thing.
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.860]   Love you, Steve.
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:18.860]   Hope you're better.
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:21.860]   But, you know, they should hire us to do their PR.
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:24.220]   Yeah, I wonder.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.260]   I don't think that they expected the backlash that they got.
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.940]   You know, like some project manager kind of posted this on the Chromium blog.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.140]   I don't think they maybe expected it to be gone.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.060]   I think that's the case.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:35.500]   I think that...
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.140]   And this is one of the reasons I kind of like Google.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.500]   They're not that polished, actually.
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.500]   Right.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.020]   You see it every...
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.020]   You see it all the time.
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:48.100]   They'll launch three products on the same day because they didn't coordinate.
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.780]   Do you think they would get Esquire's worst-dressed award?
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:51.780]   Yes.
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:52.780]   As a company, do you think?
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.780]   Yes.
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:54.780]   They'd wait quarter-wise.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:55.780]   They'd wear saddle shoes.
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.380]   I don't know what the modern equivalent of saddle shoes and quarter-wise is.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.380]   Saddle shoes.
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.380]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.380]   God, I saddle...
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.100]   I wore those in like first grade.
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.420]   I remember my saddle shoes.
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.420]   They wear...
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.580]   They wear think geek t-shirts and chinos.
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.580]   Yes.
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:10.500]   And sneakers.
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.500]   Yes.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:15.540]   But I like that about them.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.540]   I kind of...
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.100]   You know, okay, another...
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.100]   I'm going to do it again.
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.420]   Name drop.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:24.260]   When Regis was tweeting, because he's not a good typist, there were typos.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.700]   And I said, "That's good, Regis."
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.620]   Because when you have a typo, when it's not perfect, people know, "Oh, Regis must have
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:30.620]   done this."
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.620]   Because nobody...
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:36.260]   The paid tweet that he calls her tweet-arella, the woman who's paid to tweet for them is going
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.340]   to make sure it's perfect, right?
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:43.900]   If you have a good PR firm, if your PR strategy is great, you don't make stumbles like this.
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:44.900]   I love it.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.900]   It's authentic.
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:46.900]   It's real.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.660]   It means that Google is just some... a bunch of engineers.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.660]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.660]   You'll coordinate it.
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:51.660]   Yup.
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.900]   You're coordinating the saddle shoes.
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.300]   I just broke the link to dress like Zuckerberg.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.300]   Well, it's actually...
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.300]   I just see that.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.300]   No, tell me what...
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.540]   I put up the link on the... on right there.
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:03.540]   I'm clicking here.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.540]   I'm not really sure.
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:05.540]   I just saw it.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.540]   He is...
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:07.540]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.540]   Fashion for men.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:12.220]   Esquire says...
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:18.180]   Mark Zuckerberg, Russell Brand and Joaquin Phoenix are the worst dressed.
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:22.460]   Well, I don't care about Russell Brand, although I love Russell Brand.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.180]   And I think Joaquin's fantastic.
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:28.540]   And again, I liked him because of what he did on that Letterman thing, where he was willing
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.940]   to be a complete jerk.
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:36.340]   No, if he had asked his PR department, "Hey, should I go on Letterman as this character
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:41.260]   in this movie that's going to come out in a year and completely confuse everybody and
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.420]   make them think I'm a drug addict?"
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.420]   You think that's a good idea?
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.420]   The PR guy would have said, "No way.
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.500]   What are you nuts?"
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.420]   I like it that he was more concerned with his acting than he was with his career.
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:53.060]   Well, this is the thing, and I can't believe I'm going to defend Zuckerberg.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.220]   But I kind of like that Zuckerberg refuses to...
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.420]   I mean, he lets his ideas speak for himself.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.940]   And I say this as a nerd who hates getting dressed up.
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:06.900]   I kind of appreciate the fact that he's just like, "I'm going to let my work speak for
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:07.900]   myself.
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:11.580]   I'm going to dress the way that I feel comfortable, and this is the way I want to present myself."
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.260]   And you can bet that he's no compromise about it.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:17.300]   You can bet that the Vinkle Voss twins will never be caught dead and slip on Adidas'
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.300]   sandals.
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.180]   I'm not saying I like the sandals.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:26.780]   I'm just saying I like the general attitude, although it could be considered condescending.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:33.540]   I mean, I think he had a meeting with the president or no, he interviewed Bush and he
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:34.540]   didn't put on it.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.540]   No, yeah.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.540]   That's something I probably would have put on as a worker.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:37.540]   You wear a tie.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.540]   You wear a tie.
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:39.540]   You wear a tie.
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.540]   For the rest of it, yeah.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:45.900]   Celebrity-style Hall of Shame.
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.220]   You've already discussed the Facebook Muppets.
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.220]   Sorry.
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.020]   They called them a Muppet.
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.940]   Sartorial choices at some length.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:57.460]   Hell, we even suggested him as a stylish Halloween costume.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.780]   But just to reiterate, no matter how much money you have or how many people's secrets
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:04.860]   you hold in your digital palm, you cannot show up to a black tie event in a t-shirt
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.020]   and jeans and expect to be taken seriously.
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:14.620]   Maybe not by the guys in the black tie, but I could tell you as a nerd, I love it.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.180]   I think that's fantastic.
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.180]   There's Joaquin Phoenix.
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.220]   Nick, can I think Nick looks all right?
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.940]   The green tie I could get.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.100]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.940]   Ed Westwick's shoes don't even match.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:26.940]   Jared Lido.
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.940]   That's a good look.
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.060]   He's in good company.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.060]   Skip the ad.
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.060]   Thank you.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.060]   Char- okay.
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.060]   I think he's in good company.
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:37.260]   Charlie Sheen, David Spade and Nicholas Cage.
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.260]   John Mayer.
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.260]   Oh, plaid pants.
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.260]   That's one thing Mark never did.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.260]   Plaid pants.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.260]   Yeah, thankfully.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.060]   I'll think he did this.
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:49.220]   The old you go to Mark by Mark Zuckerberg dot com.
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.660]   It was a store put up.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:53.980]   Like it like his fashion brand.
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:54.980]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.820]   Oh, boys, boys, don't do that.
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.580]   All right, let's see.
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.580]   This is good.
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.180]   Instructing all the young male geeks.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.860]   No, no, you can be like Mark without dropping my chem.
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.860]   Carry the news.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.980]   Bathroom, plain white socks so far.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.260]   So good Adidas flip flops.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.260]   Elastic jeans.
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.260]   That's the bottom.
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.260]   The best thing is the bottom.
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.220]   Elastic jeans are for pregnant women, not for men.
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.220]   That's true.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.220]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.220]   A sweet tie.
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:22.140]   They mark by my, I want this.
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.420]   I would buy this t-shirt right now.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.340]   The mark by Mark Zuckerberg fashion for men.
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.180]   I would, if that really were real, I'd buy it.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.180]   I think you can.
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.180]   I'm buying it.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.620]   They should have, they should say Mark Zuckerberg production.
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.140]   A zuck.
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:41.100]   You can $23 canvas tote American apparel.
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.100]   Wow.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.900]   But it's not made, I love that fashion for men.
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.900]   Mark by Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.620]   I want the, I want the scent.
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:56.380]   Again, young male developers do not admire the man's ideas, not his clothing.
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.700]   You do not have to dress like Mark.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.100]   Okay, you go to a meeting.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.180]   You're a, you've got a million dollar venture fund.
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:07.140]   You want to invest in somebody who's going to make the next big thing.
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:12.060]   Do you, are you saying or looking at him, he's wearing a naddy, blazer, and gray slacks.
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:13.060]   Tassoed loafers.
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.060]   You give him money?
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.060]   Hell no.
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.860]   That's the Winklevoss twins.
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:18.860]   Yeah.
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.660]   You say, who'd you steal the idea from?
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.500]   You say, okay, who are you going to sue?
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.220]   Because that's the one I want to invest in.
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.540]   Who'd you, the Goldman sack?
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:34.180]   The Goldman sack, isn't that great?
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:41.260]   Oh, I admit, I don't wear the Adidas shower slippers ever.
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.260]   Is Mark where those?
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.260]   Yeah.
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.260]   With socks.
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.260]   Oh, with socks.
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.300]   With socks, which is the worst offense.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.260]   He's doing that to, purposefully.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:55.500]   Of course, that was his great line about, about the social network was that the one who
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.300]   they did get right was his wardrobe.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.100]   That's right.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:04.540]   And by the way, by the way, so now Sorkin decides the Zuckerberg is a good guy.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.540]   What happened?
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.380]   Yes, his, his accepted speech.
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.540]   Oh, and the Golden Globes, he thanks Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:14.620]   Yeah, and so did Rood and the producer.
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:18.460]   Thank them for letting us use his life to make a point about the social relationships
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:19.460]   today.
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.460]   Oh, BS.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.180]   There's so much butt kissing, so much butt kissing.
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.180]   Oh, Hollywood, I'm sure.
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.180]   Mark is a real person.
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.180]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.180]   He is.
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.180]   Yeah.
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.180]   Cinnical little worms.
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.180]   Hollywood.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.180]   They suck.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.380]   But you know, I have to say that we, I think we came to this conclusion that the social network
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.500]   was the best thing that ever happened to Mark so.
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:38.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.500]   It is.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.580]   The inception is criminal.
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:42.820]   Criminal.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.380]   You thought inception was a good movie?
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:45.380]   I did.
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.300]   I, oh, did you not like inception?
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.300]   I love inception.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.740]   I was surprised that it beat social network.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.740]   That social network that was, I was offended.
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.900]   Do you not like this inception, Leo?
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.540]   Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.220]   This may be the first time that Leo and I like.
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:00.060]   I know, because we have much the same taste.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.660]   Yeah, we do have similar taste.
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.660]   I'm not going to get complicated while, Leo.
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.620]   It's terrible movie.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.620]   Wow.
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:10.180]   The characterizations were so thin.
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:13.180]   They misused Ellen Page.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.900]   She could have been somebody in that movie.
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.340]   Instead, she was, she was a cardboard cut out.
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.500]   The plot was absolute.
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.900]   I mean, I fought, look, I followed it.
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.460]   I wasn't one of those people saying, what's happening?
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.780]   I don't understand where it's going.
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.780]   I figured you was.
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.900]   I completely, look, I understand recursion, Gina.
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:28.900]   And it was basically recursion.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.900]   I understand recursion.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.900]   It was recursion.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.580]   So I wasn't confused.
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:38.740]   In fact, the minute I saw the little, when he washed up on the shore, and I saw the,
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.020]   I mean, it was happening.
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.020]   It wasn't, it wasn't.
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.020]   You knew that it was going to end with the top.
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.580]   Yeah, it was like the whole thing was.
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.540]   Yeah, I got the whole movie right in the first two minutes.
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:54.340]   However, I thought not, okay, I know I'm completely upstream on this one, but, hey, what
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:40:00.140]   about that, what about that Mark Zuckerberg Tunisian protest sign?
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:01.140]   Isn't it great?
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.740]   I'm changing the subject very quickly.
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:03.740]   Thank you.
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:04.740]   Thank you.
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:05.740]   Thank you.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:06.740]   Thank you.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.580]   Would you please explain this?
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:09.860]   I don't understand.
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:10.860]   I don't.
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.820]   Jasmine Revolution.
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:13.820]   Thank you.
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:14.820]   Good.
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:22.060]   Mark Zuckerberg by Fazaza Fizza Tunisian people versus Ali bad versus Ali bad.
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.060]   I don't.
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:26.420]   So there, there, there, there's a huge argument going on right now.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:31.060]   You've getting more of is fighting against Andrew Sullivan and Clay Shurkey where you
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:37.660]   have the, uh, Shurkey and Sullivan are the triumph, the Twitter triumphalists accused
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:38.660]   their other.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:41.580]   They don't really as strong as you think, but, but they're saying they're giving credit
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:47.580]   to Twitter and to Facebook for its role in Tunisia, whereas more of in both Iran and
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:50.660]   now is saying, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're far over doing it.
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:55.980]   Well, I understood the argument in Iran, which was that all of the quote during the Iranian
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:41:00.420]   Green Revolution, all the quote protesters were in the US because why weren't they writing
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.420]   in Farsi?
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.580]   I mean, they weren't even, they were writing in English.
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:04.580]   That was, that was patent.
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:05.580]   That was obvious.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:06.580]   I don't, I don't know.
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.060]   I don't know anything about the Tunisian story, but.
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:12.420]   But the fact is there are people there in Tunisia who are thanking Mark Zuckerberg for
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.540]   having Facebook, which is pretty incredible.
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:19.500]   I think it's pretty clear that both I, I don't, I disagree with the argument that Twitter,
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.820]   uh, who was it wrote that in, uh, in the New Yorker?
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:27.820]   The Twitter supports the status quo as opposed to, uh, big hair, big hair guy.
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:28.820]   Uh, yeah.
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:29.820]   Malcolm Gladwell.
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.180]   Not, not, not, I'm glad.
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:35.340]   Well, that's the, that's, that's the international symbol for Malcolm Gladwell.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:37.740]   You're from the movie figures.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:38.740]   Yes.
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.180]   Gina, if I had seen him.
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.420]   I might have liked it.
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:46.180]   I was probably just, I, what sounds I think that Jeff agrees with you.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.180]   So it's like two on one.
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.180]   I don't know.
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.940]   I'm, I'm, uh, I liked it.
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:50.940]   I liked it.
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:51.940]   I don't think it was brilliant.
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.620]   But even God, social network versus inception.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:57.420]   I, I think social networks actually a better movie.
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:01.540]   Much more like 20, I lean you, you disagree too?
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.540]   She'll okay.
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:03.540]   So maybe I'm just not a geek.
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.540]   I'm just, it's probably this.
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:08.180]   No, no, I think that I'm just dumb because I, inception, like I really enjoyed it.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.180]   It blew your mind.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.180]   It did.
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.180]   I did.
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.740]   So clearly I'm just like, see the matrix blew my mind.
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.380]   I walked out of the matrix going.
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:15.380]   Wow.
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.380]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:17.380]   Yeah.
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.380]   I walked out of inception going.
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.460]   Who cares what happens to the top?
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:26.260]   Oh, see, I spent an hour discussing the top.
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.060]   Did it fall over at the end?
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.060]   Is it real?
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:30.060]   Is it not real?
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:31.060]   Is he in trouble?
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.060]   Is he in trouble?
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.060]   And then he said that.
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.060]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:38.660]   I was in Google Wave discussing it with a friend of mine.
[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:39.660]   It was my, my, my buddy.
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:44.620]   It was a big sci-fi fan in Google Wave having a threaded conversation about, you know, that
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.300]   inception and what all the symbolism meant.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.340]   And I was like, I think it was a metaphor for inception.
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.340]   And actually, yeah.
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.340]   Yeah.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.340]   Yeah.
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.780]   And somebody screwed up below.
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:55.780]   Yes.
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:56.780]   Some of these screws.
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.420]   Some of you messed up in the basement.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.420]   All right.
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:02.060]   We're going to take a break.
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.980]   This is a, this is a discussion that I'm sure I will hear about in Twitter and people
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:11.440]   say you lose your, your geek crit if you don't like inception, but I think it actually
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:14.540]   proves that you are a super geeker and more highly evolved geek.
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:15.540]   Yeah, I think so too.
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.180]   You had the top thing in the first three minutes.
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.980]   I immediately got the recursion.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.300]   I was like, Oh, come on.
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:25.260]   Well, but because I knew it was at time travel, I mean, I kind of knew a little bit of the,
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:27.500]   I guess I probably read some, a blurb somewhere.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.380]   And I, you know when I, here's what I went in.
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:33.220]   I said, cause I knew people were confused by the movie.
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.740]   I said, okay, so this is a confusing movie.
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.300]   Let me see if I can figure it out.
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.300]   And it was.
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.300]   So you were proactively.
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:40.780]   I was thinking about modeling it.
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:43.300]   You was, this is going to make sense.
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.300]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.300]   Okay.
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.460]   Look at already on Twitter.
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:50.100]   It's Leo, the port hates inception.
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:53.180]   Anyone want to troll the guy?
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:44:00.020]   Too lazy to do the trolling themselves.
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:01.020]   They're trying to get it.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:02.020]   That's right.
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:03.020]   Do it.
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.020]   I'll source the troll.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.020]   I'm some bored.
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:08.220]   I don't really want to troll him, but if anybody would like to, please go right.
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.220]   Be my guest.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.340]   Here's a good reason to troll Leo.
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:14.020]   Thank you're welcome.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.020]   Let me mention squarespace.com.
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.660]   We're going to come back, Gina Tarpani from smarter where.org is here in life hacker.com.
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.620]   And of course, Jeff Jarvis from buzz machine.com.
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:26.820]   We're talking about Twitter, Google, the cloud, Facebook.
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:32.740]   If it's on the net, this show we talk about it movies, anything, Chipotle, anything.
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:33.740]   Squarespace.
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:35.140]   I'd like to talk about squarespace.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:38.260]   Squarespace.com, they call themselves a secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:41.780]   I would agree for several reasons.
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:44.020]   First of all, squarespace is hosting plus software.
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:45.900]   So you need to understand that.
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.060]   They will host your website.
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:49.780]   Of course, you can have your own domain name and everything.
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.500]   But then they have this great software.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:56.540]   It's a content management system, but I don't know if that does it justice.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.820]   The best way to do this, go to squarespace.com/twig.
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.340]   And there's a big green card.
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:04.300]   Try it for, button rather, try it for free.
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:05.300]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.860]   Just make up a site name.
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:08.860]   Give it a password.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:09.860]   Give it an email address.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:10.860]   They don't collect those.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:15.420]   So that if you forget your password, they can email it back to you.
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:23.820]   And then a little bit of one of those things so that you don't have to be a robot.
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.940]   And once you do all that, you can set up a site.
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.220]   I mean, for two weeks, no cost, no charge, full site.
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.540]   You'll be starting with these incredible templates that Squarespace uses.
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.580]   There's 60 plus designer styles.
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.500]   Very easy to modify the templates.
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.900]   So you start with a template, but you are in complete control.
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:40.900]   And that's nice.
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:45.380]   Even if you don't know anything about web design, you can make it look like your own.
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:48.140]   I just read an article that said, "People, you should trust yourselves.
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:49.300]   You don't need to run out and get a designer.
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.020]   You should trust your eye.
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.860]   Let you know, do it yourself first."
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.180]   I thought that was kind of interesting.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.060]   And this certainly makes it possible.
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.700]   Using Ajax for drag and drop and so forth.
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.300]   It's got great stats.
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:06.060]   An iPhone and iPad app make it so easy not only to post, but to monitor your site, your
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:09.620]   stats, kill spam if it should appear.
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:13.260]   Auto galleries, forms, it's really powerful.
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.420]   Easy to use, very easy to try.
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:20.980]   And then if you decide you like it, just take that site you built and say, "Okay, let's
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.060]   make it active.
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:27.300]   Let's make it, I mean, it's active already, but let's keep it $12 a month."
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:31.380]   And you could take 10% off when you use a promo code, "Twit" on checkout.
[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:37.420]   Or if you subscribe for, that's for one year, if you subscribe for two years, $10.67 a month,
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:40.860]   minus 10%, so it's like $9 a month.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:45.620]   Squarespace.com/twigthesecret behind exceptional websites.
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:47.660]   We use it for our Twit blog.
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:50.260]   And I'll have to tell you, after wrestling with some of these other content management
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:52.180]   systems, I'm tempted to just use it for everything.
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.180]   It's really great.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.180]   Squarespace.com/twig.
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:47:01.940]   Try it yourself.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.660]   Google has grabbed a Connect researcher from Microsoft.
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.100]   I thought that was kind of interesting.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.140]   You think it was for the brains?
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:10.140]   Or do you think they actually want to do something with Connect?
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:14.740]   Well, they have a game portal coming up, but I think he's more of a researcher, brains
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:15.980]   kind of guy.
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.380]   Johnny Chung Lee, there he is in a Krispy Kreme hat.
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.700]   I didn't love that, don't you?
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:24.380]   That's actually at Google.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.780]   You can go to one of the cafeterias and get a Krispy Kreme hat.
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.860]   And then they have those Krispy Kreme donut burgers.
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:31.420]   Do you ever try one of those?
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.420]   Mm-hmm.
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:33.420]   That'll kill you.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:34.420]   Oh, yeah, that'll get you.
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:35.420]   That'll get you.
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.420]   That's totally.
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.420]   This is exciting.
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:38.420]   It's really bad.
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.420]   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, fight more words, mister.
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:41.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:42.420]   Oh, come on.
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.340]   Have you ever tried-- OK, you slice a Krispy Kreme in half.
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.360]   You fry it.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.580]   Oh, please.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:48.580]   Oof.
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:49.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.320]   I can't take the whole sweet beef thing.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.320]   Oh, no.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.320]   It's good.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.320]   It's sweet and savory together.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.320]   It's perfect.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   Oh.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:59.260]   That's why peanut butter and jelly is so good.
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:02.520]   Oh, there's something a lot less wrong.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.540]   Butter and jelly.
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:05.540]   Then a donut.
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:06.540]   Oh.
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:13.860]   Apparently, Johnny was a Wii hacker, developed head tracking on the Wii Moat, among other
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.500]   adaptations.
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:16.500]   So you're right.
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:17.700]   It's about brains.
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:22.340]   I want to see Connect like just a recognition and Android someday.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.340]   [GASP]
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.340]   And your TV.
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:25.340]   [GASP]
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.340]   And your TV.
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.140]   I think that solves the TV problem.
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.140]   Oh, Google TV.
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:30.140]   I want that there.
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:34.540]   Now, I've used Connect on the Xbox 360.
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:35.980]   I have to say it's a little frustrating.
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:40.380]   For instance, when you want to exit out, you have to hold your hand up.
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.980]   But because it doesn't want to have-- the problem is accidental gestures.
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:48.820]   So it has to do something so that it can distinguish between an intentional and accidental.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:52.060]   And the way it does it is you hold your hand up and then you pause.
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:53.460]   And then it knows, oh, I see the hand.
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:49:05.020]   And then a little clock goes zzzz, and it's only a second or two, and then it goes, OK,
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.020]   I get it.
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.460]   You really are holding your hand up, not just going like this.
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:09.460]   Right.
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:10.460]   But it loses you sometimes.
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:11.460]   Yeah, it's not.
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:12.460]   And it's like yet another progress bar.
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:13.460]   You don't want to look at another progress bar.
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:14.460]   Yeah.
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:15.460]   So there is that issue.
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:15.460]   Maybe Johnny can do it between intentional and unintentional gestures distinguishing between
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:16.460]   the two.
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:20.380]   I do-- I love on Dance Central when you go like this and you swipe.
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.420]   So you move your hand up and down to select an item.
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:24.420]   And then you swipe.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:25.420]   It's just very natural.
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:26.420]   It feels good.
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:27.420]   And very satisfying.
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:28.420]   Yeah.
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.420]   Maybe just because it worked, right?
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.860]   Oh, I'm satisfied.
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:33.860]   It actually worked.
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:38.540]   So what you want in life is the pad with no pad.
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:41.660]   You want all the same gestures to be able to work in life.
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:42.900]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.980]   Multitouch in life.
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:48.620]   So now people who walked on the street, not just talking to themselves on a headset,
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:52.660]   they'll talk to a computer and they'll start swiping suddenly in the air.
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:50:00.380]   At the region, I was going to demo the Nintendo 3DS and they had an augmented reality demonstration
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.380]   they wanted to do.
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.340]   And I said, look, I only have five minutes.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:08.420]   You want me to explain augmented reality in 30 seconds?
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:09.420]   This would take the whole segment.
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.900]   You know what?
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:15.620]   I was impressed with the whole thing, but just in the first second, you didn't let them
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:17.060]   waste a second gabby.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:21.180]   You knew you had to get the stuff in and you took charge and said, "Here's the first one."
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:22.180]   Right.
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.180]   You did.
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:24.180]   You kept it on track.
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.180]   You really didn't.
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.180]   Well, it's not just me.
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:30.020]   You don't see this, but off camera, Michael Gellman, the producer, has a whiteboard that
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.220]   says "next" on it.
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.420]   He holds it up and if you don't move on, he starts tapping it like this.
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:36.620]   I can imagine that.
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.620]   Basically, everybody.
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:39.620]   I lean.
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:40.620]   He doesn't do that.
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:41.620]   The twi cottage?
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:42.620]   No, she doesn't.
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:43.620]   I lean.
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:45.900]   You can control him.
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:46.900]   Try it.
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:48.540]   One of the reasons, no, she can't.
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:54.780]   One of the reasons I created Twit was in direct response to mainstream media's desire to,
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.100]   "Don't get into the details.
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.100]   Nobody wants to know that."
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.620]   It shows us pretty pictures.
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:01.140]   Yeah, you're exactly right.
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:06.820]   There was an article about an interview with Roger Ailes, the head of Fox News in which
[00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:11.060]   the, you probably read this, Jeff, in which the writer talked about the fact that Roger
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:18.140]   doesn't have the sound on when he looks at watch as Fox or any television because he says,
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:21.900]   "If you can't grab me with a sound off in eight seconds, then," or he actually said
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:25.100]   three seconds, "then you don't have any talent on TV."
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.420]   It's very visual, right?
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:31.260]   People were stunned by this and I said, "If you knew anything about TV, you know no television
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.980]   executive ever has the sound on.
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:37.060]   Everything's about hair and visuals.
[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.060]   It's all about..."
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:39.060]   Oh boy.
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:40.060]   Yeah, I know.
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:41.060]   This is why, unfortunately, mainstream media...
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.060]   Good thing I'm on Twit.
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:43.060]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:44.060]   We're about ideas.
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:46.220]   Well, you have very nice hair.
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:48.020]   Oh, thank you.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.500]   But we're about ideas.
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.280]   You know even the chat room sometimes is going,
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.980]   "Nect, fax, fax, fax, fax"
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:56.140]   I mean a lot in fact.
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:57.580]   But what were you to do-
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:58.420]   How do we love you chat room?
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:02.040]   Oh we do, and I understand it, but we really,
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.120]   I like the leisurely pace.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.760]   Yup, I do too.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.500]   I do.
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:06.540]   And I think it does,
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.780]   I think when I,
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.260]   they're saying it right now, by the way.
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.140]   Right now smart ass chat room.
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:14.900]   Next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next,
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.500]   Next, next, next, next, next, next, previous,
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:17.840]   Somebody said previous, I liked that.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.240]   - You're all so smart.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.440]   - Previous- - Next is ex.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.280]   - Next is ex.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.240]   (both laugh)
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.880]   - They're clever in that job room.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:29.380]   - What we do, we do for smart people, right?
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:31.200]   We assume that you care about this stuff,
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.120]   you're intelligent, you're willing to spend a little time
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:36.240]   with it, we are all ADD, we accept that.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.660]   But we also assume that there's some interest
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:42.560]   in intelligence, and that's exactly what mainstream media,
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:45.880]   well, Geoff, you reviewed TV for years.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.200]   I don't know- - Yep.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.840]   - It was, it was, Washington Golden Globes,
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:53.320]   I tweeted that I'm so glad I don't cover a showbiz anymore.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.200]   - It's brain dead, it's so- - I didn't see it,
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.080]   but I understand Ricky Gervais was like very dismissive.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.920]   - Well, there's much controversy about that,
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:04.520]   and the Brits are saying, welcome to British humor, folks.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:08.080]   He's not all kiss-assie and sucky and he's-
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.480]   - That's why we love him.
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:13.360]   - I agree, but the stars did not.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.840]   The funny thing about it is it's become,
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.440]   like everything else these days, political,
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:19.320]   this whole story today that says that right-wing bloggers
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:23.240]   and TV folks love that Gervais stuck it
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.480]   to liberal Hollywood.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.000]   - Ha ha, it's liberal Hollywood, eh?
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.360]   - But John Stewart also said that he loved it,
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.640]   so he was, I thought he was very funny,
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.240]   but he was mean, oh yeah, it was mean.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.320]   - Yeah, he was mean, I love them though.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.440]   I love his hilarious.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.720]   - He didn't discolé, did he?
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.200]   - Well, I'm sure that he did, no, he didn't,
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.680]   but I've just forgiven him that.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.560]   - I like that, I'm a New Yorker, I like that kind of humor.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:48.840]   I work for Denton, so.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:49.680]   - Yeah!
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.000]   - The British humor, I get it, I get it.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   - It's not just British.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:52.840]   - Hey!
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:54.800]   What are you talking about here?
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.200]   All right, google.com, let me see,
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.240]   are they doing the Google Doodle, yeah they are,
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.400]   'cause it says on.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:04.000]   It says on's birthday, this is a good Google Doodle.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.560]   - I love how going to google.com is like visiting the museum,
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.880]   like let's see what's on, you know,
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:08.720]   what's your company show, is it?
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:09.560]   - Yeah, 'cause nobody ever visits it.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.080]   - No one actually goes there, right.
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:14.000]   - Can you see the word Google in there?
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   - Yeah, yep, I see.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   - V-O-O-G-L, yeah I love it.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   - Yeah, very nice.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.840]   - In the style of Paul says on, and it says,
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.000]   "170 second birthday", they're doing a contest.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.840]   It's the Google Doodle for Student Competition,
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.960]   and you could win thousands of dollars,
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:42.160]   let's ask the Christian Science Monitor what's going on.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:46.160]   - We're the Google links to the Christian Science Monitor.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.640]   That is the first result.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.040]   Today Google allows this fourth annual
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:52.440]   Doodle for Google Competition.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.120]   They're asking art students across the country
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.000]   to draw, sketch, Photoshop, or finger paint,
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.600]   their own logo, $15,000 scholarship for the winning entries
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:03.040]   and a $25,000 technology grant for their school, wow.
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:05.640]   That's neat.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.120]   - One talented kid will have his or her picture post
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.360]   on the Google homepage.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:10.480]   - The judges, Google staff,
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:15.480]   and Whoopi Goldberg, Ice Cating Champ Evan, Lysachek,
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:18.440]   and Garfield creator Jim Davis.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:21.540]   Last year, a third grader won.
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:26.240]   Mackenzie Melton, here's her Google Doodle.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.760]   That's pretty cool for a third grader, that's very nice.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:29.600]   - Very nice.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.120]   - From El Dorado Springs, Missouri.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:32.600]   - The problem is, what you end up with these things,
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:35.360]   you end up with a million crushed little kids.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:39.280]   - I had one of them a few years ago.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:40.920]   - Really? - Oh.
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:41.760]   - Yeah, you know.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.680]   - Well, you gotta explain that there's probably,
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.520]   you know, a million entries.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:47.560]   - You're a kid.
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.200]   - You're a little kid.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.440]   - I know. - What you,
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.800]   I remember when I collected.
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:52.720]   - Google is crushing the dreams of Jim.
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.600]   - A bunch of cornflakes, box, stuff.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.360]   - You didn't get an A, you're nowhere.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:57.960]   - Sorry. (laughs)
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.640]   - I'm sharing my deepest childhood trauma.
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:00.640]   - Sorry, let's go ahead.
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:01.480]   - Sorry, Luke. - I'm sorry, Luke.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.480]   (laughs)
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:04.760]   Don't apologize, you're that's my fault.
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.400]   - It's all right, I'm not gonna talk about it.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.360]   - I collected a bunch of cornflakes, box tops,
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.760]   to get a Mr. Potato Head and it never came
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.320]   and I'll never get over it.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.160]   (laughs)
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.120]   That's why I hate Tour Story 3.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.560]   (laughs)
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:18.640]   - So-- - I'd say we're sending you
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.760]   Mr. Potato Heads.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:20.840]   - No, no, please, no. - You're running
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.520]   for the onslaught. - I don't want 'em.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.480]   - Sweet cottage, look up the edges, kids.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.280]   - All I could say is when Mr. Potato Head
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:28.800]   went from an actual potato to a plastic potato,
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:30.520]   they lost me.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:33.440]   I want my Mr. Potato Heads to rot on the shelf.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:36.720]   So social network, we didn't really say who won.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.440]   Social network won four Golden Globes.
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:42.200]   Golden Globes are, we don't even know who they are.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.400]   They're the foreign-- - It's a bunch.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.840]   - Hollywood Foreign Press.
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:46.200]   - Yeah, which means it's nothing.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.120]   The guy who got up had no accent anymore
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.480]   from the new association. - He's been living
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:50.400]   here too long.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:55.400]   - Yeah, it's a dozen people who are hangers on--
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.000]   - Oh, it's for you. - For when Lance.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.640]   Oh, it's some small number.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.440]   And but somebody came along and said,
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.920]   we need another award show.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.560]   There's this crazy Golden Globes thing
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:06.440]   and it's been blown up into other particular spaces.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.400]   And because it comes before the Oscars,
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.000]   which of course is intentional,
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.960]   it carries this weight because it's like,
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.920]   is it a precursor of,
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.840]   so best motion picture drama social network,
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.080]   I think we can all agree for whatever it's flaws,
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:20.160]   that's gonna be best picture this year, right?
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:23.600]   - Ooh, oh, Gina.
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:25.480]   - Sephien. - Inception?
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.640]   - I shall, I still argue-- - Whatever,
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:29.720]   whatever you think about inception,
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:32.440]   Hollywood does not give science fiction movies--
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:33.720]   - Okay. - Best picture awards.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:34.560]   I mean, they don't have a chance.
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:35.400]   - I will accept that.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.160]   - I wrote it up to like, I thought,
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.960]   I thought that the nerd movie of the year
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.760]   is inception, although now I'm rethinking that.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.600]   - No, no, it can be the nerd movie of the year line.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   I can't think of a more nerdy move.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.320]   (laughing)
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:49.160]   It's definitely the nerd, I wouldn't argue that.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.480]   - You wouldn't argue that, but you think
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.520]   that social network was a better film.
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:53.800]   - Oh yeah. - Overall.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.600]   - And I didn't, and remember both Jeff and I
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:57.040]   were kind of nasty about it.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.520]   - Oh, I still think-- - Yeah, I know.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.880]   - Thoroughly, that's a problem with it.
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:02.000]   - It was more, yeah, morally reprehensible,
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.400]   yet in a vacuum it was a well-made film
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.800]   with a great script.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.360]   - It was such a cynical act.
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:12.960]   That's why Sorkin and Rudin on the Golden Globe
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.520]   is just upsets me so much more.
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.840]   We used you, Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:20.000]   and oops, people do like you.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.560]   We didn't manage to destroy you.
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:22.800]   - Never mind. - So we like you now too.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:23.640]   - Yeah.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:26.480]   - You know, it was even more a cynical act.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.120]   It doubled the cynicism. - It doubled the cynicism.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:29.240]   You're right.
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:31.120]   Best motion picture drama,
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:33.480]   best motion picture director,
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:34.960]   best screenplay,
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:38.360]   I don't know what the fourth one is, but they won four,
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:39.880]   and best original score,
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:42.120]   oh, that's the Trent Reznor score.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:45.920]   Black Swan, Natalie Portman for Best Actress.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:47.240]   You know, I love the King's speech.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.080]   Have you seen that yet?
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.680]   That's a great movie. - I loved it.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.120]   Great film. - I did great movie,
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.120]   and Colin Firth won Best Actor.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.640]   I don't know why, this isn't the show
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.960]   for the Golden Globe results.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.400]   I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.040]   - Well, but Glee,
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:03.120]   - Oh, oh, but Glee. - But Glee.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.520]   - But Glee, let's just get that in there.
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:06.760]   Jane Lynch is except his beat, hilarious.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.600]   - Oh, I see, I didn't see any of it.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:09.440]   - All the writers.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.960]   - I was on a plane, I didn't see any of it.
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:11.800]   So what did she say?
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.720]   - Yeah, it was kind of, I mean,
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.120]   she was just really funny,
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.920]   and I would try to reenact it,
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.640]   but I will absolutely ruin it.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:20.040]   But she made just really some very, very funny,
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:23.320]   like very suvestor, like jokes.
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:24.800]   You know, she gave her writer,
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:27.120]   and then she delivered these incredible like lines,
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:27.960]   funny lines.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:28.800]   - She's really fads funny.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.080]   - She's, she's, Jane Lynch is such a wonderful actress
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:32.320]   and has done so many great movies,
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:37.280]   but she's really found her character, persona.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.400]   - Yeah, she has.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.080]   She was too up there, it was really cool.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:43.600]   - She was, well, of course she's too now.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.880]   I love it that that TV ad where she kicks the kid off the bench.
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:50.120]   (laughing)
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:51.240]   - Yeah, she said something like,
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:53.480]   you know, when I'm not too busy, you know, eating,
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:54.800]   I really appreciate it.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.400]   (laughing)
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:59.480]   - All this, all the good things at Glee is done for me.
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.440]   It was very funny, we look it up on YouTube.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.320]   - I would accept this video is no longer available
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.160]   because this YouTube account associated with this video
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.960]   has been terminated due to multiple third party
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.600]   notifications of copyright infringement.
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:11.200]   Sorry about that, says YouTube.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.880]   - Of course, I was too busy like squealing
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.800]   and jumping up and down,
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.640]   so maybe my recollection of it is,
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.840]   is what it actually was.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.520]   - Is it a squeal or a squee?
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.360]   - A squee, a squee.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.600]   - Officially specific to fan girls.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.440]   (laughing)
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.880]   - Which I am, tween, fan girls,
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.080]   which is what I become.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.520]   (laughing)
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.560]   - So I was really, my wife was very upset this morning
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.680]   because she got an email, she's not a member of LinkedIn.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.120]   She got an email from LinkedIn that had five people she knows
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.400]   saying these people are in LinkedIn
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.920]   and want you to be a friend with them.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.920]   And she said how, she was really upset.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.360]   She said how do they know?
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.800]   Who are, how does LinkedIn know this information?
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.160]   She was very upset and after thinking about it
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.280]   and talking with the chatroom,
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.640]   I realized those people, all when they signed up
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.880]   for LinkedIn said help me find my friends,
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.080]   here's my contact list.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.240]   And I mean, it's not just Facebook.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.440]   This stuff is happening everywhere
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.440]   and it's very offensive.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:17.400]   Facebook has had to suspend its address and phone sharing
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.120]   feature 'cause of the same kinds of,
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.920]   what the hell?
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.720]   Reaction.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.600]   They announced a new feature that allows users to share
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.920]   their mobile phone number and address with applications
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.680]   and third party websites.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.240]   They said today they're suspending the change
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:35.440]   in order for us to clarify the permission process.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.400]   - Well I think that's a good thing.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.400]   I think they've won. - Yes.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.040]   - Rather than shoving it out first and then fixing
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.120]   and doing damage.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.240]   - Well they did shove it out.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.040]   - Well they did but they pulled back fast with that.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.240]   - Fast.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.280]   I mean it went out Friday night making users' address
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.040]   and phone number accessible as part of their,
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.080]   the social graph.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.440]   The issue is if you haven't explicitly said don't share that
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.320]   it would kind of share it.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.480]   - As long as they iterate quickly,
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.800]   as long as they learn and iterate quickly.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.480]   - Yeah it's just like Google with Buzz right?
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.920]   They responded fast.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:09.360]   Although I didn't have to point out that maybe they should
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.200]   have realized that this was gonna be an issue.
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.080]   - Yeah, yeah, phone numbers it gets kind of sticky right.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.920]   I mean I feel like as soon as you email someone
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.120]   they have your email address.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.920]   Your email address is in their address both.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.880]   They will likely upload to wherever to contact their friends.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.600]   I mean at that point it's like it's the nature of it right?
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.040]   But yeah phone numbers it gets a little sticky right?
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.360]   It's a good argument for Google Voice.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:38.040]   - Yeah, having a single phone number which is not
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.360]   your number. - Like a public phone number
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.360]   that you share.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.520]   - It's free why not?
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.760]   And if you want, and this is what I do
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.560]   in my Google Voice number I give it out
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:48.880]   because I use screening and so I don't have to,
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.960]   I mean anybody can have my Google Voice number.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.800]   I'll give it to you right now.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.560]   It's 302 Leo Twit.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.760]   - Wow, bull Leo.
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:57.680]   (laughing)
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.520]   - I like that moron.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.240]   - And suddenly all the phones in the Twitcata
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.600]   go bringing off the hook.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.520]   (laughing)
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.080]   - I like that moron who gives that his Social Security
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.120]   member.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.720]   - Try it by service.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.560]   - Don't do that.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.320]   - No, don't do it, no, bad idea.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.680]   Park, the Palo Alto Research Center did a study
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:18.080]   on the usage of the location feel in Twitter profiles.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.320]   They said you're getting it, you're doing it wrong.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.120]   This is the new meme.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:27.840]   They selected group of 10,000 active users
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.080]   to study 34% of Twitter users do not provide
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.920]   valid geographic location on their profiles.
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.440]   Instead they use them for joking or none of your business.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.120]   - I don't know why.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.520]   - Well this is the open text field in your profile, right?
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.880]   - I'm sure you'll be doing anything you want.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.000]   - Yeah, yeah, and I can, working on ThinkUp,
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.880]   I can say that this sounds absolutely correct.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.520]   And you know, it stinks, but you know, it's an open text field.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:56.160]   People can describe where they are, however they want.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.080]   And that's a good thing.
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.440]   - I think so.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.280]   - That is a good thing.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.040]   That's why it's an open text field.
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.280]   - By the way, my phone is ringing off the hook.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.800]   (laughing)
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.640]   - Shocking.
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:08.920]   - Among other locations provided, Justin Bieber's heart.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.840]   (laughing)
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.280]   - You get a lot of planet Earth.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.120]   - Yeah.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:13.960]   - Under my desk.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.680]   - I used to always register,
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.720]   actually software I used to register
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.480]   to all mankind location planet Earth.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.920]   It's my little way of--
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:27.400]   - Contribution to the dirty data pool, Leo.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.240]   - Yeah, the dirty, well don't, you know,
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.560]   for a long time when anybody asked for my email,
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.840]   I'd say sjobs@apple.com.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.080]   - It's nice.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:37.240]   - Don't, I mean don't you, I mean,
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.320]   I think that's appropriate.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.760]   - It's tempting to do this.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.080]   - Now Apple, if you don't, when you get a new Mac,
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.000]   and if you don't fill out that form properly,
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.200]   they won't let you use your Mac.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.640]   - It's really-- - Well they validate.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.480]   - They validate your Mac.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.520]   - They seem to do some validation
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.920]   because I've gotten rejected, does it not?
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:53.760]   Uh-uh.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.360]   As jobs, we don't think so.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.760]   - But that doesn't stop you from actually using
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:59.840]   the machine, right?
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.080]   - I can't remember, it seemed like I had to get through it
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.520]   to continue on.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.600]   - That would be evil.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.240]   - That's kind of evil.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.720]   - So what do you think of,
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:10.280]   I don't want to talk about jobs personal life
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.600]   'cause it's none of my business,
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:13.640]   except to wish him well
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.000]   and hope that he gets better.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.560]   But there is a larger story, which is Apple without jobs.
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:24.560]   Apple being very, you know, even the business presses,
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.120]   well, we can't trust Apple to be straightforward
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.560]   with us, we don't know what's going on.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:30.760]   - There's all kinds of things going on.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.880]   I talked to Michael Harrington earlier today,
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.000]   there was the Apple director who died
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   and who was a source for various journalists.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.200]   And now there's a debate going on
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.680]   in journalistic and online circles
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.440]   as to whether or not his death
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.760]   is appropriate to give up the promise of confidentiality
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.960]   that he had, so that's one issue that's going around.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.520]   - Oh, that's really interesting.
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:51.360]   - Isn't it?
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.760]   If you go to TechCrunch, it's fairly high up.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:57.200]   And I'm suddenly forgetting the name of the director.
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:03.200]   Farhad Manju had a piece, which I did,
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.560]   I like him normally, but I didn't like this one
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.320]   where he was basically speculating the jobs
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.000]   will never go back because he's done everything he needs to do.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.480]   Well, that's right in the damn dough bit.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.560]   And I find that offensive.
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.920]   Going through the guy, as I said in the next bed,
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.000]   had the first half of what jobs had,
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.440]   and that was amazing enough,
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:21.720]   and then he had a liver transplant.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.840]   Of course, things are gonna go wrong.
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.120]   But he's fought back before,
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:28.160]   and I'm betting he's gonna come back.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.080]   - Of course, Michael cut through the debate
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.680]   by revealing the guy.
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.840]   I mean, yeah.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.720]   - Well, he's well revealed all over in the irony
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.440]   as the New York Times person has said I wouldn't do it.
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:40.400]   Obviously then did it because she was confirming.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.120]   Matthew Ingram, who's a gigo-home writer,
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.560]   a gigo-go-writer, and I were kind of leaning the other way
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.480]   that the death changes the contract.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.760]   - That you guys think.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:55.040]   - I think if somebody's confidential source,
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.520]   they stay a confidential source,
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.480]   regardless of whether they happen to be breathing.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:06:59.640]   - For eternity?
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.120]   - Yeah.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.200]   No, no, for 100 years.
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:07.640]   Life plus 30, I don't know.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.040]   - Yeah, it's like public domain,
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.040]   like at what point, what does it say?
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.320]   - The point where nobody cares anymore.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.760]   - So the point where no, like Mark Twain's like autobiography.
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.600]   Was it 100 years?
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.720]   - Yeah, but that was just the greatest marketing stunt
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:21.920]   of all time, because if you read it, it's like (imitates buzzer)
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.200]   who cares?
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.400]   - It's like, oh, I could proc up my monitor with this thing.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.960]   - I almost bought the book.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.480]   - It's a new, really great monitor-izer.
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:30.400]   - I read a review in the New York Times book review,
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.000]   which it was Garrison Keeler wrote a really funny review
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.400]   in which he just says, this is just a marketing stunt
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.200]   100 years later, 'cause there's nothing in here
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.120]   you wanna read, it's horrible.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.120]   (laughs)
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:46.120]   - Well, as Ari didn't point out, Mark felt deep throat.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:49.680]   His deal was not to lie, die,
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.640]   though he didn't come in a little bit earlier,
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.760]   and the reporters went along with it.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:58.600]   One of your room says is the contracts voidle.
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:01.800]   A lot of contracts were voided on death.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.240]   Tries up and dib, this is about Steve Jobs' personal life,
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.800]   and that's what makes it so difficult.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.640]   Imagine instead that you have some,
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:08.840]   you're a reporter at the New York Times,
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:11.280]   you have to have two sources, by name,
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.120]   you've got this huge story at AT&T,
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.320]   but you can't get a second source,
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.040]   and you have one source by name,
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.120]   the second source is off the record, second source dies.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.000]   - Do you do it?
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:21.840]   Do you go with it now?
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.080]   - No, that's interesting.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.720]   - You know, it may be a bad--
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.080]   - No, it's fascinating.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:30.360]   It means a journalistic issue, but it's fascinating.
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:33.680]   You know, speaking of the King's speech,
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:37.440]   most of the details in that script came from Lionel Logue's
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:39.920]   "Diary," which was found later,
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.560]   and the screenwriter, or actually,
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:46.280]   I guess it was a book, or before the information was revealed,
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:49.600]   they asked the Queen Mother if it was okay to reveal it,
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.640]   which I thought was appropriate,
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.960]   and she said, "Okay, but only after my death,
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.680]   "because it's far too painful,
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.080]   "and I don't want to live through it again."
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.480]   So that movie couldn't be made until the Queen Mother died,
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.600]   which is-- - Wow, ever.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.760]   - And she lived a long time, yeah.
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.480]   But they respected that, and I think that's appropriate,
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.880]   but you're right, after somebody dies,
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.320]   I mean, what are they gonna fire him?
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:11.160]   - Yeah.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.320]   - Can they prosecute the estate?
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.640]   I don't think so.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.080]   But it does kind of, it redounds to his reputation
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.240]   after death.
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.480]   - Well, right, I mean, it kind of makes him seem like--
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.320]   - A jerk.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.560]   - Could potentially make him seem like a jerk.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:25.560]   Yeah, I do really wanna do that to someone who just dies.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.400]   - Well, it's too late now, I thought that--
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.720]   - 100 years ago, whatever.
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:30.080]   - Michaeline Maynard writing in the New York Times,
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.760]   as Mike points out, it kind of,
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.680]   it hypothetically says, "Jerry York told others of us
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.160]   "details about Steve Jobs' illness.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.000]   "To me, a promise is a promise.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.080]   "I'll never reveal his name."
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:42.920]   What?
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.360]   (laughing)
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.360]   (laughing)
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:47.200]   What?
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.280]   And then, and that's a tweet.
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:53.680]   I just like everyone to know that I'd never divulged
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.120]   that Jerry York, one of my sources, is a source.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.680]   Basically, that's what she's saying.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.340]   Anyway, it's very odd.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.520]   - So what do you think about that?
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:09.520]   I wanna resist trying to speculate on Apple after Job.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.120]   - I kind of feel like if somebody told me something,
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.320]   yes, we're not gonna talk about it.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.000]   If somebody told, oh, to answer this question,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.240]   then we'll talk about the job thing.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.680]   If somebody told me in confidence something,
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.400]   I would basically say, okay, I'm not gonna,
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.840]   that's confidential.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.800]   There's no point in revealing it now
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.080]   that Jerry York said those things.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.080]   What's the point?
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.280]   - Well, the point is that it was a--
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.320]   - A director.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.320]   - A good source, jobs and the company
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.920]   are not revealing anything about the health.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.000]   You know, it was known and the company knew things
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.640]   they weren't telling the public, and is that right or wrong,
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.280]   which is again, a whole, another debate.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.920]   - This is a very tricky debate.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.440]   'Cause I completely understand that Steve
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:48.200]   does not want his health rooted about in public,
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.160]   'cause it's not nobody's business except
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.760]   he's the CEO of a publicly held company.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.280]   - Can I switch her to a piece this week?
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.880]   Or she had an argument in a video with one of her people
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.560]   and they debated this at a deed.
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.560]   And what was her point, position?
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.520]   - Sure, she was defending jobs,
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.600]   and I forget who it was, what it was looking for.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:09.000]   - Well, okay, but there, it does something,
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.440]   one of the reasons I am not a public,
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.880]   well, it's one of many reasons,
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.680]   I'm not a publicly held company,
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:15.800]   is because as soon as you're a publicly held company,
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.040]   there are all sorts of requirements
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.520]   of information that you have to reveal
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.880]   because you're selling pieces of your business
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.000]   to the public, the public,
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.440]   and it now has a right to know some business information
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.720]   that's germane, you no longer have the right
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:34.240]   to withhold information about the health of your CEO,
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.720]   for instance, if that's germane to the value of the company.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:39.280]   I think nobody would argue that Steve Jobs' health
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.600]   is very much germane to the value of Apple.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:45.360]   So I think that, I mean, I'm sorry, Steve, you're right,
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.160]   you deserve privacy, but if you should have thought
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.720]   about that when you went public,
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.760]   'cause if it was a private company,
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.400]   nobody's business but Steve's.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.680]   Right, am I wrong?
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.480]   And then of course we're talking to the guy who's got,
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.520]   who announces every possible surgery to the world, so.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.480]   You're the-
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:06.320]   - Was he my scar?
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.160]   - Yeah.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.240]   - I'm gonna be, you're the Lyndon Johnson.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.080]   - You're the Lyndon Johnson.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.160]   - Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.960]   (laughing)
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:13.800]   - I got that, I got that.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:15.000]   - You're showing my prostate scars.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.840]   - I got that scar right there.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.640]   - That's a very famous picture.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:21.800]   - Did you see the video this week about LBJ by Impance?
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:22.880]   - No.
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.880]   - Oh, oh, I saw people talking about this.
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:26.800]   - You got it, you got it, you got it.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:29.480]   I can also see if we can find it real quick.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.320]   LBJ, fine.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.640]   - Who can Google, who can Google it faster?
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.840]   Are these the, with a roomy crotch?
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.400]   Oh wait, this is audio, not video, right?
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.280]   - But there's a video version of it.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.400]   - I got the audio.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.120]   - No, you want the video version because they illustrated it.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.520]   - Oh yeah, I have that, okay.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.040]   Here we go, let's say.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:47.880]   - Listen to watch it.
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.560]   - It's on Vimeo, LBJ, Lyndon.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.200]   For those of you who don't remember,
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:57.200]   he was the president back in 1964 through 1968.
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:01.360]   Here we go, LBJ buying pants.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.360]   - Hello, hello.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.200]   Mr. Hager?
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.240]   - Yes, Bill Hager.
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:09.040]   - Joe, you're part of the one that makes clothes.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.960]   - Yet there, we're all gathered.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:15.320]   - You all made me some real lightweight slacks.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:19.800]   He just made up on his own, sent to me a trip a month ago.
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:24.480]   It's kind of a light brown and a light green,
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.480]   rather soft green and soft brown.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:31.440]   Now I need about six pairs for summer wear.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:34.680]   If I need about six pairs, I'll wear around in the evening
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.080]   when I come in from work.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:39.280]   And I can send you a pair.
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.400]   I want them half-inch larger in the waist
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:44.400]   than they were before, except I want two or three inches
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.720]   of stuff left back in there, so I can take them up.
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:49.880]   - Not very 10 to 15 pounds a month.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:50.720]   - What?
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.400]   - So leave me at least,
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.920]   - We all thought he was full of stuff in back there,
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.000]   but now we know.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.760]   - And make these a half-inch bigger in the waist,
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.240]   make the pockets at least a little more.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:02.280]   - I don't know where it gets to this,
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.280]   but it gets us to where the rest is wider left.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.120]   - Oh, oh.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.800]   - Oh.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:10.080]   - Come on, come on.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.040]   Now another thing that crutch down where you nuts are.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.960]   It's always a little too tight.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.520]   So when you back them up, give me an inch that I can get out there.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.720]   Because they cut me.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.360]   They just like riding a wire fence.
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.480]   These are almost the best that I've had
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.200]   anywhere in the United States.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:32.800]   But when I gained a little weight, they cut me under there.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.200]   So leave me, you never do have much margin there.
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.920]   But see if you can't leave me about it.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:43.440]   'Cause the age from the further zippering in the round.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:44.640]   - Get me back.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.160]   - Get me back to my bun hole.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:47.480]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.440]   (laughing)
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.800]   - He was actually quite famous for being somewhat crude.
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.600]   In fact, even having meetings in the White House, John.
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:58.920]   - Yeah.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:02.400]   - At those tapes, Michael Beshluss did an amazing job
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.080]   some years ago, collating the LBJ tapes.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.720]   It's well worth, it's on audible.com.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:08.840]   It's well worth listening to.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.080]   I don't know where this one came from,
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.320]   but he taped everything before Nixon did.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.040]   He was the original taper.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.200]   That is very funny.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.040]   - Isn't that right?
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:18.880]   - I don't know.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.720]   - God bless the internet.
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.360]   You find that gem and somebody pulls it out
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.360]   and does something with it.
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:25.240]   It's the remix culture.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:26.440]   It's a beautiful thing.
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.280]   - It is not fake.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.360]   That's absolutely LBJ.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.200]   - Oh, it is.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.800]   - I know it's white's anywhere.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:31.760]   I listen to all those tapes.
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:34.080]   I love them because it's really an insight
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.640]   into the very personal presidency.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.080]   I mean, you get right in there.
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:40.240]   - Yeah, I feel like I could have probably done
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.360]   without the information at the end there.
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.200]   - Oh, you know.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.280]   (laughing)
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.480]   - Still great illustration.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:46.480]   - I mean, that's a sitting treasure.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:47.440]   - And a good demonstration.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.400]   - I'll give me some of them hager slacks.
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:50.760]   You know, you made some.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.320]   He was such a good old boy.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.880]   - Oh my God.
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:58.200]   - So have you used your iPhone to buy coffee yet?
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.960]   - I did today.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.800]   - How was that?
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.080]   - It's incredibly fast.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.240]   There it is, right?
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:07.160]   - So the Starbucks app now has the ability to buy coffee.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.000]   - Yes.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.680]   And so all you do is go to the app and say,
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:11.840]   touch when you do it, you scan it to the thing right there
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:15.000]   at the register and boom, done and off you go.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.080]   Now what I want, and I said this on Twitter,
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:20.520]   is I want this to also have my drink order.
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.360]   So that goes in.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.320]   I don't have to go through all those mess,
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.240]   which was somebody's idea at my Starbucks idea
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:25.480]   about year and a half ago.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.040]   And on Twitter, Starbucks Twitter accounts said,
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:29.840]   well, one thing at a time.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.360]   Interesting.
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.200]   - I also want this on Android
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.520]   when they said they're working on that too.
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.440]   - Can I have it delivered?
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.080]   That's what I want.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.720]   I want you to just bring me coffee, boy.
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.680]   And can you leave a little more room in the crotch?
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.320]   (laughing)
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:46.760]   - So how was the payment done?
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.960]   Is it done through iTunes?
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.760]   - Oh, you register your card.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.600]   - You charge it out.
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:51.480]   - No, like you have like a gift card?
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:52.480]   Okay, you charge card.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.800]   - Star, sorry Steve Jobs, it goes way around you.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.640]   So really?
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.320]   - Oh, Apple makes nothing?
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:58.440]   - No, no, no, no, it's a free app.
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.880]   And then I register my gift cards to my account anyway,
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.480]   which I just did this weekend by chance,
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.000]   because I found some.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.600]   I didn't know how much was on them.
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.960]   My mother-in-law gives me, she didn't know what to get
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:09.160]   from me, she gives me a Starbucks card.
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.440]   Thank you very much, I think.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:15.000]   And so I have like $300 in Star Wars card.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.720]   - Oh Steve, like credits.
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:18.720]   - A couple years sitting there, so yeah.
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:19.560]   And so I wanted people to-
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.120]   - Well, if you have cards, yeah, I mean,
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:23.120]   it's the same thing, it's just in your phone.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.080]   - So you type in your order,
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.040]   does the app detect what Starbucks you're in?
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.320]   Like how does it submit the order?
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.160]   - No, no, it's just-
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.000]   - So you have to be connected to the library?
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   - You just get in the door.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   That's what he wants.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:31.840]   - Oh, I see.
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.000]   - You just hold up a scan, that's it.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.280]   It's like the point.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.680]   - He wants, and I agree with him,
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.200]   you shouldn't have to go up to the counter at all.
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.400]   - Right, you just submit your order.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.760]   This is Star Wars. - There I say it.
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.920]   Chipotle's app, of course, I can do it.
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:43.920]   - Really?
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.960]   - Oh yeah, I did it today.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:48.240]   You go to the Chipotle app, you find the nearest one,
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.960]   I have a standing order, I put it in, I get there,
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:54.600]   and I go around the line, which at my Chipotle is incredible.
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:55.960]   It goes outside even in the rain,
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:58.960]   and Bingo, Jeff has his bag of burrito, and I go-
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:17:59.800]   - I have to say, when I-
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.680]   - So I'm nervous, Chipotle hacks, awesome.
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:02.680]   Is this on Android?
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.240]   (laughing)
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.240]   - Android Chipotle.
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:07.240]   - Is it on Android?
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.080]   - Is it?
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.040]   - I'm just looking.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:13.560]   - I like Baja Fresh because they have the salsa bar there,
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:17.000]   and you can get the jalapeno slices.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.520]   And so I complained on Twitter about not having jalapeno slices,
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:24.200]   and Chipotle tweets the official, what did you call them?
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.640]   Where did you just call them?
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.400]   - Twitter- - Twitter-
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:29.240]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.080]   - Twitter- - Twitter-
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:30.920]   - Twitter- - Twitter-
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:33.160]   - For Chipotle, said yes, you can in fact ask for,
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.800]   and it's diced fresh jalapeno from the back.
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.520]   And by God, I tried it, and they brought 'em up.
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.960]   - This show is so informational.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.640]   - It is so huge.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.800]   - I need efficient ways to get my food.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.320]   (laughing)
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.960]   - I would like to have food without actually speaking to,
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.640]   or really in any way having contact with a human.
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:52.480]   Is that possible?
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.960]   - Yes, seriously, this should have been my tip.
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:56.840]   - Yeah, I was thinking of like bathrooms.
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:59.760]   Do you go into bathrooms now, and don't know what to do
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.640]   if you actually have to touch something?
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.320]   (laughing)
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.680]   Right, I mean, I wave, I stand up from the toilet,
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:06.520]   it does it, I wave.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:07.800]   - It's a little weird, isn't it?
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.080]   It is a little weird.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.680]   If it works, you can- - I like it.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:12.760]   - I get to open the house, loves it.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.960]   - I feel like an idiot, 'cause I'm always at the sink
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.200]   on like this, and they never,
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.800]   and it's always in the airport I encounter these,
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:18.640]   and they never work.
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.840]   So you're going like this, I'm like this.
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.840]   - And then you have to touch the handle of the door
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:23.680]   to open it on the way out.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:24.520]   - Yeah, right, yeah.
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:25.360]   - Which negates the whole thing.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.440]   - The one least clean thing in the bathroom,
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:30.280]   and there's no paper towels to which you can,
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:32.480]   so just bring rubber gloves from now on.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:33.800]   (laughing)
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.520]   - Let us get, we are gonna get in a moment
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:38.680]   to our tip tool and number of the week
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:39.880]   with Jeff Jarvis and Jitter Tepani,
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:41.720]   we are way late again, I don't know why this happens,
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:46.360]   I just, if we took out all of the non-useful stuff,
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:47.560]   this show would be- - Three minutes.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.160]   - Yeah, be very quick.
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.240]   (laughing)
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:54.720]   Minus the Chipotle Glee social network stuff, it's over.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:58.560]   The inception review alone.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:01.040]   Just real quickly, I wanna mention,
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.120]   if only you could do that with your email,
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.720]   just eliminate the stuff you don't want
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:05.680]   and only get the stuff you like,
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:06.920]   well that's what MailRout does,
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:10.200]   think of it as MailRout is the Chipotle Glee
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.640]   social network inception remover for your junk mail.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.480]   MailRout.info is a place to go to find out
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.080]   more 10% off for the life of your account,
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:19.000]   if you run your own server, which I do,
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.720]   if you can change the MX record,
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.280]   if you're, you know, this is a great solution,
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:24.640]   and it's worked for me for years,
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:25.960]   since 2004 I've been using it,
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:28.800]   and I am now sharing my email secret with you.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.680]   MailRout.info, 10% off for the life
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:34.160]   of your account.
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:37.840]   Let's start with Gina Trapani, oops, that's my hand.
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.840]   Let's start with Gina Trapani and her tip of the week.
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:45.360]   - So my tip this week is a shameless, shameless plug.
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.200]   - Blog!
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.880]   - I hope you all forgive me for this,
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.800]   but that Android app that I started working on back in May
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:53.040]   is now ready for people to try it out.
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.920]   It's called To Do Text Touch.
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.120]   It's not in the Android market yet,
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.320]   because I've got a couple, actually,
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:58.440]   it's not in the Android market yet,
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:00.960]   because Jeff Jarvis always complains about the search button
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.480]   not working correctly, and until I have that working,
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.680]   I'm not gonna submit it, but in the meantime,
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:08.800]   you can download the APK, the APK, it's at my website,
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.840]   it's topofthewebsitesmarterware.org.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.640]   It is a personal task manager,
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:15.360]   it's a To Do Text Manager,
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.880]   which is a story to do text file in Dropbox,
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:18.960]   so authentic it's Dropbox.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.960]   - I love that channel, I realize this is cloud.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:21.800]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:22.800]   - So go to a Smarterware Door,
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.840]   and you'll see you can see
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:24.680]   some of your other screenshots.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.600]   - Not to do text, but to Smarterware.
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.840]   - Not to dotext.com yet.
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:31.720]   Once I get it out there, I'll have it there,
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.120]   but you can see at Smarterware.org at the top there,
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.960]   and there's a link to download the APK,
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:39.920]   and just give it a test run, and see how it works.
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:42.320]   - So you actually have a UI for Android
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:45.000]   that's not just a text editor, that's kinda cool,
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.400]   but then it saves it to the text file.
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.720]   - Each line, that represents one line
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.280]   that's to do.text file, right?
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.320]   So when you update that line,
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.360]   if you long tap one of those items,
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:56.320]   you make it updated, it writes it back to do text
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.960]   on your phone, and then syncs to Dropbox
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.280]   in the background automatically, right?
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:01.600]   So your two text will be synced on whatever device.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.080]   - So if you're on an iPad, for instance,
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:06.560]   you could use plain text, which does access Dropbox text files.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.320]   It's a .txt file, right?
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.160]   - Yeah, it's just about txt file.
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.280]   - So you have full access to it.
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:12.000]   So you could use it on your iPad,
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.360]   you could use it on your iPhone,
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.320]   on your Android phone, and of course any computer,
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.720]   as long as you just open it with a text editor.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.360]   - Exactly, and the reason why I wrote this app
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.520]   is because editing text on your phone
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.960]   is a continuous text file.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:25.920]   It's just kind of a pain.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.800]   So what this app does is just separate each line
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.080]   into an individual task, and gives you kind of one tap ways
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.280]   to prioritize, to mark things as complete,
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.240]   to add tags, to it, and dates.
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:37.000]   So it's just easier to deal with versus--
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.400]   - Could I use this for any kind of lists, Gina,
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.640]   if I want to do a guest list for an event or something?
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.640]   Like, it's the same basic concept, right?
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.880]   - It's the same basic concept.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.960]   So the idea is eventually we will have,
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.520]   it will support lots of different.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.080]   You can create any text file,
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.280]   and then edit it line by line,
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.320]   and there's touch interface on your phone,
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:54.680]   which is really what I wanted.
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.040]   But then it syncs back to Dropbox,
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.320]   so then you can edit on any platform
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:00.640]   and any text editor that you want.
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:02.760]   So this is, I live in to do text,
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.760]   and this is a companion app to my command line interface
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:06.760]   to do text.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:08.520]   - What do you do, like, click silver,
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.520]   or something to command line it,
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.600]   or you just--
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:14.800]   - I actually wrote a bash script to do.sh,
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:18.640]   which it's just to do, add, to do, prioritize, that kind of--
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:19.920]   - So you'll have the terminal open,
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:21.680]   and then you'll just use commands in the terminal.
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:22.920]   - Yeah, I live, yeah.
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:25.240]   And so I use GeekTool, I kind of pin it to my desktop.
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:27.680]   I use commands, I will often open it up
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:28.520]   in a regular text editor.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.280]   I mean, I access the text file itself
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:31.280]   in lots of different ways,
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.720]   but the whole point is that it's just a text file.
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:35.040]   I can do that, and with Dropbox,
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.720]   you get that syncing to what goes everywhere.
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:38.560]   So that's what I love about it.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.000]   I mean, I literally have a thousand,
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.520]   like 3,000 line done.text file since 2007,
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.160]   of like all the things that I've done,
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:47.440]   which you know, you can really easily grep and search.
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:50.640]   So this app is just sort of a companion for folks
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:53.120]   using the to do text and stored in Dropbox.
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:54.680]   And it's in beta, and there's some bugs,
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.320]   but I hope you give it a try,
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.520]   if you have an Android phone.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.720]   - The chat room points out,
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:00.400]   you know, the giga home just brought it up.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.400]   - Oh, perfect.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:02.240]   - Really?
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:03.080]   - Thank you. - Right on.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:04.240]   - Thank you. - Awesome.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.080]   - Thank you.
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.040]   - Cool, very very cool. - Well done.
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.880]   - So that's my kind of personal plug.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.120]   My quick tip for the week is for programmers.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.360]   I was complaining a couple weeks ago
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.240]   about how the Chrome OS doesn't,
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:16.720]   you know, it's not easy to edit code in Chrome OS.
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:19.360]   Well, Google code, which is code.google.com,
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:23.360]   which hosts coding projects, added a text editor.
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:26.600]   So you can edit your code with a little syntax highlighting,
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.760]   and you can preview the diff.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:31.280]   So it's kind of like the beginnings of this cloud IDE
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.120]   happening.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:32.960]   I mean, of course you can't compile,
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:35.160]   you can't run tests, that kind of thing.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:37.160]   But it does seem like sort of like the beginning.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.960]   So if you're hosting code at Google code,
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.480]   and I gotta say I prefer GitHub,
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.200]   but this is good too,
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.600]   I prefer GitHub myself,
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:47.560]   but Google code is coming along anyway.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.840]   There's something to check out.
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:50.360]   So if you're hosting some code on Google code,
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.560]   you can edit there now.
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:54.240]   So if you have a CR48, that might be an option.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.760]   - Yeah, they have to have something like this
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:58.080]   if you're gonna use a CR48 for anything.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.240]   - Yeah. - But you can't recompile it.
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:00.640]   So it's like, well, I got the code in.
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.520]   - Well, yeah, you need some sort of environment, right?
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:03.760]   So you have to deploy it somewhere,
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.120]   and then compile it somehow, you know?
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:08.160]   So this is just a way to start to edit,
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.320]   do some, some editing only.
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:11.880]   Yep, maybe steps.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:14.280]   - Our number of the week from Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:17.040]   - Number of the week is 1.78 million.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.960]   That's how many people are likely to die this week,
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.480]   this year on Facebook.
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:25.760]   - Not because of Mark's bad dressing,
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:26.600]   but-- - No, that's well,
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.040]   like birds falling from the sky,
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.240]   I guess, you know, Facebook people
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:31.800]   will start dropping over. - If you have 600 million users,
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:34.360]   some percentage of them are gonna pass.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.800]   - Which raises the really interesting issue
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.560]   that Dave Weiner has been talking about a lot lately
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:41.200]   is your memorialization.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:42.360]   After his father passed away,
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.800]   his father had an online blog.
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:47.320]   How do you keep your virtual life there?
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.200]   How do you keep your legacy?
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:51.800]   - I was talking yesterday with this amazing woman
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:52.880]   named Elizabeth Eisenstein,
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:54.520]   who's a professor at American University,
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:57.520]   who wrote the definitive Gutenberg book,
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:01.280]   700 pages, just amazing that I read for my research.
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.600]   And it was just a delightful conversation with someone who,
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:06.560]   you know, the viewers, I don't know technology and all that.
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.800]   But we got into the same issue of permanence,
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:11.080]   and the desire for permanence is what pushes people
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.120]   to write a lot, that's what we're doing.
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:15.440]   And she said, well, you know, your floppy disk
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.800]   is already useless, but the Gutenberg Bible's
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:20.360]   still around 550 years later.
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:23.560]   And so how do we look at this issue of permanence?
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:24.400]   - Right.
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:26.840]   - As people die, and what is their legacy online,
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:27.960]   and what should it be online?
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:29.400]   You know, I lost a friend a while ago
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.080]   who got killed in an auto accident,
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:32.880]   and her page is still there.
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.520]   - Facebook has a process for that.
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:37.760]   You actually can, as the next of kin,
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:41.560]   contact Facebook and it will turn your wall into a memorial.
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.480]   There's a whole process for that.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:44.320]   - I didn't know that.
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:47.080]   - Yeah, well, when you got millions of people dying,
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.840]   you got to do something.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:49.680]   - Yeah.
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:50.520]   - So actually, I come into Facebook
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.080]   for kind of thinking about that.
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:55.600]   - I don't mean to end on a downer of death today,
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.840]   but I found that notion interesting
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.200]   is that when you get to those numbers,
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:02.680]   you're going to deal with 1.8 million deaths.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:04.400]   And what do you do about it?
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:05.920]   - I can't remember what the, and I see,
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:07.360]   I don't know about you, I bet you were to Facebook,
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:08.840]   you're obituary and Facebook.
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:11.400]   I'm trying to find the link that you would follow
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:15.240]   if somebody passes away on Facebook.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.720]   - But you know, this is what users do with walls
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:19.880]   of people who have died anyway.
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.080]   - Anyway, yes, they do anyway.
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.400]   - But Facebook has kind of formalized the prospect.
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.640]   - But what Dave talks about is that,
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.040]   so I have to leave somehow a means
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.440]   to keep Buzz machine going, or not.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:34.640]   But my ego I have going past the grave,
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:35.800]   I want to still be there.
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.960]   I want to take down all the comments in spam,
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:41.160]   but 'cause I can't fight back from the grave,
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.120]   but I want it to somehow live on.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:46.120]   And how does that happen?
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:47.960]   And so Dave's been thinking about that a lot,
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.200]   and he's also been asking the same thing,
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:51.520]   not just for people, but for code and things.
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:53.280]   How do you find permanent institutions
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:54.960]   in a world where things come and go
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.960]   and start and die quickly?
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:59.560]   You will universities be that place to preserve that,
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.480]   or will they go away too?
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:04.480]   - So Facebook has a form,
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:07.640]   reported deceased person's profile.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:10.400]   And by the way, they're pretty seriously strict about
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.120]   under penalty of perjury, and so forth.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:14.960]   But what will happen is the account then becomes
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:18.160]   memorialized, privacy is set so that only confirmed friends
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:20.640]   can see the profile are located.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.640]   The wall remains so that friends and family
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:25.440]   can leave posts in remembrance.
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.280]   But you need to provide some information.
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:30.240]   And so there is actually a page on Facebook.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:31.240]   - Oh.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:32.360]   - To report deceased person.
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.440]   I think that's actually completely appropriate.
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:38.000]   I wonder what Twitter does for something like that.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.960]   - I, now our friend.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.200]   - Well Twitter, you lose all your stuff anyway Leo.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.440]   - 3500 tweets in that.
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:47.400]   - If you don't use, if you don't use Gene or Japati,
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.680]   all your tweets go up in the air anyway.
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:54.120]   Gina, Gina is our link to eternity.
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.800]   - Yes.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:56.640]   Wow.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:58.240]   - As long as I'm around anyway.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.960]   - Well, we gotta, I think we, you know,
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.200]   we gotta, we gotta think about this.
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.320]   And I think this is, you know, my friend Brian Brushwood,
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.880]   who of course is one of our hosts on NSFW,
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:07.680]   has created a page, he was thinking about this.
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:09.440]   He talked about it on Twitch this week called,
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:12.120]   it's called afterlife.me.
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:15.040]   Every year on his birthday, which was the 17th,
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:18.440]   he has to ping this page if he does not.
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:22.560]   An AI goes into effect that basically takes over,
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.720]   saying Brian has died.
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:25.560]   - Wow.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:26.560]   - 'Cause he didn't ping me.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:27.960]   Brian is dead.
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.480]   And this is what's gonna happen.
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:31.000]   It does all this stuff.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.240]   Is that wild?
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:34.080]   - He hasn't.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:34.920]   - That is wild.
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.840]   - Mixed in dimension into this formula.
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:39.040]   - Oh, well, he's either dead or crazy.
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:39.880]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:42.680]   - Does he remember to, does it remind him?
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:44.440]   - The blind doesn't know what it's like to get older.
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.720]   - I told him this is a brilliant startup.
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:47.560]   - It is.
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:48.400]   - It's the best.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.560]   - The thing is, is that we write about these kinds
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.240]   of services and life hacker all the time,
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.240]   but my question was always like,
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.840]   how long is this startup gonna make it?
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:56.920]   I'm probably gonna make it longer than this startup does.
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:57.760]   - Right, right.
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.560]   - Why would I trust, even Google,
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.840]   I mean, I would trust like the Library of Congress.
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.640]   But I wouldn't trust a startup
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:04.640]   and I don't even know if I would trust.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.600]   - When you set up the startup,
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:08.560]   you have to do all these things to make sure
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.880]   that no matter what, even if the founders go away,
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:13.760]   whatever, there's an annuity to keep the thing running.
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:14.800]   - Run in a new way like a graveyard.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.640]   - Right, and the software continues.
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:17.600]   I mean, graveyards do this.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:20.720]   If you buy a perpetual flame or whatever,
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:22.280]   perpetual care at a graveyard,
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:23.520]   by the way, I'm about to do that.
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:25.960]   Jennifer and I have decided on a plot.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:28.120]   (laughing)
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:29.880]   It is death week at death week.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.360]   - I was gonna say, welcome to Welcome to Wake, folks.
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.520]   - She said, you know, there's still some nice space
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.680]   in the graveyard in Petaluma.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:38.200]   We really ought to get that hillside plot now
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:41.000]   so that the kids will know where we are.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:41.840]   (laughing)
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:42.680]   - Aww.
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:46.640]   - It's a little morbid, but I don't think it's inappropriate.
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:47.760]   And I think the, I think--
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:49.640]   - You're doing them a huge favor, Leo.
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:51.480]   Huge favor to do that for them.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:52.520]   - Well, they don't want to do it.
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:53.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:57.040]   That's called pre-planning in the mortuary business.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.160]   Now, I have to say, I think we need,
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:01.240]   we definitely need somebody to put together,
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:03.520]   you're right, Gina, I've seen all these sites
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:05.960]   that set up this stuff are gone.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:06.800]   - Yes. - But,
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:07.920]   somebody needs to do something
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:09.400]   and somehow set it up so that it's more permanent.
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.160]   At least, hey, congratulations to Facebook
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:13.320]   for addressing it and handling it.
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:17.280]   I wanna switch this on my todo.text to do list.
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:20.000]   - And I'm sitting here going, God, I really ought to do a will.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:20.840]   - Oh yeah.
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:22.520]   - Oh, you do, oh, you do, you do, you do.
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:24.240]   My brother-in-law died in test state
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:26.160]   and boy, is that a mess.
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:27.000]   - Yeah, with the problem.
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:27.920]   - It's a mess, it's a worse thing than the world.
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:30.120]   - It's just awful to go through my wife's executor
[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:31.720]   and it was just terrible to go through.
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:35.160]   And a lot of ugly surprises await.
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:38.520]   - You're in test state now that you've had your surgery, right?
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:40.560]   I'm just joking, never mind, he'll get it in a few minutes.
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.000]   - That was the previous surgery.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000]   (laughing)
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.040]   - All right, my tool and then we're gonna get out of here.
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:50.360]   So I'm not gonna name names, but somebody that I work with,
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:54.680]   I lent her a droid X and she lost it.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:57.160]   And I said, well, you have where's my droid on it, right?
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:58.000]   She said, what's that?
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.720]   And I said, oh my God, I haven't told you about where's my droid?
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:02.440]   Where's my droid is an Android application?
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.040]   It's absolutely free.
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:05.520]   Now, there's a Find My iPhone,
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:06.360]   whichever one knows about it.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.040]   This is the analog for that.
[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:10.320]   And it has some, it's free, it has some great features.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:14.000]   Ring when lost, ring for 30 seconds, ring for five minutes.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.960]   There's all sorts of useful stuff in here.
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.720]   There's an attention word.
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:21.720]   You can text to the phone that will erase the contents
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:24.240]   that will respond, turn on the GPS
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:27.160]   and respond with the location of the phone.
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:29.840]   This is a really lovely,
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:32.960]   this is, so if I send a text with GPS my droid
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:37.240]   to my lost phone, it will turn on the GPS
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:38.920]   and then I can follow it.
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.960]   I can figure out where it is.
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:42.480]   Look, if you've got an Android phone,
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:44.720]   you really ought to have this on there.
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:47.440]   It's called Where's My Droid?
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:50.400]   And it is a free application you can download.
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:51.840]   And I really think it's,
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:55.120]   and I wish that this person who shall remain nameless.
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:57.760]   And put that on there,
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:59.400]   'cause we'd have it back by now.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:00.760]   I think you've been calling it.
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:04.240]   Yeah, oh yeah, that's, of that, no, no.
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:06.080]   I think she left it in a New York cab
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.680]   and having left an iPod in a New York cab some years ago
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:09.880]   and calling the cab company
[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.880]   and hearing the laughter, the mirth,
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:13.400]   (laughing)
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.680]   that ensued when I said,
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.400]   "Well, is there any chance I could get the cabi
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.200]   "to return that?"
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.480]   They in fact, what they said was,
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:20.760]   "Well, if you're lucky,
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:22.600]   "maybe you turn it into the police department,
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:25.520]   "but we got it otherwise I think you're out of luck."
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.760]   Do not leave anything in a cab
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:28.560]   if you ever want it back, that's for sure.
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:31.760]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:34.520]   That's his blog, a must read.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:36.920]   He's also a professor at City University
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:37.760]   of New York of Journalism
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:40.640]   and the author of a great book called,
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.160]   What Would Google Do?
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.360]   Available in better bookstores everywhere.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:46.840]   Are you gonna hold up the book?
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.680]   - Hey! - Yeah.
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:49.680]   - I haven't done that in ages,
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:50.800]   chat room place back. - It looks just like
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:53.680]   my copy. (laughing)
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:55.840]   - Oh, mine's on my Kindle, yeah.
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:56.800]   (laughing)
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.080]   - Hold up your Kindle.
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:01.400]   Gina Trapani would never have a dead tree anything
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:03.240]   in her house.
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:04.160]   - Never.
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:07.600]   She is the author at smarterware.org.
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.240]   And that's a great place to go to find out
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:10.840]   about this to do.txt, which is really,
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:13.480]   I think a wonderful idea for a to-do list.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:15.080]   - It's the nerdy to-do list.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:16.720]   - Well, it's the right to-do list.
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:18.840]   So, it's just the right thing.
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:21.760]   I get fancy when you can do it in text.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:23.760]   And we do the show every Wednesday at 11,
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:24.920]   oh, I'm sorry, one pm Pacific,
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:26.800]   four pm eastern time at live.twit.tv.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:27.960]   So tune in for the live show
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:30.440]   or get the edited show after the fact
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.280]   with all mentions of Glee
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:36.480]   and Chipotle removed, excised.
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:37.920]   No, no, we leave it all.
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:41.420]   - You know Leo, Gina and I were conspiring in Austin.
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:44.360]   That was right. - That was coming up.
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:45.920]   - The show from.
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:47.600]   - Is there Chipotle and Austin?
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:48.440]   - So that will, the central.
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:50.680]   - The central. - It's going to the fake burrito place,
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:52.120]   but it's the right thing for us.
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:54.320]   - We're in freaking Austin and we're gonna go to one.
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:55.760]   All right. - I know.
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.600]   It's our, but there are several.
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:58.760]   There's a lot of support. - All right.
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.600]   - You know, we're gonna go to a real--
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.160]   - You could stick might not be great.
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:02.040]   - You got the truck, right?
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:02.880]   You got the Twit truck?
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.240]   - So, yeah, this isn't official,
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.880]   but what we're planning to do is we have a truck
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:07.880]   with cameras in and a makeup room, the whole thing.
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:09.760]   And then we have, it has a lip that sticks out
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:12.160]   and we'll sit on the lip, not while the truck's going.
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:13.480]   I don't think that's quite safe,
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.440]   but the truck will go spots in park
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.480]   and we will sit in front.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.280]   So we'll, yeah, if it's, if,
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.920]   well, here's all Chipotle has to do.
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:23.800]   Provide us with a high speed internet connection
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:24.800]   via ethernet,
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:27.280]   just to wire out of the stores, fine with me,
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:29.400]   and free burritos or whatever it is they make.
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:31.560]   And then the guacamole for all.
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:34.760]   And then we will be outside of your Chipotle store.
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:35.960]   Chipotle tweets.
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:38.640]   That's the guy talking to you, man.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:39.720]   - We're out. - And I'm definitely
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:41.760]   going to South by so-- - Oh, yay!
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.200]   - Yay, South by party!
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.240]   - Yes! - Party at Leo's truck.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:48.480]   (laughing)
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.880]   - Oh boy, oh boy.
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:51.960]   - That's soon. - I can see already.
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:53.040]   - That's coming up.
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:55.760]   - I will be here next week.
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:57.520]   - You will be next week, right?
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:58.360]   - Yes.
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.040]   - I'm gonna have to ask Eileen.
[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:02.120]   But I will not be here the week after,
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:04.000]   or for three weeks, I'm gonna be in South America.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.720]   So, Tom, - I'm gonna miss you for four Leo.
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:06.800]   I hate this one. - Oh, and now you're
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.640]   gonna be a Davos and not able to do the show
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:09.640]   because you'll be in there.
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:11.240]   - They scheduled me so that I'll be
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:12.920]   immediately invented 10 o'clock.
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:13.760]   - That was fun last year.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.400]   We got the tour around. - A lot.
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:17.000]   - Yeah, that was fun, but that's all right,
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.080]   because you're famous and you gotta go.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:21.320]   So-- - We gotta represent us.
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:22.440]   - We gotta represent. - Yeah.
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:24.760]   - We gotta represent. - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.680]   - So I guess I won't see you for a month.
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.520]   - Oh, I hate that, Lee.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:28.480]   I'll have a mobile yosh.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.760]   Have a great, great, great trip.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:30.600]   - Thank you.
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:31.440]   I'll be-- - Join.
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:32.800]   - You deserve it. - I'll be doing
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:34.400]   my social media thing.
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:35.240]   - Yeah.
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:37.120]   - So you can follow it there.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:38.680]   - Thank you everybody for joining us.
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:41.440]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:44.520]   (upbeat music)
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:46.320]   - We need more, not sick.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.920]   (upbeat music)
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:51.500]   (upbeat music)
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:54.080]   (bell chiming)
