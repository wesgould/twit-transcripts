[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.000]   And we are talking about the Googleverse, the cloud,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.640]   everything having to do with whatever is out there and not
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.720]   in here and joining me right now around the country
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.600]   from San Diego, California.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.280]   Gina Tripani.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.760]   Hey, Gina.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.880]   Let's go to see you again.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.080]   Welcome back home.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.280]   Thank you.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.040]   From New York, New York, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.160]   Oh, this is what you want.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.360]   Shut up.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.600]   He's showing off his Nexus One.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.680]   I'm actually-- and you probably, if you're listening,
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.160]   you're going, what's wrong with Leo?
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.960]   I'm actually not in the studio today.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.640]   We're at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas,
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.080]   which is replete with Nexus One's there.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.800]   I've never seen so many Nexus One's.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.560]   Everybody's got one, and everybody who has one
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.960]   is quick to show it off.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.120]   And you know what's really sad?
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.720]   I ordered it Tuesday, and I know it's sitting back home
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.240]   waiting for me.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.440]   Oh, no.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.640]   So Jeff, you didn't buy it, Gina?
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.280]   I did.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.200]   I did.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.120]   All right, let's see.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.840]   I've been waiting for the show all week.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.720]   Show off.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.800]   Show off.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.360]   You know, I went--
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.360]   I just got dying, but Jeff thinks.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.760]   Well, I went to an event.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.960]   We'll find out in the moment.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.000]   Really?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.240]   I get the feeling that Jeff hates it, and I love it.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.080]   So I'm really--
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.800]   No, he hates it so Ray's wrong.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.760]   What I tweeted, it's the blogger's curse.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.560]   You quote yourself or repeat yourself.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.920]   I'll do both.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.720]   I tweeted that I felt as if I cheated on my wife.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.040]   That is to say Steve Jobs is by going to a strip bar
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.000]   that it is to say Nexus One.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.920]   That is a very tortured analogy.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.080]   I don't--
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.480]   I don't know.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.360]   He's cheating on the app.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.200]   I've talked about how the problem was
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.680]   that it was rather like an S&M bar,
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.040]   because it was Google saying, you've
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.760]   filled through this hours of A.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.600]   Oh, interesting.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.760]   Basically, it just doesn't replace the iPhone for me.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.720]   I understand what you said, Gina, on your post at Smarterware
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.640]   that it becomes a marker of the true geeky, which
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.080]   shows that I'm not.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.360]   I'd rather like that Apple goes to the effort
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.480]   to figure out how we think so that we don't have to think.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.680]   Microsoft, on the other hand, requires us to think like Bill
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.440]   Gates and Microsoft.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.880]   Google, which wants to intuit our intent, needs,
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.720]   I think, to get a little bit more like Apple.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.600]   They just didn't think through some stuff,
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.920]   and I just felt like I was going back through a maze,
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.000]   getting it working.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.920]   And at the end of the day, my Apple's just more comforting.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.400]   I still have my--
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.320]   How much-- how much of that Jeff,
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.960]   do you think, is just familiarity?
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.960]   And how much of it is really that this is not
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.560]   a polished product?
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.040]   Well, I think that's absolutely right, Leo,
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.600]   and what Gina said-- and I don't even
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.800]   just do any of your thunder, Gina,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.360]   but you always say so many smart things.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.800]   You have plenty left over--
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.920]   is that those who treasure openness
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.280]   will treasure the android.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.760]   And I understand that, and I get that,
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.120]   and he grabs me right about the familiarity.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.840]   But I basically think that if the iPhone hadn't existed,
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.160]   and this were first, I would be gaga in love with this.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.960]   But the iPhone is a hard act to follow.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.200]   I am to say, as a droid user, of course,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.560]   I'm going to be very comfortable immediately
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.520]   with the Nexus 1, and the ones I've played with
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.960]   are much faster than the Droid.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.200]   I mean, noticeably swifter, and that's
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.280]   kind of showed off by that live desktop thing they're doing.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.120]   There's more front pages, right?
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.200]   There's four front pages.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.320]   That's a good thing.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.240]   I hate it the three.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.920]   It's too limited.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.600]   I can't wait to play with it.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.000]   I love the industrial design.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.680]   You agree?
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.040]   Come on.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.680]   You've got to say it's got a good industrial design.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.320]   It's good hand candy, yes.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.280]   Hand candy.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.200]   Jeff, I'm interested to know, so I
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.400]   think that there's a big-- I think
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.000]   the android requires just a huge paradigm shift
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.880]   for iPhone users.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.120]   I think you go into the phone with this familiarity
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.080]   with this particular experience, the Apple experience,
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.000]   which is beautiful.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.600]   And I think that when you pick up Android,
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.560]   it just feels weird.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.000]   So I'm interested to know, what happened when you
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.720]   started using it?
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.280]   What are the things that it's missing the most,
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.200]   or the things that just made you go, what the hell is this?
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.280]   It was Deja Vu with Windows.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.480]   You want to go turn on the Wi-Fi.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.960]   You've got to go through six steps to do that.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.280]   You've got to understand they're logic.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.840]   There's a home button on the machine,
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.880]   which operates differently if you're in an app or an app,
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.000]   and then if you're in an app, there's a second home button.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.760]   It's silly stuff.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.600]   Like, God, I admit it's silly, but it
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   makes me respect the artistry of Apple all the more,
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.880]   the detail-oriented work.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.360]   Again, if I started with this thing,
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.280]   what I love it, yeah, I'm sure I would.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.880]   I honestly am debating whether to return it or not,
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.400]   just because $529 is my wife gas.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.640]   You want to return it?
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.120]   Wow.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.200]   I'm debating, just because if I want to let my budget,
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   do I really want to buy the solely new bloggy camera
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.800]   they have with 360 on it?
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.000]   I want to buy the Apple thing, I think.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.840]   I'm just not want to be a little, I'm a presser.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.640]   I want to be a little banyoure's.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.000]   But I think I probably have to hold on to it
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   because I do this show and I care about things Google
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.880]   and I don't see what happens with it.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.800]   And I'm sure Gina sees a potential in it
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.800]   that I don't know how to see yet.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.640]   I just like to point out that only a professor
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.280]   would use the word banyoure's,
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.080]   but that's another matter entirely.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.320]   (laughing)
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.320]   Why did you not buy the subsidized version?
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.360]   Oh, because while they hadn't added all the money,
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.960]   it's ridiculous and I'll go back and forth.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.200]   If this thing would work on AT&T's frequency
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.080]   and I could just switch back and forth my sim,
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.640]   I'd be in some form of heaven.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.720]   If I could tether it, I'd really be in heaven.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.760]   If it tethered, that would take away
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.840]   any cost justification issues
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.080]   and I would have bought the subsidized one.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.920]   But this way I'm freer, I can go to Europe, I can use it,
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.000]   I can turn it off and not use it.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.400]   But then I'm already feeling guilty if I turn it off
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.840]   then how silly is that?
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.800]   Or because how silly is it to carry two phones?
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.680]   I'm asking this of a man who carries about 10.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.960]   Yeah, in fact I've got my Android, my Droid
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.880]   and I've got my iPhone and I can't wait
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.000]   to play with the Nexus one.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.160]   I was at a, you know, Google's not here really at CES,
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.520]   they don't have a booth.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.920]   They're here in a lot of ways.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.520]   In fact, it's interesting.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.440]   They're everywhere, you know.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.480]   They're everywhere really.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.680]   And it's interesting that that announcement
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.320]   was the day before CES.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.920]   And it's, you know, kind of like one of the things
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.080]   people are talking about in the Apple slate.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.080]   The two biggest stories at CES didn't happen in Las Vegas.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.360]   But I have to say, you know, I was at this Android event,
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.520]   there were Android developers there.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.960]   There was also an Android there.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.440]   I think it was Google, I don't know who paid,
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:03.120]   but somebody paid for data, the Android,
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.200]   from Star Trek the next generation, Brent Spiner,
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.680]   to be at this event.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.920]   And LeVar Burton.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.960]   He tweeted, who tweeted by the way,
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.840]   that there was, he got something very nice from Google.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.880]   And all I would say was that it pays to have played an Android.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.720]   Well, he got an Android phone.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.080]   In fact, Brent and LeVar were just on the show
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.400]   a couple hours ago.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.560]   And of course, they both whipped out their Nexus ones.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.000]   I asked them, what do you think?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.800]   And, you know, Hollywood stars,
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.200]   they get this crap all the time.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.720]   And, you know, they said, oh, it's cool.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.840]   But I don't think they used it at all.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.400]   I don't think they were using it as a phone.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.440]   But it's a beautiful phone though, isn't it?
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.920]   I mean, it's just a gorgeous phone.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.520]   Now, OK, we've heard Jeff, the Kermaj, and Gina, what do you think?
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.120]   Well, I mean, I'm in love with it.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.640]   And I should preface this by saying
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.280]   that I think it depends a lot on your upgrade path.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.280]   I was coming from an unlock G1 using AT&T's Edge network
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.040]   and running Android 1.6, OK?
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.160]   So I already know Android.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.120]   And I've got slow network and slow hardware.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.680]   So I get the Nexus one this week.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.200]   And I'm just over the moon.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.840]   Because I get a three, a triple upgrade.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.400]   I get network software and hardware.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.000]   So I'm in love.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.640]   I noticed all the upgrades to Android,
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.120]   because I've been using 1.6.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.600]   And I went from 1.6 to 2.1.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.560]   So I didn't have the Droid.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.240]   So I noticed a lot of new stuff in Android.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.360]   And I'm hoping that the navigation, even
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.120]   the live papers, even though they're kind of just
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.280]   a sort of CPU sucking eye candy, I still,
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.400]   I love that they make the device feel alive in your hand.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.880]   And yeah, the phone itself is flat and thin.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.360]   And I can slide it in my pocket without the keyboard.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.320]   I feel like I have my iPhone again.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.600]   It doesn't make my thighs look fat.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.560]   Does this phone make my thighs look fat?
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.280]   That's a big one.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.040]   You want to really carry a purse.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.560]   And so it goes in the pocket.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.360]   And the G1 was really chunky.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.360]   I think--
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.120]   I love the phone.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.720]   It is a spectacularly beautiful phone.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.320]   I don't think you could deny that.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.960]   It's a spectacularly beautiful phone.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.080]   And I think it is a geek phone.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.440]   Oh, no, Gina.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.880]   Uh-oh.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.520]   Are we losing our connectivity here?
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.520]   I think it's a geek phone.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.240]   I mean, I think that's kind of the point of it.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.400]   And I think, Jeff, really, that's what you're saying,
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.800]   is that it's not a user phone.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.680]   It's not an iPhone.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:27.600]   I'm going to pause until they figure out what's going on here.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.680]   It's a geek phone.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.880]   Well, it almost is.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.360]   Again, I think it's just contrast, Leo.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.760]   I think Gina's right, though, that--
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.120]   Gina, why don't you say what you said in your smarterwear
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:43.360]   post about this as a marker of humans and geek bigotry?
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.840]   Well, you know, David Poe wrote a piece this week
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.520]   about how he had done a Nexus 1 review
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.200]   and all these kind of Android fanboys, similar to kind
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.040]   of the Linux fanboys, came out and called them out
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.600]   and all this stuff and were crazy and called him names.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.320]   And I was saying how I felt the need to confess that when
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.760]   I see somebody holding an Android handset,
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.520]   I kind of make some assumptions about them,
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.280]   similar assumptions that I make about when people who
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.360]   I see using Linux.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.640]   I think this is a power geek.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.960]   This is someone who knows what they're doing.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.720]   This is someone who values open source so much
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.640]   that they're willing to jump through a few hoops to get it.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.240]   And this is someone with Android, anyway,
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.920]   I think is kind of on the cutting edge.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.120]   But really, it's the openness part.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.040]   This is a phone for people who really value openness
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.120]   and for geeks, still.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.560]   I still think that it is a phone
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.800]   and not mobile operating system for geeks.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.480]   Is that a business problem for Google then, Gina?
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.760]   You know, I think it might be.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.320]   I mean, I don't think that the phone is quite--
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.960]   it doesn't have the mainstream appeal
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.120]   that the iPhone does.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.920]   But I think that what Android does have going for it
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.280]   is this kind of counterculture appeal,
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.640]   like the underdog, the thinking different.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.480]   People who use Android phones really are kind of have
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.880]   that kind of--
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.960]   they should use that in their marketing, I think.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.280]   Do you think it's Google's goal to sell as many phones
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.120]   as Apple does?
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:08.120]   I mean, does the Nexus 1 have to be an iPhone killer?
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.880]   I don't think that's requisite for Google's
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.560]   to be successful.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.240]   I don't think so.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.040]   I don't think so.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.920]   But it's true.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.880]   Android wants to-- they want Android to be successful.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.080]   But I don't think the Nexus 1 has to be successful.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.520]   Right.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.080]   That's true.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.520]   That's true.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.440]   But the Nexus 1 is there.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.480]   I feel like Google's way of trying to say, hey,
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.880]   we can make a phone that's just as beautiful and good looking
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.760]   though or close to the iPhone.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.760]   I talked at this event.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.040]   I talked to the guy who designed this phone.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.160]   His name is Eric.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.040]   He actually designed the G1 as well,
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.440]   or worked with HTC on the G1.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.400]   And one of the things I asked him is, why even sell it
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.560]   unsubsidized?
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.960]   That's $589.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.800]   There's a lot of money.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.040]   He said, well, it's not that much money, which kind
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.600]   of surprised me.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.840]   Because it is a lot of money, not just for Penuria's professors,
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.560]   but for everybody.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.680]   And I think one of the things he said is, well, first of all,
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.960]   people understand that a phone doesn't cost nothing or $100.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.000]   It costs thousands of dollars when you add up all of the two-year
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.040]   commitment.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.680]   So they do offer the two-year commitment.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.800]   And I got the sense that this was--
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.040]   I said, so what are you doing next?
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.440]   And he said, well, the next phone.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.840]   This is just the beginning of Google's long march
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.000]   into the phone world.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.320]   And I think they're going to make phones.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.040]   This is kind of what he said for everybody.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.880]   So there's all sorts of Android phones.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.960]   This is the one for the geek.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.120]   And that's why it's being sold unbundled, I think.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.240]   My hesitation here is also that I
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.400]   wish Google had gone farther to blow up the model.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.000]   I think that's what we were talking about the last few weeks,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.800]   the hope that it was going to really change the phone industry.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:57.280]   And basically, you can buy an iPhone on tethered to the contract.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.240]   You can buy this thing without a contract.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.680]   You can spend a lot of money for both.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.600]   That's that.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.880]   If Google had done anything to have an ad-supported model,
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:09.360]   or if it had been truly portable across AT&TT mobile,
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.880]   that would have gone at least one step to breaking things up.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.000]   And they didn't.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.720]   They just didn't.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.680]   That's true.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.080]   They tried to make a big hula-bloo about opening up
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.880]   the Google phone store and doing some things so different.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.280]   But they really didn't.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.280]   I wish they had gone farther.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.560]   I wish there had been more.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.920]   And the next thing is they are biting off a lot here.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.040]   They've got to go into area--
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.400]   entire fields of business they've ever been in.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.240]   They've never been a hardware company.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.640]   They've never been a retail company.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.320]   They've never really been in the phone business beyond that
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.760]   until recently.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:49.040]   These are big shifts for a purely geek algorithmically-based
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.120]   company to go into.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.640]   And a renewed commitment to Google Checkout,
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.000]   which was interesting.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.400]   I mean, Google Checkout felt like one of those products that
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.240]   was this side thing that no one ever really used.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.480]   But this was like--
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.840]   they're serious about Checkout, which I'm very happy about
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.720]   personally, because I sell my book using Checkout.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.520]   So I'm hoping that lots of people have Checkout accounts now.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.160]   But so interesting to see that renewed commitment to that product
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.120]   and that they're putting that front and center in the store.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.280]   I saw some stories on the friend feed
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:29.000]   that there were a few people who had problems with the Checkout.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.240]   One guy, it was forced to use his old address
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.640]   for his old Gmail account or his old Checkout account.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.920]   He'd moved in the meantime.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.720]   FedEx has to try to deliver it to the old address three times
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.080]   before it'll go to the new address.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.120]   That stuff happens.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.680]   I'm not going to hold it too much against Google.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.920]   But it is funny to see that they have problems like that.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.640]   I also tried to buy the phone the first instant I could
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.360]   on my iPhone, and the Checkout wouldn't work on my iPhone.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.120]   What happened?
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.200]   I just don't think about it.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.360]   I think it's supposed to be in flash and it wouldn't work.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.040]   I love you trying to buy the Nexus One on your iPhone.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.440]   That's fantastic.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.280]   I also used Google Goggles to try to look at the Apple logo.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.000]   And it didn't recognize it.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.160]   Nice.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.080]   Nice.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.880]   So what do you think that they could have done better?
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.200]   I feel like if they launched with a few more carriers,
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.840]   like you said, if they had supported the AT&T 3G,
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.880]   truly supported AT&T 3G, which meant that iPhone owners could
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.280]   have bought the Nexus One and popped in their SIM card
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.280]   and on the same level of service.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.160]   That would have been a killer.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.000]   I don't really know why they didn't do that.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.760]   Although the price for the unlock version
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.200]   does feel high to me.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.680]   I mean, you could say the iPhone has the iPod touch.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.080]   I mean, it's not a phone, but it's essentially--
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.200]   it's an iPhone without a contract or without a speaker on it.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.360]   So it's like, you kind of want to give people the option
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.520]   to get an Android phone or Android--
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.320]   it's kind of like getting an Android device
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.400]   without having to buy into a contract.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.920]   But there's got to be a better way to do that, I think.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.760]   Yeah, I think that, again, if I could use it on AT&T,
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.640]   if I could use it to tether, that would justify.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.400]   Because I now have an AT&T laptop card.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.720]   And so if I could use my iPhone--
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:18.080]   I mean, rather my either phone, but if I could use my Nexus
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.280]   as a MyFi, that would be killer.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.240]   That would absolutely kill her.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.480]   It would justify it.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.480]   Speaking of that, I think there's software called PDANet
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.600]   that does provide tethering for Android.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.520]   I think that you have to install software actually
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.480]   on your Mac and then install the app on Android itself.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.880]   Now, I haven't tried this recently.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.320]   I looked into it a while back, a few versions back.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.160]   I used to use that on my Trio.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.120]   OK, yeah.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.760]   Yeah, so it looks like it's still around.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.040]   Yeah, it looks like it's still around.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:55.360]   And it looks like it's $30 to buy for your Mac.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.320]   Interesting.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.480]   I have not tried this, though, but it sounds like it
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.960]   has been ported to Android.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.120]   I mean, you can tether with Android for sure
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.720]   if you root the phone, but that's really--
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   But there you go again, Jimmy.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.160]   You see, I'm immortal.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.320]   You're a cute goddess.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.680]   That's where we are in life here.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.080]   Look up the mountaintop at you, and I worship you,
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.400]   but I can't be you.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.720]   Well, no, I completely agree that rooting the device
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.880]   is just a totally ridiculous thing
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.920]   to expect a person, a human to do.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.840]   I wrote my Android review and complained
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.640]   that there's no easy way to take a screenshot of the phone.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.040]   You know, on the iPhone, you press two buttons,
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.240]   and you can get a screenshot.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.000]   You can't do that on Android still.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.960]   And someone in my comment said, well, of course you can.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.080]   There's this app that does it.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.960]   So I looked at the app, and it's like, oh, the phone
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.280]   has to be rooted first, and then I can use this app.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.560]   So it's crazy.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.120]   That just doesn't count.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.880]   So what do you want it to be next?
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.760]   I mean, even though you love it, and you should,
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.720]   what do you wish it were next?
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.840]   I think that the main thing that Android needs to be
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.360]   is just a better media player.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.200]   I mean, the iPhone had all the iPod capabilities built in.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.480]   The fact that it's not obvious to a new Android user,
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.040]   how do you get music onto this thing?
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.280]   How do you manage your playlists?
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.160]   I mean, just getting some--
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.440]   It's not ironic that Google, which has more of a web presence
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.440]   Lord knows than Apple has, doesn't
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.800]   have the means to really get you the apps and the music
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.480]   and the other stuff.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.680]   It doesn't have a home that you want to come to,
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.320]   which feels like a missing piece.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.080]   But does it feel like a missing piece just because you're
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.120]   used to syncing your iPhone to iTunes?
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:26.400]   Or--
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.160]   Is it so easy?
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.560]   Well, but the thing is, this is the cool thing about Android.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.680]   You boot up the phone, you type in your credentials,
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.640]   you log into Google.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.920]   Without ever attaching the phones to your computer.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.800]   And now your contacts, calendar, and email
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.080]   are on the phone, period.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.160]   I really like that.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.320]   I think that's cool.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.440]   So the iPhone thing, where you have to dock it to your computer
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.560]   and you buy apps, you sync apps back and forth and podcasts,
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.640]   I mean, you're attached to iTunes, which I think everyone
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.240]   sort of gotten used to because we're all used to iTunes.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.440]   I am too.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.720]   But I think that the over the air--
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.680]   that putting a lot of that over the air in Android
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.640]   is actually a good thing.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.000]   But the music thing is the issue.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.040]   So you don't have to know to download Double Twist, which
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.600]   is this open source software.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.000]   And you can't play songs that you've
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.800]   bought from the iTunes store that are DRM.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.480]   I mean, there's a lot of things that you have to know or realize
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.720]   that no regular person should reasonably have to know.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.320]   So I like that a lot of the setting up the Android phone
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.040]   doesn't involve docking it to your computer at all.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.760]   I think you're right there, yes.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.200]   But I guess what I'm going to is one reaction I had when I got it
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.960]   was that this is absolutely true of both iPhone
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.520]   and Android.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.200]   And maybe it's a happy problem to have.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.960]   But to use Clay Shurkey's words in the app world,
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.320]   there's terrible filter failure.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.280]   It is just now-- there's so much choice
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.000]   that it's really impossible to know what you want.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.600]   It reminds me of the early days of blogs
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.640]   where people would always ask me, which blog should I start reading?
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.600]   And I'll say, I don't know.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.640]   What do you like?
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.140]   Right?
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:53.880]   And so same problem.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.400]   I understand that with apps.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.640]   I don't want a one size fits all thing.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.520]   And there are a few apps--
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.360]   Clay, in fact, responded to my tweet saying,
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.680]   I think it was Apify is an effort to soon to do that.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.800]   But it's a problem.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.200]   And it just strikes me 10% harder to try
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.960]   to navigate that abundance on the phone than on the web.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.840]   That's true.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.000]   Yeah, that's definitely true.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   So did you feel like-- so you're talking about the Android market.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.240]   When you go into the Android market,
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.040]   you were like not sure how to get the good stuff, where to go,
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.600]   what to search for, that kind of thing.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.620]   Right.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.720]   You get the few first most popular in certain areas like news
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.040]   and say, OK, I got it.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.960]   And I didn't find Tweety, so I put in C's,
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.680]   making OK, I got a Twitter client now, which, by the way,
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.600]   a little weekly mirror.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.520]   You make the type so small, I felt like I was 90 years old.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.480]   But look at Pesta.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:53.240]   But I think that that's an issue to make people happier.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.560]   One way to look at this too is if you compare this
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.040]   to a Windows phone, it's heaven.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:21:59.540]   Right?
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.200]   You've arrived at the land of logic.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:02.720]   Right.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:07.640]   And to some extent, I think the Nokia OS too, as well,
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.960]   rather, that this is a huge leap for anybody.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.520]   If you're not an iPhone person, Android
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.560]   is certainly hands down the second best OS.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.320]   Is there a fight in words to you?
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.760]   Yeah, no, no, I'm with you.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.600]   I'm with you on that.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.600]   I am.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.560]   You know, I like Android because I can do things on it
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.840]   that I just can't do on the iPhone.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.840]   And there are probably things that don't matter
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.040]   to normal people.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.520]   But for instance, this is always my example.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.160]   The one thing that I do on my phone the most
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.400]   is I text my spouse, right?
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.000]   I text my wife.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   So I want to just be able to tap one thing
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.960]   and have a compose, but a text area come up.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.200]   So I can just type and go.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.680]   And on the iPhone, you can do--
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.920]   I think you can do shortcuts to a contact, right?
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.720]   But then you have to tap to say, I want a text,
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.360]   and you choose the phone number or whatever.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.240]   So on Android, I can have a direct shortcut to that.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.800]   On Android, I can create folders on my home screens.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.080]   I can't do that on the iPhone.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.080]   I can arrange my icons into folders.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.360]   You can get widgets on the on home screen,
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.720]   like the Google search box.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.960]   But I think the iPhone has a search box.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.320]   But Android also has that news widget, which
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.080]   is pretty cool and that power control.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.760]   These things are kind of buried a little deep.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.760]   That's the thing.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.760]   The iPhone just feels flat.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.760]   That's the weird way Google earned that.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.760]   Right.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.760]   We're going over that stuff.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.760]   This is the issue, right?
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.240]   So the initial experience with the iPhone
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.960]   is actually quite good and compelling,
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.880]   and you get it right away.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.800]   The initial experience with Android is not.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.520]   It's confusing.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.880]   And you don't know where this stuff is.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.800]   You don't know that you tap and hold the home screen
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.760]   to get a pop-up dial.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.080]   I mean, it's one of these things that you just don't know
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.040]   unless you really play with it.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.440]   I appreciate software that you kind of have to discover
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.320]   and that has these little things that you find here and there.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.320]   But like that--
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.320]   Do you like a stick shift car?
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.760]   Right, because I'm crazy, right?
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.240]   Because I like that kind of thing.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.240]   That's what I do.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.000]   I think the trick is to come up with the product that
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.840]   does both.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.760]   It has the initial compelling experience,
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.080]   also has layers of discoverability in it.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.080]   You know?
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.240]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.280]   And it's also an issue of control, isn't it?
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.840]   In all Apple products, you are out of control.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.680]   You put yourself in the hands of the Lord of Jobs
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.840]   and off you go.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.320]   Whereas in every other area of technology--
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.720]   and I've got a little bit of this left-stool in my jeans--
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.960]   yeah, you have this chance to do something.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.280]   Then the next trick is to make it easy enough for anybody
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.360]   to do it so you just don't waste time on it.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:30.880]   Right.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.560]   I hate having to search through real logic to find something.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.680]   Yes, I totally agree with you.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.840]   I know you get that for sure.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.960]   I'm back to stand up for the Google Nexus 1.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.200]   You're a bad man, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.160]   You're a bad man.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.720]   Stop ganging up on us.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.520]   No, I have to say, it's so elegant, so beautiful.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.120]   I like the Android operating system.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.720]   And one thing we're seeing at CES is a lot of devices
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.880]   with the Android operating system.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.360]   So I'm going to talk a little bit about that.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.120]   And we'll also talk about the problem with the name Nexus 1.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.120]   Apparently, Philip K. Dick's family is very unhappy.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.200]   That's in just a minute as we continue with Jeff Jarvis
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:14.800]   from buzzmachine.com, Gina Trapani from smarterware.org
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:20.520]   And me from Las Vegas on the 75th birthday of Elvis Presley.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.400]   Perfectly appropriate.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.800]   And we're going to do that in just a second.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.080]   But first, I want to mention my friends at Sync.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.400]   Ford made some big announcements here.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.680]   In fact, we talked to the CEO of Ford, Alan Malali,
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.280]   and the guy behind connectivity services at Sync.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.680]   And what really is happening with Ford Sync
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.080]   is they're putting all the connectivity you're
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.480]   used to at home into their Ford cars,
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.960]   and their Lincoln's, and their Mercury's.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.840]   And it's very, very exciting.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.360]   In this 2011 model year, later this calendar year,
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.960]   almost all the vehicles Ford sells will have Sync.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.360]   Or something like that.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.960]   Now they're calling it my Ford and my Ford Touch.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.760]   They'll be able to get this.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.240]   I know you're going to be excited about this.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.760]   Listen to Pandora.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.760]   Their music.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.520]   Absolutely create your own radio station.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.520]   Stitcher.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.560]   You're going to be able to tweet.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.640]   You'll be able to surf the internet when you're not driving,
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.480]   by the way, because safety is paramount.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.720]   But the whole idea of Sync is you're
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.320]   going to keep your hands on the wheel,
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.480]   your eyes on the road, and yet be able to interact
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.040]   with your whole life.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.720]   I love it, and I know you're going to love it.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.160]   And the best way to find out more about it
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.240]   is go to the website, syncmyride.com,
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.680]   syncmyride.com, or go to a Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.080]   dealer and say, I don't care about the car.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.440]   I just want to test drive the Sync.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.200]   I guess you have the car comes with it.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.240]   Think of it that way.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.880]   I just saw a statistic that 32% of the people who
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.920]   are buying new Ford vehicles are buying them because of Sync.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.520]   That's how important these features are.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.440]   Take a look, syncmyride.com.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.520]   I thought that was an interesting statistic, Jeff,
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:52.360]   because it shows that how important connectivity, I think,
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.920]   is to people.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.400]   Well, the announcement this week--
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.680]   not to extend the commercial, but the announcement this week
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.720]   about Twitter and Sync your ride is just really, I think,
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   wonderful.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.160]   Bringing the feed you had back into your mobile experience.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.160]   Exactly.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.760]   I mean, the New York Times raised the absolutely legitimate
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.840]   issue of talking about distracted drivers.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.640]   Now we've got people tweeting while they're driving.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.640]   And that's going to be an issue, I think.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.120]   But I think it's an issue that we're
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.200]   going to deal with whether or not you have Ford Sync.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.800]   I mean, that's what people are doing.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.000]   It's better than having your BlackBerry--
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.840]   the BlackBerry-- you know how people drive with their BlackBerry?
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.920]   I don't know what you call it.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.280]   The BlackBerry stretch where you've got your hands on the wheel
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.680]   and you're using your thumbs.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.600]   And you prop the BlackBerry against the steering wheel
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.080]   and the type, and I'm ashamed--
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.400]   Let's pick up the name for this right now.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.120]   How about calling that suicide surfing?
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.600]   Yeah, suicide surfing.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.920]   I love it.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.640]   Jeff, ever the word Smith.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.200]   And I confess to having done it.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.360]   So I think that this is an issue regardless
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.840]   of whether you've got a vehicle that--
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.240]   Don't you think the Twitter is going to become, at some level,
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.800]   audio and probably through Google?
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.160]   And that's why Google, again, wants to be so damn smart
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.440]   about understanding our spoken word?
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.320]   Well, what's really-- yeah, I agree with you 100%.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.960]   What's really interesting is the speech recognition and sync.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.240]   I talked to the guys at Nuance who do Dragon Naturally Speaking.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.600]   That's who's doing the speech recognition and sync.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.080]   And the reason that they didn't have dictation of Twitter--
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.320]   and they may still not have that for some time to come--
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.600]   is there's no really easy way to edit it if you're driving.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.440]   So it screws up.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:31.320]   Another boring post after another boring post, right?
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.080]   You really-- so there are perhaps some real limitations
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:35.720]   to this.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.520]   But it just shows you how connected we are now and how--
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.040]   Certainly as input.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.400]   It does read.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.040]   It does read.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.560]   I had a amazing experience the other night.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.560]   I was picking up my car.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.480]   Sorry, it's not a Ford.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.920]   It's a many-year-old Toyota.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.120]   Coming back on an interstate in New Jersey and Bingo,
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.720]   as soon as I got off the ramp, absolutely stopped.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.880]   So I was OK if I tweeted.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.000]   And I turned on this horrible local radio.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.400]   Nothing.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.120]   I turn on everywhere.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:01.840]   Isn't that awful?
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.120]   Local radio is dead.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:04.680]   It's awful.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.560]   So then I go, of course, to Twitter.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.080]   And I search for 287, the interstate.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:09.880]   Bingo.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.800]   Just saw a huge explosion.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.360]   This happened.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.040]   That's happening.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:13.800]   We're forming each other.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.400]   It was an instant social network on the interstate.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.520]   I also discovered some other automated feeds
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.040]   for giving me stock.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.400]   So I can well imagine that I could have a system where,
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:28.440]   A, I could have input into that saying 287 is porked.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.800]   And I could also get output of saying, just give me
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.200]   any updates on 287.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.080]   Yeah, we're just not willing to get disconnected.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.640]   And the value is so apparent of full time, always on connections
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.640]   that companies like Ford and all the companies now.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.120]   Kia is also here with Microsoft Auto built in.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.040]   I mean, everybody's going to do this because we just
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.120]   don't want to be disconnected.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.880]   And I think the phone, getting us back to the Nexus 1,
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.080]   really is the centerpiece of our digital life.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.760]   So let me ask you this, Jeff, the on-screen keyboard
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.520]   in the Nexus 1.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.320]   You can live with that.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.440]   You're an iPhone.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.320]   Here's your name.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:01.840]   I can.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.440]   And somebody held up, somebody who has the droid held it up
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.360]   against the Nexus 1.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.760]   And it really looked like it was military issue
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.040]   versus civilian issue.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.080]   Yes.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:16.600]   It's the Terminator phone versus, I don't know, Brigitte Bardot.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.720]   I love the--
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.720]   I love the--
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.160]   You've been in Vegas too long.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.120]   Oh, I could have been much worse, believe me.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.520]   I love the predictive text on Android.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.840]   I think it's really good.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.280]   Yeah, the predictive text is great.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.160]   What do you think about the voice transcription?
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.760]   I mean, I really like the idea.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.680]   You have to really enunciate and be in a quiet place.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.920]   And I can see myself using it.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.360]   But I can't do that.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.560]   No, I know.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.440]   But I think you're right.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.600]   I don't think it's quite there yet.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.240]   But it's getting there.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.160]   And I think--
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.160]   well, so I asked Nuance.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.240]   I said, doesn't Google have a huge advantage in voice
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.760]   recognition because of Google 411?
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.000]   And Nuance said, why do you think we have an iPhone
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.640]   application called Dragon Dictate?
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.680]   They have an application on the iPhone you dictate to.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.080]   It doesn't do the recognition on the phone.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:06.080]   It sends it to their servers where they collect the samples.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:06.960]   They're doing the same thing.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.320]   They realize what an advantage Google has with Google 411.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.920]   And they're going to do the same thing.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.320]   Well, you know, it makes me wonder, just
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.800]   to talk about that, where shouldn't that
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.800]   be a great open source, crowd sourced project?
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   Shouldn't there be the audio?
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:24.720]   I think I said I'm going on the board of the reading
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.760]   for the blind and dyslexic and had suggested to them
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:32.600]   that they should do an audio Wikipedia version, right?
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.560]   What if you turn it around and do the Wikipedia model for audio?
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:40.760]   What if we made audio recognition and open sourced
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:45.280]   project to the people and make that able for lots of developers
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.760]   to then use?
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.000]   That'd be cool.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.040]   It would be cool.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.880]   I don't know if you can group so you can crowd source
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.800]   that kind of development.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.800]   Maybe you can.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.240]   How many samples of the word "l'porte" do you need?
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.240]   It was 15.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:31:59.920]   For you to get it right.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.760]   No, that's a good point.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.160]   So you're saying, have everybody go to a page
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.880]   and record the word that's on the page,
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.440]   just like recapture is capturing--
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:08.880]   Exactly.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.840]   Oh, that's an interesting idea.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.360]   Yeah, you could do that.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.480]   Maybe you've started something here.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.880]   You could say you need this many samples against this many,
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.720]   you know, speaking types, excluding people who
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.280]   talk to them fast like me.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.240]   And--
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.080]   And Gina.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:23.920]   Got there.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.920]   It was also fast talkers.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.200]   I love being in the left of the tones.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.960]   I have to say that the Nexus 1 name, maybe in jeopardy,
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.000]   this is bizarre.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.160]   If you ever read the book, or you know,
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.920]   you actually would have seen it in the movie as well,
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:43.920]   "Blade Runner," or the Philip K. Dick novel,
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.480]   "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.040]   You may remember that the robots, the Androids in there,
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.880]   were Nexus models and the Nexus 6 model.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.920]   And I guess Philip K. Dick's family said, hey,
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.040]   we thought of that first.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.160]   Philip caught of that first.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.880]   And they're-- are they suing over the name Nexus?
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:00.880]   They've--
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.000]   They're threatening to.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.600]   That's ridiculous.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.760]   It's kind of pathetic, because it really
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.920]   is a tribute to them.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:05.920]   Android.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.280]   Get it?
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.960]   Android, Nexus.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.880]   And the story that's on the "Friend Feed"
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.120]   makes a point that it's not as if they own that name in all
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:15.800]   domains.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.720]   No.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.600]   It's kind of ridiculous.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.680]   Maybe they saw--
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.640]   That Lucas spent-- you know, they licensed
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.600]   droid from Lucas, so maybe they'll license Nexus from us.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.600]   A little grab.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:32.960]   There's all kind of stupidity going on in terms of control,
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.360]   not to go too far afield off this,
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.320]   but just a quick mention that News International News
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:42.440]   Corp now has forbidden an aggregator in the UK
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.640]   from linking to them.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.960]   And this aggregator has started a campaign under the URL
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.960]   right to link.org to numeral link.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.720]   News now has saying that the link is a right of ours.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.040]   Can't tell me not to link to you.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:56.800]   That's crazy.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.240]   Can't tell me not to mention the word Nexus.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.160]   Well, we've seen this before with deep linking,
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.680]   but they're actually saying you can't link in any way to us.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.680]   It's not just deep linking.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.440]   Well, you see this kid's two parts, right?
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.960]   You can't scrape, which is what robots' text is all about.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.680]   But then again, if you go to the next step on this,
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.840]   it occurs to me what if the government says at some point
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.600]   you can't scrape our data?
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.360]   If it's in public, it's in public.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:19.680]   Right.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.120]   And I should be able to read it and send to it
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.840]   in any form I choose with any device I choose.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.680]   That's what I'm going to say.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.440]   This is a question for our law show,
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.920]   but I do believe this is not the first time
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.440]   these kinds of lawsuits have been deep linking lawsuits.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.640]   They've been linking lawsuits.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.240]   And people have attempted to block this.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.360]   And I'm pretty sure they've been attempted to block scraping
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.120]   as well.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.960]   I don't know what the results of those are,
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.960]   but I have a feeling they can't have been successful
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.000]   or the internet wouldn't be working anymore.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.640]   Precisely.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.520]   Well, not just the internet, but neither would democracy.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.080]   Fairly.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.480]   Journalism that quotes everybody.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.960]   Journalism, yeah.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:56.760]   It's information.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.600]   Right.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.160]   And the fact that a journalistic organization
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.160]   is doing this is appalling.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.880]   There was also a UK organization called the NLI,
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.360]   the Newspaper Licenses Association.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.120]   It was trying to charge companies for linking to newspapers.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.280]   You published it.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.160]   That's ridiculous.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:11.840]   That's absurd.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.560]   You published it.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:14.760]   Of course we can link to it.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.120]   If you don't publish it, we won't link to it.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:22.120]   So Philip K. Dick's family and Rupert Murdoch
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.160]   and the Associated Press and the NLI,
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.120]   all go off in a room together and close yourself off
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:26.840]   from the whole world.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.760]   And you'll be happy.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.120]   Put them all in the same bundle.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.280]   Thank you for letting me say that.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.560]   All right.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.200]   I'm going to say to you, Jeff, you
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.000]   should give your Nexus one a week.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.360]   You should put the iPhone away and use your Nexus
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.400]   for a while and give it a shot.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.640]   Because I think you're going to get used to it.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.320]   I'm going to.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.600]   I think you're going to get used to it.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.920]   By the way, if I do return it, it's a $45 restocking fee.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.720]   I think that's a bit--
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.120]   Oh, that's not good.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.120]   I saw your tweet about that.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.480]   That kind of sucks.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.640]   That's ridiculous.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.360]   That's not very googly, folks.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.720]   And that's, by the way, not what normally the phone companies do.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.200]   If you go to T-Mobile and you sign up and buy a phone
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.840]   and in two weeks you say, you know, it doesn't work very well,
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.520]   they take it back.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.760]   You have no-- there's no fee.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.840]   There's no charge.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.520]   That's, I guess, one of the downsides
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:18.480]   you're buying directly from Google, the retailer.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.120]   Not such a good retailer, apparently.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.760]   In fact, there's articles already saying that, you know,
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.360]   support is nonexistent.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:30.280]   You know, a customer, Martin Thorberg,
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.360]   says, I'm paying full price for an unlocked phone.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.920]   But I can't get Google to ship to my new address.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:41.080]   It'll only ship to my old Google account address.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.880]   And FedEx and Google would neither--
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.640]   we both wouldn't change it.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.720]   They say you can't cancel the order in automated responses.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:54.080]   There's no one home, just androids.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.840]   Yeah, they need to iron out the wrinkles
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.760]   in the whole-- the new retailer gig, for sure.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.080]   Also, bugs with the 2.1 software.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.760]   Photos that can't be deleted.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.400]   Inadequate 3G service.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.800]   Of course, T-Mobile, people are going
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.360]   to find does not have the kind of coverage
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:14.280]   they might be used to with Verizon, even AT&T.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.160]   Here's an example from the Google forums.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.200]   I love my Nexus phone.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.280]   Unfortunately, it can only perform as well as the network.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.840]   It runs on.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.080]   I'm here in Manhattan.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.200]   My iPhone AT&T was bad in terms of drop calls and slow data.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.520]   But the Nexus is even worse.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.800]   It makes my iPhone look like the golden choice again.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.720]   Let's just get it over with.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.320]   Where do I send the Nexus to return it?
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.920]   And how long does it take to get my money back?
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.400]   Oh, you know.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:37.920]   Cell phone users.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.920]   This is bound to happen.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.920]   And as some people have known for fetching a lot,
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.040]   I get that.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.880]   But it does say that there's an expectation that's
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.560]   going to go on to Google.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.080]   We were talking two weeks ago about whether or not
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:54.120]   the media moves against Google are true of the populace.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.480]   And Eugene has said, well, I don't think so.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.600]   Among developers are real people.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.560]   And I agree.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:02.760]   But if enough consumers see Google as a Dell hell brand,
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.720]   that's going to have an impact on the value of the whole damn
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.480]   company.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.920]   Can you go to a T-Mobile store and look at or play with a Nexus
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.120]   1?
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.520]   No, you can only buy it via Google, right?
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.720]   And then go to the T-Mobile store online, Leo.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.800]   Just think people for a few seconds, my German friends.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.160]   They can see that you go.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.280]   People are going to be buying this thing like crazy.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.480]   I then want to go to the T-Mobile store.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.400]   It should have said on the home page, hey,
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.880]   new Nexus 1 owner.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.960]   Aren't you cool?
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.840]   Here's what we have to offer you.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.360]   Nothing.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.040]   Nothing.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.720]   I can't-- the plans are confusing as hell.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.680]   They're flashed up like crazy.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.600]   [SIGHS]
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.280]   But I can bet that's not true.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.840]   That also should have been better executed for sure.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.000]   PC Magazine, in a teardown, looking at the parts--
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.360]   actually, they're republishing the iSupply teardown.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.560]   iSupply does this every time a new hot gadget comes out.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.280]   They tear it down.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.240]   They add up the cost of all the parts.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.760]   And they come up with a cost of manufacture.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.720]   In this case, in fact, they announced it here
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.760]   at the Consumer Electronics Show.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.000]   They say when you tear it all down,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.360]   the phone you buy for $179 with a two-year contract or $529
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.760]   without is about $175 to manufacture.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:15.760]   Snap.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.120]   Aw.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.960]   That's actually pretty expensive.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.560]   That's expensive.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.120]   That's a lot.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:19.640]   That's a lot.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.160]   That's a lot for a phone.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.120]   Snap Dragon Processor, which is a very fast processor.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.000]   It's got an OLED screen, very expensive screen.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.320]   I mean, they've really-- in some ways, they--
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.160]   and this doesn't surprise me.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.000]   They built a Cadillac here.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.400]   Unibody design, kind of like the Apple Notebooks.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:47.040]   It's a single metallic shell that everything is embedded in.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:51.080]   Dual microphone that cancels background noise using
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.800]   an additional voice processor chip.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.320]   Now, that's expensive from Audience Semi-conductor.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.560]   The Droid does have a noise cancellation feature,
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.160]   but this is the first one with the Audience Semi-conductor.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:05.120]   There are 17 components within the Nexus 1.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.560]   And the most expensive is a Snapdragon at $30.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.880]   That's 20% of the cost.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:13.160]   It's a 1 gigahertz Snap Dragon, by the way.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.280]   And it's been seen in other phones as well,
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.040]   but it's a very fast processor.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.280]   It's one of the reasons you could do 720p video on it.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.880]   The OLED display $23.50.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:29.040]   And according to iSupply, the only the second phone
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.680]   to have a built-in OLED display.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.960]   And it's the biggest OLED display on the market.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.880]   4 gigabytes of memory and another $20.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.160]   This is a pricey phone.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.360]   You're buying a fancy phone.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.800]   I hope this means that this phone will make it through at least
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.520]   a couple more versions of Android.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.720]   I'm hoping to make it to Android 4.0 with this phone.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.400]   I think you can.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.200]   I think you will.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.360]   I was saying to a friend of mine who was sad about not being
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.200]   able to get the Nexus 1 because of budget,
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.560]   that I have a precious few weeks of being
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.780]   able to gloat about having the best thing on the market
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:04.680]   because surely something new will be out very, very soon.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:10.720]   Well, I think they made it very clear that this is not--
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.800]   and again, this is what I got from my--
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:17.640]   talking to the developer-- that this is not Google's only
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.560]   Android phone and that they really--
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.040]   and it's not the only Android phone you'll
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.720]   see from any manufacturer.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.560]   That may be nervous.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.360]   I grew up with Jim.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.160]   That may be nervous that, oh my god,
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.000]   it's the Apple problem.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:29.480]   Right.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:33.400]   Here comes one device and then it gets better in a short time.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.680]   You get mad at Apple.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.680]   I don't want to Google--
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.000]   I mean, I don't want to Google to hold back on some brilliant
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:38.800]   idea.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.720]   But if they already have the laboratory, something better
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:41.880]   than this--
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.520]   Well, in a way, it's the opposite of the Apple problem
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:47.080]   because at least Apple's the only company that makes its
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.040]   hardware.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.480]   It's much more like a PC in the sense--
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.720]   Google's more like Microsoft here,
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.920]   but making a reference platform as well as giving this
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.120]   operating system to a lot of other people so that they can
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.480]   make the hardware.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.520]   But I think in the long run, that's a better model.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.200]   I mean, look at the variety and choice that you have in the
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.040]   PC world compared to what you have in the Mac world.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.080]   And I think in the long run, that's a more open and a better
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:12.400]   model, although Apple does get some benefit by controlling
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.440]   everything so tightly.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.480]   Obviously, Google doesn't want to do that.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.600]   It's really clear that they're just making a reference here.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.880]   This is what we think you should do or could do.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.640]   I bet they put everything in here that they've got.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.040]   I'm sure that they did.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.080]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.400]   How many people have you heard who've said--
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.880]   Jake's son, Jake, is one of these that he'd rather wait
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.520]   for the Verizon version?
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.760]   Yes.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.320]   And that's not long--
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.360]   far from now, apparently.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.400]   Sometimes this quarter.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.000]   Yeah, the spring.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.200]   I think it's a smart move.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:45.720]   I mean, for T-Mobile, isn't the best network out there.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.800]   In fact, I can't get a location signal from my home.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.560]   So I actually considered maybe this T-Mobile choice wasn't
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.920]   the best one.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.280]   So now that the Verizon version, though, is going to be
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.800]   the CDMA version, right?
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.920]   It's not going to be--
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:58.320]   Yes.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.320]   So there's going to be a GSM version and a CDMA version.
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.760]   Remember that this Qualcomm chip said,
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.400]   Qualcomm is a big CDMA company.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.920]   So I don't think that's a problem at all.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.040]   In fact, that might be the kind of the natural thing
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.000]   for it to be.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.120]   But it's a different device.
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.600]   I mean, so consumers have to understand.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.160]   Do you think most consumers understand
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.160]   the difference between GSM and CDMA?
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.480]   Well, no, I think they do.
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:20.800]   No.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.320]   I think they do.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.000]   I mean, I don't think they know maybe all the details.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.240]   But I think that they know that there's something
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.440]   fundamentally different from a phone design for the Verizon
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.320]   network and the T-Mobile network.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.480]   And at what the very least they know is you get a phone
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.720]   to go with your cell phone company.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.960]   Although, again, this was an interesting conversation
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.560]   with the Google folks.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.120]   They said they didn't like that.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.040]   They said, in the past--
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:41.960]   which is the present.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.640]   It's just that Google lives in the future--
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.240]   in the past, before you could buy a phone,
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.280]   the first question you'd ask is, well, who's your carrier?
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.640]   You can only buy this phone, this phone, or this phone,
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.080]   if it's Verizon.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.000]   And I think people know that.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.440]   I think their goal is to change that and to make it possible.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.560]   They were very clear with me.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.680]   We do not want the Nexus One to be a T-Mobile phone.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.600]   We want the Nexus One to be at every carrier phone.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.480]   But the CDMA GSM issue, if they're
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.520]   truly trying to dip the couple, the phones from the carriers,
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.840]   then suddenly it's on the consumer
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:17.320]   to understand, I need a CDMA phone if I want Verizon,
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.320]   but I want a GSM phone if I want T-Mobile.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.520]   I think that was clear.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.440]   Wasn't that clear when you--
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.280]   --there's two different answers.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.360]   When you ordered, it went there and said,
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.360]   what network you want to run on?
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:25.800]   Right.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.000]   You just couldn't select Verizon.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   But I think that's pretty--
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.200]   I don't think that's so complicated.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.520]   What network do you want to run on?
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.280]   Well, let's see.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.480]   I'd like to have a contract with Verizon.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.480]   Right.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.320]   But if we're trying to get to a point where there isn't
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.760]   a contract, where I say, I want a phone and whatever
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.840]   SIM I have laying around, I want to be able to pop it in.
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.240]   I mean, maybe I'm--
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.080]   Well, that's GSM.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.320]   --you just have to increase the thing.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.000]   That's GSM.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.880]   But I mean, did you imagine it working like Europe,
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.080]   where you can just get a pay as you go SIM, walk into a corner
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.440]   store, and get a card, throw some money on it,
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.600]   put it in your phone and it works?
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.320]   Like that?
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.120]   You can't--
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.120]   You can't put P-Mobile on this phone now,
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.280]   which is why I bought the unlock.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:58.920]   Right.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.520]   I am the same in Europe.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.160]   But the irony of this is, Gina, why I read one story.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.720]   I didn't put it in the feed, so I can't remember where.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:10.680]   That said that when the next one comes to Europe,
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:15.240]   it's going to be the American model you're stuck with the vendor.
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.600]   That's a surprise.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.320]   That's funny.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.000]   That's going to cause a storm over there.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.760]   But here's what I fear.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.520]   It won't go fear.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.360]   It's today.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.120]   Right now today, I want to have a MyFi.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.720]   I want to have my phone.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.840]   I want to have probably a car that has a cell connection.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:35.280]   I want to have the tablet or whatever the heck it is from Apple.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:38.080]   I'm not going to have four or five.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.040]   I'm not going to be able to port.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.280]   I'm not going to have four or five separate phone bills coming in.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.320]   My wife will divorce me.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:44.640]   I just don't show them to my wife.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.440]   That's the key.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:51.080]   And as long as we're talking, can I pay some bills right now?
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.800]   Let's talk about GoToMean.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.040]   The great folks at Citrix told me, you know, you don't have to go to CES.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.120]   You could just do the show via GoToMean.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.080]   That's the idea, right?
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.680]   Is it do more, travel less with GoToMean?
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:06.000]   GoToMean is that great online meeting software from the folks at Citrix.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.360]   128-bit encrypted, so it's secure 24/7 support.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.080]   So you always have the help you need.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:13.240]   And by the way, about as easy to install as you can get.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.680]   In fact, I want you to try it right now.
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.880]   Go to gotomeeting.com/twig.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.600]   Go to meeting.com/twig.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:23.200]   And you could try 30 days free of GoToMean.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:29.280]   Unlimited meetings, built-in voiceover, internet, built-in teleconferencing, all free.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:34.040]   The cost for the whole bundle, just $49 a month, that's a heck of a lot cheaper than one trip
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.040]   to Vegas.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.400]   And I'll tell you, it's a lot more effective, a lot more engaging.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   I want you to give it a try.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.120]   They've supported us, but they brought us down here, by the way.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.960]   We thank them for their support.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.240]   And we encourage you to give it a try.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.560]   GoToMean.com/twig.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:51.320]   The best way to have your online meetings.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.440]   So now, see, now I can get another phone.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.200]   Let's see, what should I pick?
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.200]   It's funny, there are--
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:01.280]   I-- there's Julio carrying a purse.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.280]   Phone rings, you hit five different pockets.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:05.280]   It's true.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.680]   Then your purse, then your briefcase, trying to figure out which one is ringing.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.000]   Well, thank goodness for Google Voice.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.440]   I only give it out that Google Voice number, so they all ring at the same time.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.880]   It's like being a Swiss clock shop at noon.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.480]   It's very disconcerting.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.480]   It's like a Swiss cow.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.840]   Everyone can hear you coming.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.600]   [SINGING]
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:26.240]   Well, you know, speaking of Google Voice, it was really easy for me to just buy a new
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.240]   plan.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.920]   My old plan was kind of ending anyway.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.800]   But because I had Google Voice, I had all my--
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.920]   I logged in, and I had all my voicemail, and all my text messages on my phone.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.520]   My phone number didn't change.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:41.360]   I didn't have to tell any of my friends, like, hey, I got a new phone.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.200]   Now, somebody who moved from--
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:47.760]   a Droid phone told me it also picks up your wallpaper and stuff.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.880]   So Google's paying attention.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.240]   Now, that's actually a little scary.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.280]   They're paying attention to how you could figure your phone.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.640]   And when you add a new Android phone, it says, oh, well, we'll just configure it exactly
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:56.640]   the same.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.800]   Oh, interesting.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:47:59.800]   That's true.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.800]   I haven't confirmed it.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:01.800]   That's a little scary.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.960]   There's an option to back up your phone settings.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:05.960]   That is true.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:06.960]   And I wondered what that was.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.960]   I didn't know what that meant.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.040]   But now that makes sense.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:13.080]   So it saves your-- probably saves your wallpaper and your bookmark.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.840]   So I imagine that the bookmark--
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.760]   Just like dare I say it, Apple.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:18.760]   That's true.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.760]   Without the overhead of iTunes.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.000]   I mean, iTunes does that.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.320]   But that's kind of a negative.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.160]   It's on that PC.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.440]   I like the idea of Google keeping all my data.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.360]   But I wonder if it's going to scare people as it did me at first.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.720]   What else are they keeping track of?
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.200]   Right.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.480]   Right.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.320]   There's also a very tight Facebook integration on the--
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.400]   Oh, really?
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.080]   The Nexus One.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.480]   So the Facebook application comes pre-installed as does Google Voice.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:47.960]   But so the Facebook application becomes pre-installed.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.520]   And I don't use Facebook very much.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.480]   But I logged in just to check it out.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:55.960]   And it can sync all your contacts with--
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.880]   it can grab your Facebook photos and their statuses.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.320]   So if I tap a contact to call that person,
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.480]   I can see their latest Facebook status
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.200]   and their photo from Facebook.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.360]   And in the contacts application, which is pretty cool.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:12.000]   And you can also put a Facebook phone book on your home screen.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.880]   So you can tap a folder and see all your Facebook contacts
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:18.880]   and call one of them based on-- so Facebook essentially
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:22.720]   becomes your cloud-based phone book, which is really--
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.040]   I'm flashing on the idea that next Facebook
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.720]   is going to have the Facebook phone.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.400]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.360]   Powered by Google.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:33.800]   There was another story at the party
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:34.560]   that I was very shocked.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.440]   Chris Messina just took a job at Google.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:41.040]   Chris is the open source OAuth advocate.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.720]   He was working for a while for Firefox, supporting that.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:49.480]   And in fact, had worked with Facebook to open Facebook
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.080]   a little bit.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:53.160]   And so he's really been kind of an independent guy helping
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.720]   other people.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:59.120]   Did it say what his job is going to be at Google?
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:02.840]   He's a-- I saw I was with Dave Weiner for breakfast this week.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.920]   And he said the machine is going to be an evangelist for something.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.320]   Well, that's Chris's job, really.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.760]   He is an evangelist.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:16.400]   But if what Facebook is doing with Google
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.720]   and what Google's doing with Facebook,
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.520]   it would make sense to have somebody like Chris Messina
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:25.240]   involved because of his work in Open ID and OAuth.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.600]   It would make a lot of sense for them
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.920]   to hire somebody like this who's respected in the community,
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.320]   who's worked with both companies,
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.080]   maybe to bridge that gap.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:37.920]   His job is technically called Open Web Advocate,
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.280]   which is what he's been all along as an advocate of the Open
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.080]   Web.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.280]   But from Google's point of view, maybe the Open Web
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.760]   means interoperability, maybe it means OAuth.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.720]   It's interesting.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:54.520]   He was at Vidup, which is the Open ID company.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:59.240]   No, what I was talking to Dave for breakfast this week,
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.640]   two things came together.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.640]   It made my mind.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.520]   In the discussion, we've been having about the desire
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.880]   to back up all your stuff in a place that's safe for you,
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.280]   whether that's in a vendor you trust
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.960]   or whether that's on your own machine,
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.280]   and to do that across platforms and the idea
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.360]   of the data liberation front.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.320]   Dave was also talking about the idea of keeping things
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.640]   for a long time.
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.000]   His late father as a web presence.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.760]   And it just hit me that the two really become together.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.160]   You want to know that your stuff,
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.880]   that the representation of you online and the things you use
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:32.960]   while you're here to use them, are all safe somewhere.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.320]   And that's a key definition of what an Open Web means, I think.
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:39.520]   >> Messina in his blog said that he kind of put out
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:42.000]   feelers saying he wanted to work for a big company.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.720]   He thought it would be fun to work for Google,
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:46.360]   but was told well, Google pretty much only hires engineers,
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.680]   which is for the most part true.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.440]   They don't really hire evangelists per se.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.560]   So he said he kind of gave up on it.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.240]   He went in for an interview and two weeks later,
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.560]   they made me a great offer, letting me do what I was already
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.400]   doing.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.920]   Jesus, two weeks I thought it took three months of going
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.120]   through the gauntlet to get a job.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.960]   >> And normally you have many, many callbacks,
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.760]   many interviews.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:10.040]   It is the running, the gauntlet is exactly what the
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.880]   experience is, at least according to the people I've talked
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:15.960]   to, tried to get jobs at Google, it's hard.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.720]   So congratulations to Christmasina, I think that's
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.520]   interesting, we'll try to get them on the show if they'll let
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:20.960]   him.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:21.760]   >> Yeah, that would be great.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:22.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:22.880]   >> That would be wonderful.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.960]   >> Yeah, that would be wonderful.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.320]   >> Very nice guy.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.400]   And I think a good move for Google.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.560]   So let me tell you in just a second about some of the
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:33.320]   Android devices I saw, including one that could be a game
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.480]   changer in the ebook field.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.680]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.480]   You're listening to this week in Google with Jeff
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:40.880]   Jarvis, Gina Tarpani and me.
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:47.080]   I'm Leo LaPorte, live from CES and brought to you by our
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.560]   trip to CES, brought to you by, as I mentioned, Ford and
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.000]   Citrix.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.240]   And one more sponsor, audible.com, the great audio
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:53.800]   book source.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:57.520]   I listen to audio books all the time from audible.
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.400]   When I flew down here, I was listening.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:01.840]   When I drive to the airport, I'm listening.
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.120]   When I'm at the gym, I'm listening.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:06.560]   The best thing is you can get listening done, you can get
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:08.880]   reading done in those times, which normally would be
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.440]   completely lost to you.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:13.080]   And when you add them all up, I probably spent two or three
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:16.040]   hours a day reading through audible.com.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.400]   And that's pretty cool.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.200]   I want you to check it out.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.880]   Go to audible.com/twig.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:23.080]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/twig.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.520]   You could sign up for the gold account.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:29.320]   That's going to give you a book a month.
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:31.880]   And your first one's absolutely free.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.160]   You get to keep it even if you cancel.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.200]   You can cancel it any time.
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:37.200]   Audible.com/twig.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.080]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:43.680]   This week in Google and for our trip to Las Vegas for CES.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.840]   So one of the things I saw when I was down here is a new
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:49.280]   e-book reader called the Entourage Edge.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.560]   You can go to entourageedge.com and take a look.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:53.360]   They have a really great demo.
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.960]   This is-- I don't know if you ever saw the video Microsoft
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.720]   put out of their concept e-book reader called the Courier.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.120]   It was more like a book.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:04.040]   It had two pages, two facing pages.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.680]   The left page was e-ink.
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.520]   And this is exactly the same thing, by the way.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.040]   It's exactly what it looks like.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:16.240]   It's almost a 10-inch e-ink screen, 9.7 inches, 1200 by 8.25.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:17.400]   They've done some interesting things.
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:18.320]   They've added touch to it.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:21.400]   They have a Wacom digitizer on the e-ink.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:23.880]   So you can write notes on it and so forth.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.920]   It reads e-pub files and PDFs.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:30.280]   e-pub means it gives it access to the entire Google book
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.800]   library.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.320]   They also say they've made some content deals.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:39.480]   But on the right-hand side, there's an Android netbook,
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:44.440]   a 1024 by 600 pixel 10-inch screen running Android.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:48.760]   In full color, you can drag images from the e-ink side
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.880]   to the Android side.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.480]   And in fact, if that image was in color in the original,
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.000]   even though it's in black and white on the e-book,
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.040]   it will turn into a color image on the Android side.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:00.640]   There's a video camera built in.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:05.600]   You can record still images or MPEG-4 videos using it.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:07.000]   It's got headphones.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:07.840]   You could do--
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:08.960]   I imagine you could do Skype.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.440]   You could do anything you could on an Android.
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.880]   It's going to have a 1 gigahertz Snapdragon,
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.000]   very much like your Nexus 1.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.280]   So in a way, it's like a big 10-inch screen Nexus 1.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.000]   I think this is a really cool device.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.280]   Does it cost as much as the Lincoln you were driving this week?
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:21.840]   Well, geez.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.320]   That was my first question.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.120]   Guess how much?
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.360]   $490.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:27.800]   No.
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:28.760]   How?
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.520]   It's less than the Nexus 1.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:30.960]   I don't know.
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.800]   Less than the Nexus 1.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.680]   It's less than the Nexus 1.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:35.920]   Well, it's got no phone in it.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.200]   It's not a phone.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.080]   But this kind of stunned me.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.040]   And I think part of the reason they could charge so little
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:45.680]   is I guess they probably don't have to pay for Android, right?
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:47.200]   This is a remarkable device.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:47.960]   I played with one.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:51.000]   Does it use cell connectivity or just Wi-Fi connectivity?
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:51.840]   I don't think it has.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.000]   Let me see.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:53.800]   Yes, no, I'm sorry.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:57.320]   It has built-in Wi-Fi and future support, whatever
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:01.720]   that means for 3G using EVD or an HSDPA mobile modem.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:04.600]   So right now, it's Wi-Fi only.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:08.080]   It has Bluetooth, so you can use an external keyboard.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:10.480]   You can download books via Wi-Fi.
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:13.360]   You could send email from the Android side, browse the web
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:16.360]   on the Android side.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.360]   So with Wi-Fi, you can use it as a laptop.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:20.240]   Absolutely.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.720]   And they're aiming at the college market.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.320]   They think student-- because it's
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.800]   really too big to sit and bed and read it.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.280]   It's too heavy.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.040]   It's three pounds.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.520]   And so you're not going to hold it up while you're lying in bed.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.000]   But it replaces textbooks.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.640]   That's the whole point of it.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:38.400]   I think this was a stunning product.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:38.800]   There were a--
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:40.840]   What's the brand again, Leo?
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:41.560]   You can look at it.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:46.520]   entourageedge.com.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:47.240]   They're selling it now.
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:48.160]   They're taking orders now.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:51.280]   It comes in blue, black, red, white, or ice blue, midnight
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:56.960]   blue, or ice blue for $490 in ships next month.
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.920]   Now, it's a little clunky.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.920]   The bezel is a little bit big and so forth.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.920]   They're calling it a dual book.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:06.120]   They do have New York Times bestsellers in their store.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.960]   I mean, somehow they've got deals.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.480]   I don't know where these guys came from.
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:12.080]   The interesting thing is they're just one of about a dozen
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:14.000]   ebook readers here.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.800]   And a lot of Android products.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:17.720]   Really interesting.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:19.920]   A lot of netbooks and that kind of thing.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:24.640]   So I am getting excited about the notion of Android going
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:28.320]   beyond the phone, to be honest with you.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.960]   Not to bite the hand that feeds us,
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.960]   but there's also an Android system for cars that
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.160]   was being shown out there too.
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:34.680]   Oh, really?
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:37.160]   Oh, I didn't see them.
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:37.640]   It makes sense.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:38.720]   And I would imagine those--
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:39.240]   Well, yeah.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:42.880]   --as a reason why Ford wouldn't, at some point, use Android as
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:43.440]   its OS.
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:46.720]   The OS isn't necessarily the killer of sauce.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.160]   It's how they integrate it with the car.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.320]   Right.
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:52.560]   So we did our predictions last year,
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.200]   last episode for 2010.
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.160]   Or did we?
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:56.160]   Did we get to predictions?
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:56.920]   I think we looked back.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.240]   We didn't look forward so much.
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:03.720]   But the Google OS blog, GoogleSystem.blogspot.com,
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.240]   did their predictions for 2010.
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.400]   And some interesting predictions.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:10.520]   They said Bookmark Sync will extend to sync documents
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:12.040]   in Google Docs.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.920]   That seems like it would make sense.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.280]   Google will launch a service that indexes and ranks web
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.000]   applications.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.240]   I don't know why they think they'll do that, but why not.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:23.440]   I think that's right.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:25.240]   I think that's the filter failure problem there.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.360]   And if you want to organize things that are disorganized,
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.040]   there's a key opportunity right there.
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.760]   And it needs to be organized in a different way.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:31.880]   It's not information.
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:33.600]   It's applications.
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.000]   I guess you're right.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.240]   I mean, after all, a lot of applications are just information.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.960]   There's-- I mean, the distinction between applications
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:45.160]   and information is kind of nebulous anyway.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.160]   Search engine will start grouping related results.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.200]   That would be very nice.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.680]   I think that would be great.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:53.120]   Google Image Search will let you upload an image
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.760]   and then show related images from the web.
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:55.880]   That's just Google goggles.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:57.400]   That makes sense.
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.960]   Searchable Street View images.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:02.080]   I love that idea.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.760]   Android will have more users in Windows mobile.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.480]   I think that's pretty obvious.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.080]   It may be.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:07.580]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:08.240]   That's right on.
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.280]   They're going to launch-- now, I thought
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.400]   this was kind of interesting.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:16.720]   Google Drive, a drive in the sky.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.360]   But it will be an extended version of Google Docs
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.560]   instead of sending attachments.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.720]   As many people do, you can use Gmail as a file.
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.760]   There's a Gmail file system.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.920]   I think it would make sense to have a Google Drive.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:27.360]   Why not?
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:33.240]   Google will buy true knowledge and launch a fact search engine.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.600]   Maybe they'll buy Wolfram Alpha.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:39.240]   That would be kind of interesting.
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:41.560]   Google will buy Spotify and make it available for free.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:43.240]   I doubt it.
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:44.120]   Anyway, just some more--
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:45.920]   I saw a lot of people cheer that idea.
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:46.420]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:47.240]   That's what free part.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:47.680]   Love that.
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:48.160]   Love that.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:50.400]   But not going to happen.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.080]   Not going to happen.
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:51.760]   All right.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.120]   I think it's time for our--
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.440]   we got to wrap this up because I know we're
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:55.240]   keeping you a little late.
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:57.680]   We had some technical issues here on this end from Vegas.
[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:59.280]   And so we were delayed.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.120]   And we want to get Twitter underway in a second.
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:05.720]   So I'll tell you what, let's get our number and our tool
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:10.440]   of the week starting with Gina Trapani's tip of the week.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:10.800]   All right.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:11.080]   Cool.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.280]   So in honor of the Nexus One launch this week,
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.080]   my tip is for Android users.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.120]   Android, Leo, has said a couple of times, Android
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.920]   has only a limited number of home screens, three or five,
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.120]   depending on your version.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.320]   But you can create folders on your Android home screen
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.960]   and organize your icons in them.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.480]   So if you tap and hold your home screen,
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.280]   you get the option to add objects to that home screen.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.520]   One of them is a folder.
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.840]   You can add a new folder and put icons into it.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.480]   So I'll give you an example how I use this.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.600]   When I go to the gym, I use certain things on my phone.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.920]   I have a workout playlist.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.040]   And I have this app that tracks how far I run.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.520]   And I use a stopwatch app.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.080]   And I have a bookmark to a program I'm using.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.480]   Well, I created a folder called gym.
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.480]   And I moved all those icons into that folder.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.280]   So whenever I go to the gym, I tap the folder, open it up.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.240]   And I've got all my kind of gym specific icons in there.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.920]   So it's not the same as having unlimited home screens,
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.960]   but it does give you this nice option of organizing
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.800]   your shortcuts into subgroups that you can name.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:13.720]   So does the Nexus One have three or five home pages?
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:14.760]   The Nexus One has five.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.240]   Yay.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.240]   Yeah, I knew you'd be happy about that, Leo.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.280]   It's the thing that bugs me the most.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:20.560]   And I'm so happy.
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.640]   I know, I know.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:22.680]   Yeah, I really need it.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.880]   I really need more space.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.000]   But the folders will help too.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.200]   Because that's one thing that I use pages for in the iPhone.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:33.800]   Is organizing icons or applications into chunks that I would--
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.280]   So this is a good way to do that.
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.040]   That's great.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:36.720]   Exactly.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.280]   Exactly.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.800]   Good tip.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.360]   I'm still confused.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.760]   This is me giving myself an IQ test and failing here.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:47.080]   But the difference between the home screens
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:50.360]   and the little grid at the bottom.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.120]   Down here, what's the logical difference
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.680]   between those two things?
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:57.440]   Well, when you tap the grid, the application menu launches.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.840]   So think of that as your Windows Start button.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:02.680]   It's everything.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:02.960]   I know.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.800]   I hate to make that analogy.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.720]   OK, but then, so then what do you call it
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.960]   when you put it on the home screen?
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:08.960]   Is that a shortcut?
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.880]   Is that a what?
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.560]   So if you drag and drop an application from that menu
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.840]   onto your home screen, that just means it's on your home screen.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:19.240]   And you can access it just like your desktop,
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:23.240]   just like putting icons on your Mac desktop.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.400]   Yeah, I think that's a really good analogy.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.120]   And that's why I hated having five pages.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.480]   That would make a remedial lesson later.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.880]   I was having problems getting on the thing,
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:37.360]   and people were telling me in Twitter, ask Gina.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.120]   Yeah, let's talk.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.320]   I'll give you the law.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.680]   I'll give you the walkthrough, for sure.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.080]   I don't understand why you're having difficulty with that, Jeff.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.120]   You've got a drawer that has everything in it,
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.920]   and then you could select the things you use a lot
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.360]   and move those to the top pages.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.480]   I don't understand why I need both.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.360]   That's all right.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.920]   Because-- Oh, why you need both?
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:57.800]   Well, it's the difference.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:58.400]   Oh, that's true.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.120]   So the icon really doesn't have--
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.440]   It's a difference between the dock on the iPhone
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.560]   and your home screens.
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.640]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:05.560]   Kind of.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.040]   Kind of.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.000]   Like you put the things on your dock, right,
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.360]   that you use all the time, right?
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.080]   And those are always there.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:12.520]   It's been a while.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.360]   I have to say--
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.480]   One thing that does bug me is that you've got the grid
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.960]   and you've got the menu.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.400]   And they both come from the same place.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.560]   Now, didn't they change that now on 2.1?
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.880]   Does the-- that always bug me.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.680]   So you press the menu button and you get your settings menu.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.760]   But it slides up from the same place
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.240]   that the applications menu slides up from.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.120]   Is it the same on the Nexus 1?
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.520]   They're both getting the bottom.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:41.520]   So, yeah, the menu is kind of settings.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.640]   Yeah, it is the same thing.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.760]   So there's like the list of applications.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.960]   That I find more confusing because--
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.760]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.000]   I can see that.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.440]   Yeah, that bugs me a little bit.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.720]   But that's just life.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.080]   It's not just me.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.240]   Now that I find a little confusing.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.200]   Totally not just you, Jeff.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.800]   I should say, I love Android, but I can totally
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.720]   see how it is sort of confusing to new users.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:05.280]   In fact, Matt Howie wrote a great, long review
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:08.000]   about all the things that made him really confused
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.560]   about Android when he first started using it.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.440]   And so-- and he's a total nerd.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.040]   So I'm right there with you.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.920]   The initial experience is not--
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.080]   is still not as good.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.080]   It's still not as simple and easy to grok.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.560]   I'll stick with it for a while.
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.840]   Hang in there.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.400]   I think it might become more acceptable.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.280]   It's not-- there are some edges that are not polished.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.800]   But if you're comparing it to the iPhone,
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.880]   that's a pretty high standard.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.320]   It's sure a heck of a lot better than Windows Mobile
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.520]   or even Blackberry or WebOS.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:36.840]   I mean, I think it's a really nice phone.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.320]   I'm seeing also that it syncs with Picasa Web albums, too,
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.480]   so you can get your photos in from Picasa.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:42.120]   It does.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.760]   If you go in a gallery, it syncs to your Picasa Web albums,
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.840]   which is pretty cool, pretty neat, and new, thinking.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.480]   That's really-- that's wonderful.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.120]   That's wonderful.
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.240]   I think I'm going to-- I don't know if I'll replace the iPhone,
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.160]   but I think it's going to be.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.640]   I'm very excited about getting one.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.560]   That's cool.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.760]   Now it's time for Jeff's number of the week.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.840]   Well, we'll try to start with 7 out of 10.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.880]   That's how many Google users make more than one query a day.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:06.320]   This is--
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.960]   I'm so glad I stayed away from that article.
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:09.680]   I said, I told you.
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.240]   I thought I put it in the subject line.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.160]   It's off Leo.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.680]   Because it is such a great article.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.920]   It's from the Google blog.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.800]   It is wonderful.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:22.640]   It's like a Harper's Index of stats from Google.
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.480]   Right.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:23.640]   Right.
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:26.640]   So a real quick proportion of users in the US
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.840]   making more than twin 10 queries a day, one out of seven.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.480]   Wow.
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:33.080]   Fraction of queries, duplicates, et cetera.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.280]   Never seen before.
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.320]   More than one third of queries are unique.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:39.000]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.480]   That's hard to believe.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.560]   Greatest increase in denija.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:47.240]   Average amount of time taken by users to finish your query,
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.360]   nine seconds, average amount of time
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:53.720]   it takes Google to answer less than one quarter of a second.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.480]   That's just some crazy numbers.
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.280]   Yeah, that's impressive.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.040]   Impressive.
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.480]   And my tool of the week is the Google Translate element.
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.560]   I've always thought that Google's translation was really
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:03.760]   good.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.120]   And a lot of websites now kind of build that in.
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.560]   And Google has made this available for websites.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.000]   They just did this right before the end of the year.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.200]   You go to google.com/webelements/translate.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.760]   You can easily add a little Google Translate button
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:24.120]   on any website blog and make it possible for your website
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.920]   to be read by people all over the world
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:28.160]   in any of the Google languages.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.440]   And there are quite a few languages.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.640]   I don't think pirate is on here.
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:36.400]   But Yiddish is Welsh, Vietnamese, Ukrainian, Thai, Turkish,
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.360]   Swedish, Swahili, Spanish, and on and on and on.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.720]   And what a nice way to make it very easy for web sites
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:45.880]   to make their site accessible to everybody.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.760]   So google.com, if you're a web guy,
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.960]   I'm going to do this on my blog.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.960]   I think it's such a great idea.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:54.160]   Google.com/webelements/translate.
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:58.720]   Easily add Google Translate to your site.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.840]   And I think Google Translate does a fairly good job
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.480]   for machine translation.
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.680]   It's really made me very lazy.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.000]   It's the same as I can't spell anymore.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.400]   All my efforts to finally, in late in life,
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.880]   learn my bad German have gone away
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.680]   because now when I need a word, I just go on.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.080]   I know.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.040]   I do that with French.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:15.520]   A cheek.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.080]   I know it's not so good.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.120]   In fact, sometimes you get some really good--
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.920]   The other neat little trick is I gave a talk
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:24.320]   to a bunch of Dutch people a while ago.
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.800]   And I looked up.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:29.240]   And when I started on Skype, I said, donk-oom.
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.480]   And they applauded that because I went to the effort.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.840]   So I had some Norwegians want me to come speak to them.
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.240]   So I was honored that they did that.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:35.840]   And I went to Google.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.080]   I asked how do you say many thanks?
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:39.080]   And I put in my Nietak.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.040]   And that amazed them too.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.840]   So it's a nice little trick to use Google Translate
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:45.640]   to impress future mothers-in-law.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:49.040]   Just don't say each benign or linear, and you'll be all right.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.720]   My other tool I decided not to do
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.080]   is a Google Map mashup called Pot Locator.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:54.440]   That's you find the medical marijuana
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.320]   dispensary near you.
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.160]   But if you--
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.400]   They're in Vegas.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:00.960]   You have a variation on it.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:01.480]   I would say.
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.800]   Absolutely.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.720]   If you're in need, potlocator.com
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.160]   is a good use of Google Maps.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.360]   All right, everybody.
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.640]   We thank you so much for being here.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.840]   I apologize for my throat and my hoarseness.
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.440]   We'll be back in studio next week with this week in Google.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:17.280]   And some fun guests.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.240]   Maybe we can get Christmas in on.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:19.520]   There's a lot of people I have in mind.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.640]   There's some really wonderful people from Google, too,
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:22.680]   that we'd like to get on.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:26.960]   But you can find this show at twit.tv/twig.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.800]   It's on iTunes.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:28.640]   It's on the Zoom store.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.520]   It's even on iGoogle.
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.400]   You can add it to your iGoogle page.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:34.840]   If you just go to twit.tv/twig, watch it on YouTube,
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.640]   youtube.com/twit.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:41.320]   And you can watch live, normally, 215, Pacific, 515
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:44.440]   Eastern every Saturday at live.twit.tv.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:47.320]   Jeff Jarvis is blogging at buzzmachine.com.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.320]   So great to have you, Jeff.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.640]   Thanks for being here.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.480]   Thanks for putting up with a lousy connection from Vegas.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:57.000]   Gina Trapani blogs at smarterware.org.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.440]   And you can also see her work on Life Hacker and the Harvard
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.800]   Business Review.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.200]   And you might catch her bicycling around San Diego
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.440]   if you look fast with her Nexus One.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.560]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.400]   We'll see you next time.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.640]   Thank you, Liam.
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.040]   On twig.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:16.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:20.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.740]   (upbeat music)
