[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.300]   Yella here.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.000]   You're not too.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I'm much better.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.800]   That was the nicest shortest bout of COVID ever.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.700]   So it's not was it your first or no?
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.100]   No, it's my second.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.700]   Remember I was stuck in Dallas for two.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.600]   Oh, I do remember that.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.200]   That's right.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.600]   I forgot.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.900]   Yeah.
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.900]   I was like your daughter got it in Puerto Rico.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.900]   Yeah, like two weeks later, but you didn't get it from her.
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.700]   But but and I bet you this is from those conferences you were going to.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.300]   Well, no, this one was from Andrew.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.700]   Andrew got it because he he didn't know he's right.
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.600]   I was you might see Andrew.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.100]   Yeah, that's my husband.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.600]   We have the bird issue.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.400]   The bird is back.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.900]   Do you remember the bird last year?
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.700]   No, this time I had a Robin that was attacking this back window here.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.800]   No, no, it happened for months.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   Like it must have happened on this show because like it was just.
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.500]   And you can even see it if you were watching.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.100]   Robin hates me.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.900]   So is he painting a giant cat on the window or was he doing it?
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.500]   I mean, he was he's just a he was an old he's a horny dumb bird and thought there was a.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.700]   I was talking about your husband.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.600]   I'm trying to call him a horny dumb bird.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.100]   You go right.
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.900]   Hey, husband's covering all of our windows with plastic film right now to prevent the Robin from.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.700]   You think it will?
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.400]   I don't.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.000]   We'll try.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.800]   Plus we can see your reflection.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   Yeah, reflection two months and we tried the mylar strips.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.100]   We tried like the bird balloons.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.700]   We have actually just just just in video of the bird.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.100]   Yes.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.700]   Thanks.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.200]   Except it would be.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.500]   I mean, it wouldn't be great if it died, but like.
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.200]   We used to have.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   When I lived in Santa Cruz, we had picture when I was in birds would die.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.200]   They would fly into it and knock themselves out.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.900]   Yeah, this one isn't dying.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.000]   It just attacks it starting at four thirty in the morning in a little attack at literally all day and he does nothing else in.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.900]   Is he attacking it by flying into it?
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.000]   He's like pecking at it.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Yeah, he flies to it and goes hook.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.900]   It's strange.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.400]   In the later season, it gets.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.400]   Bird imitation.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.900]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.000]   Saincy.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.200]   You know, there is a simple.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.900]   That was a good gift.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.200]   There you go.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.400]   There is a simple fix for this is called cats.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.300]   Yeah, I was hoping, but we don't have my neighbor has a dog.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.400]   Yeah, we can't stick like the little high pitched thing.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.800]   No, but I mean, just having a cat would be.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.400]   I know if I could import a cat, it would totally kill this Robin because it's very predictable.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   Yeah, it doesn't have to kill it, but it would certainly scare it off.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.600]   Well, they like to know.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.100]   I think I think it's like this bird.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.000]   Can it's going to do?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.900]   Yeah, the bird's not going to or the cat's not going to scare it off.
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.700]   The cat is like this bird is a very smart here.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.900]   You know, I had a little killer.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.100]   That's it.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.200]   Once again, we got the Stacey bird imitation.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.400]   I had that was the cat imitation.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.300]   I had a funny how the bird imitation or the cat imitation are very similar.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.300]   No, that's audio.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.600]   You really need the visual punk.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.200]   The visuals very different.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.000]   I had somebody call the radio show.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.040]   Photographer calls himself Dr.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.800]   Birdie's a bird lover and he said, yeah, those windmills are killing birds like right and left.
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.000]   I said, you never go to President Trump's website.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.600]   You see the bald eagle that got beheaded by a wind turbine.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.300]   That's my picture.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.400]   And what really is that?
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.000]   So I looked it up according to the federal wildlife service.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.700]   The top threat to birds is collision with building glass.
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:04.000]   Yeah, 600 million birds die every year colliding with building glass.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.000]   Then electrical lines, vehicles, wind turbines is 234,000.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.100]   It's what is that?
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.500]   Six orders of magnitude less and cats are 2.4 billion.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:26.300]   So so I should have if I had the presence of mine, I could have said, you know, I agree.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.600]   Let's get rid of wind turbines and while we're at it, let's get a real buildings and cats
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.000]   because that's the real threat.
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.400]   Anyway, a cat would work, but our cats are too fat and lazy to catch birds,
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.200]   but they will sit in the window and look and glower.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.400]   Do you like do they make the sounds?
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.400]   Do they try to do their own?
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.500]   Which are far better than Stacey's.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.000]   I might add.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Yeah, they do little.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.300]   Yeah, they do chirping a little chirping.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.100]   And that's I think that's probably effective.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.900]   But anyway, back to the show.
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.800]   Sorry, that had nothing to do with technology.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.700]   This is the show.
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.100]   You actually never got to the show.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.700]   Welcome to the show.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.100]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.200]   Should you remember how used to diagram sentences?
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.600]   Somebody should diagram the conversations on this show.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.500]   Oh, how do we get to birds all over the place?
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   Yeah.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.200]   Was your hot?
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.600]   It was Andrew and you got COVID for him.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.100]   Oh, let's get back to the COVID.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.800]   Okay, wait a minute.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.900]   Let me pop that stack back to the COVID.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.500]   So you had a very minor case.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.300]   Thank goodness.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.200]   Thank goodness.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.800]   Yes, and Andrew as well.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.300]   Better.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.800]   Yeah, he he was he he was positive for like 10 days, but he was
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.300]   minor and he's out playing pickleball in a little bit.
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.800]   So I guess that's sick.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.100]   Is he?
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.500]   Huh?
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.000]   So meanwhile, my father has now had internal bleeding ammonia
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.600]   hallucinations.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.800]   Does he have long COVID?
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.500]   He got it in January and then the crap started happening.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.300]   Does he have a UTI?
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.300]   Have they checked for that?
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:51.900]   I'm sure they've checked for that.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.300]   Yeah.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:52.800]   Okay.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.300]   Yeah, I saw that on succession.
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.500]   Oh, yes.
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.300]   Yes.
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.700]   Good point.
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.000]   Everything I know about UTI is I learned from succession.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.100]   All right.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:06.500]   Show.
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.100]   Let me log.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:07.400]   All right.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.200]   Oh, you like it.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.100]   And have you seen it?
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.100]   Oh, that's good.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.800]   It's a session.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.100]   Succession is a good show.
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:12.300]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:12.800]   They're back.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.700]   I didn't like it at first because they were a bunch of jackasses.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.000]   And it was very hard to watch.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.800]   Yeah, that terrible.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.300]   Good show.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.100]   That's what makes us really awful, really awful people.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.200]   So let's see here.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.500]   Okay.
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.600]   Let's just get this out of the way.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.100]   And then we don't have to talk about it ever again.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:31.800]   Okay.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.100]   Roger that.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.300]   You know what I'm talking about.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.900]   Can we set a timer?
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:36.500]   Yeah.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.900]   Set it to two minute timer.
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:38.900]   Elon Musk.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.300]   Two minutes.
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.600]   Being a jerky jerk.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.000]   So it turns out I didn't really put two and two together, but fortunately,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:55.300]   others are paying closer attention that those layoffs last week were mostly of founders who were a quote whose companies were acquired and were there by at Twitter.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:05.700]   And there was this theory going around that Elon hadn't fired them up to now because he was concerned about payouts and that perhaps he'd found some legal opinion that said, oh, you could fire him and then you don't have to give money money and blah, blah, blah.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.900]   I think yeah, I think he's just like, we'll just go bankrupt and we won't have to make the day out.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.400]   Right.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:10.700]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:19.200]   So they fired some great people Esther Crawford, of course, but Leah Culver, who is a super talented, one of the creators of OAuth.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.500]   She was acquired and was doing spaces.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.500]   Which was the floor lady.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.500]   That's Esther Crawford.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:32.900]   The one who tweeted, you know, hashtag sleep where you work and had a picture of her in a sleeping bag of Twitter early on in the Elon.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.300]   She was an Elon.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:34.900]   I don't want sick.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.700]   I say sick of fan, but Elon fan in the.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.100]   Loyal.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.100]   No, she supported.
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.700]   Loyal is.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.200]   That's a good way.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.000]   That's a good way to put it.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.900]   But even loyalists under the new regime don't last long.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:50.700]   So the most recent one was actually pretty appalling and I watched it play out in real time.
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.500]   We did.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.000]   You're on Twitter.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.100]   Wait a second.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.000]   I was pointed to know I never got read my account.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.700]   I can read it.
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.200]   You just lurk.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.900]   I read only read only Twitter.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:05.900]   But I was somebody was talking about and I went and I saw it.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.300]   Is he finish?
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.700]   He's last land.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.500]   That's right.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:19.900]   Developer whose company wayne had been acquired by Twitter some time ago.
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:28.000]   Just on last Saturday a week ago Saturday had his laptop his email account.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.700]   Walked out, which is, you know, usually a sign that you perhaps aren't working there anymore.
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:44.400]   But he never heard anything else, which is it by the way, incredibly bad policy, I think for any company to signal that they fired you.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.600]   Ghost your employer.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.700]   That's ghosting him.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.700]   That's ghosting.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.200]   It is it is literally ghosting.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.500]   Get the message guy.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.200]   You're not working here anymore.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.400]   So I think quite reasonably.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:02.900]   Hallie who has a muscular dystrophy is in a wheelchair.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:09.400]   But that's neither here nor there, at least at the beginning was tweeted.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.700]   Well, I've lost access to Twitter.
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.700]   So I'm wondering.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.000]   Tried to get ahold of HR.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   He tried to do lots of things and he finally this was the last resort.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.500]   Yeah.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.000]   Nine days ago, the access to my work computer was cut.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   So this is nine days later.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.600]   There's your timer.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.100]   Oh, God, we that we just got started.
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.200]   Can I have two more minutes please?
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.900]   Just to that's all.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.700]   You got to remember how Leo tells a story.
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.500]   This is the radio.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:33.800]   I did.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.400]   Wait.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.200]   This is important.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:35.400]   All right.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:35.800]   Come on.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   Yeah, they've got it.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.700]   They've got to string the narrative along.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.100]   Not a day ago.
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.100]   That's his job.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.800]   I'm going to set a five minute timer.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.200]   Go on.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.600]   I am heralder from Finland.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.500]   Nine days ago, tweeted.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.300]   No, actually March 6 tweeted.
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.200]   Nine days ago, the access to my work computer was cut along with 200 other
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.000]   Twitter employees.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.800]   However, your head of HR, he's tweeting Elon.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.200]   Dear Elon Musk is not able to confirm if I'm an employee or not.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.400]   And you've not answered my emails.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.600]   So maybe if enough people retweet, you'll answer me here to which 23,000 people
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.200]   retweeted him.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.300]   He has about 150,000 followers.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.700]   And even tweeted Jack.
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.300]   Hi, Jack.
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.500]   I'd really appreciate your help on this one.
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.200]   My company was acquired on your watch.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.900]   I joined because I believe in what you're building.
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.800]   And then there's Sequoia and a 16 Z to investors in Twitter, claiming founder
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   founder friendly.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.800]   So he's just wondering.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.700]   So then he gets a response from Elon Musk, his various self.
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:39.900]   Elon says, oh, well, what work have you been doing?
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.700]   Now, you know, I'm just going to point out you probably could, you know,
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.200]   there's probably a way to find that out without tweeting it publicly.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.900]   But anyway, to which how he quite correctly says, I would need to break
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.200]   confidentiality to answer that question here.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.500]   Um, if you have your lawyer's share in the morning, I can do that.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:00.500]   Then I'd be happy to discuss that openly to which Elon says, I give you permission.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.000]   The king says it's approved.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.100]   You go ahead.
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.000]   So he poor guy.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.700]   I mean, this is just a dog and pony show at this point, but he's trying to, you
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.600]   know, how he's trying to be responsive.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.300]   So he says all the things he did, including saving half a million dollars
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.500]   on a Figma contract.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.700]   Um, I could go on.
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:25.100]   Uh, but, but I'm still wondering, am I employed?
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:25.900]   There is no question.
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.500]   Was it my still in the board or not?
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.200]   So Elon says, oh, you didn't do anything.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.500]   You didn't know any real work.
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.300]   Show replies.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.500]   You got to show replies button.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:34.800]   Okay.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.200]   Which, I got to figure out which a little bit, which reply.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.600]   There we go.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.200]   There we go.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.800]   That's where you see.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.400]   Um, there are a lot of other people replying.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.500]   That's part of the problem.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.700]   There's a lot of junk here.
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:54.900]   Um, anyway, Elon replies, well, that's not real work and, um, uh, makes fun of him
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.300]   and says you're in a wheelchair.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:08.000]   Um, and, uh, you know, I mean, really the lowest of the low stuff is low as Trump.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.900]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Mox is disability in a wheelchair.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.400]   Say, you know, implying, well, you know, wheelchair, you couldn't possibly
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.000]   done any work, which is appalling.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.100]   Anyway, uh, to make a long, my timer is coming up.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.600]   So it's a make a long story short.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   Sure.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:28.200]   Uh, it turns out, Halle is kind of an amazing guy who took his.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.800]   He was the Icelandic citizen of the year a couple of years ago.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.300]   I watch out a note because he took his salary.
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.100]   All five other Icelanders.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.000]   You know, there's like only 300,000 still.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.600]   No, tell him, tell us why because he took instead of a big payout, he took it in
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.700]   salary because he wanted to pay full taxes because he felt like he got this
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.600]   opportunity because he had a free education, the Icelandic education.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.700]   Basically he loves Iceland and it was like, I would take taxes because
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:03.400]   she'll, yeah, furthermore, took the money and built 1500 wheelchair ramps became a
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.300]   in Iceland, a huge advocate for wheelchair ramps.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.400]   He is amazing.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.700]   I mean, this is a nice guy.
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.700]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.500]   And he wasn't who was it who went after Greta Tunberg.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.500]   Oh, Andrew Tate.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.800]   He's being like, he's another entertain.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.900]   I know it's unbelievable.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.900]   Well, but remember he line called the, the entrepreneur who was saving the soccer
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.700]   team is trapped in a cave, a pedophile just because they didn't use his
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.300]   submarine.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.600]   So, I mean, he's not a nice guy.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.900]   He's never been a nice guy in any event.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.200]   The Holly, they got, it got resolved.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.000]   Yeah, you're fired.
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.200]   And then Elon said, but I, and then apparently he's talking, Elon said, but
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.200]   well, wait a minute, maybe I should hire you back because this really turned out
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.100]   to be a black mark.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.400]   And Holly says, you know, he was given bad information because he always
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.100]   believe somebody else's fault.
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:49.800]   I was given.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.800]   I was told that you didn't work and you were in a wheelchair that that that
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.100]   Holly's considering working at Twitter.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:56.700]   He's not.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:02.200]   Holly's opening a restaurant in Reykjavik named after his mom on a joint.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:02.700]   Really?
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.300]   Well, I got to my bucket list.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.000]   I can't wait to go to Iceland.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.100]   Everybody should go to Reykjavik and go to this restaurant and pat him on the
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.400]   back and say you are a class act.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.900]   You know, Iceland is one of those place in Reykjavik air is actually very
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.900]   helpful if you want to fly to Europe, like from the West Coast.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.760]   If you go on Iceland air, they fly you over and they'll give you like two
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.100]   nights in Reykjavik.
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.700]   So it is a very easy to set up.
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.800]   I can't remember what those are called.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.500]   But just a little pro travel trip for you.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:40.100]   It was it can go on to I am I am minimizing how horrific this threat was.
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.700]   The threat was it was just Elon was so horrible.
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.400]   He has apologized since.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.200]   Well, no, he hasn't.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.600]   No, he hasn't really thought of full of.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.100]   He.
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.600]   Yeah, it's like the oh, I misunderstood.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.000]   It's not an apology.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:52.400]   You know what?
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:52.600]   Me.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.500]   It's a non apology apology.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.500]   And you know, the best way to apologize would be to pay Holly the money.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.500]   You owe him.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.200]   But of course, he wants not paying anybody money.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.000]   He owns him.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.000]   And the timer is up.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.600]   Thank you very much, everybody.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.100]   Good night.
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.100]   Perfect.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.300]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.500]   I underestimated by half, but that's about what normal for a programmer.
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.600]   Okay, that was like eight minutes.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.400]   Oh, but yes.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.600]   That's still a good time for a radio guy.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.700]   That's very quick.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.700]   It's yeah.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.900]   I mean, this is a three hour show.
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.000]   What else are you used to fill in time here?
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.200]   Here's what Elon wrote.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.400]   The reality is that this guy who is independently wealthy did no actual
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.000]   work claimed as his excuse that he had a disability that prevented him from typing.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.600]   It was simultaneously tweeting up a storm.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.800]   Can't say I have a lot of respect for that.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.800]   I love that readers added context.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.000]   They thought people might want to know.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.700]   Yeah, but actually the context is wrong.
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:51.900]   As they said that Elon spoke directly, apologized, etc, which apparently maybe
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.700]   didn't really happen.
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.000]   And Holly's still saying I sure would like to get that.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.900]   The pay yummy.
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.700]   Unbelievable.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.500]   So there's that story and that's just, you know, it's a typical Twitter outrage story.
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.800]   I almost don't even think it's news except it's so appalling.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.000]   And there are still people that said that Twitter.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.300]   Yeah, and we are very sad.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.200]   Don't worry about that.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.700]   We can just be sad about Twitter.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.200]   This is just it's like, I don't know.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.100]   Yeah.
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:19.900]   Okay.
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:20.300]   Okay.
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.800]   Like the country two years ago.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.800]   Twitter led its privacy and security protecting tour service expire.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.100]   They let's they just didn't renew the certificate.
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.500]   So that was a year ago.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.800]   They created a tour service so that people who are in countries where Twitter is blocked.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.600]   Still would have access to it.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.200]   Not anymore.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.900]   How much did that cost them?
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.000]   Oh gosh.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.400]   Not 10 bucks at least.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:44.400]   Nothing.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:52.800]   FTC is now investigating to see whether Twitter has violated its consent decree.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.300]   Remember under Jack.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:06.600]   Twitter had a fairly big investigation and made it at a consent decree that they would not introduce any new features without explicitly explaining how privacy would be protected, etc, etc.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.700]   So how does giving this stuff to the journal will spy like that?
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:10.800]   That's what I couldn't understand.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:24.000]   So the FTC has demanded that Twitter turnover internal communications relating to Elon Musk detailed information about layoffs, citing concerns that staff reductions could compromise the company's ability.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:32.200]   To protect users, something that they had agreed to do in 12 letters sent to Twitter and its lawyers since the Musk takeover.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.600]   So this has been ongoing, but the Wall Street Journal, I guess, just revealed this.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:42.900]   The FTC has also asked the company to quote identify all journalists granted access to company records.
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.200]   Why?
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.700]   Because that's a privacy violation, right?
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.800]   Oh, OK.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.100]   And to provide information about the launch of the revamped Twitter blue subscription service.
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.400]   They are also and this will be fun.
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:58.400]   Seeking to depose Mr. Musk in connection with the program.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:06.200]   Remember, I think, frankly, it was the threat of having to do a deposition that that convinced Elon is that me.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:12.000]   I'm sorry that convinced Elon to buy Twitter, right?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.500]   It was the day before he was supposed to do a deposition that he said, OK, fine.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.400]   No deposition.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:20.900]   I'll buy it.
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:27.600]   So he paid $44 billion the last time he was supposed to speak on record.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.200]   Actually, he's done it in court since then in that trial, which he won, by the way.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.300]   We should point out good news for Elon.
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:40.400]   He he the SEC went after him for the tweet.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:46.500]   They got a they got $20 million out of him for the tweet that said he was going to take Tesla private.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:52.300]   Then Tesla investors sued in court and the jury decided that, you know, no, Elon's cool.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:52.700]   That's OK.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.400]   You could tweet that.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.400]   Nobody lost any money.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.800]   So he did get off the hook on that one and did in fact testify before the jury on that one.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.900]   FTC official wrote on November 10th.
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.100]   This is very early on.
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:09.000]   We're concerned staff reductions impact Twitter's ability to protect customer information.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.500]   Actually, the reason we know this is the house judiciary committee published excerpts of them
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.700]   in a staff report.
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.200]   So it became public knowledge.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.700]   The letters and I feel like this go on.
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.100]   Sorry.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:36.600]   The letters indicate Twitter responded to the FTC, but the agency as of late January felt the company was engaging in a quote troubling pattern of ongoing delay that raises serious concerns about its compliance.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.200]   This could be a large fine.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   Sorry.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:40.600]   Go ahead.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.300]   Stacy.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:52.500]   No, I was going to say, as part of me feels like this is the FTC piling on to find a company that it's kind of piling on to like something to give it a little bit more cash.
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.000]   I know that's.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.800]   Well, you have a consent.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.800]   No, I disagree.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.000]   You have a consent decree with a company which had privacy problems before, right?
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And security problems before.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   And the consent decree, the company agreed to and is still by the way bound, even though the company was sold, I believe, wouldn't they still be bound?
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:11.600]   You are.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.000]   You do not get out of your consent.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:13.700]   Yeah.
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:18.100]   That they would, you know, do due diligence before they did anything.
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.500]   And obviously there's no due diligence going on on Elon side.
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:26.100]   So I think it's, you know, you can't just say, oh, well, I guess that's the way it is in the world.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.400]   You got to pursue that.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.800]   That's that's okay.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:29.700]   If you're right.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.300]   I agree.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.800]   They have no teeth in future.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.200]   Right.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:33.600]   Okay.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.800]   You've convinced me.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:40.200]   I mean, I agree that Alina Khan is is the latest thing is.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.600]   One of the FTC commissioners said big tech is like standard oil, which is wrong.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.000]   And like every problem.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.400]   Well, standard was one company from a big tech is a large umbrella.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.700]   Yeah.
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:23:03.600]   Each, each big tech company has such a monopoly over so many aspects of someone's digital experience monopoly.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.400]   Oh boy.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.900]   Okay.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:10.200]   I've been trying to extricate myself from Google.
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.600]   And it's almost impossible.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.400]   It's hard.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.900]   I'm doing it bit by bit.
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:22.300]   By the way, I'll help you out with this fast mail, replace Google calendar and Google address book.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.600]   That's one of our sponsors.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:29.700]   I use Neva instead of Google search, which by the way, every bit as good as Google search better in many respects.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.600]   But unfortunately, the company uses Google work.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.800]   Works.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:40.800]   And that's so it's not as hard for me to get off Google is hard to communicate with other people.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.500]   Who use because like when people send me Google invitations when I come in here to that's, that's where they get.
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.700]   That's where they get you.
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:53.900]   We're very much a person left on a show called this week at Google who uses Google.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.400]   I like Android.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.900]   Oh yeah.
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.900]   Actually, I got back from Jason.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.200]   I had a bag of them because he didn't want to give it back to me.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.400]   This is the Samsung Galaxy S23.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.700]   And I'm actually quite liking it.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.800]   In fact, if I were going to do a pick, I found a.
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.500]   One of the great things about Android compared to the iPhone is you can have your own launcher.
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:19.500]   And I found something that's called a minimal launcher that's just like a few, a few text.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.900]   And there's no there's no status bar.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.600]   There's no nothing.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.700]   It's very clean.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.600]   Kevin really like it.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.100]   Yeah.
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.700]   Yeah, I really like it.
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.700]   It's called zero.
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.000]   Let me give you the exact name.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.800]   It's called I think zero launch zero launcher.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.800]   Zero launcher.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.200]   Nice.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.400]   It's very simple.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.100]   There's not much here.
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.600]   I'll show you what how it looks though, which is nice.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.500]   And the wallpaper changes every day.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:49.800]   And then, you know, if you want to see, you know, you have your apps and you could type of a couple of letters and launch an app and so forth.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.400]   But pretty straightforward.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.600]   The ones I use most, I knew this could be fewer lines.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.500]   I have eight, but you could have down a four.
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.100]   It's clean.
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.800]   No status bar at the top.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.400]   If you need that, you could just pull it down and you'll get it.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.100]   No, no, I don't turn off navigation.
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:09.000]   Okay, the one little thing because it's a Samsung and has this sidebar menu.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.100]   So I can quickly get to Pokemon go, but other than that.
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:18.100]   And there's no, oh, oh, I like this too.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:25.100]   So normally on one UI and Google's launcher, you slide left, you'll get Google news and stuff.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:29.200]   If you slide left here, you get a phone because this is a phone.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.400]   You slide right, you get a camera because it's a camera.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.400]   Oh, I like that.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.000]   That's it.
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:35.900]   That's it, right?
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.800]   If I want Google Assistant, I call zero launcher.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.200]   That's pretty sweet.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.300]   You lost me until then.
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.000]   Then you got me.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.300]   Yeah, isn't that not?
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.500]   I mean, so yeah, if you need a phone, you got it and your contacts are there too.
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.000]   It still has time.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.600]   And so you can set alarms and all that stuff by tapping the time.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:59.700]   You can get your calendar by tapping the date, but and you can get your, but the camera is right there too, which I think is really nice.
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.100]   I don't know.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:07.300]   I don't, this is completely subsidiary conversation, but I guess it's all that's cool.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:16.700]   So when you go back from Jason, did he call you a hypocrite for denying all other Google and then must you know, this is a Samsung.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.300]   Right, Jason.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.600]   It's Samsung.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:31.500]   Now part of my job, honestly, I'm still probably, you know, my daily driver is going to be an iPhone, but my job really is to be to know how Samsung and I have a pixel and iPhone and use windows and Mac.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.900]   I have to use all of those so I can answer questions and stuff.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.400]   It's part of my job and be good.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:50.600]   I don't, you know, if I often ask myself if I were a private citizen, you know, if I just a normal human being, maybe working down at the auto body shop, what phone would I have?
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.500]   It'd probably be an iPhone.
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.400]   Same.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.600]   And it wouldn't be a modern, you know, it'd probably be an iPhone 10.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.200]   Some SC.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.300]   Yeah, an older iPhone.
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:26:59.700]   Yeah.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.900]   Some SC iPhone or some simplified Galaxy phone.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.000]   Oh, and the masses have to circle around what you were saying, Stacy.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.300]   I probably wouldn't be de-googling my life.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.900]   I'd probably all in on Google, right?
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.600]   Because, oh, yeah, you would not take Google.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.000]   You would.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.500]   That's a lot of.
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.000]   Well, unless you're my mother, is she de-googling?
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:24.800]   I'm like 10 steps away from her, like going off and like living in a fair day cage.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.300]   Yes.
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:25.800]   Really?
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.700]   She is de-googling.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.600]   So I told her actually about Fastmail and she's very excited about it.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.800]   Yeah, because you can use instead of Google calendar and instead of Google contacts.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.800]   Unfortunately.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   So then I turned off Google, right?
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.200]   And then Lisa said, but I send all of the meeting invites to you.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:43.600]   I go.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.300]   Exactly.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.400]   I want to use Google so I kind of have to, right?
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:53.200]   I experienced this with Kevin because Kevin has been off for a long time.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:59.100]   He's on proton mail and all these other things and every now and again, he's like, I didn't get it.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.200]   I'm like, oh, he's like, okay, fine.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.600]   Send it to my cheap mattress.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.300]   I'm like, well, let me see.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.400]   Like, I want to support you in this.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.800]   Let's figure out how I can send you something.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.000]   Isn't that funny?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.300]   That's tough.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.400]   Zero launchers.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.400]   Tag line.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.000]   Googling is minimal AF.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.400]   For your day to day.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.800]   I don't know what the AF means, but that's what it is.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.400]   The minimal.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.400]   Has a.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.600]   I know what it means.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.600]   Jeff, come on.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.100]   I'm not a.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.600]   I may be de googling, but I'm not Stacy's mom.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.400]   I'm not a dinosaur.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.100]   By the way, he is a senator.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.500]   Your mom's got it going on.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.600]   I just want to say that's pretty cool.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:34.900]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.200]   You did.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.200]   Is that song?
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:44.300]   You probably so sick of that.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.700]   Was that a big hit when you were in high school?
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.800]   No, it was later than that.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.100]   I think it was a high school.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.300]   Oh, that's terrible.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.700]   Yeah, fountains of Wayne.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.000]   Oh, so sorry.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.300]   That was a very bad time for that song to be a hit.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:04.100]   Yeah, it was it was not my best years.
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:11.600]   I think I was in college because they were they released their they were active between 1996 and 2011.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.400]   I was in college.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.200]   Great band.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.100]   Great song.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:14.900]   Great name.
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:15.700]   Is it?
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.300]   I grew up to you.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.500]   Who did the song Sarah by journey?
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.500]   Was is that journey?
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.600]   Sarah.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.200]   Yeah, that's all.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:26.700]   Yeah.
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.500]   I think I think it's really good.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.400]   One of those.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.800]   I think it's a journey.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.400]   Then that's.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:42.400]   And I always wanted from my early ages because like I was a baby basically when MTV came out, you know, and I would run out and see this because I love the song and the video with the breading down the hallways.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.500]   And I wanted my name and a song.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.300]   And then years later, that's what I got.
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:55.200]   Stasis mom has got it going on.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.400]   Starship.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.500]   There we go.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:57.900]   Star.
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:58.600]   Thank you, Ray.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:58.800]   God.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.300]   Star.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.600]   Well, so did Fleetwood Mac.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.500]   There were quite a few people.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:07.300]   In fact, when I worked with Sarah Lane, when I worked with Sarah Lane, she hated those all of those all of them.
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.200]   She hated.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.200]   Right.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.400]   You know, you know how that is.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.700]   You know, yeah, but I get it.
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.600]   But you know, as a kid, you didn't know any.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.100]   Better.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.800]   You thought I need a song.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.700]   Yeah.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.900]   What's my theme?
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:26.800]   The song I'm talking about is Sarah.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.800]   Sarah.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.800]   They all sound like that.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:30.400]   I'm also.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.200]   They do see it kind of like that.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:38.600]   Oh, the question is, will the YouTube bot be able to tell that was actually a song and have to take us down?
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.600]   Okay.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:44.000]   Someone who doesn't tone deaf should probably try, but it's not me.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.300]   I want to check your ears, Miss Stacy.
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:50.900]   That was rough.
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.300]   I know.
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.700]   Here.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.100]   It's Jefferson Starship.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:57.700]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.300]   There you go.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:59.000]   We know.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.100]   We know it is.
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.700]   Never saw the video, but I remember the song.
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:03.600]   Ish.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.500]   You are not allowed to play this.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.700]   This is worse than saying the F word on Google.
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.000]   This is so bad.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.400]   By the way, you can now say the F word on Google.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.200]   I'm going to say it now.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:16.900]   Can I say it?
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:17.600]   No.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.200]   What is somebody's kid better than YouTube?
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.700]   Youtubers.
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:29.700]   This is like Renee Richie, who is YouTube's creator liaison and our good friend made had to make a video explaining the new rules.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:35.000]   Youtubers can now swear at the start of videos without getting monetized.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.900]   What does it mean at the start without getting.
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.300]   That was the rule.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:47.200]   The rule was if you say a bad word within the first 10 seconds of your video, 15 seconds of your video, we're going to demonetize the whole video.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.200]   But it's okay to say it later and not going to be monetized.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.500]   That's why you don't understand.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:57.900]   If a video contains swearing within the first 15 seconds, it will be demonetized.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:01.800]   No, now because that's patently ridiculous.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:06.500]   They're going to ease it and you can swear within the first 15 seconds.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.000]   Let's wait a minute.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Let's just ask.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.600]   Let's just ask Renee Richie.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.900]   Renee binary.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:12.400]   Renee.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:12.900]   You can't.
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.700]   Yeah.
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.700]   Let me see.
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.100]   You too.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:15.900]   It's confusing.
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:19.400]   Well, I think that's really what more than anything else.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.400]   It was like, how am I supposed to do that?
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:28.000]   They trying to avoid people because they have auto play or things like that, suddenly encountering something that was really upsetting.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.900]   That would make sense.
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:37.000]   But then do they have similar rules to like not showing graphic violence in that timeframe or other disturbing?
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:37.500]   They did.
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:43.500]   They had a number of rules, but the real guy, the guidelines seem to really be to get to profanity.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.100]   It was a profanity policy.
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:49.800]   So they've announced effective March 7th.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.400]   We're making the following changes.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:33:04.500]   I would try to read this with a straight face usage of moderate profanity at any time in the video is now eligible for green icons usage of stronger profanity like the
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:15.100]   F word in the first seven seconds or repeatedly throughout the majority of the video can now receive limited ads.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:22.600]   That's better than under November's update, which was no ads video content using profanity, moderate or strong.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.100]   This is like the none that comes out with a ruler.
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:30.700]   See if your skirt is sufficient inches below your knee video conference using profanity.
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:40.100]   So the moderate is strong after the first seven seconds will now be eligible for green icons unless used repetitively throughout the majority of the video under the November update.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:40.900]   This would receive note.
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:53.700]   We've also clarified our guidance on how profanity and music is treated moderate or strong profanity used in background music backing tracks, intro or outdoor music can now earn full ad revenue.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:34:01.600]   You have any profanity in titles and thumbnails will still be demonetized and cannot run ads.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.500]   So I think you're right.
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.000]   I think you actually got it.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.500]   If I may say this to YouTube, you nailed it, Jeff, because you said it's about the previews.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.900]   It's about people straying across it.
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.700]   I shouldn't have said that somebody else.
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:15.700]   Well, I said that.
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:16.300]   Stacey.
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.400]   Stacey.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.200]   We've been giving.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.800]   If I may, if I may say you nailed it, Stacy, thank you.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   Nailed it.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.500]   Nailed it.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.100]   Here is a nail a keyboard.
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.400]   Here is a here is our good friend.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.400]   Oh, I can't play it.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:38.500]   It's on Twitter for some reason, among other things, Twitter's not not playing back the video.
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.500]   I swear to God.
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.500]   Have you noticed has it been?
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.500]   It's been women to Stacy just leave.
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.300]   She ran out of the door.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.900]   You can be credit for her.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:47.300]   Brilliant.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.300]   She ran away.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.300]   Can't take it anymore.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.000]   And now she's yelling back to the mic.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.200]   My dog was scratching at the door and I thought you didn't notice me.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.700]   Let the little fellow be always.
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:04.700]   You totally ignored my here is Renee Richie explaining the new rules late last year.
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:12.200]   YouTube updated the ad friendly guidelines around profanity, which videos get green or yellow icons monetized or demonetized.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.600]   We read your feedback, watched your videos.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.600]   We've listened.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.500]   We've heard you.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:20.900]   And here's Connor from our ads policy team with a fresh update on reviewing our own
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.900]   enforcement data.
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.900]   We found the profanity policy results.
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:24.400]   Sure.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.900]   matches the hair approach that we intended.
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:27.900]   It's amazing.
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.400]   As a result, we are making the following changes.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:30.900]   All right.
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.900]   I do like his accent though.
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:33.900]   Our initial update.
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:34.400]   Connor's clearly.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.400]   We are no longer.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.400]   From New Zealand.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.400]   All right.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.900]   So I thought he was Irish.
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:39.900]   Oh, I'm just.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.900]   I bet you every time I get you.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:42.900]   Every single.
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:43.900]   Oh my God.
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:44.900]   It's so cute.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:48.400]   Thank you Renee for clarifying that.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.900]   And Connor, thank you for your beautiful accent.
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:51.900]   Your gorgeous man.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:52.900]   You are.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.900]   I'm standing straight out of the Ben cheese of an assuring.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:57.900]   Let's see.
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.100]   What else is going on?
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.700]   I should do an ad, shouldn't I?
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.700]   Should I do an ad?
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:04.700]   Yes.
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:05.700]   Since.
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.700]   Oh, and then we can talk about GG sewn.
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.700]   Oh God.
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.700]   She's me too.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.500]   I am so peeved.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.500]   In rage.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.500]   Okay.
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.700]   There's a good tease coming up next rage.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.700]   Rage.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:18.700]   No curse words.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.300]   No, because we don't curse here.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.400]   Although Jeff has the yellow icon all over his face.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.600]   Try to adjust it.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.600]   Sorry.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.600]   It's so crappy.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.600]   It's not.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.600]   It's not.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.600]   You know, this show probably.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.600]   Oh, there you go.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.600]   Much better.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.600]   How's that?
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.600]   He's working on it.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.600]   Yeah, you look like flesh.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.600]   Oh, no, I'm pink.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.600]   Yeah, but at least you're.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.000]   Yeah, you're not like cast an ambrity.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.600]   You know, it's great about actually.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:52.220]   I was thinking this is just this show, but all of our shows, each of our hosts is uniquely
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:55.020]   quirky in their own way.
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.020]   You call me quirky.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.020]   Quirk is a nice way to put it.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.620]   Are you sure that you didn't mean cranky?
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.060]   There's nothing quirky about me.
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.100]   We're all a little bit odd.
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.500]   Let's let's be frank.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:11.300]   And every one of us from Andy and not go to Paul Therat to Jeff Jarvis, we're all a
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:14.740]   little bit, you know, just a little different.
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:19.220]   And that's what makes it a wonderful place to be, I think.
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.220]   Isn't it true?
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.220]   Don't you think?
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.220]   I'm just boring.
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:23.220]   I don't know about quirky.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:25.220]   You're the most normal person on the network.
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:26.220]   Yes.
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.220]   You are the most normal person here.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.220]   That's true.
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.220]   That's true.
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:36.180]   But think about how much I learned about football from you and other exciting things.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.100]   Where do we get to our Formula One segment?
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.100]   New on the end.
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.100]   Coming up.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.100]   Coming up.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.540]   And I discuss racing.
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:48.980]   But first a word from Melissa, our sponsor, as the saying goes, announce a prevention.
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:57.060]   I should do this and announce a prevention is where it's a pound of cure.
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:00.780]   And that's really true when it comes to your data at your company.
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:05.740]   Identity theft and data breaches are a huge problem.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.060]   And I don't think I'm telling you anything you don't know.
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.980]   And if you're running a business, you need digital identity verification.
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.860]   I got the place to go.
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:14.860]   Melissa.
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:19.100]   Melissa, we've talked about them for years as the address experts, but really they're
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.300]   the data experts.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:28.740]   Melissa's electronic identity verification suite, EIDV, is a seamless, robust tool that
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:36.140]   helps businesses like yours tackle identity fraud and mitigate risk during onboarding.
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:40.620]   The solution includes three components for complete ID verification.
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:43.660]   Here consumer, personator identity and Melissa ID.
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.980]   So let me talk about those three.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:50.020]   There's personator consumer, which verifies customer and business contact information.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.140]   That's actually a really important step.
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.220]   It enriches your records with demographics.
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.740]   It connects your data for a complete customer view.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.900]   And it eliminates duplicates, makes sure everything's accurate.
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.900]   You get deeper insight, more effective business intelligence.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.300]   Getting the data in right in the first place is so important.
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:11.380]   But then you also have the personator identity solution, which verifies identities.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.580]   And it does it, by the way, completely worldwide.
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.740]   And this may be really important for you for legal reasons.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.460]   You get cross matching capabilities.
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.980]   You get watch lists screening this way.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:26.420]   You're compliant with any money laundering regulations or know your customer rules.
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:27.540]   Melissa helps you there.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.380]   So that's a big, big part of your compliance.
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.820]   Melissa uses a layered approach for their data quality checks.
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:37.620]   It utilizes a dedicated engine for each of those layers.
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:43.660]   And it corrects, parses, understands, names and addresses for safe customer onboarding
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.300]   while protecting your organization.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.340]   The real advantage Melissa has is it's unique.
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:53.180]   It's having separate data quality tools built into a single EIDV service.
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:56.780]   So you get it all kind of, but you don't have to do piecemeal it, right?
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.260]   With Melissa, you have access to flexible pricing.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:04.740]   You get complete contact data verification using global services at no additional cost.
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:11.820]   You of course get there very rightly, I think, widely known, award winning tech support.
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:12.820]   And it's there 24/7.
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.260]   They're really, really good.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:19.700]   They'll help you deliver a smoother customer journey, verify identities in three simple
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:20.860]   steps.
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.420]   You can save time and resources.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:26.220]   You can review and approve a customer's onboarding documentation quickly, less than
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.220]   a minute.
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:34.380]   Melissa's flexible multi-system workflow integrates with all Android, iOS and PC systems, as
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:37.740]   well as web form and checkout and mobile applications.
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:38.740]   They've been doing this.
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.740]   They're the kings of this, frankly.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.900]   They've been doing it since 1985.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.180]   Melissa, I guess it's Melissa, I should say the queens, right?
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.700]   Actually, it's a person's last name.
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.860]   But anyway, it's specialized in global intelligence solutions.
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:53.180]   The founder is named Melissa.
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:56.900]   Melissa is specialized in global intelligence solutions to help organizations unlock accurate
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:02.860]   data for more compelling customer view now for, what is that?
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.180]   35 years.
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.180]   More than.

[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.100]   Melissa continually undergoes independent security audits.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.260]   So you don't have to worry.
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.420]   Your data is always safe.

[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.060]   We are so happy to partner with Melissa.
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.340]   They've been with us for a long time.
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:44.980]   They really are supportive of the work we do here.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:45.980]   Thank you, Melissa.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.940]   And you support them right back when you use them.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:52.780]   And especially if you go to Melissa.com/twit because that's giving them the signal.
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.700]   I saw this on Twig.
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.660]   Oh, and that's good for us.
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.660]   Melissa.com/twit.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.740]   It's a great service for great people.
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.300]   Thank you, Melissa.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:04.300]   All right.
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.740]   Let's get back to the silliness.
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:09.100]   Oh, no.
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.100]   It's not silliness.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.100]   It's rage.
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.100]   We're going back to rage.
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.100]   Oh, rage.
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.100]   Gigi Sohn.
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.100]   How long?
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:19.740]   So Gigi Sohn was nominated ages ago to fill in his--
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:20.740]   Yeah, but I was at the Biden administration.
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.740]   --and not soon enough.
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.740]   --but, yes.
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:23.740]   Yeah.
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.660]   Well, to fill an empty seat in the Federal Communications Commission.
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.340]   She's a former Democratic FCC official.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:33.740]   She was nominated by the White House October 2021, OK?
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:34.740]   Yeah.
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.900]   A year and a half ago.
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:41.500]   But the problem is the telecommunications people hate her, which in my opinion makes
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:45.300]   her the perfect person for an FCC commissioner.
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:46.620]   Yeah.
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:52.220]   She has been consistently attacked and the Republican Congress has blocked her--
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:54.100]   Well, a couple Democrats also.
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.100]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.740]   Manchin and Mark Kelly, I thought more of him.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:03.020]   And yeah, there's a-- here's what makes me angry.
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.860]   OK, I get that politics is politics.
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:09.860]   But they also-- there was a lot talking about her personal life.
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:13.860]   She is a-- both-- she is a reformer.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:20.020]   I would say that she is a reformer who is understanding and understands the technical
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.700]   aspects of telecommunications at a very deep level.
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.860]   Like, I've had discussions with her about carrier aggregation.
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:28.020]   Well, you know it.
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:29.020]   I know her.
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.020]   She's great.
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.100]   She is smart and sharp.
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.700]   She is also gay.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:34.860]   And that has come up--
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:35.860]   Oh, damn.
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:43.380]   --several times, both officially and in this slimy, underhanded, like, astroturfi-lobbing
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:51.820]   way and the Republicans are-- and I am outraged that Gigi's personal life is part of this
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:52.820]   at all.
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:44:00.100]   And I just-- like, it's one thing-- yes, I knew that Gigi might be a hard sell because
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:06.500]   she is a reformer and she's very much-- you don't get to be in charge of anything in Washington
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:10.700]   having openly stated your opinion, right, and advocated for anything.
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:17.340]   You have to be as neutral as, like, I don't know, was something neutral.
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.340]   Water, bread.
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.340]   I was like--
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.780]   Like Stacy's mom.
[00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:22.780]   Neutral.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.540]   Neutral is a white bread.
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:28.740]   You know, my mom is the opposite of neutral, but yes, maybe the song.
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:31.420]   You just have to be incredibly inoffensive.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:34.420]   And yeah.
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.700]   Well-- I'm just so mad.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.180]   We lost such an opportunity.
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:44.260]   And we haven't been able to regulate anything at the FCC for the last two and a half years.
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:47.740]   Which maybe secondarily part of this, right, is not just--
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:48.740]   It is a hundred percent part.
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:52.380]   --he's on, but let's not fill this seat so that we can't get anything done.
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.780]   She is absolutely an advocate for net neutrality.
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:58.780]   And this is something telecommunications hates.
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:03.820]   But it's something the you and I and everybody's listening to show supports should support.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:07.180]   Yeah, she's very pro-consumer in all of her things.
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:12.860]   And she's not afraid to call out the fact that we have basically a monopoly in our telecoms.
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:14.300]   Sorry, not a monopoly.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.780]   We have a very anti-competitive telecommunications regime in the US.
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.820]   I do oddly, in effect, really.
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:20.820]   Yeah.
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.220]   Well, please, like anyone's getting DSL nowadays.
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:27.260]   You're either-- I mean, if you're in one of the few areas where they offer fiber--
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:28.260]   That's a good point.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:29.260]   Sure.
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.260]   That's actually a really good point.
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:31.260]   It used to be a duopoly.
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.260]   Now it's the common shareable--
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:37.100]   Gee, Gee was arguing that way before because she technically understood what she was doing.
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:39.100]   And what was happening in broadband.
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.740]   Oh, it's an acknowledgement.
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:46.420]   Unfortunately, it's an acknowledgement of the importance the FCC has to these companies.
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:51.220]   The power the commission would have if they were fully staffed and they weren't being
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:54.780]   so viciously and frankly, underhandedly opposed.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.940]   This isn't really about policy.
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:02.100]   This is about how we can undermine this.
[00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:03.780]   So it's a 2-2 split right now.
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:08.780]   Certainly the FCC has two Republicans, two Democrats, and then a chairman nominated by
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:14.860]   the incumbent party, the president, which would give it a 3-2 Democratic majority.
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:19.700]   That's exactly what Ted Cruz and Manchin don't want, right?
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:21.700]   So that's what we can--
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.620]   And I will point this out.
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:32.020]   The telecoms in the EU have managed to convince-- Marguerite-- how do we say that?
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:33.020]   Marguerite the Vistyker.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:34.020]   Yes.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:42.580]   They've managed to convince her to listen to their arguments that Netflix should be paying
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:46.460]   them for clogging up their pipes, basically.
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:51.580]   So this is an argument that we've had for decades now in the US where--
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:52.580]   And it's utter BS.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:53.580]   It's double bill.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.580]   It's double billing, man.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.580]   It's complete BS.
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:56.580]   Yeah, it's utter BS.
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:47:01.660]   But now the EU is like, oh, well, that makes sense.
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.660]   Okay.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:08.420]   So keep an eye on that, because if they succeed in the EU, they're kind of coming right back
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.900]   here and be like, well, maybe now is the time.
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:15.220]   And they did it during the pandemic because people were streaming so much Netflix while
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:20.620]   businesses were trying to also do work and the broadband pipes couldn't handle it.
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:26.660]   I mean, I guess-- I mean, look, it's appalling to attack her because of her sexuality.
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:28.140]   That's ridiculous.
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:34.860]   But I guess you could make the case that this is what makes America so great is that you
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:41.980]   can fight something like this by spending money on billboards in Las Vegas and advertisements
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:45.020]   in West Virginia and so forth.
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.380]   But it's not us making that money.
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:48.380]   No, I understand.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.380]   Or spending that money.
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:50.380]   It's corporations.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.380]   Well, okay.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.380]   But they have--
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.940]   Let's talk about Citizens United and what they did.
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:55.940]   This actually--
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:56.940]   How do you do that?
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:57.940]   I mean, I'm not going to do that.
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:58.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:47:59.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:00.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:01.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:02.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:03.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:04.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:05.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:06.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:07.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:08.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:09.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:10.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:11.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:12.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:13.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:14.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:15.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:16.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:17.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:24.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:28.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:29.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:30.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:31.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:32.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:33.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:34.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:35.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:36.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:37.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:38.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:39.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:40.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:41.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:42.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:43.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:44.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:45.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:46.940]   I'm not going to do that.

[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:31.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:32.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:33.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:34.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:35.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:36.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:37.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:38.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:39.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:40.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:41.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:42.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:43.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:44.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:45.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:46.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:47.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:49.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:50.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:51.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:52.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:53.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:54.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:55.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:56.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:57.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:58.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:05:59.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:00.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:01.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:02.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:03.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:04.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:05.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:06.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:07.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:08.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:09.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:10.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:11.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:12.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:13.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:14.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:15.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:16.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:17.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:18.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:19.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:20.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:21.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:22.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:23.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:24.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:25.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:26.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:27.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:28.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:29.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:30.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:31.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:32.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:33.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:34.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:35.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:36.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:37.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:38.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:39.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:40.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:41.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:42.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:43.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:44.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:45.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:46.940]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:50.940]   Oh, these people are dangerous and you need to pass bills against them.
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:55.940]   It's not really because trans people are dangerous to the right or to anybody else.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:58.940]   It has nothing to do with that.
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:01.940]   That's really the most important thing to understand.
[01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:08.940]   It's a way of getting people upset so that they will vote so they will vote our party
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:09.940]   into office.
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:15.940]   That's the real goal because nobody's worried about trans people making
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:17.940]   a bad thing happen.
[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:18.940]   It's not.
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:20.940]   At drag shows, perfect example.
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:21.940]   Who cares?
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:22.940]   Yeah, stuff going on in there.
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:26.940]   Who cares if somebody dresses up like a woman and does a show?
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:27.940]   That's fun.
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:28.940]   That's entertainment.
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:30.940]   Didn't you see some like it hot?
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:31.940]   It's entertainment.
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:32.940]   Didn't you see Milton Burl?
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:33.940]   It's entertainment.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:40.940]   But if we can get people upset about it, then we can get them to vote.
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:41.940]   They're voting.
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:47.940]   And then we can do what we really want to do, which in my opinion is to give the telecommunications
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:52.940]   companies free rein, eliminate regulation, reduce taxes.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:54.940]   It's a better than a smokescreen.
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:58.940]   It's a trick and it's a very effective trick.
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:04.940]   And unfortunately, the real sad thing is there are trans kids and there are drag queens
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:06.940]   who are completely and utterly harmless.
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:09.940]   Have you ever met a harmful drag queen?
[01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:14.940]   They are completely and utterly harsh who are being murdered, who are being prevented from
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:18.940]   medical care, who are being severely damaged by this.
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:22.940]   And it's all for a very cynical political ploy.
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:24.940]   And that's the exact example of this.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:27.940]   We'll leave race out of it because that's a hot button topic.
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:31.940]   It's the same thing, by the way, the same thing's happening.
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:35.940]   But no one can say drag queens are hazardous.
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.940]   They're not.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:38.940]   They're not.
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:40.940]   They could be hazardous to your ego.
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:43.940]   They're too damn beautiful.
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:49.940]   So I have to tell you, watch out because this is happening right now.
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:52.940]   Look what's going on in Florida right now.
[01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:54.940]   This is a pre-Nazi state now.
[01:08:54.940 --> 01:09:01.940]   This is a, this is exactly what was going on in 1930s Germany.
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:03.940]   Reid Hana Harant.
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:10.460]   And, and it is really concerning and I feel for anybody living in Florida, but especially
[01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:15.940]   if you're gay, if you're a minority of any kind in Florida.
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:18.940]   I know parents or trans kids in Florida and they just don't know what to do.
[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:19.940]   What do you do?
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:25.300]   You can't, and, and if you're a student and you want to read a book, you can't read a wrinkle
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:26.300]   in time.
[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.780]   I mean, what are we doing?
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:29.780]   That's nuts.
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:33.460]   And it, but I have to say, you know, after thinking long and hard, is this really because
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.460]   they hate drag queens, is this hate?
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:40.300]   Because they hate, no, it's about getting in office so that they can, they're real agenda,
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:41.300]   which is the correct.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:42.300]   I'm going to say it.
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:43.300]   I'm going to say it.
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:44.300]   And I don't mean it's a joke this time.
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:46.100]   It's, it is the essence of moral panic.
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:50.860]   You have, you, you convince people that there's something that is a threat to society.
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:53.020]   There's a folk devil who is that threat.
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:54.420]   Doesn't matter who it is.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:55.620]   It could be Jews in Germany.
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:56.980]   It could be trans people here.
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:57.980]   Yeah.
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:59.860]   Jews weren't the real problem in Germany.
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:01.940]   That wasn't the point, right?
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:02.940]   Newsflash.
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:06.860]   That's a really good example.
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:07.860]   Yeah.
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:08.860]   It's a really good example.
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:13.820]   And it breaks my heart because I think it's so damaging.
[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:16.820]   You can't read brave new world in Florida.
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:18.580]   What are you talking about?
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:22.340]   What are you, what are that's insane?
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.780]   Okay.
[01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:27.780]   We have to get off this because I'm just going to have to go drink right after this
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:29.780]   call and I'm kind of like dinner and do things.
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:31.860]   Put my desk and bottles empty.
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:36.220]   But what I'm saying, what I'm saying, what I'm really saying is this is an excuse not
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:40.660]   to drink, not to go unconscious, but to get conscious and to act and to do something about
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:41.660]   it.
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:44.660]   Because if you don't vote, this just spreads.
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.300]   It was the, it was the good Germans.
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:47.300]   Yeah.
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:49.860]   It was the good Germans who said, well, it's not going to affect me.
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:50.860]   It's not going to affect me.
[01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:57.220]   I think personally as someone who is younger and a little bit, I have to live in this, I
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:00.180]   can't count on dying and I've got a kid.
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:05.380]   I think in addition to voting, you actually have to get out and take action in terms of
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:06.820]   you have to go to the mattresses.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.540]   No, you have to go to protests.
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:14.340]   You have to actively call your regulators, your legislators.
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:19.460]   You know, the most important thing though is that you cannot despair because that's
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:22.260]   when they win, when you give up.
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:26.940]   You can't allow yourself to give up.
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:27.940]   Yeah, okay.
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:29.980]   And so that's what I would say to you, Anne.
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:30.980]   I know it's really tempting.
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:32.060]   I give up all the time.
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:33.060]   Don't give up, Anne.
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:35.500]   It's hard to, it's hard not to despair.
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.420]   And as it gets worse, which it will, it's going to get harder.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:38.980]   I'm going to continue to vote.
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:39.980]   That's, that's, yeah.
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:40.980]   At least.
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:41.980]   And be active.
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:42.980]   And, and, and, and I burn that right.
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:43.980]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:44.980]   I keep dropping ass splitives.
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:46.980]   Well, we're allowed to now.
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:47.980]   This one.
[01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:48.980]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:49.980]   We're, we're, we're the fifth.
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:50.980]   We're an A-richi.
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:51.980]   We're an A-richi.
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:52.980]   We must have been voked him.
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:54.700]   I must have said his name three times.
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:57.700]   He showed up in our discord, said it, what, what, what?
[01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:59.700]   You need me when he.
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:02.740]   I heard a he's going to be on a Twitter in a couple of weeks.
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:04.780]   So we'll get to say hi and talk about.
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:05.780]   Outstanding.
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:06.780]   All sorts of stuff.
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:07.780]   But he's going to be on the big show.
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:08.780]   Google knows all.
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:10.780]   Hey, heard you say it.
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:12.780]   Hey, speaking of Google.
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:13.780]   We do.
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:14.780]   Cool.
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:15.780]   Do we?
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:17.780]   Google I/O is coming May 10th.
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:20.220]   Did you get an invite, Jeff?
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:21.380]   Oh, small audience.
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.220]   They said, did you?
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:24.220]   Jason Howell did.
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:26.460]   And he's going to be going and we're going to cover it.
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:27.460]   Yes, Jason's going.
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:30.220]   Oh, I'm so jealous, Jason.
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:31.220]   It's one day.
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:32.220]   You know what?
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:33.380]   It's another one of these things.
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:35.820]   Should we do the, should we do the puzzle?
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:36.820]   What?
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:42.020]   Oh, no, I was looking for my thing.
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:46.380]   I was like, I didn't know where I think I got an invite.
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:48.220]   Look and see.
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:49.780]   I didn't really look and see.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:51.580]   You could come down for that.
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:53.780]   Spend a day with us.
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:54.780]   So we will.
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:55.780]   I mean, I could.
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:56.780]   Sorry.
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:59.260]   And if you don't, if you don't, you can come on with, in fact, I'd like to invite you
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:03.540]   to Jeff to do our coverage because we'll stream the keynote, assuming that they stream
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:04.540]   it.
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:05.540]   And we will have.
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:06.540]   Yeah, they're going to.
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:07.540]   They're going to.
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:11.980]   And I'm very pleased to say we will have Mr. Jason Howell.
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:14.580]   Jason, I used to have such fun hanging out there together.
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:15.580]   Me too.
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.820]   It was so much fun.
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:21.620]   It's not the Google I/O of years gone by this year.
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:22.620]   Right?
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:28.300]   Well, they're going to have to do better than they did with their.
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:30.540]   Bard presentation in Paris.
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:31.540]   Yeah.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.340]   Kinos will be live and available.
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:39.700]   We all have that presentation, Jeff.
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:43.900]   There was no Google I/O in 2020 because of the COVID pandemic.
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:48.020]   There was a small on campus stage in 2021.
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:51.420]   We covered it with Google folks there.
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:58.860]   They went back to the shoreline last year, but only had a few people at the event to watch
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:13:59.860]   live.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:01.420]   And it was a one day event.
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:03.300]   I think it's going to be similar.
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:06.340]   The quote limited live audience.
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:08.060]   Shoreline keynote Sundar Pichai.
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:09.060]   We don't know the time.
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:13.700]   I think 10 a.m. on May 10th.
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:15.220]   But this is where Google announces.
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:20.060]   This is I think, given how soon it is.
[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:24.900]   This is probably where we're going to hear more about Bard because remember, Google kind
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:28.460]   of missed the, missed the boat a little bit.
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:35.620]   Or Google very wisely said, we're the careful one where there was an awful one.
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:37.140]   Microsoft is not Microsoft.
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.140]   Well, they're saying it now.
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:42.180]   No, they were saying that they said it during the Bard presentation to.
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:43.180]   Yeah.
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:49.060]   You know, I was thinking Leo was thinking you probably hate this idea, but this being this
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:54.340]   week at Google, what if we had kind of a special show about what you would do to fix Google?
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:56.540]   Oh, who would we have?
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:58.980]   That requires prep, not punditry.
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:14:59.980]   You're right.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.980]   Oh, never mind.
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:04.180]   Oh, golly, you're right.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:05.180]   Shoot.
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:11.660]   I forgot all about that.
[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:14.500]   Could you do the prep for Stacy and then just tell us what we should.
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.060]   I mean, I could do some prep.
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:18.500]   I'm happy to give it a good thing.
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:23.740]   I'll have a good thing on it.
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:25.140]   Maybe do some interviews.
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:29.540]   Well, actually, I think part of this would be getting the right people on.
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.540]   Yes.
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:31.540]   Yes.
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:35.580]   People who have been outspoken like Mike Elgin, who says, so no, but tries the words CEO
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:37.980]   in Silicon Valley.
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:44.260]   Maybe we should get Blake Lemoine, the Google engineer was fired for saying no, no, no,
[01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:47.980]   but we can also use the fact that we have the zoom structure.
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:49.980]   Now we can have people call in for a few minutes.
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:53.260]   Oh, why don't you get what's what's her name?
[01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:54.260]   Timon.
[01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:55.260]   Timon.
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:56.260]   Yeah.
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:57.260]   Yeah.
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:00.500]   And it's Margaret special and Emily Bender.
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:02.620]   I think, I mean, to be fair, you're right.
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:08.180]   We're just pundits, but we have heard all of those voices on this show expressed, right?
[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:14.460]   We've talked about stochastic parrots and, you know, Timon, it's point.
[01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:17.420]   And I think we've represented them well.
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:22.300]   It was, it was a joke more in the sense that, oh, yeah, well, it hurt like hell.
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:27.300]   And I'm just like the prep, the prep work that we do here for like, I don't know if I'm
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:31.340]   doing the prep work where I would feel confident saying no, I mean, either.
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.340]   No, I agree with you.
[01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:36.300]   But I next Friday, the 17th, is stochastic parrots day.
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:39.260]   Oh, oh, do we get to go?
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:40.260]   Eric.
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:42.060]   That's stochastic pirates.
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:44.060]   Oh, dang it.
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:47.980]   Here's the Google IO announcement.
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:49.220]   There's something going on here.
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:51.540]   I don't know what this is.
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.980]   Usually they have a puzzle to solve, right?
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:58.860]   Okay, they're counting down the time.
[01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:00.940]   What's, what's this?
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:01.940]   That's the sound.
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:02.940]   That's mute.
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:03.940]   You know what a mute button is.
[01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:04.940]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:05.940]   What is this?
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:06.940]   I could change the beats.
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:09.780]   Wait a minute.
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:10.780]   This is 23.
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:13.420]   Oh, these are previous IOs.
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:17.660]   What the heck is this?
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:19.860]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:20.860]   Google's so cute.
[01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:22.820]   They do all this fun stuff.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:24.660]   Anyway, we are 60 days.
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:26.460]   I think whoever knows the couple's got laid off.
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:27.460]   17 hours.
[01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:28.460]   Yeah, right.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:30.860]   Four minutes and 14 seconds away from Google IO.
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:31.860]   And we will cover it.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.620]   We will live cover the live stream.
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:35.060]   We will have your art commentary here.
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:36.580]   I'll just stop that right now.
[01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:37.580]   Thank you.
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.140]   Don't stop it right now.
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:40.140]   Thank you.
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:43.380]   Yeah, ticking clock is going to make Stacy think the, the show should be.
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:48.580]   Well, you don't want that one way to hustle through the show would be do our, our second
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:49.580]   ad.
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:50.580]   How about that?
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:51.580]   That'll keep things moving along.
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:52.580]   What do you think?
[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:54.580]   Only an hour and 16.
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:55.980]   It's only four o'clock.
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:56.980]   What the heck?
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:58.060]   How could it be?
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:05.340]   Actually, I want to tell you about a new tool that we are using here at Twitch to prepare
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:08.420]   our as the tech guy show Mike and I are doing it.
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:10.460]   It's really cool.
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:12.020]   And it's a sponsor.
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.100]   I had not actually, I was not familiar with them.
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:20.300]   I think I'd heard the name, but I was not really familiar with them called Miro M-I-R-O.
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:27.380]   But we realized one of the hardest things about, about doing Miro, talking about Miro,
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:32.540]   about doing an ad for Miro is what is Miro, you know, because it's anything you want it
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:33.540]   to be.
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:34.540]   Well, that helps a lot.
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:39.300]   I guess it looks like, you know, at first glance, a simple digital whiteboard.
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:42.020]   But it's so much more than that.
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:48.700]   Miro is essentially a collaboration tool, a very, very visual online collaboration tool
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:57.060]   that teams can use for brainstorming to create a new product, to innovate, to organize meetings.
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:58.380]   They have timers built in.
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:03.860]   So you can just like Stacy did with the Elon story, you could time your conference call.
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:08.340]   They have all sorts of tools to help you.
[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:12.300]   They integrate with so many cool things.
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:14.620]   But I just don't know how to describe it.
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:18.540]   We're going to have to show you, we're working with Miro on an Ask the Tech guys board.
[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:21.820]   You could do it as a mood board.
[01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:23.460]   You could do it as a can-band board.
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:29.180]   So you keep track of projects, brainstorming, designing.
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:31.300]   You can use it for icebreakers.
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:39.100]   The best thing, maybe go to Miro and by the way, the website, Miro.com/podcast.
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.020]   So we get credit for it.
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:45.060]   And then take a look at what they call the Miroverse.
[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:50.100]   This is a place where others have posted their templates.
[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:55.940]   And this will give you kind of an idea of the kinds of things you can do, mind mapping,
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:20:02.540]   your balance quiz retrospective, empathy map, product designer, self evaluation, hyper focus,
[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:05.740]   character mix and match mix and match icebreaker.
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:07.700]   There are lots of icebreakers on here.
[01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:10.980]   They're fun things you can do.
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.660]   Some of them a little weird.
[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:14.780]   Here's a Beatles retrospective.
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:15.780]   I've mentioned this before.
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:22.540]   The weirdest one from me was the Harry Potter retrospective created by the UK government.
[01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:25.380]   But I think they did it for brainstorming purposes.
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:29.980]   There's a Chinese New Year from a lead scrum master.
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:33.140]   You could even play Connect 4 if you wanted to.
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:43.380]   A great way to plan, to design, to think, to make the kinds of work that we hate here,
[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:50.540]   that thing called prepping, the thing called thinking to make it easier so you can get the
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:51.540]   job done.
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:56.980]   And you'll all be viewing and sharing the same big picture, which is nice.
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:58.740]   Everyone will have a voice.
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:01.260]   Everyone can tap into that single source of truth.
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:05.980]   It's great for a team because your team stays engaged and invested and happy.
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:09.380]   It is a fun way to work together.
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:14.620]   Cut out any confusion on who needs to do what by mapping out processes and roles and
[01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:15.620]   timelines.
[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:19.860]   There's a swim lane template you can use or can-bandboard.
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:24.660]   Like planning is easier because humans are visual, frankly.
[01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:30.180]   This is a tool you can use on a big screen, on a laptop, a desktop, on a whiteboard.
[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:31.340]   It's a virtual whiteboard.
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:37.820]   You can use it on one of those Google TV screens they have to work together.
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:40.620]   But in a way, it's kind of like that even if you're in different places.
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:47.420]   For hybrid work, this is a great way of having all the team together in one space.
[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:51.580]   You don't have to worry whether they have legs or not because it's not virtual reality.
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:55.340]   Although I wouldn't be surprised if they have some ideas about that.
[01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:59.620]   Tap into a way to map processes, systems, and plans of the whole team so they not only
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:02.780]   view about how to give feedback as well.
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:07.940]   And if you are feeling meeting fatigue, you will love Miro because it makes meetings
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:11.020]   more fun and more effective and shorter.
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:17.380]   Miro users report saving up to 80 hours per year just because of those streamlined conversations.
[01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:24.020]   Are you ready to be part of the more than million users who use Miro every month to solve problems,
[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:27.060]   to get their work done, to have fun to play?
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:28.740]   Work should be play, shouldn't it?
[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:30.820]   It can be with Miro.
[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:31.820]   We'll show you.
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:34.140]   We're still working on our Ask the Tech guys board when it's done.
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:35.140]   We'll show you.
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:36.260]   I'm very excited about that.
[01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:37.900]   Get your first three boards for free.
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:40.020]   Oh, did I mention that?
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:46.020]   Your first three boards free so you can try it and really get a sense of it.
[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:50.580]   I think it's a great thing because it's, I know it's kind of like what it's very, it's
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:53.220]   whatever you need it to be, whatever you want it to be.
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:54.940]   You start working together better.
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:55.940]   Miro.com/podcast.
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:58.860]   Miro is M-I-R-O.
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:03.300]   Miro.com/podcast.
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.100]   Very cool.
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:06.500]   Very fun thing.
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:10.660]   And we started to use it as a company and really get a lot of mileage out of it, I think.
[01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:13.100]   Miro.com/podcast.
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:14.100]   Highly recommended.
[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:16.100]   Okay.
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:17.100]   Facebook.
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:24.940]   Remember I said Jan Lecun who's in charge of AI at Facebook, his first reaction to chat
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:27.140]   GPT was, "Well, we can do that.
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:28.300]   We can do that.
[01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:30.140]   We can always do that."
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:32.220]   Well, apparently they could.
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:36.260]   And now we know because their large language model has leaked online, it was posted on
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:37.980]   4chan.
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:42.460]   Facebook has been very, just like Google, very careful about it.
[01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:43.460]   Unlike Microsoft.
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:47.780]   They've been very careful about who has access to it.
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:51.780]   What they would do is you'd have to apply and they'd give you approval.
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:52.980]   Researchers have been using it.
[01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:56.260]   Government officials, members of civil society.
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:00.860]   Apparently somebody got it on 4chan.
[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:06.580]   It's the first time, according to Vice, a major tech firm's proprietary AI model has
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:09.820]   leaked to the public.
[01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:10.820]   Even when you usually check-
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:14.100]   It's actually due much with it.
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:18.340]   Well, it doesn't matter if a lot of people can.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:19.340]   It's just that they're writing-
[01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:20.340]   Some people can.
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:21.340]   Right.
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:23.460]   4chan members say they're running it on their own machines.
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:24.460]   Yeah, right.
[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:25.700]   It's the bomb plant.
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:26.700]   Yeah.
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:32.020]   And of course it's probably competitively difficult because I'm sure researchers from the
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:37.540]   other companies have immediately taken a look at it.
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:38.540]   There are different sizes.
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.540]   Is this part we know yet?
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:45.820]   No, I haven't heard from anybody who's played with it to see.
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:55.060]   But part of the reason is Facebook has been very clear that if you use this in any way,
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:57.580]   you're in deep doo-doo.
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:03.780]   There's issuing takedown requests and I think that they have said to some people, "You better
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:05.100]   not.
[01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:07.300]   You better not."
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:09.620]   The public, the long who's the CEO of HuggingFace.
[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:11.660]   That's the stable diffusion company.
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:12.660]   Vehicle diffusion.
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:16.980]   Yeah, posted a staff update from GitHub regarding the repository.
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:20.740]   Company meta platforms is requested to take down to this published model, characterizing
[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:25.940]   it as an unauthorized distribution of meta properties that constitutes copyright infringement
[01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:31.980]   or improper authorized use and cautioned users against not only using it but uploading
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:35.980]   any weights to the internet.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:40.300]   They acted, Facebook had been very quickly on this.
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:44.900]   And it's not something you can really, because I know it's not necessarily training, but
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:49.140]   you're still running a pretty large model, you need some serious compute horsepower.
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:53.700]   Not saying that, but it's not necessarily like something an individual could do, you
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:55.980]   need access to some.
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:26:04.460]   The one that I don't know because I'm in Moron, but I was stable, was stable diffusion
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:08.100]   anyway, which I have installed and used.
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:09.980]   You can download other models.
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:15.100]   They call them checkpoints, but you can download a series of, you can download a model that's
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:21.660]   trained on a series of images from anime, and then you have more of an anime flavor to
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:22.980]   the stuff that's generated by it.
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:24.980]   I don't know if it's in that state.
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:30.020]   It's not clear to me, but it is possible to boil these large language models down in
[01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:34.620]   such a way that you can use them with the proper front end.
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:35.620]   Yes.
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:37.740]   I think it didn't fall calm.
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:41.140]   Just say they're, oh, sorry, go ahead.
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:43.740]   I think they're running stable diffusion on a phone.
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:44.740]   It would be an Android phone.
[01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:47.340]   I have it right now on my iPhone.
[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:55.900]   There is a program free open source called Draw Things That's Stable Diffusion on an
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:56.900]   iPhone.
[01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:01.340]   So, Qualcomm had to tweak its stuff to make sure it was up to Apple.
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:04.340]   It works fine on Apple's, Bionic, whatever.
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:05.340]   Yeah, it works fine.
[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:08.220]   Anything with a neural processor should be able to do it.
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:12.500]   Let me see if I can find the, it's called Draw Things.
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:16.820]   If you've ever used stable diffusion, you'll recognize it immediately.
[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:21.540]   That's the stable diffusion interface, and you can even download other checkpoints.
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:26.620]   So you get to choose the models, and there's different versions of stable diffusion available
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:29.980]   and these models are big, 1.6 gigs.
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:33.180]   But there's quite a few.
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:36.180]   So this is the full stable diffusion running.
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:43.460]   And by the way, I should point out in reasonable time on an iPhone.
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:44.940]   This is an iPhone 14 Pro Max.
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:48.420]   I mean, it's the high end iPhone, but it doesn't take long.
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:53.620]   This is a little Christmas card I made out of cut paper, but that's a simple prompt.
[01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:59.420]   You can have more complicated prompts featuring Stacey's mom.
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:04.420]   What do you think it's going to do with that?
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:05.420]   I don't know.
[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:06.420]   I really don't know.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:10.220]   I don't know if we want to know.
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:12.900]   Bountains of Wayne spells their Stacey without the superfluous.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:14.580]   Oh, so it's not your mom.
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:16.260]   It's somebody else's mom.
[01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:17.540]   It's another Stacey.
[01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:18.540]   It's some other.
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:19.540]   Some other Stacey.
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:24.020]   And it has all the parameters that you normally have with stable diffusion and stuff.
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:25.020]   It's fun.
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:29.460]   It's, you know, so yeah, Qualcomm finally figured out how to put it on Android device.
[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:30.460]   OK, yeah.
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:32.180]   Well, I was like, we've had that forever.
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:33.180]   Yeah.
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:35.500]   Like, we can show it off.
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:36.500]   Yeah.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.340]   It does it in under 15 seconds.
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:39.980]   Can I ask a question?
[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:48.220]   I understand how large language models make tokens for words and data about the relationships
[01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:49.820]   among the words.
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:51.580]   How does a visual one work?
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:56.060]   What's a token in the learning set for a visual?
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:29:02.140]   It depends on if it's for photos versus videos, 2D versus 3D.
[01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:03.140]   The most basic.
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:04.140]   All right.
[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:10.220]   So like a 2D facial kind of model thing or even something like object detection, they're
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:20.540]   creating relationships between significant things on a face for facial recognition.
[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:26.020]   So they're looking for like eyes and so they're doing like the distance between your eyes
[01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:27.460]   and your mouth and your nose.
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:28.460]   So that's what they're doing.
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:31.540]   Are they trained on the idea of the eye and recognizing what an eye is?
[01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:35.180]   I think they pick out the eye on their own in the model.
[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:39.420]   Like you show them enough faces and they're like, well, all these faces seem to have.
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:40.620]   Yeah, these things.
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:46.860]   And then so to understand the difference, they figure out those relationships.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:52.220]   On like the 3D models, which are used for like video, it's more complex.
[01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:57.580]   And usually what happens is the computer is going, it will identify things like eyes
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:29:58.900]   and stuff.
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:05.820]   But then you're also writing code to recognize that the object has not permanent something
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:07.580]   beyond the flatness of it.
[01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:08.580]   Does that?
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:12.620]   Yeah, that's the word.
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:20.580]   There's a short video on YouTube, especially with a larger article from Louis Bouchard,
[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:22.780]   how AI generates new images.
[01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:29.500]   Gans simply put as Louis, L-O-U-I-S-B-O-U-C-H-A-R-D dot A-I.
[01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:30.500]   And you can find him on the computer.
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:34.500]   To generate new images, we use an architecture called generative, our dress, our own network.
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:35.500]   And guess what?
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:38.740]   He is a French, composed of an encoder and a decoder.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:56.180]   Both are code-
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:59.180]   I didn't understand you so.
[01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:03.420]   Anyway, you can watch this.
[01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:06.820]   Can we just, because Stacy, I feel the pain, I feel your pain.
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:12.900]   Here is a TikTok waffle maker.
[01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:14.500]   This goes on for quite a while.
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:18.380]   He's actually taking an old waffle maker that he bought somewhere.
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:20.380]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:22.340]   Okay, it's called a waffle iron.
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:23.340]   Waffle ironer.
[01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:26.180]   And waffles aren't flat.
[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:27.700]   Why would you use an iron?
[01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:34.700]   Anyway, he's going to clean it up.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:37.620]   I hope at the end there's waffles.
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:38.700]   I'm just hoping.
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:40.980]   It's seven minutes and 29 seconds.
[01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:43.740]   What did TikTok allow you to do seven minutes?
[01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:45.700]   It's been a long time.
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:46.700]   Look at that.
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:47.700]   Look how cleaned up it is now.
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:48.700]   Gorgeous.
[01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:49.700]   It's pretty.
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:50.700]   It's beautiful.
[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:51.700]   Oh, here's the batter.
[01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:53.460]   It does make us go.
[01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:55.660]   It's going into the waffle.
[01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:56.660]   Look at those.
[01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:57.660]   You've just heated it beforehand.
[01:31:57.660 --> 01:31:58.660]   Oh, listen to sizzle.
[01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:01.660]   Don't you heat your waffle iron first?
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:04.180]   You always heat it first.
[01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:05.180]   Look at that.
[01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:06.180]   Oh, that's good.
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:07.500]   It's going to squish out the sides though.
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.660]   He's put too much of the batter in.
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:10.660]   I think.
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:11.660]   Oh, no, maybe not.
[01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:12.660]   Look at that.
[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:14.660]   Oh, no, he knows what he's doing.
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:15.660]   He knows what he's doing.
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:20.900]   And old things never die is the name of this TikTok, which I'm going to follow.
[01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:21.900]   Absolutely.
[01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:22.900]   Old underscore.
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:23.900]   Stacey.
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:26.500]   That is not a beautiful piece.
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:28.660]   Oh, that's pretty.
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:30.380]   Is that like the Lije waffle?
[01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:31.380]   That's a little thin.
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:35.380]   He's putting some noisettic coco on there, little pom-pom-pom.
[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:36.780]   Oh, hello.
[01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:39.220]   Elated to the rest of us.
[01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:42.260]   That waffle fits in his hand is too small.
[01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:44.500]   That is too small.
[01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:45.500]   That is fair.
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:49.300]   I did already have my waffle for the show, so this was good that I saw this now.
[01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:50.300]   Because otherwise.
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:51.380]   Good for you, Stacey.
[01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:53.220]   I did it for you.
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:54.220]   Thank you.
[01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:55.220]   I have.
[01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:57.540]   I covered underneath the counter because we never do it.
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:58.540]   But one of those waffles.
[01:32:58.540 --> 01:32:59.540]   A hundred things you want.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:02.260]   It's a round Belgian waffle or the pour the thing in the hand.
[01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:04.260]   And then you wait and then you flip it over.
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:05.260]   Flip it a bit over.
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:06.260]   As a handle.
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:07.900]   Yep, we use ours quite regularly.
[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:08.900]   It's good.
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:09.900]   It's more so hard.
[01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:10.900]   It does.
[01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:11.900]   I used to use it when I...
[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:12.900]   The florries.
[01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:13.900]   Yeah.
[01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:16.860]   Before I realized it was making me extremely fat.
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:22.020]   And when the kids were little, because I don't mind making my kids fat, so yeah.
[01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:25.980]   Did you see Big's big story in Politico?
[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:28.940]   This was kind of a shocker about doorbells.
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:30.940]   The privacy loophole in your doorbell.
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:31.940]   Now, maybe this is a one off.
[01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:34.380]   We talked about this on our show forever.
[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:40.300]   I mean, this is an example of what I have long said about giving police initial access
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:42.180]   to these videos.
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:47.220]   Once you have a camera in your home, if someone decides there's a reason to subpoena that
[01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:48.580]   data, they can get it.
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:49.580]   They can do it.
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:50.580]   Not just that.
[01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:51.580]   You could have used that.
[01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:52.580]   You could have used that.
[01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:53.580]   You could have used that.
[01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:58.420]   And it was among 21 ring cameras in...
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:02.860]   He had 21 ring cameras in and around his home and business.
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:07.860]   The police were conducting, they said, a drug related investigation on a neighbor and asked
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:13.180]   for videos of suspicious activity between 5 and 7 p.m. on one particular night.
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.340]   He said, "Fine, I got it."
[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:16.780]   He sent the clips in.
[01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:21.540]   In fact, there was a car that drove by 12 times in that two-hour timeframe.
[01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:23.220]   He thought that was all the police would need.
[01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:28.180]   Politico said they asked for more footage now from an entire day's worth of records.
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:31.460]   A week later, he received a notice from Ring.
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:37.340]   The company had received a warrant approved by a judge saying, "We want footage from
[01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:43.620]   all the cameras inside and out."
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:48.540]   Either you want to or not, we're going to share it.
[01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:50.820]   So this is the biggest loophole of all.
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:57.980]   Not only can they come to you and say, "Give us the video," they can subpoena Ring and apparently
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:02.180]   they can subpoena with a phishing expedition that says, "Hey, while we're at it, let's
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:03.940]   see what you're doing."
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:04.940]   Wow.
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:05.940]   Yeah.
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:06.940]   Wow.
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:11.660]   This is why you don't put that sort of stuff inside.
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:14.180]   This is why I don't put that stuff in my home.
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:15.180]   Yeah.
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:21.660]   So Lisa, long ago, forbade cameras inside the house, rightly so.
[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:25.100]   We had cameras everywhere because I just was silly.
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:27.420]   I'm glad now.
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:35.620]   In fact, what could possibly go wrong?
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:39.620]   Then why would anybody want to see what's going on inside our house?
[01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:44.860]   Apparently, it doesn't matter because maybe something happened outside and they said,
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:47.580]   "Well, let's just see what happened inside too."
[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:52.660]   Well, if you start thinking, if you take this even further, you could say, "Hey, is
[01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:56.020]   this person maybe a person of interest in something else?"
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:58.500]   Maybe we can exert a little pressure on them by doing this.
[01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:00.660]   It's what we call a phishing expedition.
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:01.660]   Yes.
[01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:02.660]   And it's not lethal.
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:05.460]   Why would that be a problem?
[01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:07.860]   I don't understand.
[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:10.620]   Yeah.
[01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:16.820]   Apparently, according to Politico, all the US state privacy laws from the strictest regulations
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:22.900]   in California to the industry-backed law in Virginia include exemptions if law enforcement
[01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:24.460]   asks.
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:29.900]   So really, you're depending on the judge to have the sense to say, "Well, why would
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:30.900]   you want that?"
[01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:32.700]   And this judge apparently did not.
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:35.740]   Or you're depending upon the legislature to have done a decent job of protecting your
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:36.740]   privacy like good news.
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:38.500]   It was because of the last week's piece.
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:43.780]   No legislature in the state of any of the states has done that.
[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:49.540]   Congress has, Ed Markey actually sent a statement with the article.
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:51.700]   He's a Democrat from Massachusetts.
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:55.740]   They are part of an ever-expanding web of surveillance in communities across America.
[01:36:55.740 --> 01:37:00.420]   I've been ringing alarms about this company's threats to our privacy and civil liberties
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:01.420]   for years.
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:02.420]   Oh, good.
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:04.420]   I see what you did there, Aziz.
[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:07.100]   So this is something that's going to happen this year.
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:10.860]   Y'all shall all prep yourself just last week on Wednesday.
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:16.540]   The White House put out their national cybersecurity strategy for the year, and part of it was
[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:17.900]   privacy.
[01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:25.460]   We have historically, in the US, focused on cybersecurity as without looking at privacy,
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:30.140]   without regulating anything related to privacy, even though they are closely related.
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:35.580]   But this year, we're actually getting to that, we see it with the White House calling for
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:40.980]   legislation and rules around rulemaking, around privacy, individual privacy and data
[01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:42.980]   privacy for connected devices.
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:50.540]   The CSA, the organization behind Mater has started a privacy working group, and something
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:53.100]   else just happened related to this that I can't remember.
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:58.300]   Does that leadership really understand the difference between security versus privacy?
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:02.820]   I should point out that Congress did have a privacy law, which is killed in committee.
[01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:07.980]   But even that national privacy law had a loophole for police warrants.
[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:15.100]   Well, yes, although if you want to just get around giving giving company data to the police,
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:18.500]   you can just be like, okay, fine, we're just not going to do it.
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:21.460]   Like Volkswagen did with the carjacking case.
[01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:24.140]   Did y'all see this?
[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:25.140]   And then what happens?
[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:31.100]   Volkswagen, they basically, Volkswagen, a woman, she was pregnant just to add insult injury
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:37.260]   here, with a two-year-old in her new Volkswagen with location tracking was carjacked.
[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:41.860]   And when she told the police and they took the car with her two-year-old strapped inside
[01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:43.100]   his car seat.
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:46.500]   So when she went to the police, the police called Volkswagen and they're like, we know
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:47.700]   you have to find my feature.
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:49.380]   Can you please tell us where this car is?
[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:50.740]   There's a child inside.
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:53.140]   And this was the police, not the woman.
[01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:57.060]   And then Volkswagen, it wasn't Volkswagen.
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:39:02.700]   It was the contractor who's working for them under the service said, no, she didn't activate
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:03.700]   it.
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:05.900]   So you have to pay us $150 to get this information.
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:06.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:09.900]   And the police were like, okay, fine.
[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:13.540]   No, they actually paid the fee because they wanted to find the kid.
[01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:15.980]   But obviously that was not an ideal scenario.
[01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:20.820]   And now Volkswagen says that everybody who buys their cars with this service now gets
[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:26.020]   it for free for five years because they really feel bad about screwing this one up so much.
[01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:32.740]   So basically, so a Congress is never going to pass nor any state legislature a law that
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:36.860]   says, no, the police can't get it with a duly signed proof warrant.
[01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:38.700]   They're never never going to do that.
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:40.340]   So that's going to happen.
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:41.340]   Companies do push back.
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:42.740]   Even Ring pushes back.
[01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:46.900]   Ring says, you know, they've said no in the past.
[01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:53.740]   They've stopped reporting on how many they've said no to of late, but they have pushed back
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:58.460]   in the past and companies have the right to do that.
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:05.780]   But I think most of the time, why would a company go out on a limb to protect me unless
[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:10.300]   it became a problem for their business that nobody was buying Ring doorbells because of
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:11.300]   it?
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:15.780]   But why would Amazon go out on a limb if there's a warrant from, you know, law enforcement
[01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:20.700]   signed by a judge saying, give us Leo's inside cameras too.
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:22.380]   I doubt they're going to push back on that.
[01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:23.380]   Maybe they are.
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:24.380]   I don't know why they.
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:25.380]   Well, they do.
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:27.180]   They do have encrypted video.
[01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:28.860]   Scooter X just brought this up and he's right.
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:31.940]   So Ring tries to get you not to encrypt your video.
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:35.500]   I'll be honest because they're they explain all the things that will happen.
[01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:41.660]   But if they did encrypt the video, so I guess if you want cameras inside your home, if you
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:45.860]   turned on ring does offer the encryption service.
[01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:51.820]   Now the danger is that if you don't have access to your phone or the if you don't have your
[01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:56.460]   password and that sort of thing, you can't unencrypt it yourself.
[01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:59.500]   But that is an option for you to want to encrypt it.
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.860]   So I have a Google jail if you don't.
[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:05.420]   I mean, can the court force you to open up your phone?
[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:10.500]   If the answer on that seems to be no, then is it why?
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:13.940]   Yeah, you can't ask you for the password.
[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:16.500]   No, that's not a password.
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:23.020]   So in that case, then that would be precedent for not getting access to those videos if
[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:24.020]   they were already.
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:28.900]   This is why end to end encryption is such a hot topic and we'll go back to GG zone.
[01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:29.900]   Exactly.
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:32.460]   But this is why this is such a hot topic.
[01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:36.300]   I don't care what the fraternal order of police says.
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:37.700]   We need to have end to end encryption.
[01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:40.740]   This protects your privacy in so many cases.
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:42.820]   And that's a good thing.
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:45.300]   I have a hella Google hello doorbell.
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:50.580]   I've never seen any offer to encrypt my videos.
[01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:53.100]   I didn't put the nest cams back up though.
[01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:54.100]   I had taken them down.
[01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:56.460]   I think we still have one looking at me right now.
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:59.740]   We still have them here in the studio for security reasons.
[01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:04.020]   It's just, I mean, and maybe this is a completely isolated case.
[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:10.260]   But this guy, Larkin, quite reasonably is pissed because he has no say in this and all
[01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:14.460]   the footage that's set back up to the ring server from the cameras in his home and his
[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:20.660]   business are now being just, here you go, sent off to law enforcement, even though this
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:23.340]   is a crime that he has nothing to do with.
[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:27.180]   In fact, those cameras in the business aren't even in the same neighborhood, but they got
[01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:28.940]   it all.
[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:31.940]   That's just not okay.
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:38.940]   When I ran local sites, the worst defenders in subpoena, for information, for Chatter's
[01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:40.420]   IP addresses or cops.
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:41.420]   The police.
[01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:42.420]   Yeah.
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:45.780]   And it was cops seeking other cops who were gossiping about them.
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:46.780]   Oh, dear.
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:48.780]   Yeah, that's another problem.
[01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:53.180]   The lieutenant would say, somebody just broke me to say bad things about me and I'm going
[01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:57.220]   to find them and their asses and then come up for us.
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:42:58.220]   Great.
[01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:00.220]   We started erasing data.
[01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:07.020]   Yeah, as a journalist, I mean, you don't keep, like, I don't keep my notes.
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:12.900]   I have a very strict, like, every six months or so, if a story is done, I chunk my notes
[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:16.300]   because I don't want to have that information available.
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:19.100]   Which is a shame for the books you want to write or...
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:20.940]   I don't want to write any books, but yes.
[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:22.020]   Oh, you never know, though.
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:23.020]   You might doubt it.
[01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:25.860]   Well, once you write the books, you might say, I mean, I had that interview with Gigi
[01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:31.340]   Sohn and she became the first woman to live on Mars and I wish I had my interview notes.
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:32.420]   You never know, right?
[01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:33.420]   You don't know.
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:34.620]   Here's some good news.
[01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:35.620]   We need some good news.
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:36.620]   We're going to duck.
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:37.620]   Sure.
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:38.620]   Yes, we do.
[01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:39.620]   She's...
[01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:41.740]   Well, I know she has notes from an interview with Gigi Sohn, so I put two and two together.
[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:43.900]   That's all.
[01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:45.420]   The rest of the world, which is a...
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:48.020]   I have a good chance for us to plug restoftheworld.org.
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:49.020]   Which is amazing.
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:54.900]   It is a really great nonprofit news gathering site that's really...
[01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:56.780]   Good by Eric Schmidt's daughter.
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:58.500]   Eric Schmidt's daughter, okay.
[01:43:58.500 --> 01:43:59.500]   Yes.
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:02.860]   And the point of it really is to give more coverage to global stories.
[01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:09.340]   They just got $200,000 from Ford Foundation to expand coverage of how tech is impacting
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:11.940]   workers all over the world.
[01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:18.540]   This fellowship will help them hire reporters all over the world to enhance their coverage.
[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:26.900]   It's a one-year reporting fellowship at restofworld.org.
[01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:32.940]   I really need to check rest of world on my daily view checks because there's really
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:35.580]   great stuff, global tech stories.
[01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:38.780]   TikTok's viral monks are clashing with Buddhist authorities.
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:40.260]   I didn't see that one yet.
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:46.420]   Superstar monks have built massive followings, but dancing, singing, and fame-seeking are
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:49.500]   all violations of the monastic code.
[01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:52.700]   So don't should be TikTok-ing, buddy.
[01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:55.860]   This is a Cambodian monks.
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:58.060]   Wow.
[01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:01.300]   Bo Paisie has a nightly ritual after finishing his schoolwork and prayers.
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:06.060]   The 22-year-old Cambodian monk disappears into his room with his Android phone, locks
[01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:07.620]   the door and sits on his bed.
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:09.740]   In years gone by, that would have meant something else.
[01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:10.740]   But no.
[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:17.460]   Today, for hours, he edits TikTok videos for his 132,000 followers to watch before they
[01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:18.460]   fall asleep.
[01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:26.340]   And I have to say, because I have many friends who follow various monks and wise people on
[01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:29.220]   TikTok, that's good, right?
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:36.940]   He's spreading the Dharma in a modern way.
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:40.820]   And that's one more thing that will be gone when they ban TikTok in the United States
[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:41.820]   of America.
[01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:43.980]   As Senator, you remember that.
[01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:50.380]   Like you saw, Fitbit is killing off, according to XDA developers.
[01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:55.020]   Christine Pearso writing at XDA dash developers.com.
[01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:58.580]   Some of the best reasons to use a Fitbit.
[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:01.460]   The Verge reported this like two weeks ago, but yes.
[01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:02.460]   Okay.
[01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:04.940]   I'm just like an actual user.
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:05.940]   So...
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:06.940]   I'm just like an actual user.
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:07.940]   I got the note and I'm just a little bit close.
[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:10.140]   Oh, YouTubers are quite upset about this.
[01:46:10.140 --> 01:46:12.300]   But this is an old story.
[01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:15.860]   I mean, it's like two weeks old and I'll complain about it to anyone.
[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:16.860]   Yeah.
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:17.860]   It's not happened yet.
[01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:18.860]   March 27th.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:23.300]   Challenges and open groups will be removed from your Fitbit.
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:27.460]   Is this Google wants you to get a pixel?
[01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:28.460]   I'm sorry.
[01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:29.460]   Go ahead.
[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:31.460]   Do you see a benefit in removing challenges?
[01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:32.460]   Well, that's my question.
[01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:35.340]   I like that would be the...
[01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:38.820]   That would be the last thing to go because it promotes community, if you will.
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:40.900]   Forest folks trying to work on Fitbit.
[01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:43.820]   Google sucks at community, I guess.
[01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:46.500]   Or maybe they want you to get a pixel watch instead if they move.
[01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:47.500]   They do.
[01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:50.860]   This is them making Fitbit crappier.
[01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:54.460]   So we buy the pixel, which is already crappy and nobody wants it.
[01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:59.580]   And it makes me mad because I hoped that the Fitbit ethos of like decent stuff would actually
[01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:00.580]   make the pixel better.
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:03.180]   That's what I thought would be the footage.
[01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:04.180]   Yeah.
[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:06.380]   They did the worst.
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:07.980]   Screw them.
[01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:10.060]   I've had a Fitbit since they launched.
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:14.340]   I had the original one that had the little flower on it and like grew.
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:16.020]   Oh, I remember that.
[01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:17.020]   Yeah.
[01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:18.020]   I had that one.
[01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:19.020]   Yeah, that one was helpful.
[01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:21.540]   But my washing machine has had a lot of them.
[01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:24.100]   They almost all ended up in the washing machine.
[01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:25.100]   That's true.
[01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:27.940]   Yeah, those clip-on ones were dire that way.
[01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:28.940]   Because it clipped on your pants, right?
[01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:29.940]   Right.
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:30.940]   Yeah.
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:31.940]   Yeah.
[01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:32.940]   And then you'd watch-
[01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:33.940]   Probably not your bra strap.
[01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:36.660]   No, it's his man's ear.
[01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:38.660]   I like to learn.
[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:42.100]   I'm a natural kind of guy.
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:43.100]   I like to.
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:44.620]   But at all, hang on.
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:48.740]   We didn't mention when we were talking about Florida, the bill, this isn't even a, this
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:50.660]   is can't be a serious.
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:52.620]   This can't be serious.
[01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:59.740]   The bill from a member of the Florida state legislature Senate bill 1316 that would require
[01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:05.020]   bloggers who write about the governor to register with the state.
[01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:08.980]   I mean, come on, man.
[01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:09.980]   Senator, you're-
[01:48:09.980 --> 01:48:10.980]   They can bake it up.
[01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:13.580]   Everything new they can come up with to be more outrageous.
[01:48:13.580 --> 01:48:14.580]   It was.
[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:15.580]   What is it?
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:16.580]   Yeah.
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:17.580]   What, I mean, really?
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:21.020]   Are you so worried that somebody's going to criticize Ron DeSantis that you want them
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:23.020]   to register and then what?
[01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:24.020]   Then what?
[01:48:24.020 --> 01:48:28.660]   Anytime you make the media register, you are in the losing side.
[01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:30.660]   That's a bad sign.
[01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:33.140]   Blaten violation of the first amendment.
[01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:38.660]   But nowadays, it's worth a try, isn't it?
[01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:44.060]   You mentioned the cybersecurity strategy that Biden has presented.
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:46.460]   Now, the problem is it's not law yet.
[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:49.700]   We got to obviously code it into law to make it have any-
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:51.460]   Well, hold on.
[01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:52.460]   Yeah.
[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:55.380]   So this isn't designed to become law.
[01:48:55.380 --> 01:48:59.980]   This is to govern our government's approach to cybersecurity.
[01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:04.620]   And some of these things are already in existing laws and executive orders.
[01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:05.620]   So this isn't ever-
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:07.420]   This is like-
[01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:09.540]   This is its mission statement.
[01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:12.860]   And we're going to build things that follow the mission statement is how I would think
[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:14.340]   about it if I were you.
[01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:21.700]   So besides the privacy angle, which you mentioned, there's also, I think, a significant issue.
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:22.700]   Number three.
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:29.420]   Door number three, where the government says, "Now, so you remember, whenever you open
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:35.220]   a box with software or you download software and you ignore the EULA, the end-user license
[01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:39.220]   agreement, there's almost always in there a paragraph that says, "This company warrants,
[01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:42.340]   in no way warrants that this software is good for purpose.
[01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:43.340]   We'll do anything good.
[01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:46.580]   And if it does anything bad, we're not responsible.
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:51.260]   There's no warranty at all here that this works.
[01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:52.260]   They're not liable."
[01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:59.700]   In other words, well, this is one of the third rail issues that this new cybersecurity policy
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:00.700]   addresses.
[01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:05.860]   They are asking software makers to be liable.
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:09.540]   It says, "Companies that make software must have the freedom to innovate, but they must
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:14.860]   also be held liable when they fail to live up to the duty of care they owe consumers,
[01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:18.460]   businesses, or critical infrastructure providers."
[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:22.460]   Them's fight words.
[01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:26.980]   So this makes people are just, I mean, this is a huge shift.
[01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:34.060]   I will say, though, that we have in many industries over the last three or so years,
[01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:40.540]   we've implemented many regulatory, many laws that are like, "You need to do this.
[01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:43.460]   You should not have this in your designs."
[01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:45.340]   Car makers are liable, right?
[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:50.060]   If you make a car, the wheels fall off and everybody dies in a fiery wreck, they're not
[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:51.060]   off the hook.
[01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:54.380]   There's no software license agreement that says, "Well, we're not responsible for the
[01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:55.380]   wheels."
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:57.060]   That's most consumer goods.
[01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:58.500]   They are liable.
[01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.460]   Software is unique in that respect.
[01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:01.460]   Yeah.
[01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:04.700]   And they've had rules in place.
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:06.540]   So this isn't coming out of nowhere.
[01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:08.060]   They know what they need to do.
[01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:10.940]   They just now, and they're supposed to be doing it.
[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:14.860]   But now they're saying, "And if you're not doing it, boom."
[01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:16.940]   You're going to be liable.
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:17.940]   Good.
[01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:19.300]   And I think this is good.
[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:27.140]   I think this is like, what is the concept of fiduciary duty for developers who should
[01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:29.780]   be following secure by design principles?
[01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:35.020]   I mean, I don't know, it's not fiduciary duty.
[01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:37.660]   What is duty of care, I guess?
[01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:42.620]   And the other thing that's interesting here is they have a whole thing about insurance
[01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:48.980]   and trying to figure out, like, they're talking about a federal cyber insurance backstop,
[01:51:48.980 --> 01:51:53.580]   which is basically like, let's say there's a big ransomware attack or some sort of thing
[01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:54.580]   happens.
[01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:55.740]   It's a physical attack.
[01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:57.260]   And it shuts down an industry.
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:52:01.140]   And the insurance companies that people have contracted with for cyber insurance can't pay
[01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:02.140]   for it.
[01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:07.780]   Should the federal government step in and be like, "Yeah, okay, we got that."
[01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:11.260]   That's a really interesting kind of thing right there.
[01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:18.380]   Oh, there's so many other stories and I don't really want to spend another three hours because
[01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:21.180]   well, I just don't.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:23.700]   I do have a waffle, but I get you.
[01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:29.060]   I mean, Jeff, you put in so many good examples of chat GPT parlor tricks.
[01:52:29.060 --> 01:52:33.100]   That's kind of what I also wanted to prove why you should have a show about it.
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:36.780]   Well, but to me, it's just like, okay, so Alan Alda, who has a podcast.
[01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:40.260]   Jeff Tuck in GPT parlor trick show.
[01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:41.260]   Yeah, okay.
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:43.060]   That's an interesting show.
[01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:44.060]   Okay.
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:45.060]   You can host that.
[01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:46.060]   Yeah.
[01:52:46.060 --> 01:52:47.060]   All right.
[01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:48.060]   Yeah.
[01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:54.180]   Alan got a chat GPT to write a new mash scene and then got Hawkeye and BJ Honeycutt to voice
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:57.700]   it, which is kind of cool, I guess, but a parlor trick.
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:52:58.700]   The script nonetheless.
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:52:59.700]   Socked.
[01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:00.700]   There's probably more.
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:01.700]   Yes.
[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:03.700]   Oh, are you talking about mash?
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:04.700]   Mash.
[01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:05.700]   Yeah.
[01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:06.700]   That's it.
[01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:07.700]   I'm done.
[01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:08.700]   I'm not going to say anymore.
[01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:09.700]   I'm not going to play it.
[01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:16.100]   My commonators class, new class incoming class, machine learning 20%.
[01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:17.100]   I'm surprised.
[01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:21.820]   Next year, it'll be 30%, 50%.
[01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:23.380]   You can now have chat GPT is slack.
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:24.540]   I immediately applied.
[01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:26.860]   I can't wait.
[01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:30.860]   In the past, we've had Burke on free lunch Wednesdays.
[01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:31.860]   Ask for people's orders.
[01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:37.900]   Burke, you'll be glad to know from now on chat GPT, we'll be collecting food orders on
[01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:38.900]   free lunch Wednesday.
[01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:41.500]   So basically, he does office politics.
[01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:43.700]   And you ordered pork chops.
[01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:44.700]   Didn't you, Leo?
[01:53:44.700 --> 01:53:45.700]   No, I didn't.
[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:46.700]   Oh, I'm sorry, Leo.
[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:47.940]   You're dead.
[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:54.220]   Have you seen, by the way, at least two people I know, one a professor and one Chris
[01:53:54.220 --> 01:54:01.340]   Breen, who's a Mac expert, have been told that they're dead by chat GPT.
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:04.060]   You ask who, you know, tell me more about Chris Breen.
[01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:08.660]   It says, oh, all of nice things about Chris Breen, Chris Breen passed away in 2018.
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:12.420]   And it's like, what?
[01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:15.180]   It's just a strange place to go.
[01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:16.180]   Plug something.
[01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:19.820]   And I plug Matthew Kirschenbaum, who the author of Track Changes, a book we love, wrote
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:26.060]   a wonderful piece in the Atlantic called Prepare for the Textpocalypse, which he's arguing
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:31.140]   that we have thought we had a lot of text before, but now chat GPT is going to cause
[01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:33.500]   this tsunami of text.
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:34.500]   Yeah.
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:35.900]   And I think it's a wonderful piece.
[01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:39.540]   I said back in Twitter that I think that we were already there, right?
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:46.580]   Media were filling up the world with meaningless content, memos and letters and bureaucracy.
[01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:48.140]   We were already at too much text.
[01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:51.580]   Now in a way, it does us a favor by saying how meaningless it all is.
[01:54:51.580 --> 01:54:52.580]   Yeah.
[01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:53.580]   It's a good piece.
[01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:54.580]   Yeah.
[01:54:54.580 --> 01:55:01.220]   I think ultimately the uses of AI will end up not being creating images or creating text,
[01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:04.740]   but some other kind of variety of interesting.
[01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:08.500]   Creating software that we could all build ourselves to do the jobs.
[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:11.380]   That'll be some useful things.
[01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:13.380]   And some of these are just parlor tricks.
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:17.740]   I mean, AI is already doing captioning and translation on the fly.
[01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:22.380]   And it's very good, by the way, that those YouTube captions have got better and better.
[01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:27.620]   Oh, on our Google meets today, two things popped up for the first time.
[01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:30.420]   One, we had the option of using Bureau, by the way.
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:31.420]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:34.420]   I was like, no, so do you want to use it?
[01:55:34.420 --> 01:55:39.220]   When you use it, it's so cool because you can have a timer and you can do brainstorming.
[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:41.180]   Yeah, there's all sorts of cool things you can do.
[01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:42.180]   Our sponsor.
[01:55:42.180 --> 01:55:43.180]   So that was cool.
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:44.180]   Sponsor, by the way.
[01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:45.340]   Sponsor, by the way.
[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:47.460]   And then Jeff, you didn't see sponsor, by the way.
[01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:49.300]   We have to all of this.
[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:50.540]   It's the new rule.
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:54.660]   I'm folding your arms and say it.
[01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:55.660]   What did I do right now?
[01:55:55.660 --> 01:55:56.660]   I moved his lips.
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:57.660]   That's good enough.
[01:55:57.660 --> 01:55:58.660]   That's fine.
[01:55:58.660 --> 01:55:59.660]   What else?
[01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:07.020]   The biggest thing is they had real time captioning, which I've seen, but they had real time captioning
[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:08.020]   with translations.
[01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:09.020]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:10.020]   Which I hadn't seen.
[01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:11.020]   Wow.
[01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:15.140]   And I was like, well, but Stacy, you can't have any of that because you're giving up Google.
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:17.460]   So no, no, no, you can have none of that.
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:19.620]   All those wonderful things you just talked about.
[01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:23.220]   You can't use anymore because you're being nasty to Google.
[01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:27.740]   Well, that was that was our Google and our business, not Google in my personal life.
[01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:29.740]   Well, I'm sorry.
[01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:31.580]   Can't be too faced, Stacy.
[01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:32.580]   Too faced.
[01:56:32.580 --> 01:56:35.180]   You're either a Google friend or you're not.
[01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:39.020]   You're like one of those people who's like, if you work for Apple, you best be used in
[01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:40.020]   Apple gear.
[01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:41.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:42.020]   Oh, my God.
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:46.620]   But you can see you stuck.go with chat GPT.
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:48.260]   No, OK.
[01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:50.020]   Wisely though, is it?
[01:56:50.020 --> 01:56:53.260]   It's using just encyclopedias and Wikipedia.
[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:54.260]   Yeah.
[01:56:54.260 --> 01:56:56.260]   And by the way, sir, training material.
[01:56:56.260 --> 01:57:00.300]   Did your friend Leo LaPorte show you Niva doing this ages ago?
[01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:01.300]   I know.
[01:57:01.300 --> 01:57:02.300]   OK.
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:04.900]   I'm saying like, judging everybody's doing you guys.
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:09.660]   You guys, you know, first gave up Google search for duck.go.
[01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:12.700]   And so I'm just going back to your old hypocritical way.
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:14.260]   I'm loving Niva, by the way.
[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:15.260]   Five bucks a month.
[01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:16.260]   No, we know Leo.
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:17.260]   We know.
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:18.260]   Have I mentioned that?
[01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:20.820]   Can I invite a friend?
[01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:22.380]   Can I share the magic?
[01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:23.380]   Please.
[01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:24.380]   Please.
[01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:26.180]   Nobody wants to use your slow certain.
[01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:27.500]   It's not slow anymore, by the way.
[01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:29.380]   I have to say, I did.
[01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:35.940]   In fact, I think besmirch it in the past by saying, oh, because I'm going to just turn
[01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:36.940]   up slowly.
[01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:37.940]   Let me just show you.
[01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:39.940]   Who is Jeff Jarvis?
[01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:42.140]   I'm going to be alive or not.
[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:43.140]   Yeah.
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:44.140]   Let's see if you're dead.
[01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:45.140]   And then you see it's very quick.
[01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:46.140]   Oh, you didn't gain.
[01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:47.140]   Now speed enough.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:48.140]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:49.140]   It's much faster.
[01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:50.140]   And I like the results.
[01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:52.620]   But it didn't give it didn't give a paragraph about me.
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:53.780]   No, because you don't count.
[01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:56.780]   She's like, oh, she's.
[01:57:56.780 --> 01:57:58.420]   Oh, women, here we go.
[01:57:58.420 --> 01:58:00.060]   White American man.
[01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:02.500]   I wrote that.
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:03.500]   I wrote.
[01:58:03.500 --> 01:58:04.500]   I know.
[01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:05.500]   Thank you.
[01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:06.500]   Yeah.
[01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:11.660]   Anyway, there's some good pictures of you in here.
[01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:12.860]   Is that an AI picture?
[01:58:12.860 --> 01:58:13.860]   That's a really good one.
[01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:14.860]   I like this one.
[01:58:14.860 --> 01:58:15.860]   Look at these.
[01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:17.660]   Oh, I love that shot.
[01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:18.660]   That's good.
[01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:19.660]   That is nice.
[01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:20.660]   Yeah.
[01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:22.780]   Sculptly took one that is generally used that I hate.
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:24.180]   This one I bet.
[01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:25.180]   That looks like that.
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:28.220]   That looks like I'm singing an Aria, doesn't it?
[01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:29.220]   Yeah.
[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:30.220]   Is this it?
[01:58:30.220 --> 01:58:31.860]   No, I hate that one too.
[01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:33.380]   Yeah, no, this is good.
[01:58:33.380 --> 01:58:35.660]   If I look like that, I'd use it every day.
[01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:36.660]   You look gritty.
[01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:37.660]   Gritty.
[01:58:37.660 --> 01:58:39.700]   You look like you're in Jaws the movie.
[01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:45.740]   Like you're going to be like the old captain is going to take down the giant shark.
[01:58:45.740 --> 01:58:46.740]   Yeah.
[01:58:46.740 --> 01:58:47.740]   Yeah.
[01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:48.740]   Gritty.
[01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:50.740]   The gritty Jeff Jarvis.
[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:51.740]   Hi.
[01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:52.740]   Hi.
[01:58:52.740 --> 01:58:57.180]   But Facebook's bringing back Messenger weirdly weirdly.
[01:58:57.180 --> 01:58:58.180]   Mm.
[01:58:58.180 --> 01:58:59.180]   Mm.
[01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:00.180]   Mm.
[01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:03.980]   I think we should make a note that recode brand is dead.
[01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:05.780]   Yeah, that's kind of sad.
[01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:09.420]   That was started by Walton Cara, right?
[01:59:09.420 --> 01:59:10.420]   Cara, yeah.
[01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:11.420]   Yeah.
[01:59:11.420 --> 01:59:12.420]   The brand is dead.
[01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:13.420]   Yeah.
[01:59:13.420 --> 01:59:14.420]   Saturday on the.
[01:59:14.420 --> 01:59:16.820]   They're retiring the recode branding.
[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:17.820]   Yeah.
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:21.180]   I don't really understand.
[01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:25.980]   Tina and Vox and all these companies that really wanted to take blogs to the next level
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:29.140]   all seem to be, I think they're troubled.
[01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:31.420]   And this is they're kind of going the way of AI.
[01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:34.220]   Yeah, they're kind of thrashing trying to solve that.
[01:59:34.220 --> 01:59:36.780]   At some point you say we're spending too much money on other brands.
[01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:37.780]   Yeah.
[01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:38.780]   So we got to have one brand.
[01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:39.780]   Everything's going to be on that brand.
[01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:41.500]   I've seen that happening in companies before.
[01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:42.500]   Yeah.
[01:59:42.500 --> 01:59:47.500]   Well, and then of course private equity buys in as they did with CNET Red Ventures did.
[01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:51.580]   And then they fired a lot of people, a lot of friends from CNET lost their jobs this
[01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:52.940]   past week.
[01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:56.700]   And Connie Guillelmo, who is the editor in chief and has been on the show as many times
[01:59:56.700 --> 01:59:58.220]   has been booted.
[01:59:58.220 --> 02:00:00.540]   I think it's booted sideways.
[02:00:00.540 --> 02:00:01.540]   Maybe it's upstairs.
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:02.540]   Yeah.
[02:00:02.540 --> 02:00:05.020]   She's in charge of the AI stuff and no longer.
[02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:07.940]   After having been in charge of the AI stuff that got the.
[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:08.940]   In trouble.
[02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:09.940]   She's going to.
[02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:10.940]   Yeah.
[02:00:10.940 --> 02:00:11.940]   She wasn't in well to be fair.
[02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:16.100]   She wasn't in charge of the AI written articles on CNET.
[02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:20.860]   She approved it, but there was a guy from Red Ventures who was the point person.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:23.780]   And is he now the executive editor?
[02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:24.780]   Maybe.
[02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:25.780]   Yeah.
[02:00:25.780 --> 02:00:26.780]   I don't.
[02:00:26.780 --> 02:00:27.780]   It doesn't bode well.
[02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:35.980]   Connie, who's great, is now the senior vice president of Red Ventures in charge of AI content
[02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:36.980]   strategy.
[02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:39.180]   That's like a promotion to me.
[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:40.380]   It does sound like a move upstairs.
[02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:41.380]   It's VP.
[02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:42.380]   Yeah.
[02:00:42.380 --> 02:00:43.380]   It sounded like a pay raise.
[02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:44.380]   Yeah.
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:48.080]   I think the senior's editor in chief at CNET, she was the one who had to write the blog post
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:54.940]   defending the use of AI to write those articles.
[02:00:54.940 --> 02:00:56.620]   I think it's Jeff.
[02:00:56.620 --> 02:01:01.660]   Is it that advertising is the advertising dollars are dwindling for these blogs?
[02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:03.660]   Is that what's going on?
[02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:04.660]   Yeah.
[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:05.660]   Yes.
[02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:06.660]   I think so.
[02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:07.660]   I'm sympathetic on that.
[02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:08.660]   We've seen the same thing.
[02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:09.660]   Right.
[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:10.660]   I don't know.
[02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:12.020]   But nobody says digital ad sales are down.
[02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:15.420]   It's just I think that they aren't they're buying Google ads and Facebook ads.
[02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:16.420]   That's what they're buying.
[02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:17.420]   Yeah, they're buying programmatic.
[02:01:17.420 --> 02:01:18.420]   Yeah.
[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:24.220]   So anything that's you know, you have a sales staff selling the unique value of the Twitter
[02:01:24.220 --> 02:01:25.220]   number.
[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:26.220]   What the hell was that?
[02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:28.620]   Miss Stacy, you shouldn't you do Stacy was closing.
[02:01:28.620 --> 02:01:30.620]   Sorry, I was just making.
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:32.620]   Why were you scratching?
[02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:34.620]   Don't scratch in the wind.
[02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:35.620]   Scratch in your windscreen.
[02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:36.620]   That's all I do.
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:37.620]   I just.
[02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:45.620]   After a certain point in time, you lose me and then I'm like, what's this guy here?
[02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:47.620]   Let's see what it is.
[02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:48.620]   I'm sorry.
[02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:49.620]   All right.
[02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:50.620]   I just I just.
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:51.620]   Let's do a quick change log.
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:52.620]   Get the hell out of that.
[02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:54.620]   That means it's change log time.
[02:01:54.620 --> 02:01:55.620]   It's change log time.
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:02:04.420]   Daisy's is twiddle time for Stacy.
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:10.220]   I'll leak my friends of the March 2023 pixer feature gop.
[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:12.220]   It's not.
[02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:16.220]   Let me just check if I had a stroke.
[02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:18.420]   Nope, I can raise both hands.
[02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:20.820]   The pixel feature drop.
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:23.620]   They do this, you know, they anyway, who cares.
[02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:26.220]   The last test is what it's called.
[02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:27.220]   Sorry.
[02:02:27.220 --> 02:02:28.220]   Okay.
[02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:29.220]   Pixel.
[02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:30.220]   It's smile too, right?
[02:02:30.220 --> 02:02:31.220]   What is it?
[02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:32.220]   L.A.S.T.
[02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:33.220]   is that an acronym?
[02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:36.580]   L.A.S.T. is it's a shorter version of the smile.
[02:02:36.580 --> 02:02:39.340]   It's like smile and raise your arms and there's one other step.
[02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:42.940]   Why need to know that they had my father do it just yesterday?
[02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:44.820]   Why is that a test?
[02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:47.420]   Because you can't control your muscles and your extremities.
[02:02:47.420 --> 02:02:55.580]   Typically a stroke, you lose some bilateral functionality.
[02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:58.740]   So when you smile, it'll be like this or you raise your arms.
[02:02:58.740 --> 02:03:00.540]   It'll be like one arm.
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:02.540]   That's not anything.
[02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:03.540]   I don't know.
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:04.540]   I'm not a doctor.
[02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:08.780]   Google rolling out Android 14 developer preview two.
[02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:13.580]   You want a gallery of everything new in Android 14 preview developer two?
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:17.780]   Apparently, it's all pineapple flavored.
[02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:19.780]   Huh?
[02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:20.780]   Huh?
[02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:24.220]   Moji lab wallpaper creator.
[02:03:24.220 --> 02:03:26.580]   We really reached peak smartphone.
[02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:29.900]   None of this stuff is going to change anybody's experience.
[02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:33.180]   Unless it's a rolling screen.
[02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:37.100]   Well, and yes, okay.
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:39.780]   I guess this should be in the change log.
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:42.140]   Somebody saw, let me get it for you here.
[02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:43.700]   Those are the worst pictures.
[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:46.980]   Somebody saw these are the worst pictures.
[02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:50.340]   The latest Pixel fold leak.
[02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:53.060]   Are you ready for the pictures?
[02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:54.060]   That's it.
[02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:55.060]   I'm a terrible.
[02:03:55.060 --> 02:04:02.620]   So this is somebody is on a subway.
[02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:06.340]   And the New York City subway got four shots.
[02:04:06.340 --> 02:04:10.140]   The bottom right, you can make out the curve of the screen and the top.
[02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:11.980]   You can roughly see the outer displays edge.
[02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:14.180]   Then a metallic reflective hinge.
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:15.420]   Hinge is key.
[02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:21.700]   I don't know why they think this is not a galaxy fold, but the Google Pixel fold.
[02:04:21.700 --> 02:04:28.140]   But the Redditor says they saw the camera bump bar, which is actually very that does
[02:04:28.140 --> 02:04:29.380]   make it like a pixel, right?
[02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:33.420]   You've seen the back of the Pixel seven, Pixel six.
[02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:34.860]   Is it the pixel fold?
[02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:35.860]   There are rumors.
[02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:40.940]   In fact, this might be why you want to pay attention to this Google I/O keynote.
[02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:45.180]   Maybe this is when they start talking about a folding screen from Google.
[02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:49.340]   I think they're going to I started talking and you shatted me down about perhaps talking
[02:04:49.340 --> 02:04:53.980]   about Google bard and and how they're going to shout.
[02:04:53.980 --> 02:04:55.380]   Shout me down.
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:56.380]   You didn't.
[02:04:56.380 --> 02:04:58.380]   You did it in your mind.
[02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:00.380]   You shatted me down.
[02:05:00.380 --> 02:05:01.620]   Oh, you're so paranoid.
[02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:02.620]   I'm very sensitive.
[02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:04.780]   Speaking of paranoia, you know, that go back to that picture for a second.
[02:05:04.780 --> 02:05:09.380]   I bet there's now a security alert out all Google employees where the bad taste where
[02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:13.020]   gold pants report to the security office.
[02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:15.660]   Well, they do this is typical.
[02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:20.260]   We see these because before you release a phone, you got to get out in the wild and you got
[02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:22.020]   to get people trying it.
[02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:23.020]   Apple does it.
[02:05:23.020 --> 02:05:24.700]   Samsung does everybody does it.
[02:05:24.700 --> 02:05:28.820]   That usually they put it in a case that makes it look like nothing.
[02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:31.860]   But in this case, it looks like maybe we've seen the first shots.
[02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:34.260]   How could you see anything with that photo?
[02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:36.140]   There's nothing identifiable with the phone.
[02:05:36.140 --> 02:05:39.340]   It could be a trio for all you know.
[02:05:39.340 --> 02:05:40.340]   Exactly.
[02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:41.340]   Thank you.
[02:05:41.340 --> 02:05:42.980]   That doesn't look like anything.
[02:05:42.980 --> 02:05:43.980]   It looks like nothing.
[02:05:43.980 --> 02:05:45.860]   Note Google begins rolling out.
[02:05:45.860 --> 02:05:46.940]   It's what the C.
[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:47.940]   Shaft me down.
[02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:49.340]   It says is creating stories.
[02:05:49.340 --> 02:05:50.660]   Now I'm shouting you down.
[02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:51.660]   Now I'm shouting you down.
[02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:54.260]   Now you can recognize when you're shouted down.
[02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:55.860]   My mother watches this show.
[02:05:55.860 --> 02:05:58.060]   By the way, I mentioned that story.
[02:05:58.060 --> 02:05:59.060]   So it's my fault.
[02:05:59.060 --> 02:06:00.060]   The tree.
[02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:01.060]   Okay.
[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:02.060]   Yes, that's right.
[02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:03.060]   It wasn't even in the change.
[02:06:03.060 --> 02:06:04.060]   But I had forgotten.
[02:06:04.060 --> 02:06:05.060]   So it's good to do it.
[02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:08.980]   Google begins rolling out its new look for docs and other workspace apps.
[02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:10.940]   Google one begins.
[02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:14.180]   I'm sorry.
[02:06:14.180 --> 02:06:15.180]   I'm a little late.
[02:06:15.180 --> 02:06:16.180]   Google one.
[02:06:16.180 --> 02:06:19.580]   Let me scratch my microphone for you.
[02:06:19.580 --> 02:06:21.780]   Why does Stacy sound different than mine?
[02:06:21.780 --> 02:06:22.980]   Mine is kind of a soprano.
[02:06:22.980 --> 02:06:23.980]   Hersful Warly.
[02:06:23.980 --> 02:06:24.980]   I'm a boy.
[02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:26.700]   It was more of a tone.
[02:06:26.700 --> 02:06:28.380]   There's a little bit of a bong in there too.
[02:06:28.380 --> 02:06:29.380]   Like a bong.
[02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:30.380]   Yeah it was.
[02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:31.380]   It was.
[02:06:31.380 --> 02:06:32.380]   I was just.
[02:06:32.380 --> 02:06:39.820]   I really not cut out for this job.
[02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:44.540]   What do you hear?
[02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:51.700]   Google one brings a VPN to its buck 99 month plan, adding dark web into monitoring.
[02:06:51.700 --> 02:06:55.020]   Pixel Buds Pro Spatial Audio with head tracking update is rolling out.
[02:06:55.020 --> 02:06:56.820]   Do you still use your Pixel Buds, Jeff?
[02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:57.820]   Or have you.
[02:06:57.820 --> 02:06:58.820]   You do.
[02:06:58.820 --> 02:06:59.820]   You do.
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:00.820]   So I do.
[02:07:00.820 --> 02:07:02.060]   They work for spatial.
[02:07:02.060 --> 02:07:09.740]   The Android 15, which is V, we believe nine to five Google says is V.
[02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:10.740]   Vanilla ice cream.
[02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:13.340]   You don't always have to have a dessert.
[02:07:13.340 --> 02:07:16.300]   Vanilla ice cream.
[02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:20.140]   And Google has launched a new Google Trends Portal.
[02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:22.420]   I think Google Trends is actually quite useful.
[02:07:22.420 --> 02:07:24.420]   I like Google Trends, don't you?
[02:07:24.420 --> 02:07:25.420]   It's fun.
[02:07:25.420 --> 02:07:26.420]   I'm generalist.
[02:07:26.420 --> 02:07:27.420]   Would enjoy that.
[02:07:27.420 --> 02:07:28.420]   Yeah.
[02:07:28.420 --> 02:07:29.420]   See what people are talking about.
[02:07:29.420 --> 02:07:30.420]   Yeah, it's very useful.
[02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:33.780]   So there's a new, I guess a new portal to that.
[02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:35.380]   You can see what people are searching for.
[02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:39.980]   This is one of the things Google does that's actually the, you know, awesome.
[02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:46.580]   It's just the ability to see like the top search topics right now, you know, and what's
[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:48.220]   going up and what's going down.
[02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:51.300]   And you could see in different, different jurisdictions and stuff.
[02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:54.820]   So it's very, I think this is a great tool.
[02:07:54.820 --> 02:07:56.100]   Trends.google.com.
[02:07:56.100 --> 02:08:00.900]   And that's a very brief Google change log.
[02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:01.900]   Mm.
[02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:05.140]   Solid minus the phone.
[02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:06.140]   The phone.
[02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:07.140]   The phone.
[02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:08.140]   The phone.
[02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:09.140]   The phone.
[02:08:09.140 --> 02:08:11.740]   You know, I'm sorry, my system.
[02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:12.740]   Oh, wait.
[02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:15.060]   Actually, there, there was a cool thing that Scooter X put in.
[02:08:15.060 --> 02:08:17.900]   I just want to stick this in here because this drives me nuts.
[02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:18.900]   Thank you.
[02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:19.900]   I'm a parent.
[02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:20.900]   Yeah.
[02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:21.900]   Thank you, Mr. Scooter X.
[02:08:21.900 --> 02:08:23.140]   See, we do read your stuff and we're like, Oh, that is good.
[02:08:23.140 --> 02:08:24.740]   God, you make fun of me for how many links?
[02:08:24.740 --> 02:08:26.540]   Look at all those links.
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:27.540]   The chum.
[02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:32.300]   Google Chrome is making it easier to delete auto fill data.
[02:08:32.300 --> 02:08:33.540]   And you know what?
[02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:34.540]   Thank goodness.
[02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:37.860]   So it's basically, you know, how it's got all the auto fill.
[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:38.860]   Yeah.
[02:08:38.860 --> 02:08:43.860]   Let's say you move or something happens, then it's like still trying to bring up your old
[02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:46.660]   stuff used to have to go like to this.
[02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:47.660]   You had to go someplace.
[02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:51.300]   I remember going several screens and now.
[02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:54.140]   There's a little trash can icon.
[02:08:54.140 --> 02:08:55.700]   Oh, that's great.
[02:08:55.700 --> 02:08:57.420]   Oh, that is nice.
[02:08:57.420 --> 02:08:58.420]   Okay.
[02:08:58.420 --> 02:08:59.420]   Sorry.
[02:08:59.420 --> 02:09:00.420]   Yeah.
[02:09:00.420 --> 02:09:03.620]   Because that is really annoying or like when your credit card number, well, now you don't,
[02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:05.220]   you know, it's not going to be a lot of changes, but it used to not.
[02:09:05.220 --> 02:09:07.420]   It wasn't part of like the formal Google thing.
[02:09:07.420 --> 02:09:08.900]   Don't go running looking for it though.
[02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:13.340]   It's currently in the works only for desktop, including Windows, Mac OS, Linux and Chrome
[02:09:13.340 --> 02:09:14.340]   OS.
[02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:17.660]   In any case, Stacy can't have it because she doesn't want to use Google.
[02:09:17.660 --> 02:09:20.740]   So you never, you're going to never let her in.
[02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:21.740]   I know.
[02:09:21.740 --> 02:09:23.740]   I'm going to just work with you.
[02:09:23.740 --> 02:09:24.740]   All right.
[02:09:24.740 --> 02:09:27.180]   That's it for the rest of my life.
[02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:28.180]   All right.
[02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:32.660]   Let's, let's, let's all just take a breath to scratch our screen.
[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:33.660]   Uh, protectors.
[02:09:33.660 --> 02:09:34.660]   Pop filters.
[02:09:34.660 --> 02:09:37.260]   Stacy, would you do yours again?
[02:09:37.260 --> 02:09:38.260]   Because it didn't sound different.
[02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:39.540]   I want to hear how it sounded.
[02:09:39.540 --> 02:09:40.540]   How did you do that?
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:43.380]   Well, so I wasn't intentionally scratching it to make noise.
[02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:44.380]   I was just curious.
[02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:45.900]   So this is a curious scratch.
[02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:46.900]   Wow.
[02:09:46.900 --> 02:09:47.900]   Wow.
[02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:48.900]   That's a fingernail.
[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:50.900]   That is clearly a fingernail.
[02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:52.300]   Oh, that is a dale.
[02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:53.300]   Yeah.
[02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:57.100]   And I'm thinking she, she doesn't have quite as fine a grain to pop filter as we do.
[02:09:57.100 --> 02:09:58.780]   Hers might be a little more textured.
[02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:06.740]   But I like how the sound changes.
[02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:07.740]   Probably a low point.
[02:10:07.740 --> 02:10:12.500]   I'm going to say in all of these episodes.
[02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:17.500]   I'm really watching the podcast and all they're scratching her.
[02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:19.620]   I can't just have a squirrel moment.
[02:10:19.620 --> 02:10:27.620]   I can't think of another podcast where this has become a part of the show.
[02:10:27.620 --> 02:10:29.940]   I don't have a persona for the show.
[02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:30.940]   It's just the.
[02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:32.940]   I look forward to all the messages.
[02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:34.500]   Oh, no, this is your persona.
[02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:36.460]   That's a great one.
[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:37.460]   Joy of it.
[02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:38.460]   Yeah.
[02:10:38.460 --> 02:10:39.460]   What?
[02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:40.980]   What is your, it's like what was it?
[02:10:40.980 --> 02:10:43.980]   Eugene Levy, they talked about doing a travel show.
[02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:45.380]   He said, no, I hate traveling.
[02:10:45.380 --> 02:10:46.700]   They said, that's the show.
[02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:47.700]   And they did it.
[02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:49.540]   That's what they did.
[02:10:49.540 --> 02:10:51.380]   It's on Apple TV now.
[02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:55.300]   And the promo, the very first thing says, I'm here in Antarctica.
[02:10:55.300 --> 02:11:01.300]   And the first thing that comes to mind is why am I here in Antarctica?
[02:11:01.300 --> 02:11:04.100]   It's probably a great show because he's very funny, of course.
[02:11:04.100 --> 02:11:05.100]   Hey, everybody.
[02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:10.860]   It's Leo LePort, the founder and host of many of the Twitch podcasts.
[02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:15.660]   I don't normally talk to you about advertising, but I want to take a moment to do that right
[02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:17.380]   now.
[02:11:17.380 --> 02:11:22.140]   Our mission statement at Twitch, we're dedicated to building a highly engaged community of
[02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:24.180]   tech enthusiasts.
[02:11:24.180 --> 02:11:29.140]   It's our audience and you, I guess, since you're listening, by offering them the knowledge they
[02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:33.300]   need to understand and use technology in today's world.
[02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:38.860]   To do that, we also create partnerships with trusted brands and make important introductions
[02:11:38.860 --> 02:11:40.340]   between them and our audience.
[02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:45.180]   That's how we finance our podcasts, but it's also, and our audience tells us this all the
[02:11:45.180 --> 02:11:46.180]   time.
[02:11:46.180 --> 02:11:51.700]   A part of the service we offer, it's a valued bit of information for our audience members.
[02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:55.780]   They want to know about great brands like yours.
[02:11:55.780 --> 02:12:01.660]   So can we help you by introducing you to our highly qualified audience?
[02:12:01.660 --> 02:12:06.660]   And why do you get a lot with advertising on the Twitch podcasts?
[02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:10.260]   Partnering with Twitch means you're going to get, if I may say so, humbly the gold standard
[02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:12.340]   in podcast advertising.
[02:12:12.340 --> 02:12:14.500]   And we throw in a lot of valuable services.
[02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:19.820]   You get a full service continuity team supporting everything from copywriting to graphic design.
[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:24.380]   I don't think anybody else does this or does this as well as we do.
[02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:27.900]   You get ads that are embedded in our content that are unique every time.
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:29.980]   I read them, our hosts read them.

[02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:07.700]   People like me and our other hosts talking about your products sincerely and informationally.
[02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:09.460]   Those are incredibly valuable.

[02:13:12.740 --> 02:13:14.340]   thousands of fans.

[02:13:21.580 --> 02:13:25.420]   But let me tell you, we are looking for an advertising partner that's going to be with
[02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:26.900]   this long term.
[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:29.060]   Visit twitter.tv/advertise.
[02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:30.820]   Check out our partner testimonials.
[02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:33.460]   Tim Broome, founder of ITProTV.
[02:13:33.460 --> 02:13:41.940]   They started ITProTV in 2013, immediately started advertising with us and grew that company
[02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:44.620]   to a really amazing success.
[02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:47.900]   Hundreds of thousands of ongoing customers.
[02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:52.180]   They've been on our network for more than 10 years and they say, and I'll quote Tim,
[02:13:52.180 --> 02:13:54.540]   we would not be where we are today without the Twit Network.
[02:13:54.540 --> 02:13:55.940]   That's just one example.
[02:13:55.940 --> 02:13:58.860]   Mark McCrory, who's the CEO of Authentic.
[02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:02.780]   He was actually one of the first people to buy ads on our network.
[02:14:02.780 --> 02:14:05.140]   He's been with us for 16 years.
[02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:10.180]   He said, and I'm quoting, "The feedback from many advertisers over those 16 years across
[02:14:10.180 --> 02:14:15.940]   a range of product categories is that if ads and podcasts are going to work for a brand,
[02:14:15.940 --> 02:14:17.780]   they're going to work on Twit shows."
[02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:24.700]   I'm proud to say that the ads we do over deliver, they work really well because they're honest,
[02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:25.940]   they have integrity.
[02:14:25.940 --> 02:14:29.540]   Our audience trusts us and we say, this is a great product.
[02:14:29.540 --> 02:14:30.540]   They believe it.
[02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:31.660]   They listen.
[02:14:31.660 --> 02:14:33.500]   Our listeners are highly intelligent.
[02:14:33.500 --> 02:14:34.500]   They're heavily engaged.
[02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:36.100]   They're tech savvy.
[02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:37.940]   They're dedicated to our network.
[02:14:37.940 --> 02:14:43.140]   That's partly because we only work with high integrity partners that we have thoroughly
[02:14:43.140 --> 02:14:45.380]   and personally vetted.
[02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:49.300]   I approved every single advertiser on the network.
[02:14:49.300 --> 02:14:52.820]   If you're ready to elevate your brand and you've got a great product, I want you to
[02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:57.260]   reach out to us, advertise at Twit.TV.
[02:14:57.260 --> 02:15:00.340]   I want you to break out of the advertising norm.
[02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:05.500]   Grow your brand with host red authentic ads on Twit.TV.
[02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:12.220]   Visit twit.tv/advertise for more details or email us, advertise at twit.tv if you're
[02:15:12.220 --> 02:15:14.860]   ready to launch your campaign now.
[02:15:14.860 --> 02:15:21.820]   I think this would be a good time now that we've all checked our pop filters to do the
[02:15:21.820 --> 02:15:27.420]   back of the book and it is going to kick things off with, we are going to kick things
[02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:30.220]   off with Stacey's thing.
[02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:31.220]   Stacey?
[02:15:31.220 --> 02:15:36.220]   Okay, I have no thing.
[02:15:36.220 --> 02:15:39.220]   Okay, so many things.
[02:15:39.220 --> 02:15:40.220]   No thing.
[02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:42.220]   The new mouth organ.
[02:15:42.220 --> 02:15:43.220]   I have no idea.
[02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:44.220]   I have no idea.
[02:15:44.220 --> 02:15:45.220]   I have no idea.
[02:15:45.220 --> 02:15:49.260]   Wait till Disney caught COVID.
[02:15:49.260 --> 02:15:53.860]   I've got a bunch of boxes in the corner and I've got nothing for you.
[02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:58.100]   So let's just on the COVID thing because I don't think we really finished that conversation.
[02:15:58.100 --> 02:16:01.380]   So you and Andrew both got it mildly.
[02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:02.540]   Do you know where he got it from?
[02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:05.540]   I mean, Bainbridge Island cannot be a hotspot exactly.
[02:16:05.540 --> 02:16:06.940]   We were in Disneyland.
[02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:07.940]   Disneyland.
[02:16:07.940 --> 02:16:09.260]   I could show you what I got at Disneyland.
[02:16:09.260 --> 02:16:11.140]   I got the best souvenir of all time.
[02:16:11.140 --> 02:16:12.140]   Let's see.
[02:16:12.140 --> 02:16:13.140]   That's really not something.
[02:16:13.140 --> 02:16:14.140]   Really?
[02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:15.140]   That's right.
[02:16:15.140 --> 02:16:16.140]   Yeah.
[02:16:16.140 --> 02:16:17.140]   A Disney souvenir.
[02:16:17.140 --> 02:16:18.140]   Look, pics don't have to be anything.
[02:16:18.140 --> 02:16:21.940]   Okay, these are my favorite guys in all of the world.
[02:16:21.940 --> 02:16:23.940]   Oh, they're from the Minions.
[02:16:23.940 --> 02:16:24.940]   The Minions.
[02:16:24.940 --> 02:16:25.940]   Yeah.
[02:16:25.940 --> 02:16:27.540]   No, no, they're not the Minions.
[02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:28.540]   That is a completely not.
[02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:29.540]   Oh, those are from the Toy Story.
[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:30.540]   That was the Toy Story guys.
[02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:34.980]   I know absolutely nothing about cartoons a day.
[02:16:34.980 --> 02:16:37.940]   No, in Toy Story, those are the little claw guys living in the publishing.
[02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:38.940]   These are the little guys.
[02:16:38.940 --> 02:16:43.460]   And so they say, well done.
[02:16:43.460 --> 02:16:45.460]   Oh, okay.
[02:16:45.460 --> 02:16:47.460]   Come on, you're not gonna catch you.
[02:16:47.460 --> 02:16:49.300]   You will go when you are today.
[02:16:49.300 --> 02:16:55.380]   Boy, I'm glad they spent money on these high fidelity reproduction.
[02:16:55.380 --> 02:16:56.380]   I know.
[02:16:56.380 --> 02:17:01.140]   That is like my like happiness, whenever I'm like on deadline or like, oh my God, then
[02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:03.100]   I just get that's really cool.
[02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:09.540]   Anyway, not something that's really tech savvy, although now I'm like, could I just pull these
[02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:13.500]   MIDI files and make my ringtone be like the claw?
[02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:14.500]   Oh, baby.
[02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:18.660]   I mean, Disney probably would be very unhappy with me.
[02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:25.900]   People would think you have a really crappy phone if it sounds like that.
[02:17:25.900 --> 02:17:26.900]   I roll.
[02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:34.020]   That was just an angry scratch on my filter.
[02:17:34.020 --> 02:17:37.780]   Oh, now we have a way she can really express.
[02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:42.420]   This is my Mozart of the Toy Channel with one of my very favorite Toy Story toys ever.
[02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:43.420]   It was a ghost.
[02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:45.980]   I saw that and I didn't buy it.
[02:17:45.980 --> 02:17:47.140]   It's the claw.
[02:17:47.140 --> 02:17:48.140]   I wanted to.
[02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:49.140]   That's right.
[02:17:49.140 --> 02:17:50.140]   The claw.
[02:17:50.140 --> 02:17:51.140]   Why the?
[02:17:51.140 --> 02:17:53.260]   Because I so it's not in here.
[02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:57.940]   I bought a Lego orchid flower, which is awesome.
[02:17:57.940 --> 02:17:58.940]   Have you all seen those?
[02:17:58.940 --> 02:17:59.940]   Do you want to see it?
[02:17:59.940 --> 02:18:00.940]   Yeah, sure.
[02:18:00.940 --> 02:18:04.220]   This Casey's thing has to go get it migrated into many doctors.
[02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:05.220]   She had no things.
[02:18:05.220 --> 02:18:09.340]   Now she has nothing but by the way, just while she's walking around, you were asking about
[02:18:09.340 --> 02:18:11.140]   this Opal C1 camera.
[02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:13.140]   I was curious about $300 camera.
[02:18:13.140 --> 02:18:15.100]   Jason has been using it a little while.
[02:18:15.100 --> 02:18:18.020]   Yeah, Jason's been using it on Mac break weekly.
[02:18:18.020 --> 02:18:24.220]   But I have to say, I'll be honest, I think you already have the best camera.
[02:18:24.220 --> 02:18:26.660]   I bought a lot of these to try them out.
[02:18:26.660 --> 02:18:28.140]   Did these Opals?
[02:18:28.140 --> 02:18:31.900]   I didn't buy the Opal, but I've tried almost every all of the competitors for this.
[02:18:31.900 --> 02:18:34.300]   Oh, look, it looks very good.
[02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:39.180]   But you really have with your Android probably the best camera you need.
[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:41.460]   And I'm using the micro.
[02:18:41.460 --> 02:18:43.820]   I'm using the Mac.
[02:18:43.820 --> 02:18:47.060]   So camo, C-A-M-O is the program.
[02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:51.060]   You could put it on your Android phone or your iPhone and there's a camo studio that goes
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:52.180]   in the Mac.
[02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:54.740]   And then you can either hook it up or do it wirelessly.
[02:18:54.740 --> 02:19:00.260]   I have all these cameras at home and I've stopped using them.
[02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:03.580]   I just use my iPhone, but you can use an Android device.
[02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:07.820]   I've just used this for the camera and it works great.
[02:19:07.820 --> 02:19:09.380]   Totally cosign.
[02:19:09.380 --> 02:19:11.620]   How do you hook that up to the...
[02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:16.380]   Either with a cable or wirelessly, it will work over wirelessly.
[02:19:16.380 --> 02:19:23.340]   The program you want and that's not free, but we'll underwrite it.
[02:19:23.340 --> 02:19:24.540]   And you have a pixel, right?
[02:19:24.540 --> 02:19:25.540]   It should work on your...
[02:19:25.540 --> 02:19:26.540]   Yes, I do.
[02:19:26.540 --> 02:19:28.300]   Because I still use Google.
[02:19:28.300 --> 02:19:29.300]   Yeah.
[02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:30.300]   Still use Google.
[02:19:30.300 --> 02:19:32.620]   It's just on a Samsung.
[02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:33.620]   So it's from...
[02:19:33.620 --> 02:19:34.620]   It's from...
[02:19:34.620 --> 02:19:35.620]   What's the name?
[02:19:35.620 --> 02:19:36.620]   This is not it.
[02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:37.620]   So don't show this.
[02:19:37.620 --> 02:19:38.620]   No.
[02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:41.060]   Camo, not cam studio.
[02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:42.060]   Camo.
[02:19:42.060 --> 02:19:43.060]   Camo.
[02:19:43.060 --> 02:19:44.260]   I left out the O.
[02:19:44.260 --> 02:19:48.020]   Do not leave out the O's from reincubate.com.
[02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:49.020]   C-A-M-O.
[02:19:49.020 --> 02:19:50.020]   C-A-M-O.
[02:19:50.020 --> 02:19:51.620]   Used to be your lunch.
[02:19:51.620 --> 02:19:53.020]   Reincubate.com.
[02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:55.380]   And what it...
[02:19:55.380 --> 02:20:01.500]   Basically, the Android app is not quite as good as the iOS app, but it still does the
[02:20:01.500 --> 02:20:02.500]   job.
[02:20:02.500 --> 02:20:06.340]   So you put it on your phone, you launch it on your phone and then on your Mac, you launch
[02:20:06.340 --> 02:20:07.340]   Camo Studio.
[02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:08.340]   You can also do that on Windows.
[02:20:08.340 --> 02:20:11.220]   I've tried it on Windows and Mac after I was Android with iOS.
[02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:12.220]   I can't.
[02:20:12.220 --> 02:20:13.220]   I have.
[02:20:13.220 --> 02:20:17.820]   I had it on Windows for a little while playing around with it because I had that on my phone
[02:20:17.820 --> 02:20:18.820]   over here.
[02:20:18.820 --> 02:20:19.820]   Yeah.
[02:20:19.820 --> 02:20:20.820]   And it worked really well.
[02:20:20.820 --> 02:20:21.820]   Yeah.
[02:20:21.820 --> 02:20:23.380]   So it's truly cross-platform now.
[02:20:23.380 --> 02:20:27.340]   And honestly, you spent a thousand bucks on your smartphone.
[02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:28.340]   Yeah.
[02:20:28.340 --> 02:20:29.340]   Exactly.
[02:20:29.340 --> 02:20:30.580]   And a lot of that went to the camera.
[02:20:30.580 --> 02:20:33.340]   And I think these cameras are better than anything I've seen.
[02:20:33.340 --> 02:20:35.820]   Any of these USB cameras I've seen.
[02:20:35.820 --> 02:20:38.460]   Thank you for making those points, Mr. LaPorte.
[02:20:38.460 --> 02:20:39.620]   That right there.
[02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:41.940]   You spent a thousand dollars on this thing.
[02:20:41.940 --> 02:20:43.340]   It's a miles out of it.
[02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:44.340]   Yeah.
[02:20:44.340 --> 02:20:45.340]   Yeah.
[02:20:45.340 --> 02:20:46.340]   Oh, for all of the stuff.
[02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:47.340]   I've even hooked up SLRs.
[02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:50.060]   I've put my Sony alphas on and stuff like that.
[02:20:50.060 --> 02:20:53.020]   And I mean, that's probably better.
[02:20:53.020 --> 02:20:54.700]   But honestly, you have that.
[02:20:54.700 --> 02:20:55.900]   I don't know if it's better.
[02:20:55.900 --> 02:20:56.900]   Honestly, yes.
[02:20:56.900 --> 02:21:03.260]   Because the iPhone has great quick as your Pixel 6 does auto focusing.
[02:21:03.260 --> 02:21:04.260]   You could do all these.
[02:21:04.260 --> 02:21:05.740]   It's got a lot of processing in there.
[02:21:05.740 --> 02:21:07.340]   I mean, it's really amazing what you can do.
[02:21:07.340 --> 02:21:09.140]   So I think that's probably the way it goes.
[02:21:09.140 --> 02:21:11.140]   Will it no longer be pink or yellow?
[02:21:11.140 --> 02:21:12.860]   I think we'd solve that problem.
[02:21:12.860 --> 02:21:16.820]   So let me just look at the pricing because we should send you a chip.
[02:21:16.820 --> 02:21:17.820]   Oh, it's fine.
[02:21:17.820 --> 02:21:19.820]   We'll send you a chip.
[02:21:19.820 --> 02:21:20.820]   A chip.
[02:21:20.820 --> 02:21:24.780]   You've been watching my pick of the way.
[02:21:24.780 --> 02:21:30.020]   I shall send you a chip for $39.99 for the Camo Pro.
[02:21:30.020 --> 02:21:31.260]   Actually, you could try it for free.
[02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:34.700]   And that's probably what you should do is try it for free first and see how it works.
[02:21:34.700 --> 02:21:36.420]   I'll find a way to break it.
[02:21:36.420 --> 02:21:37.420]   Did you try a Lumia?
[02:21:37.420 --> 02:21:38.420]   Can we jump?
[02:21:38.420 --> 02:21:39.420]   Yeah.
[02:21:39.420 --> 02:21:40.420]   We're trying them all.
[02:21:40.420 --> 02:21:42.300]   We're trying to get out and try every one of them.
[02:21:42.300 --> 02:21:45.220]   And that's because he has a very unusual lighting situation.
[02:21:45.220 --> 02:21:49.220]   But honestly, your Pixel is pretty good at handling that.
[02:21:49.220 --> 02:21:55.380]   You know, it's actually as good as my Chromebook camera is better than this somewhere.
[02:21:55.380 --> 02:21:56.380]   Right.
[02:21:56.380 --> 02:22:03.340]   I would say that I would vouch for having like a APS-C sensor, a 4-frame sensor.
[02:22:03.340 --> 02:22:09.700]   But for a webcam, smartphones are just as good and will be totally fine.
[02:22:09.700 --> 02:22:13.140]   Now, let's see your Lego flowers.
[02:22:13.140 --> 02:22:14.700]   Hey.
[02:22:14.700 --> 02:22:17.700]   It's a Lego orchid.
[02:22:17.700 --> 02:22:18.700]   What?
[02:22:18.700 --> 02:22:19.700]   What the what?
[02:22:19.700 --> 02:22:22.060]   It's my Valentine's Day present.
[02:22:22.060 --> 02:22:23.060]   Oh, he is now.
[02:22:23.060 --> 02:22:25.460]   That's a good or just Andrew making.
[02:22:25.460 --> 02:22:26.460]   He's a keeper.
[02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:27.460]   Okay.
[02:22:27.460 --> 02:22:31.700]   Heiress made it because or my child made it because they, they find it stress relieving.
[02:22:31.700 --> 02:22:32.700]   Yeah.
[02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:34.900]   I said I volunteered it to.
[02:22:34.900 --> 02:22:36.780]   They got a bonsai and I got this.
[02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:40.300]   But look, it has the little leaves and it has a bunch of like loose legos.
[02:22:40.300 --> 02:22:41.740]   So this is just like loose fill.
[02:22:41.740 --> 02:22:42.740]   So dirt.
[02:22:42.740 --> 02:22:43.740]   The roots.
[02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:44.740]   Yeah, it's got like loose Lego fill.
[02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:46.300]   Is it dirt?
[02:22:46.300 --> 02:22:51.260]   So this is the bonsai tree that they got.
[02:22:51.260 --> 02:22:52.260]   That's really cool.
[02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:53.260]   This is really cool.
[02:22:53.260 --> 02:22:54.260]   They're really awesome.
[02:22:54.260 --> 02:22:56.780]   And there's a bird of paradise, but that it looks like you got it.
[02:22:56.780 --> 02:22:58.620]   You said you got oh, there's the orchid.
[02:22:58.620 --> 02:23:02.860]   Oh, man, your husband gets extra points on that.
[02:23:02.860 --> 02:23:04.940]   This is from the Lego botanical collection.
[02:23:04.940 --> 02:23:06.140]   You don't sneeze at it.
[02:23:06.140 --> 02:23:07.140]   Wow.
[02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:12.060]   I don't know if many people are allergic to orchids, but yes.
[02:23:12.060 --> 02:23:15.980]   And I was kind of like, this will be kind of cheesy, but it's actually quite nice.
[02:23:15.980 --> 02:23:17.940]   It's so it's real shiny.
[02:23:17.940 --> 02:23:18.940]   Yeah.
[02:23:18.940 --> 02:23:21.860]   Actually, and they have the Rivendell set y'all.
[02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:22.860]   The Rivendell.
[02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:23.860]   If you want to.
[02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:25.340]   That's twice after that word today.
[02:23:25.340 --> 02:23:27.660]   Okay, Lord of the Rings where the elves live.
[02:23:27.660 --> 02:23:28.660]   Yeah.
[02:23:28.660 --> 02:23:29.660]   They've got a like a mega.
[02:23:29.660 --> 02:23:31.900]   I think it's like $300, but it is a gorgeous.
[02:23:31.900 --> 02:23:34.660]   So you are a secret Lego lover.
[02:23:34.660 --> 02:23:37.740]   It's not that secret.
[02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:40.460]   I've never heard you talk about this.
[02:23:40.460 --> 02:23:42.020]   Oh my golly gosh.
[02:23:42.020 --> 02:23:43.820]   Are you looking at it?
[02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:44.820]   Yeah.
[02:23:44.820 --> 02:23:46.020]   Oh my good.
[02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:47.020]   Golly gosh.
[02:23:47.020 --> 02:23:54.340]   Rivendell, the last homely house home of El Ron.
[02:23:54.340 --> 02:24:00.580]   And look, there's the elven queen and Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee.
[02:24:00.580 --> 02:24:03.860]   And there's Mary Brandy Buck and Pippin took.
[02:24:03.860 --> 02:24:07.020]   Legolas Gimli, Boromir, Aragon.
[02:24:07.020 --> 02:24:08.580]   They're all there.
[02:24:08.580 --> 02:24:09.580]   Wow.
[02:24:09.580 --> 02:24:13.500]   I don't want the Lego Gutenberg press, but they didn't approve it.
[02:24:13.500 --> 02:24:16.100]   I'm so I would have voted for it.
[02:24:16.100 --> 02:24:17.820]   How about a Lego line of type?
[02:24:17.820 --> 02:24:18.820]   How about that?
[02:24:18.820 --> 02:24:19.820]   Huh?
[02:24:19.820 --> 02:24:20.820]   Oh, that'd be killer.
[02:24:20.820 --> 02:24:23.540]   Hey, you know how much Rivendell is?
[02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:24.540]   Five hundred shmakers.
[02:24:24.540 --> 02:24:26.540]   All five hundred.
[02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:27.540]   Five hundred.
[02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:28.540]   Get the orchid.
[02:24:28.540 --> 02:24:29.540]   Get the orchid.
[02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:30.540]   It's a sixty bucks.
[02:24:30.540 --> 02:24:32.540]   Oh my was only 50.
[02:24:32.540 --> 02:24:38.780]   Oh, I think it's only where you were shopping for your Legos.
[02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:40.100]   No, I just was looking online.
[02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:41.940]   I don't want it to give away the $10.00.
[02:24:41.940 --> 02:24:46.860]   I don't want to give away the price because I mean it was a gift.
[02:24:46.860 --> 02:24:47.860]   It's 50.
[02:24:47.860 --> 02:24:48.860]   50.
[02:24:48.860 --> 02:24:49.860]   It's 50.
[02:24:49.860 --> 02:24:56.260]   Yeah, or 49.99 euros.
[02:24:56.260 --> 02:24:59.980]   Where would I find this mid journey of gritty Jeff?
[02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:00.980]   Huh?
[02:25:00.980 --> 02:25:01.980]   In the discord.
[02:25:01.980 --> 02:25:04.740]   Oh, the staff one.
[02:25:04.740 --> 02:25:06.740]   Oh, dude.
[02:25:06.740 --> 02:25:08.740]   Where is it?
[02:25:08.740 --> 02:25:12.940]   We have a staff in the regular.
[02:25:12.940 --> 02:25:14.500]   Oh, in the staff discord.
[02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:21.820]   Oh, well, hell, I didn't know we had a staff standing not slack and slack staff.
[02:25:21.820 --> 02:25:23.140]   I don't even know about this.
[02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:25.380]   Are you guys hanging out without me?
[02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:27.180]   Where the hell is staff discord?
[02:25:27.180 --> 02:25:30.540]   All right, down at the bottom inside.
[02:25:30.540 --> 02:25:31.540]   Twit staff.
[02:25:31.540 --> 02:25:32.540]   Okay.
[02:25:32.540 --> 02:25:34.020]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:35.020]   Inside Twit staff.
[02:25:35.020 --> 02:25:36.820]   Oh, the staff mid journey.
[02:25:36.820 --> 02:25:37.820]   Yes.
[02:25:37.820 --> 02:25:41.020]   Oh, yeah, I didn't realize we have a staff mid journey.
[02:25:41.020 --> 02:25:42.020]   Gritty.
[02:25:42.020 --> 02:25:43.020]   Yeah.
[02:25:43.020 --> 02:25:47.220]   Gritty Jeff, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:47.220 --> 02:25:49.220]   These are pretty awesome.
[02:25:49.220 --> 02:25:50.220]   Go up one.
[02:25:50.220 --> 02:25:57.020]   So you know what happened was gritty is the mascot for Philadelphia flyers.
[02:25:57.020 --> 02:26:01.420]   And so when you said gritty Jeff, but there's another.
[02:26:01.420 --> 02:26:02.820]   Oh, that's you.
[02:26:02.820 --> 02:26:04.620]   That is you.
[02:26:04.620 --> 02:26:06.580]   Look at the hair.
[02:26:06.580 --> 02:26:08.780]   Let's make that the album.
[02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:10.540]   I think so.
[02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:15.060]   If those of you listening only on audio as a.
[02:26:15.060 --> 02:26:16.060]   Who?
[02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:17.060]   Carilla de Vil.
[02:26:17.060 --> 02:26:19.340]   Yeah, he's got Carilla de Vil here.
[02:26:19.340 --> 02:26:21.620]   Jeff, did you have a pick of the week?
[02:26:21.620 --> 02:26:22.780]   Oh, I got tons.
[02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:23.780]   I got tons.
[02:26:23.780 --> 02:26:24.780]   I see.
[02:26:24.780 --> 02:26:28.020]   I want to mention just real quickly that this tomorrow is the last.
[02:26:28.020 --> 02:26:29.020]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:26:29.020 --> 02:26:31.020]   There's more for the shift.
[02:26:31.020 --> 02:26:33.100]   This is the one where you're on the boat.
[02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:34.100]   That's homeless.
[02:26:34.100 --> 02:26:35.100]   Gritty Jeff.
[02:26:35.100 --> 02:26:36.100]   Okay.
[02:26:36.100 --> 02:26:40.620]   You want to give a nice plug to our good friend Glenn Fleischman.
[02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:41.620]   And I don't want to.
[02:26:41.620 --> 02:26:42.620]   Fleischman.
[02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:46.740]   And yes, the last day for the shift happens Kickstarter is tomorrow is now it's more than
[02:26:46.740 --> 02:26:47.740]   $725,000.
[02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:49.540]   I'm so happy.
[02:26:49.540 --> 02:26:55.780]   They pass their $700,000 extra special push.
[02:26:55.780 --> 02:26:56.780]   And it's just amazing.
[02:26:56.780 --> 02:27:03.100]   They apparently I heard Glenn or I saw Glenn to don't have plans for a second printing.
[02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:08.740]   So if you want it better go now to the Kickstarter search for shift happens.
[02:27:08.740 --> 02:27:12.220]   And if you want to copy, you better buy it because there may not.
[02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:16.060]   I can't promise, but it sounds like they don't want to do a second printing.
[02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:19.980]   So the first edition is it and boy, when you want to have this.
[02:27:19.980 --> 02:27:22.260]   So very nice, very nice.
[02:27:22.260 --> 02:27:23.260]   He's too.
[02:27:23.260 --> 02:27:27.420]   We could go over about 10 slides in Bennett Devon's annual slide extravaganza.
[02:27:27.420 --> 02:27:31.140]   Oh, something tells me that Stacy's going to start scratching her.
[02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:32.820]   Is there a slide in there?
[02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:34.620]   I'm focused now.
[02:27:34.620 --> 02:27:35.620]   I'm so embarrassed.
[02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:36.620]   I'm so embarrassed.
[02:27:36.620 --> 02:27:37.620]   I'm focused.
[02:27:37.620 --> 02:27:40.620]   Is it the covid rotation 1514?
[02:27:40.620 --> 02:27:43.460]   We go through real fast.
[02:27:43.460 --> 02:27:44.460]   Okay.
[02:27:44.460 --> 02:27:50.140]   So I'm going to say that there's some perspective here on the firings and technology.
[02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:54.820]   Facebook fired 11,000 people, but they've hired 15,000 since January.
[02:27:54.820 --> 02:27:56.340]   I've been saying this for a long time.
[02:27:56.340 --> 02:28:00.620]   But finally, Benedict Evans says it and everybody believes now we listen.
[02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:06.500]   This all of these fires really bring you just back to, you know, pre covid at worst.
[02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:08.460]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:28:08.460 --> 02:28:13.860]   Slide 20 on a Amazon has now overtaken Wal-Mart's revenue.
[02:28:13.860 --> 02:28:14.860]   Stop, stop.
[02:28:14.860 --> 02:28:16.700]   We've been waiting for that to happen.
[02:28:16.700 --> 02:28:20.660]   That's what we call the e-commerce singularity, baby.
[02:28:20.660 --> 02:28:23.700]   And a slide 28.
[02:28:23.700 --> 02:28:27.820]   Look at the ad budgets in the U.S. as a percent of GDP and the UK is very high.
[02:28:27.820 --> 02:28:30.180]   Other countries just don't spend that much on advertising.
[02:28:30.180 --> 02:28:31.380]   We don't need.
[02:28:31.380 --> 02:28:33.780]   Does he say anything about podcast advertising?
[02:28:33.780 --> 02:28:35.340]   No, not a word.
[02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:36.900]   It doesn't matter, Leo.
[02:28:36.900 --> 02:28:37.900]   It just doesn't matter.
[02:28:37.900 --> 02:28:39.540]   That's clearly it.
[02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:44.820]   I had to send Lisa to Las Vegas this week to raise money.
[02:28:44.820 --> 02:28:45.820]   Oof.
[02:28:45.820 --> 02:28:46.820]   Sell ads.
[02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:47.820]   You mean?
[02:28:47.820 --> 02:28:48.820]   No to dance.
[02:28:48.820 --> 02:28:53.820]   Oh, where have I fell for it again?
[02:28:53.820 --> 02:28:58.860]   No, the podcast movement show is in Vegas right now.
[02:28:58.860 --> 02:29:04.540]   And she went there to talk people into buying ads.
[02:29:04.540 --> 02:29:07.100]   That's why she's there with our sales team.
[02:29:07.100 --> 02:29:09.900]   We should see your comedy show.
[02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:10.900]   Max and Ryan.
[02:29:10.900 --> 02:29:11.900]   This is amazing.
[02:29:11.900 --> 02:29:12.900]   Yeah, she's hysterical.
[02:29:12.900 --> 02:29:14.740]   She's got a little club show.
[02:29:14.740 --> 02:29:15.740]   That's fine.
[02:29:15.740 --> 02:29:22.060]   Hey, if you don't want Lisa to have to sell herself in Las Vegas, you should join Club
[02:29:22.060 --> 02:29:23.060]   Twit.
[02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:24.060]   That's all I'm saying.
[02:29:24.060 --> 02:29:26.060]   Seven bucks a month.
[02:29:26.060 --> 02:29:29.900]   Never again will Lisa be forced down to do the thing.
[02:29:29.900 --> 02:29:32.460]   They installed a pole in the studio for nothing.
[02:29:32.460 --> 02:29:33.460]   That's a visual form.
[02:29:33.460 --> 02:29:36.340]   No, that's terrible, terrible, terrible.
[02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:38.340]   This is my wife you're talking about.
[02:29:38.340 --> 02:29:40.380]   She is a wonderful, wonderful human being.
[02:29:40.380 --> 02:29:41.380]   That was for you.
[02:29:41.380 --> 02:29:48.020]   Putting her life on the line to go into people by going to be amongst other people to sell
[02:29:48.020 --> 02:29:52.900]   advertising because the times are tough, but you can solve that problem just by joining
[02:29:52.900 --> 02:29:53.900]   Club Twit.
[02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:54.900]   Twit.
[02:29:54.900 --> 02:29:55.900]   That's all I'm going to say.
[02:29:55.900 --> 02:29:57.300]   It's just a nice support thing.
[02:29:57.300 --> 02:30:00.380]   You get a lot of free stuff, including Stacy's book club coming up next month.
[02:30:00.380 --> 02:30:01.940]   We've got a lot of good events.
[02:30:01.940 --> 02:30:03.980]   In fact, we have an event.
[02:30:03.980 --> 02:30:08.020]   You just put another event on there that's coming up soon, right?
[02:30:08.020 --> 02:30:13.060]   Mr. Nielsen actually put in our special news of home theater geeks.
[02:30:13.060 --> 02:30:15.140]   Oh, that's the news.
[02:30:15.140 --> 02:30:16.940]   We're bringing back.
[02:30:16.940 --> 02:30:18.180]   Thanks to club members.
[02:30:18.180 --> 02:30:22.900]   We can bring back a show that we had to cancel for lack of added support.
[02:30:22.900 --> 02:30:24.660]   Home theater geeks.
[02:30:24.660 --> 02:30:27.260]   So that will be in the club tomorrow.
[02:30:27.260 --> 02:30:34.740]   One PM Pacific, four PM Eastern, then Stacy's book club Victor Bogknot, Alex Wilhelm, fireside
[02:30:34.740 --> 02:30:36.860]   chat with Sean Powers from Floss Weekly.
[02:30:36.860 --> 02:30:39.180]   I'm sure there'll be many more events still to come.
[02:30:39.180 --> 02:30:40.180]   You get that.
[02:30:40.180 --> 02:30:42.060]   You get the ad-free versions of all the shows.
[02:30:42.060 --> 02:30:44.780]   You get the Twit Plus feed with shows we don't put out in public.
[02:30:44.780 --> 02:30:49.020]   You get gritty Jeff Jarvis.
[02:30:49.020 --> 02:30:55.780]   We should start printing like little cards, gift cards to give away.
[02:30:55.780 --> 02:30:57.780]   Twit collector cards.
[02:30:57.780 --> 02:31:04.900]   So when you join, you get like, like, every year, maybe with a Christmas card, you get
[02:31:04.900 --> 02:31:07.940]   one or maybe it's like every morning together.
[02:31:07.940 --> 02:31:12.060]   We should have Jeff Jarvis's moral panic cards.
[02:31:12.060 --> 02:31:13.060]   There we go.
[02:31:13.060 --> 02:31:14.940]   That would be good.
[02:31:14.940 --> 02:31:16.580]   That would be really good.
[02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:18.740]   Nice.
[02:31:18.740 --> 02:31:21.700]   We actually have a, this is new.
[02:31:21.700 --> 02:31:25.780]   It's funny because I said, oh, we should do that yesterday.
[02:31:25.780 --> 02:31:33.020]   And within seconds, they created a mid-journey bot in our club to it for the staff.
[02:31:33.020 --> 02:31:34.020]   Cool.
[02:31:34.020 --> 02:31:36.300]   Very nice.
[02:31:36.300 --> 02:31:38.700]   Did you have anything else, Jeff, before we move on?
[02:31:38.700 --> 02:31:45.780]   Slide 41, anchor, having built a $2 billion business just on Amazon is pretty amazing.
[02:31:45.780 --> 02:31:47.780]   Anchor, beer, anchor, anchor.
[02:31:47.780 --> 02:31:48.780]   Anchor, no, UV.
[02:31:48.780 --> 02:31:49.780]   Oh, anchor.
[02:31:49.780 --> 02:31:51.580]   Well, no, I think it's anchor.
[02:31:51.580 --> 02:31:53.580]   The charger company.
[02:31:53.580 --> 02:31:55.180]   Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:31:55.180 --> 02:31:57.260]   Yeah, we knew that.
[02:31:57.260 --> 02:32:02.260]   They're really, it's amazing when Amazon's let them do, but at the same time, it's kind
[02:32:02.260 --> 02:32:04.180]   of a trap, isn't it?
[02:32:04.180 --> 02:32:10.660]   Because then you have to be subject to things like Amazon undercutting you and demanding
[02:32:10.660 --> 02:32:14.100]   money so that you get picked and things like that.
[02:32:14.100 --> 02:32:15.100]   It's maybe not always--
[02:32:15.100 --> 02:32:16.100]   Oh, slide 56.
[02:32:16.100 --> 02:32:17.100]   Yes.
[02:32:17.100 --> 02:32:18.100]   YouTube.
[02:32:18.100 --> 02:32:22.020]   Payouts are almost comparable to TV production budgets.
[02:32:22.020 --> 02:32:23.020]   What?
[02:32:23.020 --> 02:32:25.940]   Oversped over lots more people.
[02:32:25.940 --> 02:32:26.940]   Yeah.
[02:32:26.940 --> 02:32:27.940]   Yeah.
[02:32:27.940 --> 02:32:28.940]   Wow.
[02:32:28.940 --> 02:32:29.940]   That's still the budget, the budget, the budget.
[02:32:29.940 --> 02:32:30.940]   Holy cow.
[02:32:30.940 --> 02:32:31.940]   What?
[02:32:31.940 --> 02:32:32.940]   Slide 58.
[02:32:32.940 --> 02:32:39.620]   And Mr. Beast has a comparable total viewing time to the top 10 Netflix show.
[02:32:39.620 --> 02:32:40.620]   There you go.
[02:32:40.620 --> 02:32:41.620]   Good lord.
[02:32:41.620 --> 02:32:42.620]   There you go.
[02:32:42.620 --> 02:32:43.620]   That says something.
[02:32:43.620 --> 02:32:46.500]   YouTube is really a parody with these streamers.
[02:32:46.500 --> 02:32:47.500]   Yeah.
[02:32:47.500 --> 02:32:49.700]   Finally, slide 66.
[02:32:49.700 --> 02:32:52.780]   Sears in its heyday stock 200,000 items.
[02:32:52.780 --> 02:32:55.100]   Amazon lists 300 million.
[02:32:55.100 --> 02:32:56.100]   Wow.
[02:32:56.100 --> 02:33:02.700]   2000 new series were made in the US on TV in 2022.
[02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:06.940]   YouTube had, of course, this 3.7 million daily uploads.
[02:33:06.940 --> 02:33:07.940]   Wow.
[02:33:07.940 --> 02:33:11.180]   Very nice.
[02:33:11.180 --> 02:33:15.740]   That's Benedict Evans who does a yearly presentation which we often talk about called
[02:33:15.740 --> 02:33:16.740]   the new gatekeepers.
[02:33:16.740 --> 02:33:18.740]   Guess who the new gatekeepers are?
[02:33:18.740 --> 02:33:19.740]   Us.
[02:33:19.740 --> 02:33:20.740]   Us.
[02:33:20.740 --> 02:33:21.740]   On casters.
[02:33:21.740 --> 02:33:22.740]   Us, really?
[02:33:22.740 --> 02:33:27.420]   No, apparently YouTube actually.
[02:33:27.420 --> 02:33:29.620]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, thank you so much.
[02:33:29.620 --> 02:33:34.820]   How about you, Ant, Pruitt, a thing or an item or?
[02:33:34.820 --> 02:33:35.820]   Yeah.
[02:33:35.820 --> 02:33:40.860]   I didn't have one and I totally forgot about it, but you being here in Sonoma County, you
[02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:46.020]   remember the rain that was past weekend, rain and sideways and hail and all of that
[02:33:46.020 --> 02:33:47.020]   good stuff.
[02:33:47.020 --> 02:33:53.420]   Well, I was out in that all day Saturday and just felt great and had my backpack with
[02:33:53.420 --> 02:33:55.220]   me and you know what?
[02:33:55.220 --> 02:34:01.300]   All of my gear was totally fine and it's the travel backpack from Peak Design.
[02:34:01.300 --> 02:34:02.300]   Oh, I have this one.
[02:34:02.300 --> 02:34:03.300]   Waterproof.
[02:34:03.300 --> 02:34:04.300]   This is a great backpack.
[02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:08.340]   I think I love it, but my cameras were totally fine.
[02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:10.820]   Did not have any damage from the sideways.
[02:34:10.820 --> 02:34:13.740]   This is specifically a camera backpack, yes.
[02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:14.740]   Yes.
[02:34:14.740 --> 02:34:17.900]   So, you can also use it to put some clothes in it.
[02:34:17.900 --> 02:34:20.380]   Do you have inserts in it?
[02:34:20.380 --> 02:34:21.380]   I do.
[02:34:21.380 --> 02:34:28.260]   I have their camera cubes also that I put inside of there too, just for extra little
[02:34:28.260 --> 02:34:33.140]   nooks and crannies, if you will, to put lenses or cards and stuff like that.
[02:34:33.140 --> 02:34:36.380]   But it's a heck of a bad way to hold a bottle of wine.
[02:34:36.380 --> 02:34:37.380]   Nice.
[02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:39.540]   Couple bottles of water, whiskey.
[02:34:39.540 --> 02:34:40.540]   Yeah.
[02:34:40.540 --> 02:34:41.540]   Yeah.
[02:34:41.540 --> 02:34:47.620]   Yeah, great bag and I'm quite happy with that.
[02:34:47.620 --> 02:34:48.620]   They do that stuff.
[02:34:48.620 --> 02:34:49.620]   And the next one.
[02:34:49.620 --> 02:34:50.620]   And the next one.
[02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:51.620]   It looks nice too.
[02:34:51.620 --> 02:34:54.860]   That's showing the actual rain because we had the race for...
[02:34:54.860 --> 02:34:57.220]   This was the high school's first meet this weekend.
[02:34:57.220 --> 02:34:58.780]   They were racing in the rain.
[02:34:58.780 --> 02:35:01.220]   It was all day in the dad gum rain.
[02:35:01.220 --> 02:35:02.220]   Oh Lord.
[02:35:02.220 --> 02:35:03.220]   And some...
[02:35:03.220 --> 02:35:04.220]   You can see...
[02:35:04.220 --> 02:35:07.740]   Well, I guess that video I didn't show all the rain, but this was a great race.
[02:35:07.740 --> 02:35:10.140]   This is the 100 meter dash.
[02:35:10.140 --> 02:35:14.380]   About five separated by about 800th of a second.
[02:35:14.380 --> 02:35:15.380]   Wow.
[02:35:15.380 --> 02:35:16.380]   And that race.
[02:35:16.380 --> 02:35:17.380]   It was such a good race.
[02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:18.380]   Hard hit finish third.
[02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:21.980]   Examine him in the fourth lane there.
[02:35:21.980 --> 02:35:22.980]   He's in the red there.
[02:35:22.980 --> 02:35:23.980]   Yeah.
[02:35:23.980 --> 02:35:24.980]   Yeah.
[02:35:24.980 --> 02:35:27.220]   And the guy right there on the right and the white, he won it.
[02:35:27.220 --> 02:35:28.940]   That's the guy from Newman.
[02:35:28.940 --> 02:35:29.940]   Such a good race.
[02:35:29.940 --> 02:35:32.740]   I wasn't happy with the time, but didn't I realize?
[02:35:32.740 --> 02:35:34.300]   Oh yeah, he's been sick.
[02:35:34.300 --> 02:35:35.860]   And that's my no.
[02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:36.860]   So yeah.
[02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:39.860]   It's hard to do my shit mono.
[02:35:39.860 --> 02:35:44.940]   He was the fastest runner with mono in the race.
[02:35:44.940 --> 02:35:46.260]   He felt good about it.
[02:35:46.260 --> 02:35:48.260]   His 200 meters was about...
[02:35:48.260 --> 02:35:52.340]   I think he ran like a 22.8 or something like that in the 200.
[02:35:52.340 --> 02:35:56.460]   And I was really impressed with that considering he was still sick.
[02:35:56.460 --> 02:36:02.260]   But yeah, my final pick of the week is Silo series is finally announced with the dad
[02:36:02.260 --> 02:36:04.740]   gum date for TV.
[02:36:04.740 --> 02:36:13.980]   This is a book based on the books from Hugh Howie's, Wool, and he's got a lot of heavy
[02:36:13.980 --> 02:36:17.340]   hitters in there for acting and Apple TV picked it up.
[02:36:17.340 --> 02:36:22.660]   They're calling it Silo because it's based on some Silos in that book series and it's
[02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:23.660]   coming out.
[02:36:23.660 --> 02:36:24.980]   Are they living in Silos?
[02:36:24.980 --> 02:36:26.700]   The trailer is awesome.
[02:36:26.700 --> 02:36:27.700]   They're like living.
[02:36:27.700 --> 02:36:32.620]   Is it opposed to apocalyptic world and they have to live in a decommissioned missile silo?
[02:36:32.620 --> 02:36:33.620]   Is that...
[02:36:33.620 --> 02:36:34.620]   Ish.
[02:36:34.620 --> 02:36:35.620]   I'm gonna say that.
[02:36:35.620 --> 02:36:36.620]   Okay.
[02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:40.020]   But you like the books a lot, huh?
[02:36:40.020 --> 02:36:41.940]   The three books are outstanding.
[02:36:41.940 --> 02:36:42.940]   I love them.
[02:36:42.940 --> 02:36:43.940]   Oh, they are.
[02:36:43.940 --> 02:36:45.700]   Should we add them to book club potential?
[02:36:45.700 --> 02:36:49.500]   We could, but I'm sure everybody's read it in our book club, quite honestly.
[02:36:49.500 --> 02:36:50.500]   I haven't read them.
[02:36:50.500 --> 02:36:51.500]   I have not read it.
[02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:52.500]   I never even heard.
[02:36:52.500 --> 02:36:53.500]   Okay.
[02:36:53.500 --> 02:36:54.500]   Yeah.
[02:36:54.500 --> 02:36:55.500]   Okay.
[02:36:55.500 --> 02:36:58.620]   It's Hugh Howie's and it's called Wool is the first book.
[02:36:58.620 --> 02:37:03.420]   The second book is called I think Dust.
[02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:07.620]   It's like a prequel to the first book, but it makes sense that they did it as a prequel.
[02:37:07.620 --> 02:37:09.820]   And the third one ties it all together.
[02:37:09.820 --> 02:37:12.500]   As soon as I finish Prince Harry's book.
[02:37:12.500 --> 02:37:13.500]   So good.
[02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:15.500]   I will pick those up.
[02:37:15.500 --> 02:37:17.060]   Oh, and G.
[02:37:17.060 --> 02:37:21.900]   But I'm glad that this is finally getting on television screens now.
[02:37:21.900 --> 02:37:22.900]   And so I love it.
[02:37:22.900 --> 02:37:25.140]   You had Tim Robbins and Colin.
[02:37:25.140 --> 02:37:26.980]   Yes, good looking cast.
[02:37:26.980 --> 02:37:27.980]   May 5th.
[02:37:27.980 --> 02:37:28.980]   Rashida Jones.
[02:37:28.980 --> 02:37:31.100]   You love your cast.
[02:37:31.100 --> 02:37:32.100]   Yeah.
[02:37:32.100 --> 02:37:33.100]   Are you listening to the story?
[02:37:33.100 --> 02:37:37.500]   I am listening to spare because I want to work on my Ponzi British accent.
[02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:39.300]   Let's try it.
[02:37:39.300 --> 02:37:40.300]   Let's hear it.
[02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:41.300]   Come on.
[02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:49.780]   Then my thoughts about mummy as the British tabloid told everybody I was a stupid person.
[02:37:49.780 --> 02:37:50.780]   It's actually good.
[02:37:50.780 --> 02:37:53.020]   It's good to hear.
[02:37:53.020 --> 02:37:58.420]   It's hard not to be sympathetic for somebody who was born into this family and the British
[02:37:58.420 --> 02:38:00.780]   tabloid press is a nightmare.
[02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:03.460]   The old Gothic ruins.
[02:38:03.460 --> 02:38:04.460]   The Gothic ruins.
[02:38:04.460 --> 02:38:05.460]   Yes.
[02:38:05.460 --> 02:38:06.460]   Yes.
[02:38:06.460 --> 02:38:08.740]   Apparently listening to it too.
[02:38:08.740 --> 02:38:10.300]   I checked my phone.
[02:38:10.300 --> 02:38:11.300]   I checked.
[02:38:11.300 --> 02:38:12.300]   No, mummy.
[02:38:12.300 --> 02:38:14.260]   It must be running late.
[02:38:14.260 --> 02:38:18.580]   I thought I'd silly to listen to it because I don't, you know, I don't want to be part
[02:38:18.580 --> 02:38:22.820]   of the Harry and Meghan media empire.
[02:38:22.820 --> 02:38:26.740]   But it's actually kind of interesting to see what it was like to be the spare.
[02:38:26.740 --> 02:38:29.100]   You know, they call about the air and the spare.
[02:38:29.100 --> 02:38:33.500]   The air, of course, is big brother William who's next in line after Charles III to be
[02:38:33.500 --> 02:38:34.700]   the king of England.
[02:38:34.700 --> 02:38:38.940]   And he's the spare because if something happens to William, then they've got a spare
[02:38:38.940 --> 02:38:40.540]   air.
[02:38:40.540 --> 02:38:44.340]   And it's not easy being the spare, I guess is the.
[02:38:44.340 --> 02:38:49.540]   I'm listening to Devil Land, England under siege 1588 to 1688.
[02:38:49.540 --> 02:38:51.540]   Under siege by home.
[02:38:51.540 --> 02:38:59.380]   Well, but the cells because it starts with Elizabeth and then the various fights and
[02:38:59.380 --> 02:39:03.660]   beheadings from that on through Charles one, Charles two.
[02:39:03.660 --> 02:39:06.020]   So I'm listening to sorrow land.
[02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:07.860]   Oh, who's that?
[02:39:07.860 --> 02:39:08.860]   Is it sorrow land?
[02:39:08.860 --> 02:39:12.060]   It is about, it is about a fungus.
[02:39:12.060 --> 02:39:14.140]   It is actually it's about it's, it's a lot.
[02:39:14.140 --> 02:39:15.140]   I'm not even going to describe it.
[02:39:15.140 --> 02:39:16.140]   It's science fiction.
[02:39:16.140 --> 02:39:17.140]   Just.
[02:39:17.140 --> 02:39:19.620]   Do you only read sci fi?
[02:39:19.620 --> 02:39:20.620]   Stacey besides the.
[02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:22.980]   I read every ship books and stuff that you read.
[02:39:22.980 --> 02:39:23.980]   You read nonfiction.
[02:39:23.980 --> 02:39:24.980]   No, I read it.
[02:39:24.980 --> 02:39:27.020]   I know I don't read everything.
[02:39:27.020 --> 02:39:28.020]   I read.
[02:39:28.020 --> 02:39:34.860]   I hate novels with women facing away from the camera and they're about like orphans from.
[02:39:34.860 --> 02:39:38.940]   Hand in hand with the Eiffel Tower in front of them.
[02:39:38.940 --> 02:39:44.220]   Yeah, all of the I hate those historical lady fiction books and it's not that I'm not.
[02:39:44.220 --> 02:39:45.460]   I don't like them.
[02:39:45.460 --> 02:39:49.980]   But everything else I read, I read almost it been discriminatedly.
[02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:50.980]   Yeah.
[02:39:50.980 --> 02:39:51.980]   Yeah.
[02:39:51.980 --> 02:39:55.220]   Oh, there's a sequel to Chantaram just came out.
[02:39:55.220 --> 02:39:57.020]   I'll have to check that out.
[02:39:57.020 --> 02:39:58.820]   I like that book.
[02:39:58.820 --> 02:40:04.940]   Yeah, I try to alternate fiction and nonfiction and I got to read more ishaguro.
[02:40:04.940 --> 02:40:08.420]   We read that wonderful Clara and the sun.
[02:40:08.420 --> 02:40:10.260]   Yeah, that was great.
[02:40:10.260 --> 02:40:11.860]   Have you read?
[02:40:11.860 --> 02:40:14.260]   Never let me go.
[02:40:14.260 --> 02:40:17.740]   No, and that's it's funny you say that because that's on my wish list.
[02:40:17.740 --> 02:40:21.660]   That's the next I've read remains of the day, but I have to read.
[02:40:21.660 --> 02:40:26.060]   Never let me go, which has been of course made into a movie with Kieran Knightley.
[02:40:26.060 --> 02:40:29.140]   I think they're having another movie.
[02:40:29.140 --> 02:40:34.260]   They're making someone just got the rights to his his dragon fog book.
[02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:35.620]   I can't think of what it's called.
[02:40:35.620 --> 02:40:36.620]   He's a lovely writer.
[02:40:36.620 --> 02:40:39.780]   I just love his he really is his his prose.
[02:40:39.780 --> 02:40:40.780]   Okay.
[02:40:40.780 --> 02:40:45.500]   I think we can call it a day we've been here for many, many hours, 10 hours.
[02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:47.420]   We've cleaned our screens.
[02:40:47.420 --> 02:40:51.180]   Everything's working well and I think it's time to say goodbye.
[02:40:51.180 --> 02:40:53.020]   No, no, no, no, I loved that.
[02:40:53.020 --> 02:40:54.220]   That was the highlight.
[02:40:54.220 --> 02:40:55.220]   You can stay.
[02:40:55.220 --> 02:40:57.500]   Literally the highlight of the show.
[02:40:57.500 --> 02:40:59.300]   It was so funny.
[02:40:59.300 --> 02:41:06.220]   Almost as good as Jeff Jarvis's headshot, which actually gave us hours of mercy as well.
[02:41:06.220 --> 02:41:07.460]   Wow.
[02:41:07.460 --> 02:41:11.980]   This is the famous dual joints portrait that everybody does.
[02:41:11.980 --> 02:41:12.980]   Find.
[02:41:12.980 --> 02:41:13.980]   Yeah, base.
[02:41:13.980 --> 02:41:15.140]   How do you do that?
[02:41:15.140 --> 02:41:17.140]   It's just nonsense.
[02:41:17.140 --> 02:41:18.140]   It's nonsense.
[02:41:18.140 --> 02:41:20.660]   Here's here's in the style of Banksy.
[02:41:20.660 --> 02:41:23.220]   Yeah, I like those two.
[02:41:23.220 --> 02:41:24.980]   So I said upscale those two.
[02:41:24.980 --> 02:41:25.980]   Oh, nice.
[02:41:25.980 --> 02:41:26.980]   Oh, nice.
[02:41:26.980 --> 02:41:27.980]   They look great.
[02:41:27.980 --> 02:41:29.540]   Yeah, there's some good stuff.
[02:41:29.540 --> 02:41:30.540]   They really do.
[02:41:30.540 --> 02:41:31.540]   Yeah.
[02:41:31.540 --> 02:41:34.260]   I'm mid journey has become my favorite of these.
[02:41:34.260 --> 02:41:35.260]   Yeah.
[02:41:35.260 --> 02:41:37.260]   How did that get in there?
[02:41:37.260 --> 02:41:38.260]   Elmo moral panic.
[02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:39.260]   Elmo moral panic.
[02:41:39.260 --> 02:41:40.260]   I don't know.
[02:41:40.260 --> 02:41:42.260]   I don't know.
[02:41:42.260 --> 02:41:43.260]   That's the prompt.
[02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:44.260]   Thank you, Jerry.
[02:41:44.260 --> 02:41:47.660]   The students in New York never hug an Elmo on Times Square.
[02:41:47.660 --> 02:41:49.060]   Never, never.
[02:41:49.060 --> 02:41:50.060]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:41:50.060 --> 02:41:53.860]   Here's in the style of Charles Schultz, which is not really.
[02:41:53.860 --> 02:41:54.860]   No.
[02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:56.660]   Ha ha buregne d'etat.
[02:41:56.660 --> 02:41:59.220]   What's more like Matt Greening?
[02:41:59.220 --> 02:42:01.940]   This is great stuff.
[02:42:01.940 --> 02:42:02.940]   Great stuff.
[02:42:02.940 --> 02:42:03.940]   I like this one.
[02:42:03.940 --> 02:42:04.940]   You did this one.
[02:42:04.940 --> 02:42:05.940]   The moral panic shout.
[02:42:05.940 --> 02:42:06.940]   I have a mid journey.
[02:42:06.940 --> 02:42:10.500]   I love it because there's a mid journey bot on the discord.
[02:42:10.500 --> 02:42:14.820]   We paid for any member could go in here and put in a.
[02:42:14.820 --> 02:42:15.820]   On a different one.
[02:42:15.820 --> 02:42:19.980]   The members can go on the members members have another different one.
[02:42:19.980 --> 02:42:21.780]   Benefit of membership.
[02:42:21.780 --> 02:42:22.780]   Come on.
[02:42:22.780 --> 02:42:27.380]   If you get a new journey, do is it unlimited?
[02:42:27.380 --> 02:42:30.580]   You can make 25 images and that's in our discord.
[02:42:30.580 --> 02:42:32.180]   You just used it up all on me.
[02:42:32.180 --> 02:42:35.700]   Well, there it is under the fun and games heading.
[02:42:35.700 --> 02:42:39.780]   Oh, and that was just added today by Mr. Nielsen as well.
[02:42:39.780 --> 02:42:40.780]   Thank you.
[02:42:40.780 --> 02:42:42.700]   This is Jammer B's kitty.
[02:42:42.700 --> 02:42:47.780]   Yeah, another member member benefit.
[02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:52.060]   Although we should how much is it to get unlimited?
[02:42:52.060 --> 02:42:53.500]   Can you get unlimited?
[02:42:53.500 --> 02:42:55.900]   Fifty bucks a month.
[02:42:55.900 --> 02:43:00.460]   I don't know for us to do it might be different because we would be generating a lot of stuff.
[02:43:00.460 --> 02:43:03.300]   Podcasts are having lunch.
[02:43:03.300 --> 02:43:04.860]   Of course I put that prompt in.
[02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:07.220]   Yeah, that was the one we tried ages ago.
[02:43:07.220 --> 02:43:09.180]   It's gotten a lot better, hasn't it?
[02:43:09.180 --> 02:43:12.580]   Can't prove it with a camera glow.
[02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:14.340]   I don't think they know you.
[02:43:14.340 --> 02:43:15.340]   No, I don't.
[02:43:15.340 --> 02:43:16.340]   I don't.
[02:43:16.340 --> 02:43:18.180]   It's totally fine with that.
[02:43:18.180 --> 02:43:21.260]   If the internet doesn't know who I am, I'm cool.
[02:43:21.260 --> 02:43:22.420]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:43:22.420 --> 02:43:23.420]   Nice.
[02:43:23.420 --> 02:43:29.420]   Oh, this is loads of fun, but I really think we have to call today again another good reason
[02:43:29.420 --> 02:43:32.900]   to become a member of the club because the club, the discord never ends.
[02:43:32.900 --> 02:43:33.900]   I mean, it's always going.
[02:43:33.900 --> 02:43:36.220]   There's always stuff like this show, like this.
[02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:37.220]   Never it.
[02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:39.140]   Much like this, where you can go.
[02:43:39.140 --> 02:43:40.820]   Stacy's thinking I'm telling you.
[02:43:40.820 --> 02:43:41.820]   Oh my God.
[02:43:41.820 --> 02:43:42.820]   It's endless.
[02:43:42.820 --> 02:43:46.620]   I do have to start cooking dinner at some point.
[02:43:46.620 --> 02:43:49.660]   No props standing between my family and food.
[02:43:49.660 --> 02:43:52.380]   Oh, no, we don't want to do wouldn't want to do that.
[02:43:52.380 --> 02:43:55.820]   Stacy, you can buy them as it's Stacy on IOT.com.
[02:43:55.820 --> 02:43:57.060]   You can get her newsletter.

[02:44:03.420 --> 02:44:04.420]   week.
[02:44:04.420 --> 02:44:10.980]   Last week, our guest was Paulis Shouten, who is the founder of Home Assistant.
[02:44:10.980 --> 02:44:14.300]   So if y'all are Home Assistant users and I bet there are some of y'all out there, that's
[02:44:14.300 --> 02:44:18.180]   a good show because he's our guest and talks about some of the things coming up.
[02:44:18.180 --> 02:44:23.900]   I'm just going to plug that for because I know there are Home Assistant folks out there.
[02:44:23.900 --> 02:44:25.860]   Very good.
[02:44:25.860 --> 02:44:27.460]   Stacy and IOT.com.
[02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:29.060]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:44:29.060 --> 02:44:31.820]   Jeff Jarvis, we neglected to mention at the beginning of the show.
[02:44:31.820 --> 02:44:39.100]   So I'll say it now is the Leonard Taap professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig
[02:44:39.100 --> 02:44:46.780]   Newmont graduate school of chorus and journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:44:46.780 --> 02:44:47.780]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:44:47.780 --> 02:44:49.180]   Always a pleasure.
[02:44:49.180 --> 02:44:50.820]   Try the Camo studio.
[02:44:50.820 --> 02:44:52.260]   I bet you'd like it from Reencubey.
[02:44:52.260 --> 02:44:53.260]   Yeah.
[02:44:53.260 --> 02:44:54.260]   Yeah.
[02:44:54.260 --> 02:44:58.060]   Of course, Aunt Pruitt, who all doesn't need any camera advice, he's the host of Hands-Off
[02:44:58.060 --> 02:44:59.380]   and talks about normal one.
[02:44:59.380 --> 02:45:00.380]   He looks good.
[02:45:00.380 --> 02:45:01.380]   He's the normal one.
[02:45:01.380 --> 02:45:02.540]   He's the normal one person on the show.
[02:45:02.540 --> 02:45:03.540]   The normal average everyday.
[02:45:03.540 --> 02:45:04.540]   As normal one.
[02:45:04.540 --> 02:45:05.540]   As normal one.
[02:45:05.540 --> 02:45:06.540]   As the normal one.
[02:45:06.540 --> 02:45:07.540]   And Pruitt.
[02:45:07.540 --> 02:45:14.100]   I used to do a show called The Screen Savers and the boss told me my co-host, I was like
[02:45:14.100 --> 02:45:18.780]   a weirdo but my co-host was for the Lunch Bucket Crowd.
[02:45:18.780 --> 02:45:19.780]   And you...
[02:45:19.780 --> 02:45:20.780]   Yeah, that's me.
[02:45:20.780 --> 02:45:21.780]   Yeah.
[02:45:21.780 --> 02:45:24.780]   But Aunt Pruitt, you're in good company, Patrick Norton.
[02:45:24.780 --> 02:45:26.340]   Lunch Bucket and Cannon Beer.
[02:45:26.340 --> 02:45:27.340]   Yeah.
[02:45:27.340 --> 02:45:28.340]   That's me.
[02:45:28.340 --> 02:45:29.340]   There you go.
[02:45:29.340 --> 02:45:30.340]   That's good.
[02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:32.620]   No, no, that kombucha for him.
[02:45:32.620 --> 02:45:33.620]   No, Sir Reek.
[02:45:33.620 --> 02:45:34.620]   Uh-oh.
[02:45:34.620 --> 02:45:36.620]   Stacey Gritt is fine, Jim.
[02:45:36.620 --> 02:45:37.620]   I do.
[02:45:37.620 --> 02:45:41.900]   And we've driven her to drink with this program.
[02:45:41.900 --> 02:45:43.860]   I consider that mission a coolest.
[02:45:43.860 --> 02:45:46.340]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday.
[02:45:46.340 --> 02:45:48.620]   2PM Pacific, 5PM Eastern.
[02:45:48.620 --> 02:45:53.060]   And it is now 2100 UTC because we were about to go into summertime on Sunday.
[02:45:53.060 --> 02:45:58.780]   So we move, UTC does not, but that means you must tune in at a different time.
[02:45:58.780 --> 02:46:00.620]   Just do the calculations.
[02:46:00.620 --> 02:46:02.020]   2100 UTC.
[02:46:02.020 --> 02:46:04.020]   Uh, after the fact...
[02:46:04.020 --> 02:46:05.900]   Actually, that's only if you want to watch live.
[02:46:05.900 --> 02:46:08.580]   The stream is at live.twit.tv.
[02:46:08.580 --> 02:46:14.820]   It's fun if you're watching live to participate with the chat at IRC.twit.tv or in our Discord.
[02:46:14.820 --> 02:46:18.060]   Excuse me, I get the hiccups.
[02:46:18.060 --> 02:46:21.820]   If you're a club twit member, uh, after the fact, you get on to man versions of the show
[02:46:21.820 --> 02:46:22.820]   at twit.tv/twig.
[02:46:22.820 --> 02:46:25.940]   There's a YouTube channel also.
[02:46:25.940 --> 02:46:29.620]   Best thing to do though, subscribe that way you get, uh, immediately as soon as it's
[02:46:29.620 --> 02:46:34.780]   done and edited and you don't have to think about it and you can listen to it at your leisure
[02:46:34.780 --> 02:46:37.260]   or watch it because we put out video as well.
[02:46:37.260 --> 02:46:38.260]   Thanks everybody.
[02:46:38.260 --> 02:46:41.460]   Appreciate you're putting up with us for another five or six hours.
[02:46:41.460 --> 02:46:43.900]   We'll try to make the show a little longer next time.
[02:46:43.900 --> 02:46:46.660]   All two of you who are left.
[02:46:46.660 --> 02:46:48.660]   You sad, sad people.
[02:46:48.660 --> 02:46:50.220]   Uh, thank you so much for being here.
[02:46:50.220 --> 02:46:52.500]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:46:52.500 --> 02:46:53.500]   Bye bye.
[02:46:53.500 --> 02:46:54.500]   Heh heh.
[02:46:54.500 --> 02:46:59.340]   Hey, I'm Rod Pyle, Editor-in-Chief of Ad Astor Magazine and each week I joined with my co-host
[02:46:59.340 --> 02:47:03.580]   to bring you This Week in Space, the latest and greatest news from the final frontier.
[02:47:03.580 --> 02:47:07.740]   We talked to NASA Chief, Space Scientist, Engineers, Educators and Artists and sometimes
[02:47:07.740 --> 02:47:12.220]   we just shoot the breeze over what's hot and what's not in space books and TV and we
[02:47:12.220 --> 02:47:14.940]   do it all for you, our fellow true believers.
[02:47:14.940 --> 02:47:19.020]   So whether you're an armchair adventurer or waiting for your turn to grab a slot in Elon's
[02:47:19.020 --> 02:47:23.260]   Mars rocket, join us on This Week in Space and be part of the greatest adventure of all
[02:47:23.260 --> 02:47:23.660]   time.
[02:47:23.660 --> 02:47:30.660]   [Music]
[02:47:30.660 --> 02:47:33.240]   (upbeat music)
[02:47:33.240 --> 02:47:35.820]   (gentle music)
