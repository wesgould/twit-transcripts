[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.840]   This is Twig.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.640]   Bandwidth for this week in Google
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.920]   is provided by cashfly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.320]   This is Twig, this week in Google.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.640]   Episode 128, recorded January 4, 2012.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.800]   I'm no prude.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.480]   This week in Google is brought to you by Netflix.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.200]   Watch thousands of TV episodes and movies on your PC, Mac, iPad,
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.320]   iPhone, or TV instantly.

[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.600]   It's time for Twig this week in Google and the cloud,
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.720]   and Facebook, and Twitter, and everything else.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.120]   We decide we want to talk about.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.720]   Why?
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.120]   Because this is the show with the highest IQ on the network,
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.040]   so it should be able to do whatever it wants.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.400]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.000]   Part of the reason the IQ is so high
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   is we've got the two smartest people anywhere
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.080]   starting with Gina Trebani.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.640]   He was back.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.000]   So glad to be back.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.880]   She's so smart.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.200]   Her site is called SmarterWear.org.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.240]   Happy New Year, Twig.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.760]   Happy New Year.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.600]   I'm so happy to be back.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.880]   It's been two weeks of not seeing Leo.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.800]   That's too long for me.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.840]   Aw.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.680]   So I'm really happy to be back.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.200]   I know I missed you too.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.200]   Jeff and I did our best.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.400]   Jeff Jarvis is also here.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.640]   He's actually at Arizona State University.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.880]   Today, are you giving a speech?
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.320]   Yeah, there's a symposium here about entrepreneurial journalism.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.000]   So I'm doing that.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Cool.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.600]   I'm doing a book signing tonight, if anyone's
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.680]   around 530 ASU, Cronkite School of Journalism.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.280]   At the bookstore there, or where?
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.160]   No, at the school of journalism.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.960]   Right in the school there.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.480]   OK.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.800]   OK.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.320]   Cool.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.080]   Go see Jeff if you're in-- is it Phoenix?
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.640]   Phoenix.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.640]   Cool.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.840]   I'd be there if I could.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.720]   Jeff is also a professor of journalism
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.920]   at the City University of New York.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.000]   And he blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.200]   And his latest book is called Public Parts
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.000]   about the virtues of living in public.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   So Gina missed last week where we solved all of Google's
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.680]   problems.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.320]   Turns out we didn't.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.880]   Gina, were you-- so I could just
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.760]   see Gina yelling at the--
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.560]   I had gotten back to San Diego and was unpacking
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.440]   and listening to the year end episode.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.720]   And there was one other time I had missed a show
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.800]   and then listened to it after.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.200]   And I had the experience of being a listener.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.000]   And yeah, I was talking loud.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.720]   I was yelling.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.200]   I was like, they're being too easy on them,
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.000]   which is often what we get accused of by listeners.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Now you know why.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.720]   I have an experience like, well, what about--
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.240]   yay.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.240]   And so I wrote-- probably I was probably
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.840]   the hardest on Google I think I've ever been.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.840]   I wrote my very demanding hard line to do list for them
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.600]   in 2020, 2012 on my blog.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.160]   I wish you'd been here last week because I would have loved.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.280]   It's a very good list.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.000]   And I can't disagree with any bit of it.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.360]   So--
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.160]   I mean, a lot of things are just obvious, right?
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.760]   I mean, obviously Google has to release a really great tablet
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.440]   this year, right?
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.360]   I think, though, that that-- now, I have to-- OK,
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.640]   this is what I would have said if you'd said that last week.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.800]   I understand why you say that.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.240]   But I think it's a shame that Google,
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.640]   in order to teach its partners how to do something right,
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.800]   has to release a phone or a tablet to lead the way.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.640]   Microsoft does not do that.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.920]   Microsoft never has had to make a reference Windows computer
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.440]   or a reference Windows phone.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.160]   Why does Google have to do that?
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.560]   What's the problem?
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.080]   You know, I just think it's a different thing.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.480]   I think that these are relatively new devices that
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.760]   have-- that-- you know, it's a new kind of form factor.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.360]   It's a factor.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.720]   It's the most personal of personal computers
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.200]   that have ever been made.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.480]   And I just-- I think that Jobs was onto something
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.080]   when he said, you know, the whole widget, you know,
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.960]   get the hardware and the software people to work together.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.640]   Google's not a hardware company.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.000]   In fact, I don't even have any faith
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.160]   that Google could do a better job than, let's say,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.000]   HTC or Samsung or Motorola.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.800]   Could they?
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.160]   Well, now that they have Motorola,
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.000]   I think that they could--
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.960]   I think that maybe they could.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.840]   So they Chrome, there's that search appliance.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.160]   I mean, they've done some hardware.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.160]   But it's-- they--
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.160]   Well, always with partners.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.000]   Always with partners.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.160]   But now that they have Motorola, they actually are a hardware
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.800]   company.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.920]   If you think of it that way, as much as they've kind of kept
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.800]   Motorola separate, listen, this tablet has to be perfect.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.960]   I got the Get Samsung Galaxy Tab, the 10/1 at Google I/O
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.040]   this past year.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.800]   And over the air update came down and it ricked it.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.040]   The thing was ricked.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.560]   Like for weeks and weeks.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.280]   And then I had to connect it to the computer.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.080]   And I was typing all these obscure commands
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.560]   and downloading these weird--
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.000]   I basically had to root it in order
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   to bring it back to life, which is insane.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.760]   That's insane that should not happen.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.600]   This tablet has to be absolutely stutter free,
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.960]   perfect, flawless ice cream sandwich, amazing, incredible.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.320]   And also they have to partner with other software developers.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.880]   They have to get the New York Times app.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.840]   They have to get a good Twitter client.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.720]   You know, this tablet has to be the tablet that you want
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.600]   if you're a Google lover.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.400]   That's exactly why Android tablets are not making it.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.640]   Google is not Apple.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.200]   And they never will be.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.800]   Adagina, you're right that Google needs a great tablet.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.800]   But I think Leo is right that Google's probably not
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.720]   the one to build the great tablet on Android.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.840]   I don't think they have the skills.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.040]   Although I love this line, don't use chase scenes and explosions
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.280]   or even robots in the advertising.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.480]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.080]   Motorola just really--
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.800]   the droid, the whole droid thing.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.680]   God, I don't understand who they're aiming at.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.480]   No, it's terrible.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.640]   Phone that scares you.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.920]   Oh, good.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.440]   They have to make it the Google tablet.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.800]   Because this is the thing.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.200]   This is the reason why you want to Google an Android tablet
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.160]   over an iPad.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.280]   If you are deeply embedded in the Googleverse,
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.680]   like the Google productverse, that means
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.840]   that you use Gmail, Docs, Calendar, and Maps a lot.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.800]   And those are kind of the most mainstream apps.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.000]   Then Android is what you want.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.440]   Because those core apps, they're superior on Android
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.200]   than they are on iPad.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   I agree.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.560]   I doubt it doubt, right?
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.200]   So if they can make this incredible tablet with ice cream
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.400]   sandwich apps and all those core apps on Android
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.720]   are ice cream sandwiched.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.000]   And what that means is that they will unfold
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.360]   onto a tablet screen very well with fragments
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.440]   and different panels, really true tablet apps.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.120]   Because that's what ice cream sandwich kind of does.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.360]   It lets you kind of fold in menus and fold in fragments
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.040]   to display on many different sizes of screens.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.480]   So they have those core apps done.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.160]   If you are deeply embedded in the Googleverse,
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.360]   they need to make this incredible killer tablet.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.560]   And they have to market it just like that.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.280]   If you love Google, this is a tablet that you want.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.120]   And honestly, because they're playing catch up at this point,
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.280]   they have to price it significantly lower than the iPad.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.720]   It has to be a very simple choice, not
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.160]   like 10 different levels of tablets, maybe two.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.360]   Isn't it ironic that the best selling Android tablet out
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.120]   right now has no Google apps on it at all.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.080]   I'm talking about the Kindle Fire.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.600]   Nothing.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.880]   There's no Google Association at all.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.600]   No, it isn't.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   And it's not even honeycomb, right?
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.280]   It's gingerbread.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.440]   It's not just that.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.600]   With a think, it's matter of--
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.520]   It doesn't matter.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.800]   It's not anything.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.880]   Right, it's not anything.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.840]   It's not Android.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.880]   So this is the thing.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.640]   They have to nail this this year.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.400]   And I mean, you all are going to CES next week, right?
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.440]   So hopefully we're going to see this.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.000]   I want them to hire-- and actually, this segues
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.680]   into a later story in a rundown.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.600]   I was going to say when I wrote this post that they should
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.000]   hire the same firm that did the Chrome ads
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.200]   to do their tablet ads.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.000]   But maybe they should.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.840]   I'll talk about that.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.680]   They did some good ads.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.040]   And then they-- I mean, that's--
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.800]   And then, you know.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.040]   Yeah, we'll talk about that.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.800]   Well, what about my assertion last week
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.400]   that what they really need is to find a good UI guy.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.800]   I know that these people are short in short supply.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.960]   But they need a good-- they need a Johnny Ive in hardware.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.360]   And they need--
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.920]   I would have thought Andy Rubin was the guy,
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.200]   but I don't know if he is.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.280]   Somebody who's brilliant in UI design.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.800]   Because I'm-- well, we can debate this another time.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.360]   But you and I disagree over ice cream sandwich.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.520]   I think ice cream sandwich is a UI disaster.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.880]   I think that I've fallen victim to the like--
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.360]   this happens with me with Android a lot.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.160]   It's like, I see so much potential in this.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.680]   Like--
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.400]   Well, you're a developer.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.240]   You do see it.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.120]   You have a completely different perspective
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.120]   as a developer.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.200]   You see it behind the scenes.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.480]   What decisions were like, I know why they folded those menus
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.960]   into that ellipsis button.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.120]   So it's like, OK, this is future proof.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.880]   That's not an excuse.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.280]   And that's not a good reason to say it.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.240]   It's good.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.920]   But going back to what you said earlier,
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.120]   they don't grow Johnny Ives on trees.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.040]   There's a dearest of these people, I agree.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.600]   And also, Jobs chose--
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.200]   I mean, Jobs, one of the most amazing things that he did
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.760]   was choose great people.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.880]   Like, Jobs looked at WaaS and knew
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.080]   that he was the engineer he wanted.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.520]   And he found Johnny Ives.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.840]   This isn't just a matter of just like a higher good product
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.360]   guy.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.080]   And this is like a cultural DNA thing at Google.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.160]   And a lot of people kind of skewered me and said,
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.920]   Google is an engineering company.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.440]   They're made up of engineers.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.640]   And they build stuff for engineers.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.160]   And asking them to design for humans is unfair.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.560]   I completely disagree.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.120]   Asking a consumer software company
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.440]   to design for humans, for people,
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.160]   is not an unfair request.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.800]   In fact, it's--
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.880]   Let me ask you this, Gina.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.360]   Yes.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:26.480]   What company besides Apple even approaches your standards?
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.000]   Any segment?
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.640]   On the web, I think companies like,
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.880]   I mean, kind of thinking web startups,
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.640]   like I'm thinking companies like GitHub or Path.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.000]   Path is a very good example of a beautifully designed.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.200]   But it's a much smaller thing.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.360]   Would you put Facebook in that group?
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.240]   Because you need to look at a company
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.160]   that's on the scale of a Google.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.360]   Because you can make a perfect path, but that's a little app.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.600]   Yeah, it is a little app.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.840]   Yes, I would put Facebook.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.480]   Facebook figured out what people want and how to give it
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.000]   to them.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.640]   And that's why they do it.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.280]   Clearly, they're at 800 million users.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.400]   Yeah, I mean, Facebook has a very, very compelling thing
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.640]   that I never quite got my brain around.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.400]   So maybe I'm not even a good--
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.520]   No, I don't like their UI either.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.840]   Although I do like-- I think Sam Lesson did a great job
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.280]   with Timeline.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:16.720]   Yes.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.840]   I like Sam a lot.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.880]   And I think he did a good job.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.640]   Sam-- OK, there's an example of someone you hire.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.080]   Sam Lesson, of course, they've lost them.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.880]   But they could have acquired Sam and his company.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.520]   And that would have been a good one.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.080]   Well, no, they did.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:29.960]   No, they got it.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.800]   They bought Dropio.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.040]   Google could have.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.120]   Google could have, yeah.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.240]   But Google's-- don't you think Google's DNA
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.320]   is to look for engineering talent?
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:42.680]   Yes.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.920]   Period.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.520]   Yes.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.120]   And developer--
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.160]   And I'm at this conference today.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.480]   And someone we like from Google was talking
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.480]   and one of the journalism people just said,
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.480]   you know, they're just engineers.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.400]   They're just different.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.360]   They're not human.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.560]   No, I like engineers.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.640]   I love engineers.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.240]   I do too.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:00.920]   I do too.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.200]   But they're not the best UI designers.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.160]   Look at--
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:05.680]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.920]   Look at an engineer's house.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.280]   Look at-- these are guys who wash their hair with soap.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.800]   They are not aesthetic.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.160]   Well, they are aesthetic, but they're
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.080]   aesthetic in a different way.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.200]   Yeah, I wonder how much of that is culturally enforced
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.280]   and maybe enforced and educated.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.680]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.960]   And maybe I'm being too optimistic.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.120]   I think there can be good engineers who are also
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.520]   really good product people.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.240]   In fact, there are.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.120]   We know there are.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:29.800]   Yeah, but they're--
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.960]   We know there are.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.000]   And there are great engineers.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.560]   Later, we'll talk about that other story.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.760]   Matt Cutts, for example, I mean, he's a great engineer,
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.360]   but he should be ahead of communications at Google.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.360]   I agree.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.040]   So that--
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.360]   He did a great thing this week, which we're going to talk about.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.120]   He did an amazing thing this week.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.000]   So it's possible.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.240]   I mean, Zuckerberg, engineer, through and through,
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.400]   going a sense of product.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.640]   Wouldn't it go Facebook if we didn't have a great--
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.640]   Good point.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.360]   Good point.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.000]   Google TV, stop talking about Google TV and start shipping.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.160]   You don't like the new Google TV as much as I do.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.360]   Yeah, so Google TV came out last year.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.080]   You hated it.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.880]   You re-boxed it.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.600]   You said this was annoying.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.480]   I couldn't set it up.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:10.960]   But--
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.720]   I did set it up.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.160]   I just unplugged it after a while.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.880]   I was still under my TV when the update came.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.280]   And I just plugged it back in.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.280]   So it was still on your TV.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.280]   I loved it at first.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.480]   And I was like, browser on my TV, best thing ever.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.440]   And the update came out.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.200]   And you love it.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.280]   And I was disappointed with the update.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.680]   But when we talked before the show,
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.800]   I share your disappointment.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.760]   I don't feel that it is lived up to--
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.280]   those apps are very limited.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.080]   We need more apps.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.320]   We both agree on that.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.640]   Definitely need more apps.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.760]   And we're already a version of Android behind at this point.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.480]   Like this update, which was supposed to happen
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.200]   at the end of summer, was monthly.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.720]   And also is now already a version behind on Ice Cream
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.220]   Sandwich.
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.520]   And we talked about the app selection.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.080]   I mean, the app selection at this point,
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.920]   Netflix is great app, Plex is nerdware, but also a good app.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.080]   There's space invaders.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.080]   That's kind of cool.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.800]   But I'm also not going to play on Google TV.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.120]   I'm going to play on the Xbox.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.880]   And there's a fireplace app.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.320]   That's--
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.320]   It's pretty cool.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.000]   It's a live fireplace.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.240]   So I said that--
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.880]   By the way, that sounds like Gina's joking.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.080]   That's the app everybody says, oh, you got Google TV.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.200]   You got to get-- what is it called?
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.000]   Cool.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.960]   Classy fireplace.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.440]   Classy fireplace.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.120]   You got to get that.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.840]   And I have it.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.360]   And I said stop talking because Schmidt made this prediction
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.360]   that in 2012, all these TVs would have Google TV embedded in them.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.040]   But the reality is that Logitech said
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.040]   that it was one of the biggest mistakes they've ever made
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.200]   was launching with the review.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.600]   And it just feels like Google TV progress
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.200]   is moving along at a snail space.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.160]   So if it really is going to be a blockbuster thing in 2012,
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.400]   I want to see more movement on that front.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:38.900]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.460]   Gina, I think you're right there, too, that also says that, OK,
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.160]   Larry, if these are your top priorities,
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.880]   you've now set them, then you better do absolutely at all those.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.080]   Yes.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.120]   Yes.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.120]   Interesting challenge.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.560]   Raise the bar for what's ready to ship.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.240]   In other words, they put too much crap out with the saying,
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.840]   well, it's beta, and we're going to iterate.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.280]   But Gmail was beta, but very good when it first came out.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:04.780]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.080]   You can go too far the other way.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.040]   And I think that you've gone through feature creep
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.120]   and waited forever and not gotten input from people.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.360]   The way of thinking these days is ship early and iterate.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.960]   Get something out and iterate.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.360]   That's how everybody thinks nowadays in terms of app design.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.440]   But I agree with you, Gina.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.280]   I think that there's examples like Google+ Buzz.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.120]   It's a very good example.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:28.620]   Yeah.
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.600]   Oh, that was the best.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.200]   And I could think you could maybe argue the wave as well,
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.400]   that these things might have done better.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.080]   Both Buzz and Wave were stillborn.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.320]   Might have done better had they paused.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.120]   Had they baked them a little more fully?
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.080]   Had they seen them--
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.600]   I think that release early and iterate often
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.960]   is also part of Google's DNA.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.960]   I'm not saying that they should stop doing that.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.800]   But I think the reality is when you get to the size that you
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.240]   are at the influence that Google has, the scale that Google's
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.360]   at, when Google releases a new product,
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.760]   it is a big freaking deal.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.880]   They're not a small web startup anymore.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:05.120]   And it has really wide ranging consequences.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.120]   So I just think that I would like to see Google say,
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.760]   this isn't quite ready to ship yet a little.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.000]   I want them to take things a little further.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.400]   Honeycomb, not ready to ship.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.880]   I felt like they just put it out there
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.600]   because they felt like they needed a tablet.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.520]   Google+ Business Pages released without the ability
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.000]   for several people to administer.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.480]   That seems like a very basic piece of functionality
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.760]   for something like that.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.760]   That was long awaited enough.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.080]   If they had just taken it another month or another two weeks
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.120]   hour long, would it have taken for multiple administrators?
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.000]   That would have felt a little more fully-based.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.040]   Or maybe they didn't even think of it.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.720]   The problem is I put it a different way.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.640]   I think they have to expand their dog food pen
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.520]   and put more dogs in it, including people outside of Google.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.000]   And so they can release--
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.480]   so the problem is if scoble were in their dog food pen,
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.920]   he would have said, are you kidding?
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.320]   This product has to have this before you release it.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.760]   Yeah, let's scoble try it first.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.160]   It was scobles it.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:58.720]   That's it.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.280]   That's it.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.240]   If scoble tries the products, we'll all be OK.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.160]   And you know what?
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.120]   That's not insane because he's the kind of guy
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.760]   who digs into a product and discovers those things.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.160]   And they need people like that who are outside Google.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.560]   They need you, too.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.360]   And also people who are not as sympathetic to Google.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.400]   I mean, alongside the Robert scobles,
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.880]   there should be the MGC gliers.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.160]   There are a lot of-- yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.400]   Too many fanboys to release.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.400]   Finger, yes.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.840]   Yes, that was interesting.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.840]   That was interesting.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.640]   Well, even their policy around real names was not fully baked.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.120]   No.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.360]   That ship before was ready.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.160]   Had they just thought about it a little bit,
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.840]   they would have seen the issues.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.880]   So the problem is they're not open enough.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.880]   So I think there's a question--
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.840]   it's not a binary thing.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.920]   It's something along continuum where
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.120]   they dog food inside the company,
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.880]   or they release calling it a beta.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.800]   And what you're saying, I think, Gina, is the betas
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.520]   aren't good enough to be betas.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.680]   And the reason they're not good enough to be betas, however,
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.160]   is because not enough people have seen them.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.400]   So there's a catch-train, too, here.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.760]   They need more people to use the products early
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:06.040]   so that when they do put it out, even as a beta, it's better.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.600]   But I'm going even a little further
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.440]   in saying instead of depending on users
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.040]   to tell you what your product should be,
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.280]   be a little more opinionated and aggressive
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.440]   about what you think it should be from the beginning.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.040]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.760]   And iterate if that's the--
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.600]   Yeah, but do they become Steve Jobs then?
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.600]   Do they become Apple?
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.600]   Where they say, we know what's best for you people?
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.240]   Yes.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.000]   And they shouldn't go that far.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.880]   I just want them to go one or two notches
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.320]   toward that direction.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.680]   When they launched Google+ and it's complicated,
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.400]   was one of the relationship status drop downs,
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.120]   it just felt like--
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:37.960]   It's pretty obvious.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.480]   Yeah, it's just kind.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.440]   You couldn't come up with a different phrase to--
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.480]   so that kind of thing really frustrated me.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.400]   I want to see them do something new, totally different.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.640]   Not seem like they're playing catch up,
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.720]   not seem like they're being timid and putting out
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.400]   something that's bland and doesn't really have sharp edges,
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.080]   just to see what people say.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.600]   I want them to be a little more opinionated
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.400]   about what their products are from the back up.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.800]   I think Larry Page is stripping it down to the metal
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.760]   and is rebuilding it.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.520]   And I think that all of this is something he's considering.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.240]   I think so too.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.440]   I think it's big company, I guess.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.600]   They're myopic.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.520]   They are a little stuck in their ways.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.440]   And I think Larry is really going to try
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.280]   to kick them in the butt.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:20.840]   Yep.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.000]   I mean, my concern about this-- and we
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.520]   don't have to stay on my post this long.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.400]   But my last paragraph I was saying
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.200]   that the thing that concerns me as an open source developer
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.720]   is someone who's kind of committed to the values
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.320]   and the ideas around the word open, which became so charged
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.920]   because Google put that forth as like, this is our goal.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.960]   This is what we're committed to openness.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.400]   I don't think open should mean that every feature gets included.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.760]   It shouldn't mean design by committee or consensus.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.280]   It shouldn't mean chief and mediocre.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.720]   And Google is in a position to prove that.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.400]   And I want them to do that.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.160]   I want them to show that open can
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.760]   win in a consumer market, not just the minds and hearts
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.280]   of developers, but also consumers.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.600]   And that's what I want to see from that.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.520]   I agree with you.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.400]   Investors Business Daily named Larry Page CEO of the year,
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.680]   even though he's only been CEO since April.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.280]   I guess Leo Apotheca really couldn't have gotten that.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.120]   So while noting that Google has increased revenues
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.680]   over the last two quarters by 32% and Page took an aggressive
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.880]   approach to inspiring one of the internet's top performers
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.440]   into something even better, I'd agree.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.120]   I'm very encouraged by the cuts Larry made as much as they
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.960]   heard, I think that's encouraging.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.480]   Meanwhile, Yahoo has a new CEO announced today,
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:42.720]   Scott Thompson, former president of PayPal.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.040]   Can anyone say--
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.600]   Would anyone take that job?
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.720]   I mean, that and AOL.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.080]   They must have offered him a big job.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.080]   As many people pointed out, the problem is not the CEO position.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.520]   They need the new board.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:02.200]   And I don't think there's any way to win in that job.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.360]   No, it's like--
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.400]   All right, so let's play-- Gina, you just fixed Google.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.600]   I just saw that one problem.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.280]   So let's saw that.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:10.720]   Let's fix Yahoo.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.480]   You can't fix Yahoo.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.280]   I think Yahoo's got bigger problems.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.920]   You cannot fix Yahoo.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.280]   Isn't that odd though?
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.840]   They have such good content.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.800]   They've flicker.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.640]   I don't understand why you can't fix Yahoo.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.680]   I know flicker is the one thing that makes me think.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.520]   You know, I thought flicker was a money loser.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.640]   I really was convinced that flicker was a money loser.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.480]   I saw somebody who really knows says no, no, it's very profitable.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.320]   Oh.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.680]   Yeah, that surprised me.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.840]   Even with all that bandwidth.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.000]   Yeah, that surprised me.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.720]   Gorge.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.760]   Yeah, that's just surprising.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.960]   I mean, then again, I pay for a flicker pro account.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.520]   Me too.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.960]   That's where they make all their money.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.880]   Worth every penny.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.280]   It sure is.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.320]   Until Yahoo kills it.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.000]   Let's take a break.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.200]   We're going to come back with more including the mind-boggling
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.080]   mat cuts.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.080]   My hero.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.880]   Just what he did was amazing.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.440]   Just blows my mind.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.240]   I want to talk a little bit about our phone system.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.440]   I know this is a little weird kind of inside baseball,
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:19.840]   but we like the company so much that they become a sponsor.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.360]   Thanks.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.320]   Sometimes that happens.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.560]   So when we moved into the new building here, the new Twitch
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.960]   studios, I had to face something I never even thought of
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.040]   in the old cottage, we didn't have a phone system.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:35.120]   We had one line, and I had cordless phones.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.160]   And that was it.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.480]   And everybody used their cell phones.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.320]   I mean, because we just kind of grew.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.800]   But when we got-- we're in a business here.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.240]   We got 20 employees.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.520]   We got spread out.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.880]   We've got producers making calls.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.960]   Everybody-- we got people using the company phone
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.480]   to do stuff.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.160]   We've got an 800 number.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.480]   And so I realized, oh my god, what am I going to do?
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.760]   I got to get a phone system.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.040]   I did not relish the idea of getting the PBX in the basement
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.440]   in the service contract.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.720]   And god, I just thought this is not it.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.240]   So we didn't need to do something more modern.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.640]   I said, well, is there a VoIP solution or something out there?
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.120]   I thought of putting an asterisk, building our own asterisk
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.680]   server in the basement.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.760]   And then, thank goodness, Russell Tammany, our IT guy.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.600]   So you know what I do?
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.640]   I've done lately a lot is Ring Central.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.880]   And I said, I don't know them.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.880]   What is it?
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.840]   It's basically a virtual PBX system that's just fantastic.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.120]   If you go to RingCentral.com, you can learn more about them.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.560]   The idea is we just get the-- there's no configuration.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.080]   There's nothing.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.280]   This is why Russell likes it.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.600]   He doesn't have to sit in the basement
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.560]   writing scripts for four days or have some guy from AT&T come
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.640]   over.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.520]   You get the phones.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.680]   We've got these great polycoms.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.960]   As you plug them in, it's auto-configured.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.480]   We have music on hold.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.840]   We have all these extensions.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.320]   And then there's other cool stuff.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.960]   Like there's an Android Ring Central app
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.280]   and an iPhone Ring Central app.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.880]   So I can have my cell phone ring when somebody calls me on Ring
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.600]   Central.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:03.000]   All my messages show up on my cell phone, including the audio.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.480]   So I can listen to the audio.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.960]   Is that out of focus?
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.920]   Oh, yeah, that's the best better.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.880]   I can make calls for my cell phone that appear to come from
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.840]   Ring Central.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.280]   So not from the office numbers.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.080]   So I don't want to accidentally show my--
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:19.840]   here's Do Not Disturb.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.080]   Do you love that?
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.040]   I can turn on Do Not Disturb.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:22.880]   So won't ring.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.680]   I have that on my phone and my office, too.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.920]   The busy signal.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.160]   They brought back the busy signal.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.120]   It just goes to voicemail.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.040]   There's no busy signal.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.120]   But it goes to voicemail.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.720]   The voicemail's very sophisticated.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.120]   As I said, voicemails in my email, they could show up on
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:35.920]   my cell phone.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.920]   When I make a call from my cell phone, it comes from the
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.600]   company number.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.040]   So when people call me back, it calls back on the company
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:41.240]   number.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.080]   Our producers love that because they do want to use their
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.680]   cell phone sometimes.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.200]   But they don't want to have to use it all the time.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.120]   And they don't want to give out their cell phone number
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:48.520]   to everybody.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.680]   I just love this thing.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.000]   $25 per user per month.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.640]   And that includes unlimited long distance in the US and
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.640]   Canada.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.480]   It includes faxing.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.120]   I was paying almost that much for an e-fax account.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.720]   And we all have faxing.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.640]   Faxes go to our inboxes, faxes out.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.600]   It's just fantastic.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.880]   Real phone lines everywhere.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.520]   But it is so--
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.240]   just check it out.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.480]   I want you to check it out.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.280]   For 30-day trial, just visit ringscentral.com.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.000]   Do I even have an offer code or anything?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:15.360]   Just go.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:20.240]   Or call 800-800-4070.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.680]   800-800-4070 is the number one cloud phone system for
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.000]   business.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.600]   I know why now.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.920]   It's the way phones should be.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.840]   So easy.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.720]   You just plug it in.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.360]   Ringcentral.com if you want to know more.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.000]   Yeah, it's kind of a nice thing when--
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.600]   well, we try with our advertisers.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.840]   I don't do any advertisements for stuff that we don't use.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.760]   So we don't-- people ask to advertise all the time.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.600]   We just say, I can't.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.600]   I don't know you.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.840]   I don't know the product.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.560]   So it's kind of nice.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.000]   We've got the Ringcentral system.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.760]   It was like two days after Russell said--
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.040]   and then they called and said, we want to advertise.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.120]   So I said, OK, I think so.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:00.800]   That's great.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:01.320]   That's great.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.400]   It's a true endorsement.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:02.920]   It is.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.840]   And we've had it for six months now.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.760]   I think we all agree.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.320]   It's just great.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.440]   It's just a really neat solution.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:14.680]   So this is just the weirdest story.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:22.400]   Chrome violates Google's paid links policy.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.240]   People noted it.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.360]   And so Matt Cutz said, we've investigated
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.640]   and we're taking action to demote the Chrome site for 60
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.720]   days.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.240]   Now it was more complicated than-- there was only one paid
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:36.840]   link.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.200]   What happened was Google-- what Google
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.040]   wanted to do was get videos, I guess, on these--
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.400]   I don't know exactly what it was.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.600]   They wanted people to use it.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.080]   There's some still slimy there is that for Google
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.560]   to do paid placement for blog posts.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.200]   Well, they shouldn't have ever done that.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.160]   They shouldn't have done that.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.560]   And that's this bad on its own.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.640]   It wasn't-- in only one case, did it end up causing links?
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.920]   Here's what Matt said.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.360]   By the way, talk about transport and transparency.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.400]   Posted on Google+, yesterday, Google
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.080]   was trying to buy video ads about Chrome.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.280]   They're trying to buy ads.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:19.560]   And these sponsored posts were an inadvertent result of that.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.040]   So what they thought they were doing
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.520]   is buying ads on these websites.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.280]   But what actually happened is they got a sponsored post.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.440]   We did find one sponsored post that
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.560]   linked to google.com/chrome that in a way that
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.880]   flowed PageRank-- I don't know what that means--
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.400]   flowed in.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.760]   In a way it would influence PageRank
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.880]   because it would look like a link.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.080]   It looked like a PageLink.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.920]   Yeah, it didn't have the nofollow attribute on it.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.280]   So a sponsored post was supposed to have the nofollow attribute
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:43.800]   on them.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.040]   So there are two dozen of these.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.400]   One of them did not have a nofollow attribute.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.160]   That seems pretty minor.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.480]   Yeah, it does.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.320]   But they're pure.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.480]   They'll be impure.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.840]   And that's what's great about them.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:59.520]   So for 60 days, if you search for Chrome,
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.400]   you won't find google.com/chrome.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:05.920]   I got to do that.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.400]   This is just wild.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:13.120]   I mean, for a company to do that, he says, well, now here it is.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.560]   Well, you get the support.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:14.760]   Right.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.040]   You get--
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.400]   Get the support window.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.760]   Support.google.com.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.600]   You don't get google.com/chrome.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.400]   Although you do get the sponsor.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.320]   I think you get mostly what you want.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.440]   But I think you have to go like six pages down
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.360]   to find google.com/chrome.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.320]   But now, as I look at this, they put an ad on here
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.720]   that says install Google Chrome as the ad result.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.100]   Right.
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:37.560]   The link is there.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.720]   Did Matt do enough?
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.440]   Truthfully, I think they did too much.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.480]   That's crazy.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.640]   They penalized themselves much more
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.600]   than they would have a third party.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.720]   Because they said that they felt that they had to hold themselves
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.720]   to a higher standard.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.240]   So OK.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.440]   I mean--
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.360]   We have taken stricter action than we would
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.960]   against a typical site.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.200]   Well, but let's talk about this for a second in another way.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.120]   I think it's Matt being honorable and good.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:11.320]   But let's remember that Google is always facing--
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.560]   what would this play?
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.480]   What would this question look like when asked by a senator
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.360]   to Eric Schreibt in Washington, Washington?
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:17.760]   Right.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.680]   And the area where Google now faces more pressure
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.520]   as a monopolist, I think, will be Chrome.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.440]   Because it has now passed Firefox.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.440]   It soon could well surpass--
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.960]   It has great value.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.840]   And so I think they have to be--
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.680]   so yes, Gina, it was theatrically
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.240]   masochistic on their part.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.800]   But I think it's more than--
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.160]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.560]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.840]   I mean, he's so guilty.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.680]   He's so guilty.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.880]   I was like--
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.880]   Like a good Catholic boy.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.840]   Scarlett A.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.640]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.120]   It just felt a little like much.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.160]   Well, if you invest--
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.120]   If you invest again--
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.000]   I don't want to defend them.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.160]   But if you investigate, they hired an ad for an unruly media.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.240]   And I guess unruly media made a mistake.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.040]   They were trying to buy ad placements.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.920]   And in one case, it screwed up.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.920]   I do think that maybe went a little far.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.040]   But it's good PR, right?
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.080]   They're getting in a way.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.720]   They're getting a lot more press than--
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.240]   And you still are--
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.480]   I mean, you got an ad on the top of the search results.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.560]   If I'm looking for Chrome and I Google Chrome, which is kind of cuckoo.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.720]   But if I did that, I'm going to get that link.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.680]   That's the first thing.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.560]   Even though it's an ad, it's exactly what I want.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.800]   So what have they lost?
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.160]   Nothing.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.120]   And they get a lot of good PR.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.040]   Oh, clearly.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:33.560]   What if you--
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:33.560]   What if you--
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.640]   --be a little clueless.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.760]   Searching for Chrome?
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.480]   Search for browser, Leo.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.240]   Oh, OK.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.640]   Let's try that.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.360]   Talk about clueless.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.360]   I'm using Safari, which still has a separate Google search window.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.240]   It just drives me nuts.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.440]   So let's Google browser.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.240]   Well, number one, Google disciplines itself
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.120]   in Chrome browser page rank controversy.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.120]   That's the number one result.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.400]   Number two, result Firefox.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.520]   Number three, Wikipedia is entry for web browser.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.520]   Then Wikipedia is entry for Chrome.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.160]   Then Opera.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.120]   Then a site called the browser.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.920]   Then a definition from browser Chrome, which is not the same as Google Chrome.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.720]   It's the UI.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.960]   And then another news story.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.120]   And then Safari.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.000]   And then IE.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.440]   And nowhere on here, even there's an ad for Google Chrome, except--
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.280]   I don't want to live in a world where Opera ranks higher than Chrome
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.840]   and search results for browser.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.920]   I just have to follow up with that.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.840]   So I wonder, this must be the penalization.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.320]   This is it.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.640]   Definitely.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.360]   Wow.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.120]   Well, what it also gives them is the opportunity when somebody else messes up.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:41.480]   And they say, these are the standards we're going to hold you to.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.760]   They can always say, we hold ourselves to hire standards, in this example.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.520]   They have to--
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.480]   No, this is the right thing to do.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.600]   It's weird.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:54.440]   And I can imagine that Matt's going to be getting some cold shoulders in the company
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.840]   cafeteria for a little while.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.160]   I think that Google has lots of opportunities to promote Chrome.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.920]   I mean, I think the only thing about this story--
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.760]   Like the Super Bowl, probably.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.360]   Like the Super Bowl and the front page of the Google--
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.840]   Google.com.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.000]   The thing about this story that just surprised me was Google was unaware,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.320]   Google hired an advertising firm and was unaware that part of that package
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.200]   was getting sponsored blog posts on what looked to be these like,
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.920]   no name blog-- like blogs that, you know, from people who just sort of accept,
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:32.640]   you know, write posts for Dunkin' Hines, random brands.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.880]   I don't know, how did that get through?
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.320]   I imagine there were some internal discussions about that.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.120]   And I imagine there were some internal discussions about how do we make sure we don't hire someone
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:45.040]   who's doing something like this without us being super aware of what's happening?
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.800]   That's exactly it, Gina, because it cheapens the whole web.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   What's wrong about this?
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.000]   It isn't trying to screw with page rank.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.440]   The whole world does that.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.520]   What's wrong about this is trying to buy the voice of blogs,
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.400]   buy the authentic voice of the web.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.840]   It falls into the worst of demand media and all that stuff.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.280]   It's-- what was it?
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:09.040]   Paper Post was that horribly evil thing that changed his name and is still as badly.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.200]   That's your exactly right, Gina.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.200]   That's the bad part.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.920]   Whoever did that should be the one getting the cold shoulder somewhere outside of Google
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.920]   today.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.600]   It's true, but I think that's just part of what you get when you hire an ad firm.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.560]   I think this is probably just part of it, right?
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.800]   No, you supervise them.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.080]   Yeah, you got a media plan.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.960]   You tell the advertising agency what your goal is.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.920]   They are called unruly media.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.800]   Bad boy advertising agency.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.160]   Is unruly media say anything on it?
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.480]   It's slightly-- I'm sorry I'm asking you to do this, but I'm trying to stay off the browser
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.360]   so I don't screw up my bandwidth worse.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.640]   Let me Google unruly media.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.920]   It's unruly media, Doc.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.600]   See if they got punished, punished too.
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.600]   They are viral.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.480]   They're a viral company.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.480]   They do social-- this is what they do.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:33:01.480]   They do, I'm sure, pay for post stuff.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.560]   That's what they're doing.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.240]   They're going after advertisers who want to be--
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.440]   Word of-- it's word of mouth, everybody's so cold.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.680]   Maximize sharing.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:16.440]   Unruly's proprietary technology platform, ramp, real-time amplification and measurement
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:21.360]   platform enables us to sell guaranteed, engaged time with your audience.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.360]   Big girl.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.160]   How can you guarantee engaged time with us, the people?
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:29.280]   We can expose your content to hundreds of millions of unique users across our hand-picked
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.480]   portfolio of blogs.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.480]   Ooh.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.440]   They're basically saying this is what we do.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:41.360]   I mean, and Google just has this like army of quality tech blogs who basically cover--
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.360]   I mean, you know, cover these.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.360]   They don't need to do this.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.320]   These chromads for free because they were actually good.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:50.880]   You only pay when people are actively watching and engaging with your content.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.280]   Oh, my God.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.280]   Oh, my God.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.600]   I'm going to barf.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:01.520]   Unruly can amplify the effects of bot media by seeding videos to influential journalists,
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:07.720]   bloggers in Twitter, Roddy, and spreading content across channels and fan bases on social.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.000]   Have we ever heard from these guys?
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.160]   Have they ever contacted us?
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.800]   If they ever come in the door, throw them out in their ass.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.360]   Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and stumble upon helping you earn attention, generate peer
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.520]   recommendation and a mining word of mouth.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.560]   Unfortunately, this is what's wrong right now with the internet is that influential
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.360]   journalists are allowing themselves to have videos seated.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.360]   Terrible.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:35.200]   Well, it's the same as Steve Waldman, who was a brilliant journalist who did a report recently
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.520]   for the FCC about the future of journalism.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.920]   He just did a piece online.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:44.200]   He confided at Google about TV stations, Wiley and FCC.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   Oh, horrible.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:50.640]   My regulation by taking video press releases, putting them on the air and not identifying
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.640]   the source.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:52.800]   Happens all the time.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.800]   Exactly.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.840]   And there's regulation about that because TV is regulated.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.880]   Well, we, the bloggers here are not and never should be regulated, but there's some call,
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.960]   maybe the FTC, believes that we should be for these purposes.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.520]   If we're not forthcoming.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.040]   And then when you have companies going along and trying to pay to do that and you have
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.440]   Google paying such a company to do that, that's the big mistake.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.800]   That's where they should be in the woodshed.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   And clearly, if Google hired this company, which they did, they knew what they were doing.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   They had Google.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.800]   They're bad.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   They knew what they were doing.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.720]   The company who used just a year ago never ran a commercial.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.720]   Right.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.280]   I was, you know, I was strange.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.600]   Hey, what are they going to now?
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.280]   They're super bowl commercial in 2010 was a reap was something an old commercial was
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.680]   a old.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.440]   And I don't remember what they did last year.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.600]   Was it another one that they that we'd seen before?
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.600]   I think it was.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.160]   It was the romance one.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.160]   I think so.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:51.040]   There was the one with the French love story that was, that was, I think, 2010 Super Bowl.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:56.400]   So, and that was the first time they ever bought a TV commercial, like big airtime, right?
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.640]   So it was more than a year ago.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.640]   And what they did 2011, but they didn't make a new ad.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.640]   They just using all that.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.640]   So I'm hoping they'll make a new ad.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.400]   I think they'll have to make a new ad this year for a Super Bowl.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.240]   What do you think they'll advertise?
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.640]   Well, so those were for search, right?
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.800]   And they have that Google Plus ad now that we've seen, which is not a good ad.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:21.240]   The one about, he gets her creep, he's in her creeper's circle.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.800]   She's in his true love circle.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.840]   And then he's yeah, terrible ad.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:32.440]   It makes Google Plus look incredibly complicated to use.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.440]   Which Super Bowl is this?
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.760]   Is this XLI chat room or XL?
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.840]   I don't remember off the top of my head.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:46.360]   I'm just looking to see if there's a Google ad in this, an XL.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.360]   There's a GoDaddy ad.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.480]   Maybe GoDaddy will do an ad on how they love SOPA.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.240]   I mean, we love, oh no, we hate SOPA.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.240]   Love it.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.240]   Hate it.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.240]   It's XLVI.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.840]   Oh, so this is really old.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.840]   XL.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.680]   Don't even get me started on GoDaddy.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:03.680]   Don't get me started.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.680]   Don't even.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.680]   I'm just proud to say we've hated them since 2009.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:09.680]   Me too.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.560]   I just didn't like the sexy ads.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.200]   I thought this is just cheesy.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.200]   Well, yeah, right.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.800]   It was like misogyny, shooting outfits, SOPA.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.800]   Take your pick.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.000]   Take your pick, exactly.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.920]   No, that was interesting to think.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.920]   I forget her name, something.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:29.960]   The young woman who started the competition against Bank of America is also the one who
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.920]   started the major petition against GoDaddy.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.520]   She's like 22 years old and she started this out of nowhere.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.520]   Good for her.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.520]   And she's double featured.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.920]   So I'll be careful.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.800]   I'll edit myself rarely for the purposes of your rating, Leo.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:49.040]   But if you want to start an S storm against something, the question I asked my blog was,
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.160]   is there a point at which GoDaddy, and I'm not sure this point exists, right?
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:57.160]   But just theoretically, is there a point at which they reach enough penance that they
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.080]   get forgiven and they get business back?
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.800]   Oh, no, it's already happened.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.200]   You know, there was this big dump GoDaddy movement.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.400]   It was a blip compared to they get.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:11.520]   They have like, I saw the numbers, the number of new subscribers every day on GoDaddy.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.080]   Well outweighs any number of people who dropped GoDaddy.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.320]   But would that happen anyway?
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.280]   Yes, they don't have to do anything.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.280]   They don't do anything.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.320]   You know, but just theoretically, if you go after a company at some point, is there a
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.320]   goal?
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.560]   Is there a behavior that you expect?
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.320]   And if they reach it, you say, okay, you're forgiven now.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.720]   I think the argument about GoDaddy is, well, no, there's too much to forgive that elephants,
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:35.960]   some misogynist, big breasted ads.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.960]   That was actually of all of the things that was the thing that bugged me the most about
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.960]   them.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.960]   Also, there's just a ton of crappy upsells and you know, I tell you, it's just much.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   It just feels that way all the way around.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.480]   But I do like the fact that you, I'm sorry, but right after the GoDaddy thing with SOPA,
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.760]   then we had the Verizon $2 to pay your bill fee.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.760]   Oh, which that was great.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.560]   Within 24 hours that got built.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.560]   And that's the cloud.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.880]   That's the customer cloud.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:04.880]   Love it.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.800]   We finally were getting some cloud here.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.800]   It's about time.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.880]   By the way, just, I'm going to pat myself on that.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.680]   Go, I've turned down GoDaddy advertising since day one.
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.880]   And they, they offer a significant amount of money.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.120]   I, I think they did.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.640]   I couldn't do GoDaddy ads.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.640]   Are you kidding me?
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.440]   I think you're so happy.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.440]   I'll say that.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.440]   I mean, I'm not really happy.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.440]   It makes me feel really happy.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:37.000]   But, but we were glad when Hover.com and Elliot Noss from, from two cast came to us at Hover.com.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.600]   And that's a good company.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.960]   I was glad to support them.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.960]   I'd love to see this crappy kind of upstart.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.960]   So it's the advantage of, of, yeah.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.160]   Now people are going to point out the Twit.tv is still registered at GoDaddy.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:50.960]   And that's because they locked my domain when I tried to transfer it.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:51.960]   And it would show me credit.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.320]   Now I think they've turned that thing off.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.920]   So I, I have, I just have been lazy.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.400]   I got to go over there and transfer it.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.400]   Right.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.760]   So the locking domains, the blocking domains, making it difficult for people to leave.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.160]   And just to be clear, like we don't not like sex.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.160]   Sex is good.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.160]   Sex sells.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.160]   We like to look at pretty people.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.760]   I think people know that I like sex an awful lot, actually.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:14.760]   That's not what we're doing.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.760]   I'm no prude.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.760]   I just try to keep.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.760]   I love you.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.760]   I love you.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.760]   I really do.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.760]   It was on this show, you know.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.320]   But it was so fast.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.760]   I thought, I mean, I knew it happened.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.440]   And Eileen switched right away from it.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.440]   And I thought, oh, I didn't know.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.440]   I didn't know.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.000]   Who was the person out of life who did this though?
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.960]   It happened so fast that I thought, oh, I'm not going to ask her to edit it because
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.280]   it's not nobody's going to see it.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.120]   And by the way, this was in October or something.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.640]   This was early October.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.640]   The timing was, yeah.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.640]   It's a little weird.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.280]   Anyway, I don't want to go on about it.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.640]   But yeah, I would edit it out if I thought anybody would see it.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.680]   But I just thought, oh, it's, it's, it's so quick.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:58.680]   Deal.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.680]   Nobody will see it.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.240]   But you see what I forget is that you guys are viewers.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.800]   They're so they're eagle eyed.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.920]   And of course you could freeze it.
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:05.920]   I mean, it's easy.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.000]   You just stop it and say, oh, what was that?
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   Whoa.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.920]   So Google got fined, changed the subject.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:19.640]   This is just, gosh, I would, you know, I feel bad for Google on this one.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.560]   I feel bad for Google and I feel bad for the principles of the net again.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.560]   This is terrible.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:25.880]   It's a free speech issue.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:30.560]   This is completely misunderstanding how Google works and how the networks and how, and how
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:36.800]   the notion of our combined activity stream leading to data works that you're trying to
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.000]   control, what you're trying to control in the end is our behavior.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.400]   Because that's where that search comes from.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.000]   Is that the case or that, or is this French court just not understand what Google, so
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   here's what happened.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.720]   You know, when you start typing in a search result, Google suggests what you might mean.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.080]   And there are lots of fun.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.240]   We can, we can have some fun with it right here.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.680]   If I just type my name in, I'm sure it'll, but I'll do it to myself.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:06.840]   Leo LaPorte is an idiot, a jerk, a douche, and awesome.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:13.040]   Now, I, now, so what happened is that a French company, you type that company's name in and
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:20.160]   you'd get is a crook and they sued and won.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:26.080]   Now I can't sue, this is, this happens because it's purely algorithmic, right?
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.080]   It's just because.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.080]   Yes.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:32.080]   But this is the kind of control that European regulators are very, and courts of various
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:37.320]   sizes and sites want to put on Google, but thus the net.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:41.040]   Because while Google's doing is reflecting our behavior and they're saying that we wish
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.080]   people wouldn't behave this way and so we're going to make you hide that from the world.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.080]   It's not Google's job.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.080]   No, they're a search.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.080]   Google's job.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.080]   There it is.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.280]   Well, and if Google comes along and says, you know what?
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.720]   Okay, you're right.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:59.640]   We believe now that we don't like pick it.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:03.200]   We're, we, we agree with Rick Santorum and we don't like gay people.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.200]   Right.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.760]   And, and they start to for Rick Santorum.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.760]   Oh my God.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.760]   Don't Google him.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.760]   Right.
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:12.760]   But I don't think it's for Rick Santorum saying about, about, about gays lately.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:16.600]   That's what I'm saying is, so he's getting this.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.600]   Come up with us.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.600]   That's called a Google bomb.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.600]   That's the search results.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:24.120]   That's when a group concerted the first Google bomb was Bush.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:29.320]   What didn't push it was, uh, well, you would Google the word failure and George Bush would
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.600]   show up.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:35.080]   That was the first Google bomb I remember, but the idea is a lot of cooperating websites
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:39.440]   tie some, one thing to another thing through links, Google algorithmically, and you, and
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.440]   I'm telling you, you cannot expect them to change that.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:46.440]   Otherwise, it breaks the search algorithm came up with this connection.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.120]   You type in failure, you get George Bush.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:52.280]   The smart thing to do, which is what the George Bush campaign did is start buying other links
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.080]   so that you have a response.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:58.480]   So somebody, somebody who didn't like Rick Santorum.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.480]   Dan Savage.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.480]   Dan Savage started it.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.480]   That's better.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.480]   Good.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.480]   Which is interesting.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.480]   Dan said, what could we do?
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.720]   What, what can we do?
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.040]   And I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:15.080]   And please don't, uh, folks, if you're at all sensitive, do not look up.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.840]   You know, what's, what's interesting about this?
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.000]   I had this experience this week.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   I was looking for a hotel in DC.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.600]   So I'm going to be traveling there next week.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.160]   And I typed in the name of a hotel into the Google search box.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:27.760]   And the first suggestion was bed bugs.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.920]   Wow.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:34.240]   And I didn't even highlight to see what the, I just moved on.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:36.120]   Like the decision was made for me instantly.
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.120]   No, thank you.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.120]   Not staying there, right?
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:40.480]   Um, and you know, Dana Boyd wrote an interesting.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:44.320]   Which by the way, doesn't mean that there were any bed bugs there.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:49.080]   There were bed bugs and it doesn't even mean that there's a lot written on the web about
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.360]   them having bed bugs.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:55.440]   All it means is that people searched for this hotel plus bed bugs.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.480]   To see if, to see if they had any, right?
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.560]   I mean, you know, I don't even know.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:05.320]   This is the thing like this is reflecting not only, it's not just there are lots of web
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:08.480]   pages out there that say, you know, this hotel has bed bugs.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.080]   It means that people were searching for.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:16.560]   So Dana wrote a great piece about, you know, a fictitious high school student with an Indian
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.440]   name who people, you know, who people decide, you know, wanted to know whether or not he
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.640]   was a terrorist, right?
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.680]   And kept searching this person as a terrorist person as a terrorist.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.760]   Now there's nothing written on the web about the person being a terrorist.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:31.680]   Now this person's going into college and the first auto-police suggestions for this person
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.000]   is this fictitious person's name.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.080]   But I thought this was a good example was Al Qaeda terrorist, you know.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:43.280]   So, you know, this is, you know, so this is guilt by algorithmic association.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.280]   So that's us.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.880]   Now that's a good example of something that doesn't seem very fair.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.240]   And the bed bug example is another good example.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:54.520]   Maybe this isn't, maybe Google suggests has some flaw.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.240]   But, but, but, you know, it's no different, you know, but if, but if let's say if there
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:03.040]   were ridiculous sites written about that kid being a terrorist and they're all just as
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.400]   wrong and people actually wrote the stuff and people clicked on it.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.320]   But the suggest doesn't come from that.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.280]   It comes from people searching.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.640]   No, what I was saying.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.640]   Doesn't come from links.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.360]   But the same thing could happen.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.360]   And that's it's.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.360]   But that's different.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.360]   Well, but how is it different?
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:23.920]   To me, if people, because people are proactively writing articles saying George Bush is a failure,
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:27.360]   George Bush is a failure, that's different from the fact that somebody's saying, well,
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.720]   do they have bed bugs at this hotel?
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.760]   That is no way asserting that they do have bed bugs in that hotel.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.320]   It's just saying this is a common search, but it implies it makes this connection.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.360]   That's what that's what Dana saying here.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:43.280]   It makes this connection that's a spurious connection.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.560]   And and and people now are there's a couple of possibilities.
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:49.360]   People will get educated and say, oh, that's just a suggestion.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.360]   Right.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.360]   Yes.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.400]   But I don't think we worked that way.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.280]   You know that, Gina, and you still didn't go to that hotel.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.520]   I know how this works.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:01.360]   And when I saw bed bugs, I was like, whoa, then on, like I it wasn't, you know, and there's
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.000]   nothing that hotel can do about that.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Right.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.720]   Well, you know, I would be curious that if you search for that hotel and went ahead with
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:11.760]   the search to find out how much is written about bed bugs in that hotel, whether there
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.760]   is something behind it.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:18.240]   And you know, and I am several people ask me, well, did you go to the bed bug registry?
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.560]   Apparently there's a bed bug registry for hotels about whether or not there have actually
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.360]   been, which I probably should have done.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.360]   You know, I was in a rush.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.760]   I needed a hotel and I, you know, it was it was my first visceral reaction and I'm educated
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:33.160]   about how all this all works was whoa, you know, moved on.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:40.240]   So I will look into that to see if this poor hotel actually, but you know, are you saying
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.000]   that the court is right?
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.400]   No, actually, I'm not.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:46.720]   I mean, obviously Google can't, this is algorithmic.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.720]   So Google's off the hook.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:52.040]   So there's no way that you find them, but I'm, I am suggested that maybe Google wants
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:59.800]   to rethink this because it does have an unintended consequence that is potentially harmful to
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:06.040]   this kid, this imaginary kid that Dana's writing about to this hotel.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.960]   She calls it guilt through algorithmic association.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:16.960]   So it's, I don't blame Google, but I wonder if maybe they should not surface this.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:21.240]   She says interestingly, guilt through algorithmic association is not constrained to Google.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:26.800]   This is an issue for any and all systems that learn from people and convey collective intelligence
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.280]   back to users.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.000]   Okay, but the problem then is us.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.640]   We've met the enemy and he is us.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:38.960]   And so what we're trying to do is figure out a society in so many areas, what our new norms
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.960]   and expectations are.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.760]   And so, you know, can you legislate that?
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.760]   Could you throw it through courts?
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.800]   Can you regulate that?
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.200]   Or do we have to learn or do we have to create better technology that starts to learn where
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.920]   this stuff happens?
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:57.840]   But it's about the changing of our norms, really.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.960]   And it's something new that's come up that we're trying to grapple with and figure out.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.240]   But the problem at the nut is us.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:11.600]   So I am making the distinction between Google bombing, which is actual search results that
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.600]   connect to phrases.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:17.480]   And this algorithmic thing that doesn't have anything to do with content.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.480]   But it is.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.760]   This is the new Google bombing, right?
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:21.760]   I mean, this is the new manipulation.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.640]   But you can't, how do you manipulate it?
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:24.640]   You can't manipulate it.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.080]   You keep searching for a lot of it.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.600]   Yeah, a lot of people have to do.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.040]   You can organize that in Twitter now.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.360]   Here's here's my fantasy.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:37.880]   What I want to do is organize everyone in New Hampshire to and North Carolina to lie to
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.800]   whatever pollster there is about who they're voting for.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:45.800]   So we grab away from the horse race journalists, well, the data to make believe that they know
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.960]   what's happening.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.360]   And you could you could organize that pretty easily now through social media.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:54.680]   I would like to ask a favor of all my friends.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:50:01.640]   If they would start searching for Leo Le Porte as a handsome, handsome fellow because I just
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.880]   don't think idiot jerk douche and awesome describe me.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:09.840]   Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, by the way, the is, is that becoming because people are saying
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.280]   Leo Le Porte idiot in a search?
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:15.240]   Or is it because there's idiot in documents about you?
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:18.640]   Yeah, actually it is because, well, it looks like I'm getting search results that say that
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.360]   connect me to idiot.
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:26.200]   But I'm not sure that but I'm not sure Leo, I'm not sure that that in that case comes
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:29.000]   that data came purely from search requests.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   Right.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.920]   No, no, I think it's it must be more than that.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:32.920]   I think it's a comedy.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:36.800]   So if you just search Leo Le Porte, then you get podcast KGO, which was one of my radio
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.360]   stations used to be until they went.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.680]   That's another story to the dark side Twitter and website.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.680]   So that makes those are those are searches, right?
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:50.400]   Those are common searches, Leo Le Porte podcast, Leo Le Porte KGO, Leo Le Porte Twitter, Leo
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.400]   Le Porte website.
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.760]   It's the is that is puzzling.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.760]   What happens there?
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:59.160]   Yeah, you see, I'm not so sure that comes just from search and that's purely algorithmic
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.160]   in that sense.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.160]   Yeah, what is that?
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.160]   That's that's bombing too.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:11.320]   You know, like God knows is idiot returning his life had an idiot returning his iPad is
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:16.520]   a twit is a what?
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.400]   Huh, right?
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:21.120]   So people did not search for this is content.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.600]   No, this is content.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.600]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.600]   This is content.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.240]   Well, why do people hate us, Jeff?
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.240]   Let's see.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:30.040]   Gina, it'll probably say, no, let me.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.040]   Oh boy.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.040]   I won't do that.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.040]   I just pretend.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.040]   All of this for.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:38.640]   Well, you know, I don't I don't write about my my wife.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.640]   You know what?
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.640]   But I talk about her marriage and why I get nothing.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.120]   I get nothing.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.040]   There's no suggestion for Gina Smith.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.360]   Oh, I said Smith.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.360]   That's not your name.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.360]   Sorry, I was in a crash.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:50.360]   That's not your name.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.280]   Leo, you know what?
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.280]   This is it.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:57.360]   Gina, no, Gina Smith is a woman I worked with for many years of my former video.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:58.360]   There we go.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.360]   There we go.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.720]   Gina Smith, Gina Terrace Patropani is married.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.640]   And now that's it.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.480]   I don't write about it that much.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:10.900]   I suppose there isn't a result there for when well, there's just married flicker photo
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:13.560]   sharing is number one.
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:18.600]   Number two is from friend feed then Google plus.
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.600]   Huh.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:28.640]   So how come you avoided the douche idiot because she is neither and we all live.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.160]   So this proves it.
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:35.000]   Jeff, you're absolutely your contention is absolutely right that it is content based
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.400]   because Gina is a sweetheart and we're.
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:38.400]   Yes.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.960]   It's a it's a combination.
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.160]   It's definitely a combination.
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:42.160]   All right.
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.160]   So that's it.
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:49.520]   I'm feeling also conscious about every show every show is we have to Google ourselves.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.520]   Yeah, we do.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.720]   Who knows what's going to happen?
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.960]   Clearly the $65,000 fine is just clueless.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:01.120]   Unfortunately, there's a lot of these clueless courts, not just in France, all over Spain
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:04.680]   just passed sopa basically should be very interested in a see.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:09.240]   This will be a good test tube to see what happens in Spain.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.720]   This will happen in March.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:15.080]   Spanish government will have the right to just cut websites off.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.720]   Watch carefully see what happens.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:21.240]   And don't forget that you have basically the predecessor to occupy Wall Street in the
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.240]   Indi Nattos of Spain.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:28.920]   Oh, you have an organized pirati movement in Spain and the government may want to kind
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.080]   of shut them off.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:34.000]   Yeah, what's that they do?
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   And this news generalist, Mo Francisco Franco is still dead.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.400]   Wait, wait, maybe not.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:40.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:43.120]   Yeah, I got a chance to search for generalist for Francisco Franco.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.120]   What does it say?
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.480]   This says that he's a douche.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.480]   That's an interesting question.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:48.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.440]   Let's hope it says he's dead.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:56.880]   Generalist, Mo Francisco Franco is still dead.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:03.240]   Still seriously dead.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.760]   This is you know, it's cool about that.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.040]   It shows that Google even has some history because this is all predates Google.
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.040]   Some history.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.400]   There's history in the in there.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:12.400]   That's nice.
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.840]   Is it YouTube video about that?
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.600]   Yeah, because it's from Saturday Night Live.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:16.600]   Right.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:17.600]   Okay, right.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.840]   So these are all SNL going back to you right now.
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.080]   She does too young to have any idea.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.440]   She's wondering what the hell was happened before she was born.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.960]   This is how old we are, Jeff.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:28.480]   We were rolling with it.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.240]   We were adults.
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.800]   We were watching this.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.680]   She was not even born.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:36.920]   She's she all the old gods are going off again.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:38.880]   What are they talking about again?
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:39.880]   Guy Lamparto.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:44.320]   I want to learn from you.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:48.880]   Yeah, you'll be all to someday, Gina.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:51.160]   Don't you forget it.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:54.760]   So maybe those search results are a little bit based on age.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.200]   You'd like to know I'm an old man.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.600]   Oh, Jeff Jarvis is.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.600]   Oh, that's right.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:01.920]   We've been around long enough to be hated.
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.600]   We have more track records, right?
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.000]   You've got more you've got more enemies.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.800]   You've got more opportunities.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.400]   My life goal, get more enemies.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.920]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.920]   Everybody loves Gina Trappani.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.960]   Yeah, opposite of love and aint indifference.
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:16.960]   It's true.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.760]   They're just different sizes the same coin.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:19.760]   Yep.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:25.480]   Google buys 217 patents from IBM and got the verge.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.760]   I love the verge.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.240]   They're going to be at CES too.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:35.160]   And I'm looking forward to getting Neelai and their company on the show.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.160]   Joshua Tupolsky.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:46.440]   Big Blue is selling 217 patents, including mobile phone patents.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:51.600]   Patents on data caching, blade servers and server load balancing.
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:55.040]   Maybe it's just Google says we just if we can get them, we should.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.040]   Stock up.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.040]   Stock up on patents.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.040]   Mm hmm.
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:00.040]   It's a patents patents by patents.
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:03.720]   You know, but it's a it's still a pity that's where capital goes.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:05.640]   Google has billions of dollars that it could.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.640]   It is.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:10.720]   Like Apple and other companies that could be investing in things that are going to create
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:14.480]   jobs and create new technologies and instead they're buying friggin old patents.
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.480]   I agree.
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.240]   Hey, Tom Merritt.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:19.360]   Did you see this?
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:22.160]   Russ Pitts just took a job with the verge.
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.720]   They're doing prep.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.320]   He's our old producer.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.760]   Oh, crazy guy.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:32.440]   He wrote the most the best, the funniest, I quit letter ever at tech TV.
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:35.280]   If I could find it, I would read it out loud in a dramatic voice.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.000]   It's very funny.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.120]   Android 4.0.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:44.440]   That is ice cream sandwich, which we were talking about.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:53.160]   Apparently, Android is saying that Google is saying that the Android holo theme is required.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.160]   What is this?
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:59.920]   It just means that any Android device that's 4.0 or higher has to ship with their with
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:02.360]   Google's default holo theme.
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:05.840]   What they're saying is no more fragmentation.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.320]   Yes, this is partially they're saying.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.360]   How do they enforce this?
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.760]   That's not true in the open source, right?
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.320]   No, this isn't.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:18.360]   This is for the phones that get the Google name on them and have the Android market.
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:23.000]   If the Google Android market is on the phone and the Google name is on it, so not kindles,
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.800]   but phones that have the Google endorsement, this is now one of the requirements that Google's
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:27.800]   enforcing.
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:28.800]   I'm happy to see this.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:33.200]   This is one of the things that I want to see them do is use these rules about you get to
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.000]   use our name when.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.920]   So basically, they're saying that every 4.0 Android device from here on in has to ship
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.600]   with the holo theme, which is awesome for developers because it means that you know that
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:46.560]   your app will look the same on every device.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:48.880]   Ship with it or does it have to use it?
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:49.880]   It has to ship with it.
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:52.360]   So it doesn't have to use it, but when you build your app, the developer building your
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:56.880]   app, you can specify, I'm using the holo theme and you know that any 4.0 device and higher
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.760]   will look the same across the phone.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:02.080]   Any device, no matter, even if the manufacturer has created no skin.
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:09.560]   So this is an issue, of course, HTC, Samsung, Motorola, everybody's skins, LG skins, you
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:13.560]   know, they've got Samsung's TouchWiz, which is okay, but it's a little kind of candy coated
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:16.800]   HTC, which really sense, which really is a big shift.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.920]   I think it's nice, but some people hate it.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:24.400]   Motorola, of course, horrible, horrible.
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:27.760]   I don't know anybody who likes what Motorola does to Android.
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:32.360]   So all of these guys, well, they'll continue to be able to do that, but the holo theme
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:33.360]   will be there.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:39.600]   So like your app, when to do.txt runs, you can specify, turn off the TouchWiz and be
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.600]   just holo.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:44.080]   Just use the holo and it'll be the unmodified version of the holo theme.
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:47.200]   So manufacturers can't change a theme, which is fantastic.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:51.520]   So it just makes it easier for developers to sit to have one design target to trust that
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.280]   it's going to look the same across every device.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:59:00.840]   And that's from 4.0 on and they made it a little easier even for earlier devices.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:05.840]   I think the early devices don't have the theme, but they've created these new theme families.
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:07.160]   Android handle theme is really nice.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:11.160]   As a developer, you say, I'm going to use this theme and then here are my customizations.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:14.040]   It's like having like a base CSS style sheet.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:18.640]   It's not CSS, it's XML, but same difference, just a rule list of rules and then you can
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:19.640]   make your customizations.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:23.880]   So this is a nice step forward for developers designing good looking apps and you'll know
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:25.360]   that it looks the same.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.360]   Good.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:27.360]   And I love holo.
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.360]   I've said nasty things about ice cream sandwich.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:32.320]   Mostly it's about the moveable buttons, but I do think holo is gorgeous.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:33.320]   I think they didn't have these jobs.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:34.320]   The theme is nice.
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:35.320]   And the typography is really nice.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:36.320]   I'm excited about this.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:37.800]   Love that new droid font.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:42.640]   Isn't it ironic that Motorola's customization is called Blur?
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:46.560]   Like they thought that was a good name for anything having to do with user interface.
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:48.840]   Oh, let's call it Blur.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:53.440]   So we'll make it really hard to figure out whether or not you're tapping the right thing.
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:54.440]   Blur.
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:55.440]   Kind of illegible.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:56.520]   Who thought that was a good idea?
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:58.160]   It was so fast.
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:04.400]   Yes, I'm using the new Motorola ugly font with Blur enabled.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.840]   This is the iffy release.
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:12.600]   Crashy 1.0.
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:17.480]   Ice cream sandwich is now on 0.6% of Android devices.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:22.680]   So if you do a little math, going to Brian Bishop writing for the Verge, that's 707,000
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:26.720]   Nexus's because that's the only device with it, right?
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.720]   And the Nexus's right.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:28.720]   So the Nexus's.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:29.720]   Nexus has his upgraded ride.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.720]   Right.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:31.720]   Right.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.720]   Right.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720]   Right.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.720]   Right.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:35.720]   Right.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:36.720]   Right.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.720]   Right.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.720]   Right.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.720]   Right.
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.720]   Boy, it was, we didn't talk about this because it happened Christmas.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.720]   Oh, I guess we did, Jeff.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.720]   Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.920]   It's 3.75 million Android activations.
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.920]   Yep.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.720]   It's 3.75 million apps sold last week.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.600]   These numbers just go over my head now.
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.040]   I have no scale to figure out what they mean.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.440]   It's huge.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.160]   You know, I understand something like viewers of a TV show or circulation of a newspaper
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.160]   or magazine.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:07.280]   I don't get, you know, remembering too that a lot of the majority of apps that are downloaded
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.640]   are never used.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.640]   Right.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.120]   Well, it was Christmas, right?
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:15.320]   So in Hanukkah, so a lot of people had new phones and they downloaded a lot of apps.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.880]   I'm not surprised, but the first billion plus week.
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.720]   Also Google Plus traffic leapt 55% in December.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.840]   49 million visits according to Experian Hitwise.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:32.440]   Well, it's, I'm finding about Google Plus.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.080]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.600]   Google Plus Post ranked very high in search results.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.720]   So this is measuring visits.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.360]   People are Googling and they're finding, I mean, each Google Plus Post is its own webpage.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:46.000]   In fact, I added a story to the rundown.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   Someone complaining that, you know, I wrote a post on my blog and then someone posted
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.320]   on a Google Plus and their post ranked higher than my post.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.960]   So we both put that in their John Mitchell.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.960]   That's frustrating.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.960]   Read, write web.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.960]   I think he went a little bit overboard.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.640]   It's on the list as John Mitchell there.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:08.360]   He said that Google Plus is going to ruin the internet because he argues that it's social
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:14.240]   SEO now and rather than his post coming up first, two references to his post came up
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.240]   first.
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.240]   So why?
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.240]   Social beats, the original, I agree.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.240]   I think it's overblown as heck.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.400]   In fact, isn't that great?
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.400]   Isn't that great?
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.560]   That people are reading your freaking post?
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.560]   I agree.
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:24.560]   I agree.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.200]   Somewhere in there, something interesting that happens about the social discussion becomes
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:35.280]   an entity the same way as the content you're discussing, but that's okay.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.280]   Why don't you like it?
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.280]   This show.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.280]   Why don't you like it?
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:43.760]   Well, I don't like that you can't link to articles in line inside a Google Plus post.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.920]   So you can have that one link that you post and you can discuss it.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.920]   I agree with that.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:48.920]   It really can't do a full blog.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:49.920]   They need to have that.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.920]   They know that.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:51.920]   They know that, right?
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.280]   So if I post this under my blog and then several people have discussed it on Google
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:59.600]   Plus and used my headline as their first line of their post, I'm grateful for that.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.160]   That's awesome.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:05.520]   But Google's search results should be smart enough to know this is the link that's associated
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.160]   with this discussion happening on Google Plus.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.920]   So we should rank that higher than the Google Plus posts.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.120]   I think that's what he was complaining about.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.120]   So I thought-
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.440]   I think in a news search, like if you were looking Google News, yes.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:23.240]   In a straight on search, it should be just whatever gets the most Google juice.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.960]   Whatever has the most Google juice.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:31.760]   If there's 8,000 comments on that Google Plus post and there's 20 on yours-
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.480]   Right, then that's more significant.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.720]   It's more significant.
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:39.760]   And I would say, I would submit that you're still driving traffic to your site, aren't
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:40.760]   you?
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:41.760]   Absolutely.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:42.760]   Absolutely.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:43.760]   You want people discussing your stuff.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.240]   And the fact is that sharing- I mean, this is what you want to do.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.760]   You want to write good content, but then you want it to get shared.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.760]   Yes.
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.760]   Definitely.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.880]   I just don't like that Google Plus has so many limitations that you can't link inside
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:55.360]   Google Plus the way that you can-
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.360]   I agree with that.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:57.360]   They need to fix that.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.360]   They definitely need to fix that.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.920]   And you know, you can argue that links are power the web and the fact that you can't make
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.480]   links and a Google Plus post post on multiple links is weird and limiting.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:07.880]   But anyway, go ahead, Jeff.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:11.400]   The other thing that I want to do, I was at this conference today, Richard Jingeris,
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.600]   who wants to be on the show, by the way.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.600]   Oh, good.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.600]   I'd love to have him on.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.600]   Which would be great.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.760]   So we'll have him on ahead of Google News now, part of Google Plus.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:24.520]   One thing that I want and said to him is- and I've said this before, but as a YouTube
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:30.520]   video is a playable inside of Google Plus post or a blog or anywhere, so should an article
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.640]   be playable out of embedded?
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:33.640]   Inside.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:34.640]   Embedded, yeah.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.680]   If I want to point to a Guardian article and point to this paragraph, you know, right
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.960]   now when I do a course, I cut and paste it out and put a link in.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:43.480]   But as Gina says, you only have one link and it's limited.
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:47.560]   Why can't I put, just as I would a YouTube video, put the entire article with that highlight
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:52.960]   in it, with their brand and their revenue and their analytics and their links all inside
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.720]   that post?
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.400]   Now that's not a limitation of Google Plus.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.840]   That's a limitation of media companies thinking this way.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:03.600]   It's a limitation of Google Plus in so far as we need a standard for doing that.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:08.640]   Gina, I imagine you could figure out how to do that with the hand tie behind your back
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.560]   and two drinks that you're going, right?
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:17.120]   Well, you know, I don't know if I want to embed a whole other webpage with all their
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.680]   advertising in it, like in a Google.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.280]   No, no, no, not the whole page.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.760]   Just take an article that is designed for this purpose.
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:25.760]   Right.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:30.240]   So say, okay, here's a block quote, here's attribution to that block quote.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:34.120]   And here's the whole article if you want to read it.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.120]   Right.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.120]   Right.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.480]   It's not the webpage taken as a whole.
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.000]   It says, here's the article.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.760]   And by the way, there's some revenue attached to it as an opportunity.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.760]   Right.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.840]   I mean, I think part of Google Plus too is the API.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.080]   Like there has to be a way to express that kind of structured data, you know, multiple
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.720]   links and quotes with attribution.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:54.800]   And Google has started, Google Plus has started to do that.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:06:00.080]   Like when you get a link, you get certain bits of metadata, the title, the URL, the description
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:01.800]   and the thumbnail image.
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.120]   So we're starting to get there a little bit.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:07.240]   It would be nice if it was like, you know, the pull, you know, the pull quote, you know,
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:11.240]   that the attribution, the author name, and then have to be able to have multiple ones.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:16.200]   We'd have to, we'd have to, we'd have to make sure we had that metadata on our sites
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.080]   properly formatted, right?
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.080]   Right.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:20.080]   Right.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.040]   Well, but if you want to just, if you want to highlight one paragraph and, and you could
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.040]   do it yourself, right?
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.840]   You'd have to do it yourself.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.840]   Right.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:26.840]   You could do it yourself.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:27.840]   But there's no way to express that right now.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:32.280]   And Google Plus all the time, I will put just quote marks and put the text, you know, a
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.320]   little pull quote of the text someone else said.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:37.440]   In fact, I did that recently of really funny rant.
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.920]   And my brother, you know, texted me, it was like, are you angry?
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:40.920]   Like, is everything okay?
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.880]   I'm like, no, I didn't write that.
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:51.320]   But it does feel a little bit like, um, I'm copying and pasting someone else's content
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:52.480]   into my Google Plus post.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:57.200]   And if it shows up higher results, it feels a long fare to them.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.200]   Right.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:03.240]   Well, all we have to do, all we have to do is tell, uh, Google that we will use Google
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.240]   Plus more if you'll just do these few things.
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.240]   Yes.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.240]   I think we would.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.560]   I think I would be much more apt to use it.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.560]   And they would learn more.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:11.760]   They would learn more about content.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:16.680]   They would learn more about who's authoritative and who recite.
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:18.520]   They need that data in this.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.480]   I can't imagine this difficult.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:25.360]   No, well, as they said to me when I pushed them on to somebody there, not richer somebody
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.360]   else.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.360]   They're not a blogger.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.720]   You know, they have all the publishing module they need.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:30.720]   That's true.
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:31.720]   They should do it.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.520]   Um, it seems like an easy and you could have the simple mode where you can do it just as
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:38.360]   is and you want to link to something, but you could have the more comp, the advanced mode
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.600]   where you can put all kinds of stuff in.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.600]   All right.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:47.440]   Real quickly, cause we got to run, um, uh, phone dog Noah, Noah Kravitz wrote for phone
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:52.960]   dog created a Twitter account with a 17,000 followers over an eight month period.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.480]   Phone dog underscore Noah left phone dog.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:59.120]   Phone dog suing him saying, wait a minute, we want that account.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:06.320]   That's in effect a customer list, which you took with you who owns a Twitter account.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.840]   Who owns the relationships?
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:10.000]   I think phone dog Noah does.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.800]   Yes, but there is no more phone dog Noah.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.800]   There's just Noah.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.800]   There's just Noah.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:20.080]   What if I lean, uh, actually she uses her own, in fact, everybody here is on there on
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.360]   Twitter handle, but what if I lean was, which is what you should do.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:23.360]   Yeah, you should do.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.360]   And then that eliminates this issue.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:28.640]   Well, maybe not, but what if I lean between all this time is twit.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.640]   I lean and then she left.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.760]   I'm not going to sue her saying, give me, give me your followers.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:38.240]   Well, what if she, what if she changed tricaster?
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.240]   We don't own tricaster.
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.240]   We don't own that.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:44.280]   Somebody that that that's some guy or gal.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:45.280]   I don't know who it is.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.280]   That's so great.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.280]   Oh, I thought it was you guys.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.640]   Oh, no, we're not that live.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.440]   We're not that organized.
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:54.040]   We barely do the two live.
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.520]   We don't know what the heck we're doing.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.240]   We need a social media strategy.
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.240]   We did.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:02.600]   There's got to be aligned between company Twitter accounts, social media accounts and,
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.640]   and, and person ones, you know, what.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.680]   But that needs to be stated upfront.
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:07.840]   I agree.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:08.840]   I agree.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.920]   I mean, it's, it's good stuff when you're a writer and you're mostly associated for your
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:14.560]   work in a particular title and you say, Hey, this is my association.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.560]   It gives you credibility.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.360]   You know, the fact is that Twitter gives you the right to change, you know, if it's
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.920]   your password that you set up an account that you established and your employer has
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.240]   no problem with being calling yourself, phone dog Noah while you're working for them, you
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.120]   have the power to change that username.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.560]   You're in control of that account.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:30.560]   That's what he did.
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:34.320]   And this is something that really should be written into contracts in terms of, you know,
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:37.160]   the problem was he was the only guy working on the site at the time.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.360]   In fact, he wasn't even a staffer.
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.360]   He was freelance.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:43.880]   So they just didn't have a policy because it was brand new, I guess.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.680]   Yeah, that those, that those are his relationships.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:47.680]   They're his relationships.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.680]   I don't care if it was phone dog Noah.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:51.680]   It's his relationships.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:55.240]   And the truth is that if people were listening to him because he wrote about phone dog and
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.640]   he stops writing about phone dog.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:57.640]   That's different.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:06.840]   Rupert Murdoch has a Twitter account and I now, you know, we're no fan of Rupert's,
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:11.360]   but I am a fan of his Twitter account because it's him.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.360]   It's boy.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.360]   Is it him?
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.360]   Oh, is it him?
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.720]   In fact, is, you know, one of his early tweets got him in trouble with his wife.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.400]   He said, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not true.
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:26.960]   Well, not with his wife, but he said, Oh, it wasn't he, it wasn't him who said Brits
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.960]   take too many holidays and don't work hard enough.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:33.680]   He said that he said that and killed it, but the reports about it being his wife had
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.360]   made it happen came from the fall.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.920]   That wasn't a real account.
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.920]   Okay.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:38.920]   Wasn't a real account.
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:42.760]   So he did delete Twitter verified.
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:44.760]   This is a day.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:45.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.960]   This is a verified account and he's tweeting about books that he likes.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:54.120]   He only apparently sees Fox movies, but he likes them.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.320]   He likes to show the replaced to one back better than Glenn Beck.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.560]   I thought that was interesting.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:02.720]   He said he didn't, he basically said he doesn't like Glenn Beck in this much more fun than
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.720]   Glenn Beck.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:07.600]   They got rid of Glenn Beck and so the New York Times did, Brian Stolten analysis of this.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:10.400]   The Washington Post Howard, Howard Kurtz, rather was going up to the side.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.400]   I said, well, is that obvious?
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.800]   He's going to support what show is on now.
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.080]   Well, that's true.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.080]   But it's interesting.
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.080]   He's a fake third page.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.000]   I think he's very forthright in this.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   Don't you think?
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   He likes Santoram.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.160]   He likes Santoram, but he likes Ron Paul.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.440]   Santoram would never get on a rally after, told me if this is coincidence.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:35.800]   After Murdoch posted his endorsement of Santoram, someone else on Twitter told me that Santoram
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:37.160]   was now scheduled on a ride.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.400]   Well, don't you think if you worked at Fox News, you'd be parsing this Twitter feed pretty
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.400]   damn close?
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.400]   Yep.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.400]   What does Rupert want?
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:51.180]   Rupert always said that he owned the New York Post and lost more than $25 million a year
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:54.080]   on it because he wanted, and is there his words, a bully pulpit?
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.080]   Right.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.080]   Right.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.080]   And that's certainly Fox News too.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.080]   Right.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.760]   Well, I think what's fascinating to me is he is discovering the bully pulpit of the people.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:06.320]   It looks like he's gone through this and fixed the typos.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.320]   Is that possible?
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.880]   Well, you know, Bob, that's the way he took it over because Leo, if you look at who he's
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.800]   following, it's all just Fox corporate stuff.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.840]   And they got rid of the fake Larry Page account.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.720]   So somebody said, Rupert, we've got to take this in hand.
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.240]   Oh, that's sad because yeah, it's all fixed.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.520]   There were a lot of typos.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:28.600]   There were a lot of weird character, weird capitalizations.
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.440]   It's all been fixed.
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:34.720]   Oh, Rupert, you were so real.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.960]   Now it's just going to be sanitized.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:40.200]   Wish I could fix my typos.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:47.720]   Yeah, that's something that obviously Jack Dorsey helped him with because you can't edit
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.120]   a tweet, but Rupert can.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.360]   Oh, that's right, Leo.
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.120]   Rupert can.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:58.120]   I'm pretty sure that these were not that these were mis punctuated and miscapped by
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.120]   the way they were.
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:05.480]   Emily Bell, X Guardian now Columbia tweeted yesterday wondering, does this mean, does
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:08.760]   these conversations between Jack and Rupert mean that Rupert might invest in Twitter?
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.800]   And then she asked the thought experiment here.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.680]   What do journalists think if Murdoch owned a big honk of Twitter?
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:18.440]   He said at the Paul Allen conference that he didn't think you should invest in Twitter
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:22.600]   because it had no business model, but that means he's been looking at it, right?
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.480]   That means he's been thinking about it.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.480]   I got to sit.
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:28.120]   It's like the eye of Mordor.
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:31.960]   Oh, oh, yeah.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:36.040]   The bailful eye of Mordor has turned.
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:41.800]   I was brought out, they paid to bring me out to moderate a panel between Nick Denton, sorry,
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.120]   I mentioned the name, and Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.400]   Oh, that must have been interesting.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:47.400]   It was fascinating.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.000]   It absolutely was fascinating with Murdoch there.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.720]   This was right before he bought the Wall Street Journal.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:56.560]   I wish I'd taken a picture of him reading the journal with his craggy brow beforehand.
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.440]   And where I was going to point there, what the hell was it?
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:00.920]   It wasn't talking about me.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.920]   It was some actual point.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.720]   Oh, age is horrible people.
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:04.720]   Don't worry at all.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:05.720]   Gina, don't get old.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.960]   Let's take a break and we're going to go because we've got to get going because TNT is here
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:13.960]   and we want to quickly do our number and our tool and our tip before we do that just a
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:14.960]   brief mention.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.960]   Netflix, Netflix, Netflix.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:16.960]   Get Netflix.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:17.960]   I forgot.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:18.960]   I forgot.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:19.960]   My mom's birthday.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.960]   I forgot.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:21.960]   I've got to get her.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:22.960]   It was yesterday.
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:23.960]   Happy birthday, mom.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:24.960]   You're getting Netflix.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:30.280]   She said now I've been thinking because first I got her the three disc subscription.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.520]   Then last year, she said, I don't use the discs.
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.240]   Get the streaming.
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.960]   And then I just talked to her last week.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.560]   She said, well, I've been thinking I'd like one disc.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.960]   So I'm going to get her the one disc.
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:40.960]   It's a great gift.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.520]   Now, here's the deal.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.680]   You're already a Netflix subscriber.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.680]   I know that.
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:49.920]   If you're not, we have a free deal, 30 days free of Netflix streaming at Netflix.com/twit.
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:54.800]   If you are, would you tell a friend to just let them know, Netflix.com/twit, 30 day trial,
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:55.800]   great stuff.
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:56.920]   I use it all the time.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.600]   And it's a good way to kill a battery on a smartphone.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.400]   If you're trying to just recharge the battery, I just put Netflix on and let the movie run.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.240]   So another good use for it.
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:09.160]   Even that alone would be worth $8 a month.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.720]   Netflix.com/twit.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:14.240]   Gina's tip of the week.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:17.640]   New Year's digital life cleanup tip.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:18.640]   Mypermissions.org.
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.320]   It's a really simple site.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:25.480]   All it does is it sends you links to all the different apps that you authorize on other
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.480]   websites.
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.120]   So, you know, we're all pretty interesting to have you early adopters here.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.120]   You sign in.
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.360]   You connect with Facebook here.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.000]   You sign in with Twitter here.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.240]   You grant access to your Flickr photos, your Instagram photos here.
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:40.320]   And you know, we try out apps and then we don't use them anymore.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.960]   This site take two minutes.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.480]   You could go through and just do a quick audit.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.760]   What apps have access to my profiles on these various other sites?
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.120]   And which ones do I don't need anymore?
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.120]   Which ones can I revoke?
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.880]   And it just tightens up the security.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:53.880]   Look at all these.
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:54.880]   This is Twitter.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:55.880]   What?
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:56.880]   That's a piece of glue.
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:57.880]   You don't use how many.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:59.720]   How do you know what these things are?
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:04.920]   Yeah, I mean, if you're not using stuff and even as a developer, I have so many like test
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.920]   one, test seven.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:08.920]   Authorization account.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.040]   So just go through and it's just links really.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.040]   It's just links.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.040]   Nothing fancy.
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.040]   This is like glorified bookmarks.
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.800]   You don't have to offer your account to this permission site to use it.
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:22.200]   It's just links to the console, which lets you know which apps you offer at any different
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.200]   site.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.080]   This site, this guy, Avi Charkam, remade this site.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.240]   It took him three seconds.
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:31.320]   It's basically links to the permissions page for each of these eight websites.
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.320]   That's it.
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:36.760]   But you'll be shocked at how many things you've authorized and you don't know what you're
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:37.760]   doing.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.760]   It's just brilliant though.
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:39.760]   I mean, I could have designed this.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:40.760]   This site took of no time.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:41.760]   Oh, I know.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:42.760]   It's great.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:43.760]   It's great.
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:44.760]   It's great.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:45.760]   It's great.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:46.760]   It's great.
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.760]   It's great.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:48.760]   It's great.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:49.760]   It's great.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.760]   Now change your passwords, backup your data.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.760]   This is good.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:53.760]   I like this.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:54.760]   Yeah, this is stuff you don't need anymore.
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:55.760]   It's very nice.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:56.760]   January cleanup.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:58.760]   It took the least amount of time.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:00.760]   Oh, my doing last.
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:01.760]   That was brilliant.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.760]   He gets a putty.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:03.760]   He does.
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:04.760]   Yes.
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.000]   We're going to make that up.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   That's a good one.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   A putty award.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   That's a good one.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   I like that.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   I like that.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   I like that.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   You should have a putty hackathon.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   It's good.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   I remember Philip Kaplan.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.480]   He did F company.com.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:20.240]   And I remember him saying, you know, it's simple.
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.480]   I just create sites that I don't have to, that somebody else does all the content.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.160]   And I sit back and collect the money.
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:33.120]   And he'll just, you know, hack something up and just for the fun of it throw it out there.
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:37.000]   And he has enough audience that people will try it and stick to the wall and sticks.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.040]   Mypermissions.org.
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.200]   Your number of the week, my friend.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.920]   Number of the week is 1.5 billion.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:45.920]   Wow.
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:53.440]   A Piper Jaffrey analyst argues that based on the deal that Google did for Firefox to
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:59.560]   stay in Firefox's search, that they then use that to calculate the value of Chrome.
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:00.560]   Wow.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:05.560]   And says that if Firefox is worth $300 million in annual revenue, because they didn't deal
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:12.120]   with Firefox with Mozilla, then since they're roughly equivalent now, that Chrome at a five
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:18.800]   times multiple would be worth, would be a $1.5 billion property, which goes back to
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:26.080]   a little bit of an earlier discussion about the sleazy ads and concern about, I think,
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:27.080]   concern.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:31.520]   This is just me bringing this up about antitrust arguments that you move from search to arguing
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:36.840]   that, you know, what got Microsoft in trouble, i.e. could Chrome get Google in trouble?
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:40.800]   So Google's going to be careful if it's a $1.5 billion property.
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.440]   So anyway.
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:46.880]   My tool of the week is Google's new elections page just in time for 2012.
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:51.160]   It's going to be an interesting one, Google.com/elections.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:54.760]   By the way, not just US, there's an Egyptian edition as well.
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:55.760]   That's the two.
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:00.360]   I don't know why, but I guess when there's elections elsewhere, they'll add more pages
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.000]   for those places.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   This is fantastic.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.520]   And Leo, do me a favor.
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.880]   Click on the Google plus link to the right.
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:07.880]   This is new.
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:13.200]   This is Google putting up a news identity for a story that you're trying to solve.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.160]   So this is, this is where I just saw Jingros.
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:16.160]   And I said, is this new?
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.280]   Is this as big as I think it is?
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:22.920]   Because I think this is them starting to create identities around topics and stories.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:27.520]   So presumably they're hiring editorial staff because this is all under one moniker, Google
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:28.520]   politics.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:29.520]   No, I don't know if they're doing that.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:35.160]   I think what they're doing is adding content and discussion and graphics and data together
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.680]   for some topics.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.120]   And you can now follow those topics.
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:39.120]   But somebody's doing this, right?
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.120]   I mean, who's doing this?
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.120]   No.
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.120]   You think it's algorithmic?
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:43.120]   I think that is.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.480]   I think the page you showed before had to be designed.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:48.400]   But I think this page is fed, I'm sure, automatically.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:49.560]   Oh, interesting.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:50.560]   Hmm.
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:56.360]   And so what becomes interesting is that Google becomes, in my reach here, you want to follow
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.000]   a story, right?
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.800]   Think about following this instead of following a news article or Wikipedia.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:03.800]   Right.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:08.360]   Well, Wikipedia turned out to, you know, kind of spontaneously be a great place to follow
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.360]   current events.
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:11.440]   So they're going to capitalize on that.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.760]   So creating a new circle.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:16.040]   I'm creating a new circle called stories.
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.520]   And this is the first one.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:18.520]   Yep.
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:19.520]   Yep.
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:25.000]   Well, I wonder is, will they release this as an API so that, you know, journalists become
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.520]   alone and create these things too and made the best ones win?
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.520]   Hmm.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.000]   I'd love to see that.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.600]   I mean, it seems like it's just a page, right?
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:35.600]   Or business.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:37.600]   But how is it created?
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.600]   Is it?
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.440]   So Jeff's assertion is it's automatic.
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:42.600]   It's automatically feeding, right?
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.400]   So we have to accept an RSS feed.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:45.400]   Not curated.
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.400]   Not actually edited.
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:53.240]   Well, they, I mean, they haven't, you know, the API is read only and has been for quite
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:56.760]   some time because they don't, they don't want people just sort of doing this auto tweeting
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:00.440]   or auto, auto Facebook, you know, sending automatically sending their, you know, what
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.840]   this somebody moderate and there's this is curated.
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:03.840]   Look at this.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:04.840]   There's text.
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:07.640]   Here's your viral, viral, Iowa video of the day.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.040]   And then there's a video of it.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:10.040]   Now this is curated.
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.040]   Okay.
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.040]   Somebody's right.
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.640]   Well, then that's an issue to them.
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:14.640]   And that's new too.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.000]   If Google is hiring editors.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   Wow.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000]   Wow.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.280]   Yeah, that would be big news.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:27.920]   If they're hang out live in Iowa, they're doing hangouts.
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:29.640]   Oh, I didn't, I didn't look at it long enough.
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.040]   I will politics and elections hung out.
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:34.560]   So I want to go to the hangout and see who's there.
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:35.560]   Yeah.
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.800]   They're doing it with Good Morning America.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:38.800]   They did a hangout.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.800]   That's interesting.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:40.800]   Hey.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.440]   And today's search done.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.440]   This is editorial.
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.440]   Wow.
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:45.440]   This is editorial.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:49.440]   It doesn't have a byline, but it is.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.560]   Welcome to the Google politics and elections page, the source for news and notes from our
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.160]   politics and elections team.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.160]   There you go.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.880]   From the about page.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:03.000]   They have editorial impartial data and digital trends surrounding the political process.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   That's a newspaper.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   How is that different in any way than it's that news?
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.320]   Well, I missed that story.
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:11.120]   I looked at the second and then ran out to the halls.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:13.640]   Richard was going for his flight and asked him, is this new?
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:14.640]   Yeah, it's very new.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:15.640]   A big deal.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.040]   He said, yeah, then I didn't, I didn't think well enough to ask the question.
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:19.040]   You're right, Leo.
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.840]   It says we are nonpartisan and don't support endorse any political.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.840]   This is news.
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:25.720]   And boy, that's a channel conflict.
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:31.200]   And I think it gets great search results.
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.920]   Search for elections.
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:34.400]   YouTube.com/politics.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.400]   Same thing.
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.400]   YouTube politics channel.
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:37.400]   Wow.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.000]   Well, see, this is a mistake.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.200]   This is why I said they should divest YouTube.
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:44.760]   They really should not be doing this kind of stuff because it really muddies the waters.
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:47.120]   You call it channel conflict.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:50.520]   It's just confusing.
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:53.280]   We do this show every Wednesday at 1 p.m.
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.640]   Pacific 4 p.m. Eastern.
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:23:00.320]   That would be 2000, no 2100 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:02.480]   Next week we're doing it at a different time because of CES.
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:06.760]   We're going to do it on Monday at 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.440]   That's 1800 UTC.
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:10.440]   So tune in for the live show.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:14.840]   But you know, you don't have to watch live because you can always download it from twit.tv
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.800]   or iTunes or anywhere podcasts are.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:21.520]   There's audio and video available almost immediately after the show ends on Wednesday.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:24.480]   Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com.
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:26.520]   His book is public parts.
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:27.520]   Must read.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:32.520]   Those of you who live or are curious what it's like to live in public.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:37.480]   He also is a professor of journalism at CUNY.
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.360]   See you next week.
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.560]   See you next week, Leo.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:45.040]   Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org and is, no, I guess I can't say where you're going
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:51.520]   to be next week, but she won't be with us.
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.600]   We know she'll be avoiding bed bugs somewhere.
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:58.120]   I want everyone to know that the only thing that would make me miss Twig is a meeting
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:59.120]   at the White House.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.120]   I will be at the White House next week.
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:01.120]   Oh, you can say that.
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.120]   Oh, good.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:03.120]   Yeah, I can say that.
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.120]   That is the coolest, coolest, coolest, coolest thing.
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.680]   Gina, I got to ask you.
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:06.680]   Yes.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:07.680]   Wardrobe choices.
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.680]   What do you think?
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:14.400]   I'm breaking out my one suit that I wear at meetings in DC.
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:17.480]   I literally have my meeting in DC suit.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:20.120]   I may have to get another one if this keeps happening.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.120]   Wow.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.120]   Totally.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.120]   And we dressed up.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.120]   I'm so excited.
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:25.120]   I'm so excited.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.560]   I'm so excited to be at the White House.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.560]   I'm going to be at the White House.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:30.560]   I'm working on something that I'll be able to talk about soon.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.560]   Okay.
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:32.840]   We're very thrilled for you.
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:33.840]   That's exciting.
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:34.840]   It is.
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.680]   I'm very excited.
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.680]   So follow her on smarterware.org.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.400]   She'll probably write about it sooner than we get her back on Twig.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.760]   We'll miss you next week, but we'll see you in a couple of links.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.440]   Yeah, and have a great time at CES.
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:46.440]   Thank you.
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:47.440]   Take care.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.800]   Let's see a good Google tablet.
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:49.800]   Maybe you might.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:50.800]   They might surprise you.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.440]   Remember Eric Schmidt said we're doing a tablet.
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:53.440]   He said that.
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.280]   Can I play you guys out with a Google commercial?
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:58.560]   You can, but before we do, we just say thank you for being here.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.920]   We'll see you next week on this week in Google T&T's coming up next right after your T&T triangulation.
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:05.920]   Our guest will be a Neil Dash.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:06.920]   The great Neil Dash.
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.960]   Oh, that'll be fun.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:12.520]   The proto blogger Neil Dash.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:16.880]   But we leave you now with this commercial for what?
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:19.160]   Well, you guys were talking about what?
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:20.160]   The French commercial.
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.160]   The French commercial.
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:22.840]   The Muppets.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.640]   There's a Muppet commercial for Google.
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.080]   And Google Hangouts.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.080]   Watch.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:30.660]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:33.240]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:35.240]   (laughs)
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.820]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:40.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:45.560]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:48.140]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:50.720]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:53.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:55.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:58.460]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:01.040]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.140]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:05.740]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:08.320]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:13.480]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:16.060]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:18.640]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:21.220]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:23.960]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.460]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:27.420]   - I don't think any normal person
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:29.020]   seeing that commercial would have a clue
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:30.260]   what that was all about.
[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:31.420]   - It was so fun though.
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:32.500]   - It's great, I love it,
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:33.500]   especially if you love Muppets,
[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.340]   which I don't, but if you love Muppets,
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:36.180]   you would love that.
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:37.660]   What, they're puppets, I'm sorry.
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.660]   - Googlers love Muppets,
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:39.500]   that's the other story that's done.
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:40.420]   - Why do you like Muppets?
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:42.100]   - Googlers love Muppets,
[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:43.900]   and it fits that generation
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:46.220]   that's apparently the site
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:48.140]   that they don't ever wanna grow up.
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:51.100]   But I gotta say,
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:52.660]   a normal person seeing that ad
[01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:55.900]   is not going to know what the hell to do with it.
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:57.900]   Oh, I like the Muppets.
[01:26:57.900 --> 01:26:59.660]   What is it, a music video?
[01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:00.860]   - Yeah. - Where do I go?
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:02.740]   To do what, to see Muppets?
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:03.900]   - I have to sing on this thing.
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:04.740]   Do I have to sing?
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:05.580]   - Is it YouTube?
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:06.420]   Is it a YouTube ad?
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:07.260]   What is that?
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:09.340]   I searched on Google for Muppets.
[01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:11.420]   There's no clue as to what that is
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:13.140]   or how to use it or anything.
[01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:13.980]   - It's the party for you.
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:15.500]   - By the way, if you wanna book into it,
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:17.900]   last night on John Stewart,
[01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:21.300]   he had Elmo redone as Gitmo
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:22.540]   with a black beard.
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:25.860]   - I don't understand, I don't understand.
[01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:28.660]   It's just, people don't grow up.
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.860]   It's the Peter Panification of media.
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:32.220]   - Yes.
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:33.060]   - Are you guys doing the deal?
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:34.540]   - Oh, for translation. - For translation today?
[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:35.380]   - Yes.
[01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:36.220]   - Oh, what time?
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:37.340]   - I know he's a good friend of yours.
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.860]   In fact, he works at Expert Labs, right?
