[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.480]   It's time for Twig, this week in Google.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.760]   We're going to-- we got a big show.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.600]   We got a really big show for you today.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.800]   Gina Trapani is on vacation.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.920]   She's in London, lucky girl.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.320]   But Jeff Jarvis is with us from the Buzz Machine, BuzzMachine.com,
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.920]   and the author of What Would Google Do?

[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.680]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.720]   Jeff, great to have you.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.600]   Also here today, Mr. Matt Cutts from Google itself,
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.480]   from the mothership.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.040]   Matt is in charge of killing spam on web pages.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.000]   He's the guy you can thank.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.840]   God's work.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.560]   Yeah, yes, it is God's work.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.800]   You can thank him for all those link farms disappearing.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.120]   That was-- it was a couple of years ago
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.320]   that link farms who were just eating up Google's search
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.920]   results are, can we thank you for fixing that?
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.440]   Well, the team, they do all the hard work.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.800]   I just sort of find the parade and stand in front.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.880]   But yeah, they've done amazing work
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.000]   on reducing the amount of web stream.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.280]   Well, I mean, you would do a Google search,
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.800]   and half the pages would be just link farms.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.300]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.280]   Well, and if it happened for a medical query,
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.640]   then you really start to feel bad.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.200]   So it's nice that it's a little cleaner now.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.640]   Yes.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.000]   No, it's a lot cleaner.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.800]   It's like night and it's like night and day.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.440]   So let me ask you real quickly before we
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.680]   get to the main topic, which of course is Chrome OS.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.240]   Google made its announcement this week.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.400]   Is everybody at Google now using a Droid?
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.480]   Not everybody, because last year for the holiday season,
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.600]   they gave away a lot of G1.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.720]   So there's a lot of people who still have a G1.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.680]   I had an iPhone, and I'm thinking, after the holidays,
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.200]   I'm going to reassess and ask, do I
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.120]   want to go for an Android?
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.360]   And if so, which one?
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.000]   I am-- my sister got an Eris, and she says she really likes
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.260]   the Eris.
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.820]   That's the less expensive one, running 1.6 instead of 2.0.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.660]   But it doesn't have the keyboard.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.900]   So it's lighter, and she likes it a lot.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.180]   It's very elegant.
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.520]   And this drives me crazy.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.100]   HURRY has seven home screens.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.380]   I only have three, because I have a Google experience phone.
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.380]   Can you please tell them I want more pages?
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.880]   Please.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.540]   I'll pass the feedback on it.
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.220]   I'm sure they've heard it once or twice.
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.020]   But you like the Droid?
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.960]   On balance, fantastic.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.360]   It's absolutely--
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.780]   everybody's as good as the iPhone.
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.020]   And I'm very bullish on the application front.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.780]   In fact, that's one of the stories today.
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.940]   Is a couple of very big iPhone developers have said,
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.980]   we're leaving the iPhone platform,
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.840]   because we don't like the way Apple controls--
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.740]   how tightly Apple controls it.
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.660]   And the presumption is they're moving towards Android.
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.900]   I think you'll see a lot of exciting stuff happening
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.460]   in the Android application space very, very soon.
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.100]   I also got the dock.
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.780]   Have you played with it?
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.060]   Oh, the dock is really-- you've got to get the dock.
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.500]   You know why?
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.140]   Because it turns it into this executive desk appliance.
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.500]   It has the time.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.940]   It's like a fancy--
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.700]   it's kind of like chubby without the padding.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.980]   It is basically-- it's a chubby.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.980]   Yeah, because you've got weather.
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.740]   I could play music.
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.180]   I could do a slideshow.
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.460]   It is.
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.860]   It's kind of like a chubby.
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.220]   Boy, I never thought of it that way.
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.460]   You really took all the fun out of it, Jeff.
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.380]   I think I've made it more cuddly.
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.340]   Yeah, well, it's not exactly cuddly.
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.420]   But the slideshow is much better than the chubby screen.
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.220]   So now I'm really, really happy with the droid.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.380]   I think it's a spectacular--
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.380]   What's the-- what's the--
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.300]   Yeah, unusable.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.180]   That's why the aress might be really a good choice.
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.540]   If you have fat fingers like I do, the aress--
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.780]   I end up using the on-screen keyboard all the time.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.020]   And so why have the extra weight and complexity
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.220]   of a slide-out keyboard if you don't really need it?
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.140]   But nice job, yeah.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.660]   It's really good.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.860]   I think you'll like it, Matt.
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.020]   Here I am selling Matt on a Google phone.
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.220]   I've played with it a little bit.
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.420]   It looks really nice.
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.300]   So a few colleagues have it and we sort of borrow it and, you know,
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.060]   ogle it and play with it a little bit
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.460]   and talk about the screen quality.
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.060]   Screen is because--
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.140]   It blows you away, yeah.
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.620]   It's really-- the resolution is really high.
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.540]   It's fantastic.
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.980]   And very, very, very legible.
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.780]   Yeah, really love it.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.820]   Really, really happy with it.
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.780]   I think that-- you know, I just like seeing competition.
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.580]   And I'm a little bit with these guys who are saying, you know,
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.820]   Apple needs somebody to say, you know, ease up a little bit,
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.020]   you know, and one of them was the guy who did the Facebook
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.300]   application for the iPhone.
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.180]   He also did a very similar Facebook application on Android
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.220]   and he said, hm, this is it.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.420]   He works at Facebook, of course.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.420]   And the other, which surprised me a little bit, is Rogamiba,
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.620]   which is-- which-- I mean, this guy is a premier Apple developer.
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.100]   And if he's saying, I don't want to develop for the iPhone anymore,
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.980]   I think that that's fairly significant.
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.260]   Well, not to get ahead of ourselves,
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.540]   but that-- I've been trying to figure out,
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.340]   since I watched the Chrome OS video,
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.660]   that if Chrome OS apps really are just any web app,
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.940]   that truly is open.
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.300]   And that becomes the model conflict between Chrome OS
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.460]   and the Apple world.
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.860]   Right.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.860]   You know, what they said on the Chrome OS video
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.260]   was the challenge is curation.
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.500]   It's trying to find the best apps among hundreds of millions,
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.980]   as opposed to iPhone.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.500]   There is a limited set because Apple limits the set.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.860]   Right.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.180]   Well, we might as well just get to the story of the moment,
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.540]   because really, that is the biggest story of all.
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.780]   And Jeff, you watched the hour-- what is it?
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.580]   Exactly the same length as the latest video.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.220]   The same as Wave.
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.140]   I said in Twitter today that it gets the standard length for a Google sitcom.
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.100]   One hour and 20 minutes.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.900]   All about Chrome, was it the-- was the video the announcement?
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.780]   Or was it-- it was just a how-to video after the announcement?
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.620]   No, it was the announcement.
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.500]   They showed the three-minute what it is video.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.180]   The product manager yelled at Michael Larianton
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.020]   and told him he couldn't ask questions from where he was
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.020]   and had to go stand in line.
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.940]   You're kidding.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.900]   There was no cheering.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.220]   You're kidding.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.580]   No, so there was no-- in fact, versus Wave,
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.420]   where there were these wonderful geek moments of people.
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.940]   Yay!
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.420]   Right.
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.660]   The quality of every feature.
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.940]   I think it happened only once here.
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.980]   But it was really informational as to where they're headed.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.660]   And there isn't a product today.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.780]   It's just open sourced.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.860]   Right.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.580]   So yeah, well, let's cover the headlines of this announcement.
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.260]   That was number one, which is you can build it today.
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.420]   But we're not going to offer it till roughly September of next year.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:58.180]   The big shock to me was that they're going to prescribe the hardware.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:58.940]   The hardware set.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.420]   Yes.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.900]   You have to have, for instance, an SSD drive.
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.400]   And it sounds like it's going to be just netbooks, which also
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.700]   surprised me a little bit.
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.340]   Well, and I think what's kind of interesting is with Chrome,
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.020]   you can look at what they've done with Chrome.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.540]   They have Chrome, which is the Google experience.
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.460]   And then they have Chromium, which is the open source version.
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.100]   So if it's Chrome, it has all the official Google
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.020]   sanctions stuff.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.900]   But anybody can take the source code of Chromium, the open source
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.500]   version and hack it up, do whatever they want,
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.900]   change how it works.
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.900]   So the impression that I get is they're going to do the exact same
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.540]   thing where they'll have Chrome OS, which is the official Google
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:37.980]   version.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.700]   And then they'll have Chromium OS.
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.700]   And that's the open source version.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.140]   And you can download that, build it.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.140]   And if you wanted to slap it onto a desktop or try to do
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.380]   something really weird with it, you could still do that.
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.660]   But it just wouldn't be certified.
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.220]   Exactly.
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.140]   It's almost-- and the same sort of thing with Android.
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.500]   It's like if you want the Google experience, then you have
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.620]   the official Google Apps.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.420]   But Android itself is open source.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.580]   You can build it.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.300]   You can try throwing it onto any device.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.140]   You can get it to install on.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.580]   Well, and this--
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.180]   forgive me, but it sounds like a very clever ploy because
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.340]   there are two issues when you offer a new operating system.
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.180]   The barrier to entry for a new operating system is devices,
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.420]   hardware support, and applications.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.380]   Google kind of has the applications problem handled
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.900]   because there are no applications.
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.060]   You just use your browser.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.380]   That's the application.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.780]   But the bigger issue is hardware support.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:33.340]   And by saying, well, we're going to support a very limited
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.660]   set of hardware.
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.380]   And those are the drivers I presume Google will provide or
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.140]   at least work with the manufacturers to provide.
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.180]   And if you want to run it on anything else, well, do the
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.420]   open source development.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.780]   So they kind of have the best of both worlds.
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.180]   I think it's fairly clever on Google's part.
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:49.540]   Yeah.
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.300]   And I think that will work pretty well.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:56.580]   So in fact, I'm skyping on a net book that I ordered
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.940]   Wednesday night after-- this week after I heard the
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.700]   announcement.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.540]   So there's a page that says which netbooks have been
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.620]   tested and worked with it.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.700]   So I ordered one from Amazon, got Saturday delivery.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.260]   So I'm skyping on XP.
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.340]   But I've built a version that is a USB drive.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.460]   So I can boot this net book and I can be running Chrome OS.
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.420]   Oh, how interesting.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.100]   So you're already doing that.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.540]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.860]   And it works really well.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.220]   And so once I had the USB drive, I said, well, let's
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.780]   throw it into my think pad, which is over to my left here.
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.660]   And that boots up as well.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.620]   So Linux--
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.140]   You're trying to print out anything yet?
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.260]   I haven't tried to print anything.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.140]   They said they'll have more to announce about printing.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.420]   But there's nothing in the dialogs about printing yet.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.540]   But what's really neat is--
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.020]   I just use the hard work.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.020]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.220]   Officially, the think pad is not supported at all.
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.820]   But I was able to get it to boot.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.540]   The mouse work, the keyboard worked.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.300]   The display was full resolution.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.780]   So I have a 1,400 by 1050 screen.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.420]   And that showed up just fine.
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.700]   The wireless didn't work.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.820]   But other than that, pretty much everything worked.
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.540]   Which is very much like any hardware that you put Linux on.
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.700]   Those are the little tricky things.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.460]   You've got the fiddly bits.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.980]   Well, oh, this is great.
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.140]   Because I thought we were going to have to wait till next week.
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.660]   Because I know that Gina isn't running it right now.
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:18.100]   So first of all, what net book did you purchase, Matt?
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.100]   If you find there's a web page and we can tweet it later,
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.980]   which is the developer hardware that they've tried it on,
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.580]   I'm running an Asus 1008 HA.
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.420]   That's a sweet.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.220]   That's the C-show.
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.620]   I love that net book.
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.140]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:33.140]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.500]   You just ordered it off Amazon.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.460]   I ordered it at the night that the announcement happened.
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.940]   And I got it this morning.
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.060]   And it is really sweet.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.060]   So it ran out of the box in every case, every bit of hardware.
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.540]   Everything runs.
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.100]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.220]   Now, of course, there's still rough edges.
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.180]   Like, they're shooting for this to be released with hardware.
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.060]   For example, on the webcast, they mentioned full width
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:00.940]   keyboards, which the EPC doesn't have a full width keyboard.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.980]   But so there's still a few rough edges, alternating full screen
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.860]   versus not full screen and stuff like that.
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.100]   But you could have a six-hour battery life.
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.500]   And if you're on a plane with Wi-Fi,
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.180]   you could surf with your Chrome OS or Chromium OS
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.500]   for the entire plane trip.
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.300]   So I might try that over Thanksgiving.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:19.780]   Wow.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.340]   With the-- I usually specialize in having
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.780]   iterate questions for Geno soldiers for you today.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.340]   Thank God somebody's willing to ask them.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.180]   With the far more efficient late stack,
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:37.700]   does that have an impact on battery power as well, you think?
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.300]   That is a great question.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.180]   I don't know.
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.540]   I'll have to run some tests because I was planning on just
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.220]   wiping Windows XP off of this machine
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.420]   after I got done with this podcast.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.660]   But maybe I'll run and see how long the battery lasts
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.260]   and then see how long the battery lasts.
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.700]   Do some tests for us.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:55.700]   Yeah.
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.820]   What I have noticed is the boot time is phenomenal.
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.860]   Even now, it's really, really quick.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.180]   They're touting seven seconds.
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.020]   You're not running off an SSD, though, are you?
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.260]   Or you are.
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.380]   Well, it has a hard drive.
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.700]   But I think it also-- I'm booted
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.980]   and off a USB thumb drive.
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.300]   Oh, OK.
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:12.900]   So you are, yeah.
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.060]   It's flashing that sense.
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:14.580]   Right.
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.100]   They kept saying on the video that the goal is that it should
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.700]   turn on like a TV.
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.380]   Absolutely.
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.540]   Microsoft's been saying that for 12 years.
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.580]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.500]   I mean, it's easier said than done.
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.620]   Seven seconds would be nice.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.340]   But I mean, one way you get that is by requiring an SSD.
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:35.580]   I mean, that's kind of a way to kind of fudge it.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.540]   I mean, my Mac boot's very, very fast off an SSD.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.780]   It makes a big difference.
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.780]   And I think the difference is--
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.700]   it's almost like with Chrome where speed matters.
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.700]   And Chrome has done very well as a browser.
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.700]   It's something like 4 and 1/2%, according to some
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.740]   of the metrics at this point, after a little less than a year.
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:03.060]   But the big win is now all the browsers-- Firefox, Safari,
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.940]   even internet Explorer 9--
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.460]   they're starting to talk about speed.
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:11.460]   So by changing the conversation to be how fast do computers boot
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.940]   and really pay an attention to that, or how standards
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.620]   compliant, or how fast is your browser,
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.380]   that just makes the web better for everybody.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.140]   And that's really where the win is, I think.
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.300]   So this all makes sense in the announcements of two weeks
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:28.700]   ago about what's the speedy, the HTML add-on,
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.860]   and Go is the programming language.
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.380]   All of it's about speed.
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.460]   Everything's about speed.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.860]   A large fraction of what we think about at Google is just speed.
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.540]   And I didn't even realize that your HTTP connection might
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.060]   only be able to load two things at once, two images at once,
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:47.820]   on one stream.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.580]   So there's so much optimization that could easily be done.
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.300]   I talked to someone who had looked at some of the tools
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.660]   that Google makes available for free to speed up their website.
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:01.420]   And they sped up their website by 70% without making
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.900]   any major changes, just sort of tweaking a few things.
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.260]   So there's a lot of opportunity to make the web better
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.700]   and make a better experience for everybody, which will just
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.420]   be a lot more fun.
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.020]   Part of the assumption going back when I was starting
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.740]   to put up websites, oh, my children back in '94,
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.660]   we learned immediately.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.860]   But those in the slow days that if you had a slow site,
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.100]   you lost traffic, you speed it up to get more traffic.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.740]   But that was also when we had the slow web.
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.380]   As we all get on broadband, I think
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:33.180]   some web producers and content people thought, OK,
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.900]   that speed's not an issue anymore,
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.980]   because everybody's fast.
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.220]   So I can put up all kinds of fancy crap and not worry about that.
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.340]   And that's just according to Google, that's just not the case.
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:48.580]   You see pages with 100,000 bite images and more all the time
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.780]   now.
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.940]   It's as if they forgot what we went through.
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.300]   When we talked last week about Google
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:59.340]   might down rank those slow pages and give them worse results.
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.380]   Which put you in a terrible panic.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.860]   Oh, my God.
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.740]   It's Leo Reuter's server.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:06.660]   It's server-fully.
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.820]   That's the thing.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.620]   You can pay lip service to speed.
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.700]   Well, I guess Google's attacking it on many different fronts.
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.700]   And I hope others will follow suit.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.620]   But it's a difficult problem, because slowdowns
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.500]   happen all over the place, including network latency itself,
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.780]   which it's not really your fault.
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.940]   Well, and we've noticed speed matters in a lot of ways,
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.540]   because when we moved from--
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.620]   we used to update our index every 30 days.
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.060]   And whenever we'd put out a new index,
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.780]   people would search more.
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.820]   So it's not just how fast your website is.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.460]   It's how fresh your information is.
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.660]   Wow, that is interesting.
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.820]   How often do you index an hour?
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.380]   Is that a state secret?
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.300]   Oh, it's continuous.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.380]   So we're always indexing.
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.660]   If you do a blog post and we don't catch it
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.740]   within a few minutes or a few hours,
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.980]   if it's a significant blog post, that
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.340]   would be a failure in our book.
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.660]   Yeah.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.060]   And you're achieving that.
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.820]   Most every case I can see.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.020]   I mean, you're keeping track of tweets for crying out loud.
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.620]   Is there any calculation for how often, though, there's
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.340]   kind of a full refresh?
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.220]   I don't know how to ask the question.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.620]   But are there methods for--
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.820]   Yeah.
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.980]   Yeah, that's a very good question.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.380]   A good way to think about it is that there is a large fraction
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:25.380]   of documents in our index that we want to refresh every few days
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:25.980]   at most.
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.940]   And that's probably the largest part of what people would see.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.340]   There are some documents that don't change quite as often
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.660]   or that don't have as much page rank.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.020]   And so it's OK if you refresh them once a month
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.100]   or they're about something like that.
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.100]   So it's running already on your seashell.
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.260]   It's running well on your seashell.
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.620]   I mean, I guess it makes sense.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.860]   I mean, you're running from an existing operating system.
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.100]   Linux, do you know what kernel version it's using?
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.500]   Is it the latest kernel version?
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.420]   Is that going to change?
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.740]   Does that change with every new build?
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.500]   Yeah, I've just poked around a little bit on chromium.org,
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.820]   which is the place to go and find more information about it.
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.300]   But it's a recent Linux kernel.
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.340]   I think it's in the 2.6 series.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.380]   I don't know whether it's the very most up-to-date,
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.540]   but it's relatively recent.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.060]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.740]   Is it customized for this?
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.380]   That is a good question.
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:20.940]   I don't know.
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:27.020]   I know that the canonical folks, the people who are behind Ubuntu,
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.220]   have done a blog post that said they're under contract
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:29.900]   to do some work.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.260]   So the one big thing from the webcast
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.540]   was that Google said we're going to be good open source
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.780]   citizens, just like we have been with Chrome.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:41.460]   So if we fix bugs or apply patches that go upstream to web
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.500]   kit or the Linux kernel or the GNU project,
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.900]   then that's really nice because it's not getting held tightly
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.420]   by Google.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.540]   The good stuff is making its way upstream.
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.860]   And so everybody benefits, not just the chromium users.
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.860]   I love this video.
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.180]   What is Chrome OS?
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.340]   Great video.
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.940]   I just think that's just fantastic.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.060]   So how hard was it to build, man?
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.340]   Well, there's a couple ways to do it.
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.660]   You can build it from the sources,
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.460]   and you'll want to be a power user to do that.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:15.300]   But I was using an internal Google tool,
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.020]   but you would certainly expect you'll
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.780]   be able to download images pretty soon.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.900]   So Gadget, Ryan Block's website, there
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.260]   were a bunch of places that were starting to talk about VMware
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.380]   images.
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.780]   That would be very simple.
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.060]   Then you just run a VMware, and you just open it up,
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.620]   and you're done.
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.060]   Yeah, the only thing you miss is the sense of speed,
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:39.020]   because if you're still running it virtualized.
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.940]   Well, I'm going to get a C-shell and do it,
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.380]   because it seems great.
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.420]   So you used a tool that put it on the USB key
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.180]   and made it bootable and all of that,
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.660]   or is that all that available on the Chromium site?
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.180]   There are some tools on the Chromium site.
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.580]   So my guess is within a week or so--
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.540]   Some of these people.
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.820]   We're just posting very easy 1, 2, 3-step guides.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.300]   Right now, it's like 15 or 16 steps,
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.580]   but it won't be long before people are just like--
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.260]   Yeah, they'll tell you, go eBay, sell the thumb drives
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.060]   with Chrome L'Oreal.
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.060]   I'm already done.
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:08.900]   I'll buy it.
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.940]   I'm going to get a nice little business aside.
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:11.740]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.020]   Well, what's amazing--
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.140]   The canonical Ubuntu took off, because they would just
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.180]   give you free CDs.
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.460]   That was the key.
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:18.740]   Yep.
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.860]   So why not let you have free USB drives?
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.620]   That's the new model, less than free.
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.300]   We're going to talk about that post, by the way,
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.420]   and just a bit from Tim O'Reilly.
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.740]   I think a thoughtful post, but he didn't take the next step.
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:35.020]   And I want to talk about the next step on that as well.
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.060]   But we got so much to say about Chrome OS.
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.140]   I want to make sure that we get everybody's questions,
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.500]   answer, and so forth.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:49.100]   By the way, Echuhu installed the GDGT image, the VM where
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.900]   image says it launched in five seconds.
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.540]   So they may be getting good results.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.100]   That was on a 3 gigahertz iMac.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:56.700]   That's pretty good.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.060]   That's pretty impressive.
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.460]   One thing that struck me about it
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.900]   is that I'm curious about two things.
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.020]   What will Apple do about this?
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.100]   What will Microsoft do about this?
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:05.820]   I asked that.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:06.860]   What would question a lot?
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.580]   I don't know why.
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.180]   And in the case of Apple, I think
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:17.940]   we're about to overload tabs as a metaphor for our worlds.
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.340]   I'm sure you're the same.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.060]   I end up with 30, 40 tabs open, and there's
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.100]   no easy way to manage it, and there's no easy way
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:24.980]   to deal with it.
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.100]   And it drives me nutty, and there's
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.980]   no tool set to really do anything.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.300]   One thing about Chrome that's nice
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:33.380]   is you have the pinable tabs for web applications.
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.780]   So your Gmail is always there, and so on, which is great.
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:39.380]   But your entire world is tabs or separate instances
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.340]   and windows of Chrome OS.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.420]   And I just think if Apple were doing this,
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.540]   they'd come up with the new version of desktop,
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.580]   the new version of some metaphor that
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.260]   makes this world more easily organized.
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.900]   And I don't think tabs is it.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.220]   Yeah, and one thing that you found in the webcast
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.940]   is they were very clear, I think,
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.620]   Sundo or Prachai said, this is how it looks today.
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.420]   When it launches in a year, it's very likely that the UI
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:06.940]   will change.
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.300]   So they showed a bunch of ideas like panels
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.380]   and an almost overview, expose, sort of thing,
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.540]   where you could see a bunch of different windows and tabs
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:14.860]   open.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.980]   But they also, I think, put up a video of UI concepts.
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.260]   So they're very open about the fact
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.500]   that they haven't claimed to figure out
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.940]   the information overload problem completely.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.740]   And they might change the UI quite a bit to sort of say,
[00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:28.780]   OK, let's try it this way.
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.260]   Let's try it that way.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.100]   How much security?
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.100]   How much attention are they paying to security?
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.140]   So much.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.180]   Good.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.300]   Good.
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.500]   Yeah, so the watch words that they mentioned in the webcast
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.140]   were threefold speed, simplicity, and security.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.340]   So speed, booting in seven seconds,
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.540]   they showed that in the webcast.
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.220]   And that was on a live machine.
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.140]   Simplicity is given by the fact that it's basically just
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.500]   a web browser.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.380]   If you know how to use a web browser,
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.900]   you're not going to be too confused with Chrome OS.
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.540]   So installing, there's no updating,
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.140]   there's no not, and you just click into there it is.
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.940]   Everything's going.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.980]   You've got tabs, you just surf.
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.500]   Everything's a web app.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.220]   Nothing at all.
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.540]   You have to worry about as far as updates
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.060]   or anything like that.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.820]   And the security aspect, it turns out
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.060]   they've done a lot of work.
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.420]   And I suspect they're going to do a lot more
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.580]   to the point of locking down the BIOS
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:26.740]   and have cryptographic signing of the entire verified boot
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.100]   process to sort of say, OK, if you get malware,
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.100]   you just turn your machine off, reboot, seven seconds later,
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.260]   you're clean again.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.540]   And if at any point it tries to be persistent,
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.300]   you're checking each chain as you're booting.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.980]   And if you reach something that's bad,
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.140]   you can restore it from, I guess, either the net
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.420]   or from another part of the internet.
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:46.900]   Yeah.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.500]   Yeah, so there's a couple different modes
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.420]   where they can restore it.
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.060]   But what sounds really nice is this
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.220]   will be a machine where all the patches are applied.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.540]   It's all applied for you.
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.500]   You always have the latest version of Chrome to run things.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.380]   But you never have to worry about viruses.
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.780]   Now, they were very clear.
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:03.340]   They said, never say never.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.700]   You can never completely stop a computer
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.980]   from being the sort of thing that's insecure
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.300]   or able to be broken.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.820]   But from what I can see, they're putting a lot of work
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:16.100]   into trying to verify things all the way down to the metal
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.700]   so that there's not an easy place for people to sneak in.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.180]   Well, if you're going to build an operating system from scratch,
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.460]   that seems like something you can make--
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.220]   which should make is a goal, obviously.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.300]   Yeah.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.180]   Somebody-- I guess it was Leander Kehaney
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.780]   and his cult of Mac blocks said, they didn't mention touch.
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.140]   What about touch?
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:39.260]   And that may be the buzzword of 2010.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.260]   Yeah.
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.820]   They showed a chart that showed desktop--
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.940]   or I mean, laptop to netbook, one end of the scale.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.980]   And from the other end of the scale
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.140]   was smartphone to tablet.
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.780]   And it was almost as if they were only talking about this side,
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.340]   the netbooks on a scale.
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.380]   You think so, Matt?
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:02.540]   All I know is that the current system, the touchpad,
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:06.140]   works just like a mouse, everything, exactly how you'd expect.
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.860]   I have no idea whether they're planning
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:12.420]   any sort of multi-touch or touch screen or anything like that.
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.380]   Presumably, if the hardware supported it--
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.460]   so it looked like a standard mouse--
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.580]   it could support it.
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.020]   But as far as I know, right now, they're
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.980]   just planning a standard paradigm where
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.740]   you have a mouse with a touchpad.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.020]   The other question I had is that it
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.900]   assumes ubiquitous connectivity, which
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.900]   is the great dream, which we see more
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.980]   all the more reasonable why Google wants white spaces
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.420]   rededicated and so on and so forth.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.140]   But I've found that trying to use my Gmail on gears,
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.380]   where I'm offline, just cuts off so much functionality,
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.060]   I can't do much of anything.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:49.980]   And if everything is on the web and everything is a web app,
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.660]   I wonder about that plane flight where I don't have Wi-Fi.
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.340]   Will I be able to do anything?
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.020]   That's a great question, because I
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.140]   think there are two trends.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.380]   There's the Wi-Fi everywhere trend
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.820]   where Google is giving you free Wi-Fi in airports
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.460]   and airplanes over the holidays.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.980]   So you're getting to the number of places
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.500]   where you don't have connectivity is getting smaller.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.580]   And then HTML5 and gears and offline
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.220]   is getting more and more capable.
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.780]   And it's unclear exactly where those will meet
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.700]   and what the use case might be.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.220]   If you go to rural, Kentucky, or Tennessee,
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.020]   there might be spots where this wouldn't
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.900]   be the ideal experience.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.180]   But I think Sundar said something interesting, which
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.540]   is this might be your secondary machine.
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.500]   You might have a machine that runs Windows or Mac
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.380]   so it can do Photoshop and run executables.
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.220]   So this could be your secondary machine,
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.660]   but it might be your primary machine in terms of time.
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.420]   So if you're looking for a machine where you're going to meetings
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.740]   and you're just surfing and you're just doing some of web stuff,
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.540]   you might actually spend more time on this.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.740]   But at least for right now, yeah, you
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.540]   do need connectivity unless you've got really good caching.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.900]   I think there was a little bit of a cop out.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.260]   He was said that in part in answer
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.700]   to a question about having Photoshop or more complicated apps
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.980]   and whether those were things that don't exist as web apps.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.660]   And so yes, you'll have another machine.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.940]   If you're going to be editing movies,
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.620]   you're probably going to do it on that machine.
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.220]   I buy that.
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.660]   But if I'm going to go off on a trip for a week,
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:20.980]   I want to have the confidence that I can use this machine even
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.540]   in a cave, at least for a while.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:29.300]   Yeah, and the offline capabilities are getting quite good.
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.780]   Whether you could use it for a week, I don't know.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:35.980]   But I tried to experiment this past month
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.140]   where I went Microsoft software free for 30 days.
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.140]   I used Linux.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.140]   I didn't use any Microsoft Office.
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.740]   And that worked surprisingly well.
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.300]   The only thing I really used was my browser.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.260]   And then maybe I'd take some snapshots
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.100]   that I could upload them to the web.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.820]   So the amount of stuff that you do that's not in the browser
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.140]   is getting smaller and smaller.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.020]   The connectivity is still a key issue.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.460]   And that would be sort of an open question.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:03.940]   There's a larger question which Randall Kennedy
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.740]   raises an info world.
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:10.300]   He says, crumbs, nah, that's not going to happen.
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.620]   But I think in a couple of place points,
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.260]   you've already responded to.
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.940]   One is that he doesn't like the UI.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.620]   You've said this isn't the final UI.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.100]   He doesn't like it that it's running on Linux
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.460]   because of spotty hardware support.
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.500]   I think Google's been very clear about how they're
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.860]   going to handle that.
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.060]   But his final complaint has some merit,
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.820]   which is the world isn't going to buy in inflexible OS.
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.660]   And it's kind of related to this offline thing.
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.340]   If you're buying a laptop that's kind of locked down
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:41.940]   to do it this way, doesn't have applications on the laptop.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.740]   They're all web-based applications.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.540]   You're buying something pretty limited.
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:46.940]   No, there's no hard drive.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.020]   There's no DVD drive.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.020]   There's no there's no spindle.
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.580]   You can't install your own apps.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.020]   You can't run your own apps.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.540]   You can't have your own data on the hard drive.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:01.180]   Why would somebody do that when inexpensive small computers
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:02.460]   are out there that do all of that?
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:07.660]   Why would you settle for the lesser experience?
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.020]   Well, I can give you my personal take, which is my mom
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.300]   was visiting this week.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.260]   And she had a Vista laptop that she had bought a couple years
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.100]   ago.
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.460]   And she had the screen resolution set wrong.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.860]   So everything on the screen was jaggy.
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.260]   She had 15 different programs running--
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.700]   I showed a bottom up--
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.860]   Apple, please.
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:28.700]   We actually did.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.060]   So are you mad?
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:30.620]   No, no.
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:36.260]   We bought her a Mac laptop for Thanksgiving or for Christmas
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.860]   one year, and she hasn't used it yet.
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:38.860]   Oh, interesting.
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.380]   She's still on Windows.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.860]   We tried to get-- when the Vista came out,
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.340]   we tried to buy everybody Macs so that we wouldn't
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.140]   have to do any tech support.
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.580]   I make a deal with relatives.
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.900]   They say, you can buy anything you want,
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.300]   but if you buy Windows, don't call me.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.140]   I don't want to hear about it.
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.980]   Well, several of the family members did switch.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.580]   She was one who stayed on Windows.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.900]   And she had this suboptimal experience
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.420]   where she didn't even know how to adjust her screen
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.900]   resolution to get rid of these jaggy fonts.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.500]   And she had a lot of things running in memory she didn't need.
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.740]   So I think there definitely is an opportunity.
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.940]   A lot of people think these netbooks have to be limited.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.380]   But it seemed like in the webcast,
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.220]   they were talking about full width keyboards
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.500]   with pretty good screens and pretty fast processors.
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.380]   You know, entirely reasonable.
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:26.380]   So I think the experience, if you can get it sufficiently fast
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.980]   and smooth, might be quite nice.
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:32.220]   If you're all you're doing is surfing and web email,
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.580]   this could run for hours and hours and hours on your battery.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.660]   And you don't ever have to worry about viruses.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.220]   You don't ever have to configure or mess with settings.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:44.020]   This is really an old argument in the PC industry.
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:47.420]   This goes back to Jeff Raskin, who says the computer
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.780]   should be an appliance.
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.140]   That we've made it far too complicated for people to use.
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.300]   I would raise one other thing. It's the security thing.
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.340]   If the price is, I'm going to give up my security
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.140]   for flexibility.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.860]   I think there's a lot of people besides your mom,
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.220]   maybe even some sophisticated users who would say,
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.140]   well, I want the security.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.860]   Yeah, I have an engineer on my team
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.860]   bought or was going to buy one of these netbooks
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.780]   the day after the announcement, because he was going back home
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.900]   for Thanksgiving.
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.540]   And I don't know about you guys, but it's
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.900]   a relatively common procedure that the first day back
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.020]   for the holidays, you're cleaning off scumware
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.700]   and doing tech support.
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.700]   So if you can drop off or drop ship a computer
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.100]   and you're like, OK, just use this,
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.100]   and you can surf the web.
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.980]   And I never have to give you tech support
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.140]   or pull off the scumware.
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.780]   That might be an OK bargain.
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:34.780]   Yeah.
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.740]   Yeah, I can see that.
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.620]   Well, I think it goes to some ideas
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:43.420]   of having a partition on your machine.
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:44.980]   Jonathan Zittren is kind of talking about this,
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:49.900]   that you have the safe part and the fun part.
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:53.260]   And that you keep your world in the safe part there.
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:59.140]   But then if you want to go off and do porn, what the heck?
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.220]   And get the malware there as a result.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.140]   It sounds like this is the perfect porn machine, though.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.260]   I have to say.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.220]   Well, except somebody in the chatroom
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.020]   linked to this on all things digital at the Wall Street
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:14.260]   Journal site and wondered about, as always comes up,
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.060]   the privacy advocates come out of the woodwork wearing
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.700]   their I'm a privacy advocate t-shirt.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.060]   And but what it does, I think--
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.860]   I'm just trying to read this in two seconds here.
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.580]   But I think there is an interesting issue here in the sense
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.860]   that Google knew what you searched for and clicked on.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.260]   But now, through this, Google does
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:36.940]   have, through Chrome OS, one could say through the browser.
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.300]   But not really, but through Chrome OS,
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.740]   now starts to have a meta view of your behavior,
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.740]   which as a targeting company is a beautiful thing
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.500]   and potentially a valuable thing, a good thing to help you.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.220]   Because what can they do with that to help you
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.060]   algorithm improve your experience?
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.260]   However, they know you want to report.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.340]   You know how I'd respond to that, as I think about it more
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.180]   and more, is there's plenty of money for Google
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.220]   to make without being evil.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.180]   I absolutely agree.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.740]   And it would behoove them because--
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.340]   Money might lose.
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.140]   By being evil, exactly.
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.380]   So it would behoove them.
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.340]   And I think that they must be sensible to this,
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:14.740]   to be completely above board and knowing
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.820]   that the people are going to have this objection and say,
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:23.420]   look, we do just fine giving you the ads you want
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.340]   and giving you the information you
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.780]   out without invading your privacy.
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:27.060]   Right.
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.540]   And I think you saw this play out with Chrome
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.180]   and to a lesser extent with Android and Wave,
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:36.660]   where Google also opensource the large chunks of all that stuff.
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.940]   But with Chrome, there was the initial excitement.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.540]   And then there was a wave of privacy worries
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.620]   where Google was going to see everything you did.
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:48.140]   And going open source was a big deterrent
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.940]   for the concern because people could look at exactly when
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.060]   data went to Google.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.540]   And to this day, there are a few people who worry about it.
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.460]   But most people can dig into the source code and verify,
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.140]   no, there's no information where Google is spying on you.
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.740]   And if you're typing in a URL, then
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.420]   some small percentage of it goes to Google.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.700]   But then we've promised to get rid of it within 24 or 48 hours.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:10.860]   So I think you will see some people who say,
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.020]   well, I don't want Google to know what I'm doing.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.540]   Not even thinking, well, my ISP currently
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.300]   knows everything that I'm doing.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.540]   I'm in a more subpoenaable format.
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:20.060]   Yeah.
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:20.560]   Right.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.780]   They actually have your credit card.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.300]   Right.
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:22.800]   Right.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.300]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.460]   My favorite tweet of the week-- there's
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.980]   this wonderful blogger named Penelope Trunk, who
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:29.260]   made a lot of controversy when she tweeted her miscarriage.
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.420]   That's another story.
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.340]   And so her tweet this week was, there's a virus on my laptop.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.380]   Our tech guy will ask me how I got it.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.660]   I want to lie, but he'll figure it out.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.900]   So I'm confessing early porn.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:41.900]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.900]   Yeah.
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:43.500]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.100]   It's the perfect porn computer.
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.300]   OK, I'm just saying that.
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.100]   Not that I care about that.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.500]   Just browsers, right?
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.700]   I'm just pointing it out.
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:53.860]   It's my job.
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:58.260]   No, I want to ask you this, Matt, because I mean,
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:58.980]   you work for Google.
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.660]   So we'll recuse you on this.
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.660]   But do you get the sense, Jeff, that Google does understand--
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.940]   I mean, things like the data liberation front,
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:11.820]   tell me that Google fully understands the risks to people
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.380]   not trusting it, and is going to bend over backwards
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.900]   to make stuff open, transparent, because that's
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:18.580]   their business.
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.620]   That's the only way they can succeed.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.900]   Yeah, I'm a confessed Google fanboy.
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.980]   So I agree with that and believe that.
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.900]   But I think that Google does have a PR problem here.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.460]   When I went out and visited the campus on my book tour,
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.460]   where I saw Matt--
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:35.540]   I don't think I'm going to be a way
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.580]   a secret method that the conversation afterwards was
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.140]   kind of Google being aware of that.
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.460]   There's a PR issue.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.060]   I think I made this reference when
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:45.020]   we talked with OAM about the book deal.
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:48.540]   Google thinks of itself, I think, as Stuffelupicus.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:53.340]   And little kids look at it and see a furry monster sometimes.
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.620]   And so I think that they do what they believe
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.580]   is bending over backwards.
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.900]   But that's probably not far enough in some cases.
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:05.540]   So when you see these fears of the OS, I agree with you.
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.860]   I don't think it goes anywhere, because the cost is too great.
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.900]   But I think Google has to find a way
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:14.220]   to make promises like data liberation front so upfront.
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.380]   And find the ways that you can say to the world,
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.220]   hold us to this, as Matt just said, when you can go in
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:22.900]   and have auditors who look at the source code.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:26.100]   Same issue when I found that there were sites being
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.900]   kicked off AdSense, because there
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.420]   were thought to be Link Farms.
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:32.580]   And there was a famous case--
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.380]   I forget the name of the company-- who said, no, no, no.
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:35.820]   This is what we really do.
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.780]   And you ruined our business.
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.180]   And that's the one case.
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.820]   I argue that Google is an auction marketplace.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.700]   It's a marketplace.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.300]   It doesn't really make decisions.
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.780]   But that's the one case where Google does have God-like authority
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.820]   to just say, nope, you're off.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.020]   And maybe better off to have some kind of jury
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.460]   of peers to decide these matters.
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.180]   So I think there is a necessity for Google
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:00.860]   to deal as aggressively as possible with these questions
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.540]   before the questions come up.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:03.940]   And I think that they're good at it,
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:04.780]   but they can be better at it.
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:08.220]   Does Google have, effectively, a public editor
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:12.260]   and ombudsman, somebody who reflects public interest?
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.020]   We don't have an official ombudsman.
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.020]   No.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.700]   One thing that we do have is this culture
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.860]   where a lot of Googlers are willing to call foul
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.140]   if they see anything going wrong.
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.500]   Yeah, I know people like Chris Tobona
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.860]   wouldn't be working there if he thought there
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.340]   were anything going on.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.380]   Well, and I recently had an experience
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.220]   where I had approval from a bunch of executives
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.340]   within the company to launch--
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.660]   what I think is going to be a pretty cool feature.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.340]   And we got all the way down to the person
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.420]   who was going to flip the switch.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.740]   And they're like, OK, I need to know more information.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.900]   You need to reassure me that this is going to go the right way.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.380]   I think that's--
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.620]   Yeah, it's not enough to say, well, no, Larry and Sergey
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.500]   or Marissa or whoever are in favor of it.
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.260]   They're like, no, no, you need to convince me
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.100]   that it's all right.
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.060]   Google's been criticized for that governance by committee
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:58.340]   thing, but in a case like this, I think that's fantastic.
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.980]   That even the guy who's going to flip the switch
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.420]   gets to say, hold on here.
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.380]   I think the ombudsman is a really good idea, Leo.
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.540]   I sometimes make fun of it in the news business,
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.380]   arguing that everyone in a news organization
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.540]   should be responsible and should be an ombudsman.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:13.700]   And in a sense, I've seen people go to Matt and beg
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.740]   for things like, I don't know, wave invites on Twitter.
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.260]   Who would ever do that?
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:22.580]   And I went, no, just a really pushy, my God, that.
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.860]   And things come through, sort of, since Google does have
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.420]   its own employees being publicly in a lot of ways.
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:31.900]   But I've heard Eric Schmitt say, when the question gets asked,
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.540]   I have to give him credit, when he gets asked questions,
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.020]   he doesn't say, oh, OK, that's the 247 of the time
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:37.780]   I've heard that same question.
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:41.140]   When the 247 of the time he was asked, well, is Google too big
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.020]   and shouldn't it be regulated?
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.020]   His response is, would you rather have government run us
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.780]   or us run us?
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.060]   And he's absolutely right.
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.540]   But I think at some point, somebody's
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:54.100]   going to come along and suggest what I think
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.740]   would be the worst case, which is government regulation of Google.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:58.500]   There's no reason to.
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.100]   Google has not acted as monopolists.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.260]   It just got big by quality by doing things well.
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.220]   But it still has to get ahead of that, I think.
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:07.820]   Well, and it's really scary to think
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.860]   about Google has its philosophies, where we try to do things
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:13.940]   in an algorithmic way and return diverse and relevant search
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.300]   results.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.940]   But imagine if somebody says, well, government's
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.380]   going to know best, and we'll tell you
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.980]   how to rank the search results for vaccines or something
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:23.460]   like that.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.700]   And all of a sudden, as soon as you take one step down
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:29.300]   that path, where reasonable people can disagree
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.060]   on what the ideal search results should be for something
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.820]   medical or for vaccines or something like that,
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.660]   you start to see the difficulty where having someone there,
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.780]   second guessing, the ranking would be really, really tricky.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.460]   It's kind of a reductionist argument, though.
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:43.500]   It's not an either or.
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.060]   It's not government doing it or we do.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.700]   And I mean, there's got to--
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:50.260]   even if the public ombudsman would only be PR,
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.860]   it would be very valuable PR at least,
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.380]   and maybe you have some other value.
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.620]   But I like it that--
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:56.980]   Go ahead.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.660]   --where I write and consult.
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.380]   And they're wonderful and brilliant,
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:04.380]   and they don't pay me enough to say that, so I mean it.
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.140]   They have-- they're the only paper, national paper,
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:10.540]   in Britain that has this role, the ombudsman.
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.500]   And it is an independent position.
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.380]   New York Times does this as well, which is set up
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:19.780]   by contract, not fireable.
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.380]   It's rather like a judgeship.
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.940]   And I think it could be smart as a way
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:28.020]   to deal with those issues for someone we trust.
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.700]   I mean, who would--
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:36.060]   is Vince surf the kind of granddaddy of the internet?
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:38.580]   Who would make a great ombudsman?
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:42.420]   I think Vince is a very good suggestion.
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.660]   But there are a lot of other prickly people
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:45.580]   I can think of.
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.100]   People like him.
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:46.820]   The Borac?
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:47.820]   No.
[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:49.220]   Like Brad Templeton maybe.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.580]   I mean, who's on the chairman of the board of the EFF.
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:53.220]   There are people out there, I think, who
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.980]   would be good in this role.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:56.140]   That's a good question.
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.740]   We'll have to ponder.
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.780]   Maybe it's a panel.
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:01.300]   That's possible.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.500]   You don't want to bog it down.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.580]   I'm not--
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:07.620]   But I think it's-- for at least for appearances sake,
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.060]   it wouldn't be a bad idea.
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.100]   Hey, let's take a break.
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.660]   There's so much more to talk about.
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.860]   We're really glad to have Matt cuts with us.
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:17.740]   He is a Googler, but also in charge of killing spam
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.740]   on the web.
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.740]   You miss Gina.
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:20.540]   We're glad to have Matt.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.580]   Gina is in London enjoying herself.
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.380]   I'm seeing her tweet.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.820]   She's looking for somewhere good to eat.
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.140]   So I think she's having a good time in London.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.340]   Jeff Jarvis is here also.
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.220]   And we're going to talk more about Google in just a bit.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.940]   I do want to remind you that this show wouldn't exist
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.180]   without the help of our sponsors.
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:40.300]   People like Ford, Citrix, and Carmanite.
[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.860]   I want to tell you a little about Ford Sync.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.780]   This is the new device that is in my car.
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:48.260]   It's the hands-free Bluetooth audio solution
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.460]   that just makes my car all the better to drive,
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.580]   all the more fun to get into.
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.340]   It's a really great demo product,
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.580]   because when people come in and sit down on my car,
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.180]   I say, "Let me just show you something."
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.060]   I press a button on my steering wheel.
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.620]   I say, "Play the Beatles."
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:03.740]   And the Beatles start playing.
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:06.940]   And that is just a great feeling.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:10.140]   The idea of Ford Sync really is safety.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.260]   Keeping your eyes on the road, your hands on the wheel,
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:17.220]   and yet being able to control your audio, your phone calls,
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.740]   even get information, things like sports scores,
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:20.740]   weather forecasts.
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:24.380]   If you heard a fantasy, you can get fantasy information.
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.380]   There's a business search.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.620]   They are turn-by-turn navigation.
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:33.540]   I sent my daughter off to a debate in far, far away today.
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:37.180]   And the ability to say, "Get me to Penola High School,"
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.180]   to the car, and the car talks you through it,
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.180]   is just remarkable.
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.860]   And I worry about my kids,
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:43.580]   because they're very distractible.
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:47.260]   And having a navigation screen, to me,
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.420]   is like they're gonna watch TV.
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:49.260]   They're gonna be looking at that
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:50.300]   and say to where they're going.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.740]   Ford Sync talks you through it.
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:55.140]   There's, you know, there's a little three-line LED display,
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.780]   but you don't need that big screen.
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:57.900]   It'll tell you where you're going.
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:58.940]   It'll tell you what's going on.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:42:59.780]   You could say things like,
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.340]   "Call Jeff Jarvis at home and it'll do it."
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.660]   Well, it would if I had Jeff's number,
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:04.980]   but he still hasn't given that to me.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.820]   But that's okay.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:06.660]   Someday he will.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:07.740]   I'll earn his trust.
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.020]   No, just teasing.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:10.860]   You know, it's funny.
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.620]   We're so tied to Twitter and everything now.
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.500]   We don't know how to get ahold of people.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.860]   We just have to DM them on Twitter.
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.940]   I don't even have Matt's email address.
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:22.180]   You know, it's a different world we live in nowadays.
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.020]   But they have,
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.260]   Ford Sync has SMS capability too.
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.460]   You can, it'll read on, on equipped,
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:29.260]   properly equipped phones.
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.020]   It'll read back your messages.
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.820]   And then you can pick from pre-recorded,
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:36.540]   pre-canned messages to send back like,
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:37.420]   why?
[00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:38.260]   It's my favorite one.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.340]   I use that one a lot.
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:40.620]   I want you to take a look at Ford Sync.
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.420]   In fact, the best way to do it is to go to the website,
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.220]   syncmyridepodcast.com.
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.580]   When you're there, you'll find out how you can win
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:52.180]   one of 15 Nanos or Zunes that the folks at Ford are giving away.
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:52.980]   Tweet to win.
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:53.820]   All you have to do is say,
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:56.060]   Hey, I'm listening to this week in Google,
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:57.140]   love the show.
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:00.580]   And by the way, pound, sync myride podcast.
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:02.260]   The number sign followed by one word,
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.220]   sync myride podcast.
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:05.860]   And you're automatically entered to win.
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:08.180]   We already know that we have some listeners who have won.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.300]   I want you to be in that group.
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.780]   Now through December 9th, they're giving away.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:13.620]   15 Nanos and 15 Zunes.
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:16.020]   It's a way of underscoring that Ford Sync works
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:19.580]   not just with the iPod, all iPods, your iPhone,
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.340]   but your Zune, it even works with Droid.
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.660]   I can plug it in via the USB port.
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.420]   It'll see all the music on my Droid.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.220]   Droid in and let me play it by command.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:32.140]   Ford Sync, go to syncmyridepodcast.com to find out more.
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:34.980]   And the next time you're in the market for a new car,
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.060]   make sure you think of a Ford Lincoln or Mercury vehicle
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.820]   powered by Sync.
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:40.660]   I love it.
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:42.180]   - Leo, since you have influence with them,
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.460]   what I most want is when you have the canned message
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.500]   to go back on the phone, I want it to be in the voice
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.940]   of Kit from Night Rider.
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:48.780]   - What?
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.300]   I can't even remember what Kit sounds like.
[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.500]   It does feel like Night Rider though, you know?
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.340]   I love it.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.180]   It's really fun.
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:58.580]   I got the Droid GPS cradle too,
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.820]   'cause you know it's got the great turn-by-turn maps
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:01.660]   in Google.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:05.380]   I don't use it 'cause I have the GPS in the car,
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:07.980]   but it's so cool just to have the Droid sit there and--
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.180]   - It has the voice?
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.500]   - Yeah.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.180]   - Somebody told me, I don't know if this is apocryphal
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:15.380]   or not, but that in Italy, they could,
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.020]   most of the voices are women's voices,
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.220]   and in Italy they couldn't do that,
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.380]   'cause no one trusts women to go to the radio.
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.100]   - I'm not gonna listen to you, women driver,
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.100]   you gotta give me, it does not directions,
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.900]   I can't use those.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:26.940]   - Oh, that's terrible.
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.460]   So it's gotta be a man.
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:29.300]   - Yeah.
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.140]   - Yeah, you can turn left either, so okay.
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:36.260]   Let's talk about this whole idea of turn-by-turn
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.740]   directions built into the phone.
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.380]   This led Tim O'Reilly to write,
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:41.540]   I think a very good article,
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.260]   calling it Google's business model,
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:48.260]   not, not freemium, not free, but less than free.
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:51.220]   He says, "Google's free navigation feature
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:55.140]   "delta crushing blow to the maps companies,
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:57.540]   "navtech and telenav, and to the GPS,
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.660]   "stocks Garmin, when Google and NASA's Garmin
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:03.900]   "fell 16%, Tom, Tom fell 21%,
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:07.900]   "the point being that they're given away Android,
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.900]   "they're given away GPS, if they even says,
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:13.260]   "if Ford wanted to put Android,
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.220]   "they're using a window."
[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.540]   I think it's a Microsoft product,
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:16.820]   so I think it's Windows CE right now,
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.620]   and I'm sure they pay Microsoft for that.
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:19.820]   They could go to Google,
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.740]   not only could they get Android for free
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.500]   and the GPS for free using these maps that Google's making
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.740]   and the turn-by-turn that Google's doing,
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:29.140]   but, and here's the punchline,
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:32.580]   because Google will give you ad splits on search
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:36.780]   if you use it, they're paying you
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.100]   to use their mobile OS,
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.700]   and that's why he calls it the less than free business model.
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:43.300]   And he says it's absolutely disruptive,
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.340]   not just to the GPS companies,
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:50.060]   and to Nokia spent, what was it, $9 billion?
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:53.100]   For, was it telenav or Navtech?
[00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.500]   They bought one of the two.
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.020]   - Navtech, I think. - Navtech?
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:58.580]   $9 billion, and then Google comes along and says,
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:00.620]   "Well, we don't need you guys anymore,
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:03.140]   "we're making our own turn-by-turn."
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.020]   - By the way, the Bill Gurley wrote a poster
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.740]   for the same headline that I put up on the front.
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:08.980]   - I see it above the crowd.
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.540]   - Above the crowd, right? - Yeah.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:26.460]   - The Google Read-a-
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:27.900]   - So who gets credit?
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:29.100]   - Well, that's the same.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.980]   I gotta say that O'Reilly was nice enough.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.420]   He used my favorite PowerPoint slide that I did,
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:34.980]   do what you do best to link to the rest,
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.620]   and he gave me credit for it.
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.620]   And I got tweeted around, so I think, I think,
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.340]   he might hurt from somebody else in a private email
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.500]   with the same concerns.
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:43.700]   - Spreading fast, yeah.
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:47.300]   - And you know, from a consumer perspective, free is good.
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.820]   Sharing the bounty with us is good.
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:53.220]   The main concern is one of using market power
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:54.940]   to dump on the market.
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:55.940]   And to the world-- - Yeah, that's the question.
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.020]   Is this dumping?
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:58.340]   That's a very good point.
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:47:59.420]   - That's the question, I think.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:00.820]   - Right. - That's the ethical question
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.140]   in the end.
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:06.060]   But I think it has to be discussed in a larger context.
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:08.300]   And suppose I've been getting a headache about it,
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:11.260]   I haven't written yet, that says that it looks
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.740]   at the non-monetary economy that business week,
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:16.500]   I wrote this much up a few months ago,
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:19.660]   business week kind of column, or a cover story,
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:24.180]   on arguing that America was actually in an innovation
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:27.420]   deficit because they were measuring the impact
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:30.700]   of innovation on large old companies.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.300]   And my argument return was, well, that's not
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:37.060]   where the economy is now, A, and B, what innovation does today
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:41.020]   is reduce cost rather than adding to profit
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:44.420]   and adding to closed off barriers to entry
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.380]   so that you can extract more from the marketplace.
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.300]   You now have to give more to the marketplace.
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:53.380]   And that's just an economic reality of where we are today.
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.500]   So is that just Google doing this?
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:59.700]   Or are we in fact looking at a constant newer efficiency?
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:01.740]   I forget where I was recently.
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.140]   I was at four square conference where someone said
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:09.820]   that Google kills waste.
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:11.860]   And that's the real question too,
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:14.780]   is that is this just a matter of Google and Google's size?
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.540]   Or is this a reality of the new economy in which most
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:25.220]   innovations, Moore's law, increase value and reduce cost?
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:27.180]   Well, to me, it raises this question.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.260]   When you use the phrase dumping, this
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:31.500]   is what I was talking about when I said
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.620]   I wanted to talk a little bit about the next step
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:38.380]   that Bill doesn't go to, which is OK.
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:42.540]   So Google disrupts this and creates this new lesson
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:44.420]   free economy.
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.740]   But then what happens after that?
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.020]   You know, it's like dumping.
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.820]   The whole point of dumping is to put the other guy out
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:55.620]   of business so you can raise the costs.
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.540]   Well, but the problem becomes then
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:00.580]   that you also keep the costs down so low
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.660]   that people can't come in and compete with you.
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:06.620]   So Tom Emsling explained in my book,
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:11.860]   not that I've mentioned it twice, that in network economics,
[00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:14.700]   Craig wants to charge as little as possible,
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:17.260]   not just because he's a crazy tech hippie,
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:19.620]   but because it means no one else can enter in.
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.420]   That is the barrier to entry now.
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:23.860]   But he charges as little as possible.
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:26.540]   And he can do that because he had the technology that
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.500]   enabled him to take a $10 million market
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.860]   and make it into a reported $100 million company.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:31.980]   And he's in great shape.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:34.180]   30 employees, wonderful thing.
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:37.660]   And people look at that and say, but you destroyed value.
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:38.020]   No.
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:38.620]   In the long run.
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:42.740]   It says, I left the value in the pockets of the trans actors
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:45.100]   rather than the rest of the middlemen.
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:49.220]   And so there's a shift of key economic value here
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:51.700]   that's just happening anyway in the economy.
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.340]   Google is smart enough to see that.
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.180]   I hear the same thing happening in the news discussion
[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.140]   all the time.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:59.500]   This email I got from a famous entrepreneur this weekend
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:03.620]   was was was playtively saying, well, Google comes along in news
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.700]   and it kind of undercuts everything.
[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:10.020]   And my arc-- and it's wrong of me to say people should ask
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.500]   what would Google do and be like Google because Google is
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:14.820]   like it is just because it's so damn big.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.100]   Well, that's partly fair.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:18.140]   But I think it's partly unfair in saying that I think we can
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:20.460]   all follow these lessons and models
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:24.900]   and take advantage of these new realities.
[00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:28.700]   You know, it's funny, though, I mean, look, we're all media guys.
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:33.540]   We've worked in advertising based media our whole lives.
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:36.100]   This is just the same thing, isn't it?
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:37.060]   Yeah.
[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.820]   It's just-- it's subsidy.
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:39.140]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.180]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.260]   I mean, there's different economic models,
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:46.060]   but it's not like the ad free media supported by ads
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:48.540]   is not something new.
[00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:51.860]   The other difference, Leo, is that in media advertising,
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:54.180]   we sold advertising as scarcity.
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:56.020]   There's only so many ad spots, so many eyeballs.
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.300]   And we're going to charge what the market will bear.
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.460]   Right.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.700]   In a network model, when you want to grow as big as possible,
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:06.260]   you charge as little as you can bear to become the big player,
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:10.820]   whether that's Amazon or eBay or Skype or Google or Facebook.
[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:14.900]   You extract as little as possible to become the big guy.
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.700]   Well, that's reverse dumping.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.340]   And it's dumping also, isn't it?
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:19.100]   Exactly.
[00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:20.380]   You open a big guy that asks like,
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:23.860]   "Stuffelopica is not like Bigfoot."
[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:26.420]   But that becomes the issue that that's just
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.780]   the new network economics we have.
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:30.700]   The other thing Google did on advertising, though,
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:33.100]   was that they don't charge what the market will bear.
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:34.500]   They could have said only so many people
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.180]   search on the word "parasan" a day.
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:36.700]   Right.
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.980]   And we'll charge you what, as much as we can.
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:41.380]   Instead, it sells performance.
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:41.860]   Right.
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:45.220]   And as a result, Google is motivated
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.460]   to create more relevance.
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:48.020]   That's why ad sense exists.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.540]   It doesn't deal with scarcity.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.020]   It created abundance.
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:51.580]   Right.
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:53.500]   It also means that Google shared the risk
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.260]   with the advertiser.
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:56.380]   The advertiser in old media says,
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.260]   "I'll buy this ad on your show, but I don't know what's
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:00.340]   going to work."
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:04.060]   You know, the new way is that, dare I say it, Ford would say,
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:05.460]   "How many cars you sold for me lately?"
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:06.460]   Right.
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:07.460]   And you could prove it.
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.220]   Right.
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:10.900]   I'm too scared to do that.
[00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:11.900]   No.
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:13.060]   I don't want to get it.
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:14.420]   I said it.
[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.380]   I don't want to do that.
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:17.500]   Actually, that idea is a good idea.
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:17.940]   No.
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:20.580]   Well, the truth is, in the long run,
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:21.380]   that's what happens.
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:23.380]   Because if you don't perform, you don't get the buy.
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:27.020]   Again, you can only cheat people so long.
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.020]   Yeah, that's not true.
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.180]   It's always been a peripheral layer.
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:30.700]   It's always performance in the long run.
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:31.900]   Or it doesn't work.
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:32.900]   It doesn't work.
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:34.460]   Yeah.
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:36.540]   Well, and I think there's also a role
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:38.780]   to talk about just the key part of engineering,
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:43.780]   because machine translation, as an example,
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:46.980]   there are companies that sell that as a service,
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:49.740]   or as software that's a package, all sorts of things
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:51.260]   like that.
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:55.020]   And Google had experimented with different companies
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:55.580]   to try that.
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:59.380]   But what we ended up doing was writing our own software.
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:04.380]   So there's a real advantage to having engineers who
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:05.060]   are smart enough.
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:07.180]   And I'm not sure I'd count myself in this category.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.180]   But there are a lot of smart engineers at Google
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:12.060]   who can look at the state of the art and say, hey,
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:13.420]   how can we push past this?
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:15.580]   Or how can we find the innovative thing that's
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:19.060]   going to really turn things on its head a little bit?
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:22.700]   And at the point where you can do-- and they've submitted it
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:25.860]   for evaluation and found a few years ago that Google had
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:29.780]   the world's best machine translation by a far margin
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:31.060]   at that point.
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:34.140]   If you can build your own technology that can do things
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:37.700]   differently, or better, or cheaper than competitors,
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:40.020]   then that frees you up to do a whole bunch of innovative stuff.
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:44.020]   So for example, this week, we introduced translating as you
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:48.980]   type, so real time machine translation over at translate.google.com.
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:54.260]   And the only reason we can do that and run so many keystroke
[00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:58.660]   per-- keystroke queries is that we created the software
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:01.020]   ourselves, and that is really robust.
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.180]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:04.420]   So it's amazing that comes from the size that you have,
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:06.500]   does give you this advantage?
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.300]   I don't think that it comes from the size at all.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:12.540]   No, I think the number of people who can smartly work on
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:17.460]   machine translation and/or text to speech or speech to text
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:20.860]   is actually a relatively small group of people.
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:23.180]   You want them to be the world's best people.
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:26.300]   And so if you end up with even a single digit number of
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:31.140]   engineers, but they can do better than 30 or 40 other
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:33.060]   engineers, that's still worth it.
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:35.980]   So whenever I look at a lot of the really hard stuff that we
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:40.780]   do, similar images or trying to find content identification
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.820]   on YouTube or text to speech or translation, those are not
[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:45.980]   necessarily large groups that are doing that, and they
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:49.620]   don't necessarily get a lot of benefit from people being big.
[00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:52.860]   It's just that they really can be a whip smart engineer
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:55.060]   sometimes, and that can really pay off.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.220]   Wow, this is pretty amazing.
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:57.820]   This is what was in wave.
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:00.380]   It solves one of the pains and the butts.
[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:02.540]   I've always had with translation on Google, if you're so
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:06.220]   damn smart, why do I have to tell you what language it is?
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:08.020]   It's about what has its tech length.
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:08.700]   It does?
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:09.540]   Oh, good.
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:10.980]   Because the pulldown says--
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:11.620]   You should know.
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:12.620]   --that it says detect.
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:14.460]   It always thinks I'm talking in Spanish.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:15.860]   I don't understand.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:19.020]   So this is good coming from you, Jeff Jarvis, because you're
[00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:22.220]   the first person who's ever posted a German article into our
[00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:23.220]   feed.
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:24.420]   Do you read German?
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.020]   What's the deal with this?
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:27.780]   Yeah, an ambition.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:28.740]   No rhyme, ambition.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.940]   Yeah, I like the headline, because the headline said,
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:33.580]   " Its reaction to Chrome OS was--"
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.100]   Now we're going to figure out what it was, Leo.
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:39.860]   It's a Chrome OS, ungata set, so Vennig software, so
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:40.980]   Ville Nuhite.
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:44.780]   Yeah, so little software, so much new.
[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:45.660]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:46.660]   That's actually very good.
[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:50.100]   And what I was saying was that this was the minimalization of
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:55.020]   the OS out of software, and that's what's so big and new.
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.220]   That's actually very interesting.
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.580]   I hope I translate it correctly.
[00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:02.380]   I suspect someone in the chat room.
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:04.580]   Well, Masa is from Germany in our chat room.
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:07.580]   I'm sure he'll fix it if it's wrong.
[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:09.900]   So for chat room it says, "Zovenig software, so
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:11.580]   if you'll Nuhite."
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:12.660]   Yeah.
[00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:15.180]   Yeah, they're saying, yes, that's a correct translation.
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:16.180]   Hey!
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:16.680]   Yay.
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:17.380]   You didn't even do--
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:18.340]   You're so proud of me.
[00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:20.700]   You didn't even use Google for that.
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:24.460]   Coming up, the weirdest software bug you ever heard of.
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:27.660]   And I've got it.
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:30.140]   As we continue with this week in Google and our guests, Matt
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:33.900]   Cuts, Googler, Matt Cuts, and Jeff Jarvis.
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:36.820]   I just want to briefly mention our friends at Citrix, who
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:38.900]   make so many great remote access products.
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:41.020]   I mean, they're the kings of remote access.
[00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:46.100]   And in particular, for those of you who are in the support
[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:49.820]   industry, whether it's IT or you have software that you have
[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:54.020]   to support, GoToAssist is so incredible.
[00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:56.060]   Go to Assist Express, they call it.
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:58:00.220]   But if you go to GoToAssist.com right now,
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:02.180]   you can try it free for 30 days.
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:04.340]   If you're going home for Thanksgiving,
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:10.340]   my strong suggestion is send an email to mom, dad, Aunt
[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:13.940]   Jenny, whatever, and say, hey, click this link.
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:16.420]   And I'm going to do a little remote session
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:18.540]   and just see how bad it is before you go.
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:19.940]   Just check it out.
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:22.300]   Go to assist express.com/twig.
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.260]   I'll give you 30 days free.
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:27.060]   This is a remote access, but designed for IT support.
[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:30.300]   So for instance, it'll tell you what operating system's
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:32.300]   running, what security software is running, what's running
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:33.060]   in the background.
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:33.940]   This is nice to know.
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:36.100]   You can copy files from your computer to theirs.
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:38.420]   So if you've got malware, bytes, or a fix,
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:40.300]   you want to bring over, you can do that.
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:41.420]   Have eight sessions at once.
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:44.220]   You get the whole family while you're scanning one computer.
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:44.900]   Check the next one.
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:45.820]   And the next one after that.
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:48.420]   The next one after that.
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:50.900]   This is just a fantastic product.
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:53.900]   You can get a day pass or you can get a monthly subscription.
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:55.300]   I use the monthly subscription.
[00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:56.940]   But right now, do it for free.
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:59:04.420]   Go to gotoassist.com/twig for 30 days, absolutely free
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:09.260]   of simply the best remote access fixing software ever.
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:12.740]   If you're in the IT or support business, you must have.
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:13.580]   Go to assist.
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.540]   And we thank them so much for their support of this week
[00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:15.900]   in Google.
[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:17.940]   Now, maybe that could help fix this bug.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:18.900]   This is the weirdest bug.
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:20.900]   It's on Android.
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:26.340]   People have noticed with Android that the autofocus works
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:30.300]   sometimes, then it doesn't work, then it works again.
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:35.020]   And it turns out it's in fact a calendar-based bug.
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:37.460]   One of the weirdest bugs I've ever heard.
[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:41.060]   It's a rounding error bug in the camera driver's autofocus
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:41.780]   routine.
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:42.900]   It uses a timestamp.
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:46.300]   Now, I don't know why autofocus would use a timestamp.
[00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:51.740]   But it fails on a 24.5-day cycle.
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:54.580]   That cuts his covering his eyes.
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:57.620]   So it'll work.
[00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:01.420]   The autofocus will work for 24.5 days.
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.860]   Then it won't work so well for 24.5 days.
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:04.500]   It'll work again.
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.700]   Right now, we're in a good cycle.
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:11.060]   The 17th, four days ago, was the beginning of a works correctly
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:11.460]   cycle.
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.540]   So for those of us who've got the--
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:16.740]   and it's true, it's starting to work.
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:19.380]   Everybody share the same--
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:21.060]   it's like your cycles get in sync.
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:24.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:27.740]   We're all in the same cycle.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:32.660]   The good news is I'm sure before 24.5 days passes, 20 days
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:35.380]   now, there will be a fix for this.
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:38.260]   But I just think that's just one of those.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.540]   I had the same reaction.
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.180]   Oh, my god.
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.740]   Well, and it was funny because within Google,
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.740]   people were reading the reviews of the droid.
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.220]   And people would say really nice things about the video
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:49.580]   camera.
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.300]   They'd say it's DVD quality.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.540]   It's really great.
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:55.500]   I don't understand why the still camera doesn't look that
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.300]   good.
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.660]   And of course, everybody had to keep their mouth shut.
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:00.420]   And then November 17th rolled around.
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:04.060]   And it happened that some guy had been cleaning his screen,
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.140]   like buffing it a little bit.
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:09.580]   And so this myth was going around that, oh, you know,
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:11.740]   all you have to do is buff your screen.
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:13.860]   And suddenly it looks really good.
[01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:15.820]   It's just the dirty screen.
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:16.940]   I thought that's what I was.
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.100]   I'm going like this.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.380]   Anyway, that's a funny bug.
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:28.620]   But I feel for the guy who ever has to get the--
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:31.340]   I imagine it's no fun at the Google cafeteria for that guy
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.420]   walking around.
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:34.620]   He's out of focus.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:36.180]   Anyway, nothing more to say about that.
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.260]   I'm glad they're going to fix that.
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:39.620]   Somebody told me-- and I don't--
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:40.620]   Matt, maybe you can--
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.660]   this isn't Europe department.
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:44.820]   Maybe you know better, though.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:48.020]   This Google experience phone, the reason the ARIS was with 1.6
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:50.980]   is because if you ship with 1.6, you
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:53.260]   can customize it much more heavily than you can if you ship
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:55.340]   it with 2.0.
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:56.260]   I would believe that.
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.740]   I don't know that for sure.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:58.740]   I'd call it a 2.0--
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:01:58.740]   I think--
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:01.420]   --of the Google experience version.
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:04.060]   Yeah, well, and there's always a bunch of moving parts
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:07.780]   depending on when somebody is probably producing their phone.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:13.780]   So I think now everybody has access to the 2.0 branch.
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:19.460]   So people who just wanted to upgrade to 2.0, manufacturers,
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:21.460]   could do that a little more easily now.
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.820]   My friend at Verizon, inside contact,
[01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:25.940]   says that the ARIS, which ships with 1.6,
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:28.140]   will be updated very soon to 2.0.
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:29.460]   I love 2.0.
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:31.820]   I just have to say, I just love it.
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:32.660]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:38.940]   So as long as we're talking phones, the Gphone--
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:39.700]   anybody?
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:40.700]   Gphone?
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:41.940]   Rumors, according to TechCrunch--
[01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:42.940]   I will not die.
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:44.100]   --rumor will not die.
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:47.300]   And maybe this is why they made up Mike Harrington, get in line.
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:49.660]   But TechCrunch has said on Wednesday
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:51.900]   that sources indicate Google is still
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:55.580]   working on a Google branded Android phone sometime
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:58.220]   in early 2010.
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:01.260]   It will be sold directly to customers at retail.
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.700]   I mean, you can because it's an-- you
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:04.260]   can sell an unlocked GSM phone.
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:08.020]   You could only use it in the US on AT&T and T-Mobile.
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:11.300]   But you could do that.
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:14.900]   Kind of like the article on CNET likened it
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.460]   to what Microsoft did with Toshiba,
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.740]   Toshiba made a music player that looked awful,
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.860]   not like the Zoom for a long time.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:25.540]   And then all of a sudden, Microsoft's making the Zoom.
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:29.380]   Manufactured by Toshiba.
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.660]   I know you can't mat say anything one way or the other,
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:34.540]   but it just seems like a strange thing.
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:37.460]   At this point, especially if Android's really
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:41.660]   starting to take off, which it seems to be--
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:43.460]   on the other hand, I was very critical of Apple
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:46.940]   for locking into AT&T.
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:49.380]   I really wish Apple had done an open platform.
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:54.580]   It's kind of tricky because you never--
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.780]   you know, all these speculations and stories
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:59.580]   are going around and you never know quite what to think.
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.780]   So, you know, I work in search quality.
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:04.580]   So all I have to worry about is their webspam or not,
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:06.300]   which makes my life very easy.
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:09.380]   I know what to kill and I go up and I kill it.
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:11.220]   I only know webspam.
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:13.180]   What is this Gphone you talk about?
[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:13.780]   It's not--
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:14.380]   I'll click.
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:15.180]   I am-- I am--
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:17.780]   I only know webspam.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:18.980]   It's German night here on--
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:22.180]   Speaking German.
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:23.180]   Yeah.
[01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:26.180]   Well, they've occurred to me about the Chromium OS
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:29.100]   discussion not to go back to Topo K.
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:31.940]   But just as with the phones, I want
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:34.900]   to be able to buy a machine and play with it and have it.
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:38.100]   But if that machine doesn't cost me $300,
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:42.940]   if it really costs me another account with a phone company,
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:45.900]   and it costs me $2,400, that's no good.
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:47.020]   That's very expensive.
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:47.900]   Yeah.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:50.780]   Yeah, and the economics of connectivity
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.940]   are just remain off.
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:54.460]   And I don't know.
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:56.100]   I'm not smart enough by Amy.
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.660]   He's the most of it like David Eisenberg on it,
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.620]   trying to think of what that future means.
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:04.580]   But just as the phone companies went through their revolt,
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:06.820]   as he put it, about the dumb network,
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:10.580]   now I think the economics of connectivity are just all off.
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:11.580]   And they're going to affect--
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.180]   They are.
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:15.420]   Other industries succeeding.
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:18.460]   They're going to affect us being ubiquitously and constantly
[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.540]   connected and the value that comes from that.
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:23.660]   But this is Google's in the position.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:26.100]   This is where Google gets in a weird position,
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:29.700]   because they're doing traditional business with Android
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.940]   and Verizon and the other Android partners.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:33.700]   They're doing a traditional business deal.
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:34.300]   But what we--
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.340]   You never tried it.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:35.940]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.220]   But what we just-- you're right.
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.300]   They put that link up on the front page.
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:42.380]   But what we just talked about is this new business model,
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:43.940]   this less than free business model,
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:47.700]   and in that context, it would make perfect sense for Google
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:51.180]   to give away a free phone almost.
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.700]   And just say, here is an unlocked phone, less than free.
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.900]   Hey, you're taking it.
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:57.940]   And if that's Google's business model,
[01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:00.100]   then it would make perfect sense that they would do this.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.900]   Is there a little schizophrenic that they're
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:05.820]   in bed with Verizon?
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:08.100]   It seems like a transitional business model, doesn't it?
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:09.100]   Yes.
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:10.140]   It's what you have to do today.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:11.340]   It's kick-starting it.
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:14.020]   I posted a few weeks ago about Howard Stern talking
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:14.980]   about the wonders of the internet.
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.020]   I think I talked about it here.
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:16.940]   Yes.
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:19.100]   That he can do so much more on the internet
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:23.180]   and that he can, even at Sirius, Oprah going away
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:25.380]   from broadcast to cable.
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:26.980]   She can get the money there now,
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.580]   Howard can get the money from Sirius now.
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:30.380]   But clearly, just being on the internet
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:32.820]   and having direct connections, especially if you're that big,
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:34.140]   is better.
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:38.900]   Well, notice I still do a traditional radio show.
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:39.700]   Yeah.
[01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:45.100]   I mean, I understand traditional-- transitional models.
[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:47.780]   But sometimes I think it holds you back.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:50.020]   It's a reluctance to play hard.
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:51.900]   And Google plays hard.
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.660]   Google never struck me as having the kind of cowardice that
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:57.420]   would say, well, we want a transitional business model
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:00.100]   until we really get going.
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:00.740]   Well, that's where--
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.100]   Just like white spaces come in.
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:05.580]   Fighting for white spaces to be unlicensed.
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:05.980]   White spaces.
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.260]   That's an interesting topic.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:07.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.300]   What is white spaces?
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.500]   Matt, you want to explain it, but other than I can?
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.100]   Sure.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:13.620]   Definitely.
[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:18.700]   So analog TV needed a lot of spectrum space.
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.700]   And the digital transition where everybody's now
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:24.180]   going to digital television in the United States
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:28.100]   means that those analog channels are getting freed up.
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:33.580]   And if you can use those analog spaces to, for example,
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:36.020]   do broadband wireless connectivity,
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:38.620]   it turns out that spectrum is really
[01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:41.460]   conducive to going through buildings
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:44.300]   and going really far so you wouldn't need nearly
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.940]   as many transmitters.
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:48.260]   So it's really kind of an exciting idea
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:51.780]   because Wi-Fi was this sort of garbage, tiny slice
[01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:55.420]   of segment that was used by microwave ovens and garage
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.180]   door openers.
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:58.780]   And people didn't view it as very helpful.
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:00.100]   And Larry Page gave a speech.
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:03.460]   I think it was at the FCC where he said, look,
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:07.220]   this spectrum, just by being open to everybody,
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:08.820]   has been incredibly useful.
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:11.260]   Think about how many devices use Wi-Fi.
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:11.760]   Yes.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.020]   What if you allow the spectrum that
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:17.740]   used to be television channels, which is much broader
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:19.900]   with the proper safety provisions so that you don't
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:20.860]   get interference?
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:25.060]   What if you allowed regular people or companies or ISPs
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:26.700]   to use that in some way?
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.420]   And I think that's really exciting
[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:32.540]   because broadband connectivity isn't where you'd like it to be.
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:34.060]   There's still spots in the country
[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:36.580]   where it's a lot harder to get rural broadband.
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.460]   And in theory, that's the sort of thing
[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:40.260]   that white spaces could help with a lot.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:41.460]   I was a little disappointed.
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:42.460]   Wi-Fi is never going to be yet.
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:44.220]   Wi-Fi is too limited.
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.740]   I had a fantasy that Google was going to--
[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:49.020]   well, they said they were going to bid for this 700 megahertz
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:49.380]   spectrum.
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:52.340]   I had a fantasy that they would buy it and open it.
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:55.300]   They did own it for-- they were the top bidder for a few hours.
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:58.020]   Yeah, for a minute.
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:01.340]   Because they bid the minimum $4.6 billion.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:03.820]   But with that, the reason they did guarantee
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:07.060]   the government the minimum and bid that minimum
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.780]   was so that they could get concessions back
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:11.180]   and they got concessions.
[01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.500]   That's right.
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.540]   Yeah, I think that we start to see the grand Google World
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:19.260]   Domination Strategy coming into focus here,
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:23.460]   unlike their camera phone every 24 days anyway.
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:29.180]   In a sense that if the white spaces were open,
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:32.820]   if we had ubiquitous constant high speed connectivity,
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:34.780]   all Google wants us to do is use the internet more
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:36.980]   and make more stuff for them to organize and put ads on.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:37.780]   It's good for them.
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:40.620]   And for them to know more stuff to target and understand
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:42.060]   our intent better.
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:44.340]   Well, so you tie together the discussion of the day.
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:49.060]   You did the speed of Chromium OS, Chrome OS, Chrome itself,
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:53.020]   machines, ubiquitous connectivity, everything on the web,
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:56.300]   everything then targetable on the web, everything taken off
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:57.140]   the desktop.
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:58.580]   It all starts to make sense.
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:09:59.500]   It's good for Google.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:03.300]   And fortunately, our interests coincide.
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.740]   Well, and it was good for Earth.
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:08.460]   Yeah, I think you chalk it up to a grand plan.
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:11.180]   And from my experience, I wouldn't say there's
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:14.020]   some Google grand plan like that.
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:17.900]   But to the extent that when people use the web more,
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:18.860]   it is good for Google.
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:20.660]   Yeah, we do get to show more ads.
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:21.580]   That's true.
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:25.180]   The corollary to that-- and Ben Parr had written an equation
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:28.460]   or a post about the Google revenue equation.
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:31.780]   And the corollary of his idea was that Google
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:34.980]   wants the web to succeed and wants the web to be really good
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:36.020]   for everyone.
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:38.020]   And we'll work to try to make that happen.
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:42.540]   And so if the web is faster, more ubiquitous, easier to use,
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.940]   safer to use, all of those different things,
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:48.260]   then people use the web more, which is good for Google,
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:50.980]   but more importantly is good for everybody.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:53.620]   Wiring up places like Africa can be
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:56.980]   good for all of those countries, just like getting rural broadband
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:58.460]   could be good.
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:02.300]   And when Larry talked, wherever it was in Washington,
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.580]   he called it Wi-Fi on steroids.
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.020]   And when asked, why are you doing this?
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.620]   He said, well, the more people on the internet,
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:08.460]   the more money we make.
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:10.100]   It's just true.
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:10.620]   Right.
[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:11.620]   It's interesting.
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:12.860]   Go ahead.
[01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:16.580]   Oh, just the fact that I think Google
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:20.020]   has done a good job of aligning the interests of the internet
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:22.780]   and the interests of its users and its own interests.
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:27.340]   And I think we consciously try to keep that going.
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:29.740]   And you can see that if you read through what would Google do,
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:31.780]   if you read through your book, we try
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.300]   to align those interests such that--
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.300]   I don't think Jeff ever read you.
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:35.300]   --the things we do.
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:36.300]   That's a textbook I think you've said.
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.180]   Once you write a book, the last thing you want to do is read it.
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:40.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:43.100]   But you really do want to make the web better
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:44.780]   so that users are happier.
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:46.540]   They use the web more.
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:48.220]   It's a really nice virtual cycle.
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:50.220]   And you never want to take an action that
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:53.380]   would hurt the web or would hurt your users.
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:56.100]   And so it's sometimes takes some interesting work
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.300]   to try to find that alignment.
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:59.260]   But it's definitely worth it.
[01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:00.660]   What hits me all the time, too, Matt,
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:03.020]   is how the mission of organizing the world's information
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:04.700]   and making it accessible.
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.140]   It seems to come back to that all the time.
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:10.300]   Even in the effort to get renewable power
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:14.380]   for cheaper than coal, if you imagine power in Africa,
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:16.980]   in those villages, you can put the server farms everywhere.
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.580]   You can reduce the cost.
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:19.300]   You get more people on.
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:20.500]   You get more information.
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:25.220]   It comes back to that idea at one level or another, I think,
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:26.860]   always.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:27.460]   Totally.
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:29.300]   Yeah, I completely agree.
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:34.180]   I think Google has also invested in various ventures
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:37.540]   that try to bring more internet connectivity to Africa
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:39.740]   and various ways to use SMS well.
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:42.900]   And all of that stuff is good for those countries,
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:45.900]   but down the road will be good for Google as well,
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:49.340]   while being good for users and the internet.
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:50.180]   That's very interesting.
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:51.700]   Well, it is the old GM line.
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:52.220]   What's that?
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:56.300]   Well, GM is good for America, well, what's good for Google?
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.900]   Except it's what's good for the internet
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:59.620]   is what's good for Google.
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.180]   Rather than what's good for Google.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.660]   That's really good for Google.
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:04.620]   This email I can refer into that was just private,
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:06.740]   so I won't say it, but it was somebody I really, really
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:09.780]   respect who was kind of pushing me on this idea of Google's
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.140]   power and Google's force.
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:14.260]   And I kept saying that my lengthy response to was
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:14.780]   lengthy email.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:17.540]   I said, Google is not--
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.180]   we have put it as, these are laws of the internet
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:20.020]   that rule Google.
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:22.860]   Google doesn't rule the internet.
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:25.860]   They are just simply new laws of reality now.
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.300]   And this is how the world operates.
[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:30.740]   This is what I did try to explain in, I don't know,
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.140]   a certain book.
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:36.340]   But that's the point, is that Google
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:39.460]   recognized this new reality and found the ways to exploit
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:41.980]   and take advantage of it.
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:46.900]   And I think that often what happens is, as in newspapers,
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:48.860]   Google gets blamed.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:49.980]   Craigslist gets blamed.
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:52.140]   I've argued this about Google and newspapers.
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:53.780]   I posted about this this week.
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:55.460]   It was on a radio show talking about it.
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:58.500]   And I said, Google's mistake with newspapers is that they
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.820]   thought that newspapers wanted friends, and they tried to be
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.260]   newspapers' friends.
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:04.100]   And newspapers actually want enemies.
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:06.260]   They want people to blame for all their troubles rather
[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:08.300]   themselves.
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:10.740]   And so in my mind, Google should be the friend of anyone,
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:14.620]   including new enterprises, not just the legacy enterprises.
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:17.580]   But Google inevitably gets blamed for the change because
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:18.820]   it is the biggest target.
[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:21.580]   And it is the one that has figured it out and exploited it
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:22.700]   most.
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:25.820]   But that doesn't mean Google made the change happen.
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:26.100]   Right.
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:28.940]   I think you were saying at one point, you weren't happy to be
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:31.660]   the harbinger of what's coming for the newspapers.
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:33.620]   You were just the messenger.
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:34.540]   You didn't bring it on.
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:37.300]   You were just acknowledging it and clarifying it a little bit.
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:40.940]   And I think Google is often emblematic of the net when
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:43.380]   people talk of Google-- and I think Eric Schmidt has said
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:46.460]   this-- what they usually mean is some sort of shorthand that
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:51.260]   says, yes, the internet is doing this, or Craigslist, or
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.540]   better connectivity is doing this,
[01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:56.220]   rather than Google proper.
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:59.220]   Well, this is just a great discussion.
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:03.260]   At some point, I would really like to sit down with you two.
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:04.260]   We're running out of time.
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:06.500]   This is the only reason I do it right now.
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:11.300]   And try to tease out what those fundamental tenets of how
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:12.740]   Google runs its business are.
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:15.580]   What that-- is it one basic?
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:16.300]   Is it that line?
[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:17.820]   What's good for the web?
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:18.700]   Is good for Google?
[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:24.220]   What is that thing that informs everything Google does?
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.700]   I mean, is that in your book, Jeff?
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:28.860]   Is that something I would be able to tease out there?
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:29.220]   I don't know.
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:29.740]   I'm guessing.
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:32.620]   I guessed 40 rules like that.
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:33.140]   I think Matt lives--
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:34.020]   40 is too many.
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:34.780]   It's got to be--
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:35.820]   Yeah, it is.
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:38.140]   Because it's got to be something you can hold in your mind
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:41.340]   and use as a measuring stick for everything you do.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:41.820]   And it's not--
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.420]   But I think the mission is it.
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:43.940]   Yeah.
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:45.660]   Organizing the rules information.
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:45.940]   Yeah.
[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:47.740]   I do think it comes back to that, Matt.
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:48.740]   Is that your sense, Matt?
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:50.980]   I think it's just--
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:52.580]   I think that's a big one, I think.
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:55.100]   But there's also the aspect of Don't Be Evil.
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:57.500]   I think there is Don't Trap User's data.
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:00.020]   Mm-hm.
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.220]   Has that been there all along?
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:02.780]   Or is that something new?
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:03.260]   No.
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:04.140]   No.
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:07.620]   Eric Schmidt crystallized that at Web 2.0 in response
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:10.860]   to a question that John Battelle asked, I think, in 2006.
[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:13.620]   And it was almost as if it was a core value of Google that
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:15.740]   had always been latent beneath the surface.
[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:15.940]   And he just--
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:16.580]   Nobody knew it.
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:16.980]   Yeah.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:17.860]   He just pulled it out.
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:19.780]   And as soon as he said it, he's like, oh, yeah,
[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:21.620]   that's what we want.
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:25.740]   So I think Don't Be Evil be an advocate for users.
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:27.100]   Don't trap users' data.
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:30.260]   And then the consequences of that are,
[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:31.780]   if you can't trap your users' data,
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:33.700]   you have to compete on merit.
[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.140]   You don't give yourself any advantage.
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:36.260]   Chrome has to be better.
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:41.580]   It can't just take advantage of any proprietary API
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:42.060]   or anything.
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:43.100]   So if you have to--
[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:46.420]   Is that stuff-- do you get a handbook when you become a Google
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.420]   employee?
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:51.540]   See, there's got to be some way that they percolate these core
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.900]   values throughout the company.
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:56.660]   Because the company is such a vast enterprise
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:59.820]   with so many different things going on, sometimes
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:02.940]   inconsistent, as we see here with Android and Verizon
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:05.460]   versus less than free.
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:07.740]   But there is a consistency to how it operates.
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:11.940]   It must be somehow communicated to its employees.
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:13.900]   We do have, you know, nuclear training.
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:15.940]   Newglers are new Googlers.
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:21.140]   But I think a lot of it just comes from interacting
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:22.300]   with people within Google.
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:25.900]   And the hope is that the people who apply to jobs at Google
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:26.820]   have seen--
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:27.340]   Yeah.
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:29.180]   --yeah, have seen Google's--
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:32.700]   how we operate in general.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:35.100]   And hopefully that we attract the sort of people
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:36.380]   that believe in that already.
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:36.860]   Yep.
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:39.260]   And they don't make it through the gauntlet.
[01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:39.820]   Unless--
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:40.820]   It's a hell of a gauntlet.
[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:46.380]   Somebody's going to wear the clothes, right?
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:50.380]   Well, there is a question in the typical Google
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:52.620]   interview, which is essentially when you fill out your
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:54.980]   evaluation, you say, well, what's their cultural fit?
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:55.900]   What is--
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.100]   how googly are they?
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.780]   And that's not something that's like, do they like bright
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:00.580]   colored balloons?
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:04.620]   That's, you know, do you think that they would make Google
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.100]   proud in some sense?
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:08.740]   Somebody put a link to the Google code of conduct, which
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:11.860]   is at investor.google.com/conduct.html.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:13.620]   But that's different from what I'm talking about.
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:14.140]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:15.500]   That's, you know, the rules--
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:16.700]   the conduct rules.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:21.540]   But there seems to be an underlying fundamental mission.
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:22.540]   And Leo, I think the other thing--
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:26.540]   Marissa Myers said this in videos around--
[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:28.820]   and business people still don't believe it.
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:31.300]   I had somebody quizzing me this week about this, is that
[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:33.620]   Google goes for a great product, and will serve a lot of
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.700]   people first, and then figures out the business.
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:36.620]   I love that.
[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:38.220]   And has the courage to do that.
[01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:44.620]   Now, that got a lot of kudos as a strategy in the first bubble,
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:47.060]   because obviously people went down the wrong road as a
[01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:47.500]   result of that.
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.340]   So I don't need to worry about money.
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:50.620]   Well, no.
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:53.220]   You know that time comes when you must.
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:56.620]   But if you try to follow the money at first, you'll probably
[01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:57.420]   fail.
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:58.420]   Right.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:18:58.900]   That's it.
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.340]   And you probably don't want to just launch a product that's
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:02.820]   a MeToo product.
[01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:06.460]   Yeah, something like Google Maps was distinctly different.
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:09.540]   The idea that you could click and drag your map around and
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:12.140]   move it around directly, that's something where you could
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:14.060]   immediately see the value.
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:16.700]   Gmail, the ability to thread conversations or have
[01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:17.980]   massive amounts of storage.
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:20.700]   So I think Google does a pretty good job of trying to say,
[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:22.540]   let's not launch this product, because we're not bringing
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:25.820]   anything new, some twist or some innovation or something that
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:27.620]   would make it compelling to the table.
[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:28.780]   I wouldn't say we do that for sure.
[01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:31.980]   We have rumors this week that AOL is going to sell Map Quest.
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:34.060]   Oh, boy.
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:37.380]   I'm curious if you think the mission involves Map or if
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:41.460]   it's been pretty consistent all along.
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:46.620]   You know, the don't be evil has been around forever and
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:48.700]   organize the world's information and make it universally
[01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:50.340]   accessible and useful has been around forever.
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:54.460]   And I remember when I heard that mission statement the first
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:57.980]   time, I was taking it back because it is ambitious.
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:19:59.860]   It's staggering.
[01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:03.700]   It mentions nothing about being a search engine.
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.460]   But it's more advertising.
[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:06.260]   More advertising.
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:10.180]   But I think Larry and Sergey really hit on a key idea and
[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:13.620]   it's guided us pretty well for several years.
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:16.700]   We're going to take a little break and come back and we'll
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:18.700]   have Jeff's number of the week.
[01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.780]   We won't have a genotool of the week.
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:22.060]   I mean, a tip of the week, but I have a tool.
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:23.020]   Tip of the week, you always get the confusion.
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:23.540]   I know.
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:27.980]   Tools and tips are very similar, really, unfortunately.
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:30.940]   I'll look for a tip real quickly as we--
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:31.900]   Well, maybe Matt.
[01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:32.340]   You know what?
[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:32.500]   Matt.
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:33.180]   I can do a tip.
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:36.780]   Matt, I bet you you have a tip or two.
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:37.220]   Easy.
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:39.820]   Something you might know.
[01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:40.660]   All right.
[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:43.260]   We're going to assign Matt this week, the tip of the week.
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:45.900]   Before we do that, though, just a reminder to backup.
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:47.900]   This is not a public service announcement, although it
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:48.660]   could be.
[01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:50.020]   You got it back up.
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:52.100]   I get so many calls from people who don't back up and you'd
[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:55.460]   think anybody who is smart enough to be watching this show
[01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:58.740]   must be smart enough to back up all their data, right?
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:20:59.260]   Right?
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:02.060]   Maybe you live in the cloud, you figure I'm safe.
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:03.140]   But I guarantee you, there's something
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:06.820]   on your hard drive that you do not want to lose.
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:09.180]   And if you're backing it up to a local drive,
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:11.780]   yeah, that's a start.
[01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:13.860]   But what happens if the worst happens?
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:16.460]   Fire, flood, earthquake, tornado.
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:17.980]   Or just somebody breaks into your house
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:21.060]   and steals your backups along with your main computer.
[01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:23.620]   You got to have off-site backup.
[01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:26.100]   That's why we talk about carbonite.com.
[01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:28.220]   It's off-site backup done right.
[01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:29.980]   Couldn't be easier to use.
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:31.980]   That's another one to bring home with you for Thanksgiving.
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.220]   Bring the relatives.
[01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:35.740]   Get them set up on carbonite.com.
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:38.060]   Automatically backs up your irreplaceable files,
[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:41.300]   your financial documents, your photos, your music.
[01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:43.700]   Yeah, I said photos of music, even those gigantic files,
[01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:46.860]   because carbonite is flat-rate backup.
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:49.820]   Everything on your computer for less than $5 a month,
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:51.060]   don't worry about how much you've got.
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:54.700]   I've been backing up podcasts from this computer.
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:55.780]   Gigabytes.
[01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:56.980]   Gigabytes.
[01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:58.340]   I want you to try it absolutely free.
[01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:01.940]   Just go to carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIT.
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:03.540]   That's easy to remember.
[01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:05.740]   And you can try it free for a couple of weeks.
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:06.860]   Don't even need a credit card.
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:07.620]   It'll just start running.
[01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:08.820]   Just to give you an idea.
[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:10.420]   Now remember, you do have to have high-speed internet
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:11.900]   for this to make sense.
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:14.900]   And the backup doesn't happen overnight,
[01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:17.060]   because it's not going to slow you down and wants
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:18.940]   to do this while you're idle and when you're not
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.020]   doing anything else.
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:22.260]   But once you get stuff backed up,
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:24.500]   then it's just pretty quick to keep it always backed up.
[01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.180]   Automatically, you don't have to think about it.
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:27.060]   It's just there.
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.300]   You can go anywhere and get any file, by the way,
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:31.500]   by logging into your carbonite account.
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:32.380]   That's very nice.
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:36.740]   And if you're upgrading to Windows 7 or perhaps Chrome OS,
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:38.940]   and you want to backup your data before the upgrade,
[01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:39.540]   you can do that.
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:42.500]   Move your account to the next machine and restore.
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:43.260]   Try it right now.
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:47.220]   Go to carbonite.com, offer code TWIT.
[01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:51.140]   And Mac or Windows, less than $5 a month.
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:52.580]   But try it free right now.
[01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:55.260]   By the way, if you do the free trial,
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:58.580]   after you sign up for the free trial,
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:01.380]   if you decide to buy, you'll get two free months.
[01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:03.260]   But you have to do the free trial first.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:04.660]   You can't just go and say, I'm going to buy this.
[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:05.940]   I know I'm going to buy this.
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:06.700]   Put in the offer code.
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:07.820]   You won't get the two free months.
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:09.740]   Do the free trial.
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:11.700]   I like a company that stands behind their product
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.020]   at that point where they say, nope,
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:15.020]   you have to try it before you buy it.
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:17.780]   Carbonite.com.
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:22.340]   Well, traditionally, Matt, we start with the tip of the week.
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:24.260]   So I'm going to put you on the spot here.
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:25.460]   That sounds good.
[01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:26.820]   I could give you a couple tips.
[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:29.380]   Oh, two tips.
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:30.580]   Two for one.
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:34.860]   So one nice tip is that if you're doing any sort of legal
[01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:38.500]   research, Google added United States case law
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.580]   to Google Scholar.
[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:41.500]   So you can go and you can do a search like Google
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:44.980]   or desegregation or Brown versus School Board.
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:47.540]   And you can find all sorts of really readable court
[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:48.820]   opinions.
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:51.140]   You can research different companies
[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:54.060]   and find out what sort of interesting things are going on.
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:55.020]   So that's one tip.
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:57.940]   That's government transparency and disintermediating
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.260]   West Law all in one--
[01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:02.340]   I was just going to say, goodbye Lexus.
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:05.940]   Well, they still have citations and a lot of stuff.
[01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:09.020]   This isn't going to replace your law library, but still.
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:09.500]   Very useful.
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:10.900]   But if you don't have a subscription,
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:12.900]   it's very cheap to try it out.
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:14.500]   There are laws after all.
[01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:15.340]   We should have them.
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:15.860]   Yes.
[01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:16.340]   Yeah.
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:16.500]   Laws.
[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:17.260]   What a good idea.
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:19.140]   What a concept.
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:21.900]   And there's another neat thing that Google launched this week,
[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:26.940]   which is the ability to automatically transcribe videos.
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:30.380]   So we will run machine speech recognition on your videos.
[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:32.820]   Now, this is going to start out on a small number of channels.
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:36.900]   So Yale, Stanford, official Google tech talks.
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:38.500]   But we also rolled out something new
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:41.100]   that I think every person has access to if you have
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:44.420]   your own YouTube channel where you upload videos.
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:46.580]   If you want to, you can take a text
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:50.980]   transcription of the words that are being said in a video.
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:53.660]   You can upload the raw text to YouTube,
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:56.140]   along with the video that you already have uploaded.
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:25:00.140]   And YouTube will auto align the text that you uploaded
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:02.300]   with the spoken audio.
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:04.860]   And it will give you accurate time codes.
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:07.780]   Now, if you've ever paid to have a video transcribed
[01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:09.940]   and have captions added, it turns out
[01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:11.860]   getting those accurate time codes are often
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:13.460]   what costs a lot of money.
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:17.540]   So you might have to write down what the words were
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:19.380]   that were spoken, or maybe you have a transcript
[01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.820]   if you already had a script or something.
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:23.620]   But it's pretty amazing that Google
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:26.940]   can align the text to what's being spoken.
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:28.980]   And then it will let you download it.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:32.100]   So if you want to take that information
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:34.460]   and leave YouTube behind completely,
[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:35.620]   you're more than welcome to.
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:40.900]   You get what's known as I believe an SBV file,
[01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:44.900]   which is the text and the time codes very accurately aligned.
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:46.820]   It only works in English for right now,
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:50.700]   but as always, we're working on improving our capabilities.
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:54.340]   And it's really a lot of fun in that you don't have
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:57.140]   to do the tedious thing of keeping track of time codes
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:25:57.900]   anymore.
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:59.140]   I think that's fantastic.
[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:00.100]   What is great?
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:01.660]   This will all do wonders for finally getting video
[01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:02.580]   to be searchable, right?
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:05.500]   That's the real-- it's accessible, but also searchable.
[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:09.260]   Not just searchable, but now suppose you only read Turkish.
[01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:12.220]   You might get something that's been auto transcribed in English,
[01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:14.420]   and now you can translate it into Turkish.
[01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:17.020]   And it won't be perfect, but you can get an idea about what
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:18.780]   someone's saying.
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:19.500]   Wow.
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:20.540]   I love it.
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:22.860]   The guy who announced this in the Google blog
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:25.380]   said, this is of use to me because I'm deaf.
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:25.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.220]   I think that's fantastic.
[01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:28.700]   He uses it.
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:30.700]   There's one guy who wrote a column who said,
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:33.300]   I'm not saying that I watch YouTube videos at work,
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:36.060]   but sometimes you want to be able to see the caption yourself.
[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:41.140]   There's even a project in India where people
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:43.420]   know how to speak a particular language,
[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:45.300]   but don't know how to read it and write it.
[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.500]   And so this has the ability, in theory,
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:50.340]   to show you the captions of a language you already
[01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:52.140]   know how to speak, but maybe you're illiterate
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:53.580]   and don't know how to read and write.
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:55.980]   So there are a lot of people who can learn how to read and write
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:59.300]   just from looking at captions on videos.
[01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:02.220]   So there's a lot of really nice potential unlocked
[01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:04.060]   by this new change.
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:05.700]   Very interesting.
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:09.260]   So you had to translate while you type, too.
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:10.540]   So that's really another tip.
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:12.140]   You got a bunch of them.
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:13.260]   That's great.
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:13.860]   Easy week.
[01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:16.620]   One of the reasons we love having you on the show.
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:19.740]   And now, Jeff, your number of the--
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:20.100]   Simple.
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:22.700]   Just return to the theme of the day.
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:24.420]   And unfortunately, I've screwed up the link,
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:25.540]   so I can't find it right now.
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:33.340]   But Google announced that the number of users on Chrome browser
[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:34.780]   is 40 million already.
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:36.740]   Wow.
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:41.060]   40 million using Chrome, not Chrome OS, but Chrome.
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:42.140]   Wow.
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:44.660]   And the Mac version is any minute now, right, Matt?
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:45.940]   That was the other good news they said.
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:50.700]   Yes, Mac and Linux versions are imminent, and I can't wait.
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:51.700]   Yahoo.
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:52.300]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.820]   That wasn't the right thing to say.
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:56.300]   Please forgive me, Matt.
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.500]   I'll never say that again.
[01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:01.700]   So my tool is kind of a little different this week.
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:04.900]   And it comes from a listener who wrote to me.
[01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:07.300]   His name is Mike Koss.
[01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:11.860]   He said, this question came up at the Seattle Users Group,
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:14.060]   the Google Users Group, which is GTUG.
[01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:15.820]   You probably know about them, Matt.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:20.460]   How many unique products and services does Google have?
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:22.980]   And they've been collecting it into, of course,
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:24.980]   a Google spreadsheet.
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:29.700]   And in fact, since he sent it to me, he said 151,
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:31.460]   it's even larger now.
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:35.940]   It is now up to drum roll, please.
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:38.260]   I don't even have room on the screen to scroll all the way
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:39.500]   down.
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:44.660]   224 unique services through Google.
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:46.500]   They're all linked in this spreadsheet.
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:49.820]   I mean, this is just fantastic.
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:54.620]   You know, everything-- so instead of giving you just one Google
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:57.980]   utility, I'm going to give you all of them.
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:29:01.980]   And I promise to be data mining this as well.
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:02.940]   Can you believe that, Matt?
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:04.740]   Would you have guessed that number?
[01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:05.660]   Was it 224?
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:07.100]   That's amazing.
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.900]   I think the last time I saw that spreadsheet, it was 150.
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:12.940]   So there might be a few more still to be added.
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:14.420]   It's growing fast, exactly.
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:16.380]   So you are familiar with it.
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:18.820]   I had seen that spreadsheet, yeah.
[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:21.500]   And it was pretty funny, because Om Malek did a post where
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.500]   he talked about some of the things from Google that have
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.420]   failed.
[01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:27.780]   So he talked about Lively that we shut down, for example.
[01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:30.060]   And he had four or five things.
[01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:32.780]   But if you consider four or five things that he considered a
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:37.460]   failure compared to 224 Google services, that's really not
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:38.020]   that bad.
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:41.220]   You could argue we should be feeling more often.
[01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:43.620]   Take that, old.
[01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:45.300]   We're doing OK.
[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:49.860]   So Mike sent me a short URL for this.
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:55.300]   It is u.g o2.me.
[01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:55.620]   Get it?
[01:29:55.620 --> 01:30:01.620]   You go to me/3WT.
[01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:04.980]   u.g o2.me-- we'll put this in the show now--
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:07.620]   slash 3WT.
[01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:10.100]   It'll take you to the Google spreadsheet with H and
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:14.660]   every one of the exhaustive Google and exhausting Google
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:16.820]   product lists.
[01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:18.340]   That's really great.
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:20.100]   Matt Cutts, thank you so much for being here.
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:22.380]   And I want to thank the folks at Google for letting you be
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:23.100]   here.
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:23.540]   Hey, Matt.
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:24.340]   Always a pleasure.
[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:25.940]   Oh, well, it's great to have you on.
[01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:29.260]   And it's nice to have somebody who really knows what's
[01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:31.980]   going on in the Googleplex.
[01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:36.460]   You can find Matt's blog at mattcuts.com/blog.
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:37.900]   That's his website also.
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:42.620]   And thank him the next time you see him for the great work he
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:45.100]   does, keeping spam out of our search results.
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:46.900]   We do appreciate that.
[01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:49.260]   Jeff Jarvis, always a pleasure having you.
[01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:50.820]   I'm so glad you're here.
[01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:52.780]   The book, of course, What Would Google Do,
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:56.020]   available everywhere finer books are sold with that very
[01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:56.820]   colorful cover--
[01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:58.940]   WWGD.
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:00.980]   Are you working on anyone?
[01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:02.700]   Yeah, in fact, I was in web2.org this week.
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:07.020]   And I talked about the idea and got advice from the group,
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:08.420]   leading off saying it moves from what
[01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:10.860]   Google did and what should Jarvis do.
[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:13.860]   And the current idea is a book called Beta.
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:16.380]   I showed the alpha version of my thinking.
[01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:16.980]   I like that.
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:17.900]   I don't know what's that.
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:19.660]   So it was at your talk at web2.0?
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:20.220]   Yeah.
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:20.380]   Yeah.
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:22.940]   Where, by the way, I finally got to meet Gina face-to-face.
[01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:24.180]   It was just wonderful.
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:25.580]   She spoke as well.
[01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:26.460]   Yes.
[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:27.820]   Kevin Marks spoke--
[01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:28.500]   did the keynote.
[01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:29.420]   I'm sorry I missed this.
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:32.220]   It sounded like it was a great conference.
[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:33.940]   Well, maybe someday you and I and Gina
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:35.260]   will have a shared drink.
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:36.540]   But I'm glad that you two got to meet.
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:39.740]   Now I feel really left out.
[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:42.420]   I hope you weren't plotting.
