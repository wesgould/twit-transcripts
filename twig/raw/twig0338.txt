[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   The old gang's back together to talk about, of course, the Iowa election, and which kid
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   that uses social media the best will also talk about Google's stunning stellar results.

[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   with the lovely and talented Jeff Jarvis back home where he belongs.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   But we will get back to CUNY's beautiful studio.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I think he has ever...
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Yeah, no, you look good.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   You look good. You look great.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I have some...
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Sad.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Oh no.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   News.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   News?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Bob?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Of...
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Yes.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Bob and...
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Bob and...
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Ray.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Ray.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Ray.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Oh.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Oh.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Oh wait.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   He's the slow talkers club.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And I have the link up on this night to the...
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Oh.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   My favorite comedy routine ever.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Me too.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   The slow talker.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Bob Elliott.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Chris Elliott's dad.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And I think the younger generation knows Chris Elliott from Letterman.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I didn't mean to delay Gina's introduction here with my slow...
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And that's...
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Oh my God, it's Gina Trapani as I live and breathe.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   From Blickland, New York, hi Gina.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Hi.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Hi.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Hi.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   She's a disabled.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Are...
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   You.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   The good news is that bit is on YouTube, so a whole new generation can discover.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   It is the greatest single...
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Just, you know, once you listen to that, just go through all the rest of them.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Because Bob and Ray were amazing.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I just saw a trailer for like a new animated film where like they're all animals and these two...
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   These two characters go into the DMV, which is staffed by Slob.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Yes.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Yes.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Did you see that?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yes.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.160]   And I've seen it a couple times in the theater and people laugh every time, even though it
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.000]   takes forever to go through the whole scene.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   He's a slow talking sloth.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It's the slow talker.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   It's a good...
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   That's right.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I didn't even put those two together.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.600]   Yeah, I didn't either.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.000]   How things going Gina?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Great.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Great.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   It's a little cold here.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   It's raining today though and not snowing, so that's good.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   You've had enough...
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Yes.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   ...perceptation.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Enough warmth this summer that I think you can have some colds.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Yes.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Easy for you to say California boy.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   It's cold here.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   It's like 47 degrees freezing.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Oh, blah blah.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I'm wearing a sweater.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   It's actually 57 here Gina.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   It's actually warmer in Jersey.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   It is.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   It is.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And Maker-based going well, Maker-based.co?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Yeah, things are good.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Things are good.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Go sign up if you haven't already.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And of course, think up is still the thing.

[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And I'm Leo LePorte.thinkup.com.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I think you can see my stuff.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   It's public, right?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I've been using Twitter a lot more lately.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Oh, yeah?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I don't know why.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   That's funny.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   I was just talking to somebody who said they're using Twitter less.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I've been using Twitter less.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   But I go through phases.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I go through phases.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   That's right.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Sometimes I'm feeling talkative and sometimes not so much.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And sometimes I'm very conversation.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I'm enjoying conversation more.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I like Facebook, true.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   But I go through the same ups and downs with Facebook.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Well, you know, so the other day I was reading Facebook and I realized, boy, I'm just reading
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   a lot of the Washington Post now.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Their strategy of putting things up on instant articles is worth it.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I agree.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And Al Jazeera Plus.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   You told me about AJ+.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Yeah, AJ+.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I agree.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I think it is a great way.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And look what you did.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   You already are on there with, I see more Jeff Jarvis on my Facebook feed than I do almost
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   anything else.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Sorry.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   But when I see something like this happen, you know, Bob Elliott passing.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Facebook and Twitter are the places where the conversation happens, aren't they?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And that's so much better than reading a New York Times obituary, you know, and saying,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   "Hey, honey, you know what?"
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I like that that we can kind of have that dialogue.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   It seems like a healthy tribute.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   You know, people are sharing their favorite Bobber Ray routines, which is the best way to
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   remember.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   It's nice when there's, and again, thanks to YouTube, otherwise, what would you do?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   We can hear.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   We can relive the memories.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   So what you're talking as fast as I do that really drives people crazy when I talk to
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   that slow, because it just isn't me.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   You know what?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   This is the normal me.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   What do you think?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   What do you guys think?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   You know, this is not the first presidential election with a benefit of Twitter and Facebook.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   We had it four years ago.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   We didn't really have it eight years ago, but we had it four years ago.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I mean, we did technically have Twitter and Facebook, but I don't think there was widely
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   used.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   What do you think?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   I mean, we have a quadrennial event like this.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.600]   There really is a big shift over four years.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.000]   The role of Facebook and Twitter will be this election year.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Gina?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.800]   I mean, bigger than ever.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.240]   I mean, I think the role is as big as it is in people's lives, and these services have
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.400]   become, I think, embedded in more people's lives than anywhere else.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.560]   I mean, God, I'm not looking forward to the Facebook political debates between the various
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.000]   branches of my family.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I know.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   I mentioned this before, but what I did is I followed all the candidates, even Trump and
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.520]   I'm a Democrat, but even the Republican candidates, because I wanted to add that content to my
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.520]   feed.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.520]   See what they're doing.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.080]   I already find myself kind of covering my eyes when I see certain hashtags trending or
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.240]   whatever on Twitter, because I'm like, I just can't.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.640]   I'm not ready for this.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.480]   I'm trying to force myself to get at to, if there is such a thing as a filter bubble,
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.040]   and I know Jeff Jarvis, you argue against that notion that it's self-reinforcing.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.560]   We see more of what we believe, unless of what we don't believe.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:51.960]   But if it is to the degree that's real, I try to consciously add opposing viewpoints.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.280]   And I know, Gina, it's hard.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.840]   Sometimes you get angry, but I'm trying not to be.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.840]   That's good.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.840]   Good for you.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.440]   I'm trying to be the new thing.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.880]   And it comes from this triangulation we did with a guy named Jonathan Heit.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:09.000]   He's a moral philosopher, moral psychologist.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.640]   He's a professor of psychology at NYU who studies morality.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.600]   And his book, The Righteous Mind, it was a really good subject.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:23.120]   But he said, what we lack now is something he called intellectual humility, the idea
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.720]   that maybe we're not right about everything, an openness to other people's ideas.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.160]   And I'm trying as best I can to be intellectually humble.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.760]   I love that scene in Inside Out, the Pixar film Inside Out, where they're on the train
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.760]   of thought.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.240]   And the box falls over and all this stuff tumbles out and joy says, oh, these facts and opinions,
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.240]   they just all look the same.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.600]   And Bing Bong says, oh, don't worry, that always happens.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   And they get into stuff back in the box.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.600]   Oh, that's so good.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.240]   These facts and opinions, they all look the same.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.240]   They always have.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.440]   And they just want them back out again, right?
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.440]   Oh, isn't that wonderful?
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.640]   They're definitely, I love that phrase, intellectual humility.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.400]   Especially around political issues, just get so passionate, right?
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:09.240]   And you tend to just become full of self-righteousness about your opinion.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:15.440]   Jeff, is social media going to give us an opportunity to do a better job this year of
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.040]   electing a candidate?
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.040]   No.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.040]   I'm afraid.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.120]   And I'm always the optimist you know.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.440]   Title of Joe Trippie's book, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, who would imagine that
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.600]   the revolution will be tweeted, and will imagine that that tweet would not be occupied Wall
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:35.240]   Street or Black Lives Matter, that it would be Donald Trump, who has used social media
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.960]   absolutely brilliantly.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:43.120]   I wrote a post the other day on Medium arguing that the primary system is fundamentally racist
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.280]   because the two first states are 94% and 91% white respectively.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.440]   It's the angry white people.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.120]   It's petty code junction in a bad mood.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:59.280]   And so what we see there is constituents who are left out of that process.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.200]   And yeah, they may be able to talk on Twitter, but I don't think we see them much.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.960]   I just put under the bottom of the other, I just put up a very good post from Alyssa Miller,
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:12.560]   who is the CEO of Public Radio International, PRI, who goes through the numbers on the candidates
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.120]   and their tweets and their social status.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.200]   And she said, "The only two candidates seeing accelerating growth in social media followers
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.920]   in September are Donald Trump and Ted Cruz."
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.440]   And they're the frontrunners and the Republican Party.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.440]   Right.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.640]   The only one candidate to see more than 50% growth in the rate of followers in that time,
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:40.200]   Bernie Sanders, which is up a whopping 80%, though I suspect his was very low before.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.800]   She says the Sanders overall growth rate is phenomenal.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.000]   It started with a low rate.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.080]   The rapid decline of Ben Carson is clear.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.360]   So you do see a reflection here.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.320]   Cruz has a slight lead on Rubio and social followers.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.440]   So that's tracking to where Iowa was starting to go.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:04.360]   Hillary Clinton, who is my candidate, full disclosure, has seen a lot of growth.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:14.440]   But the bottom line is that I think that we're not seeing the people kind of taking over.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.040]   We're seeing people with media power like Trump using that power, carrying that media
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.880]   power over Twitter.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.480]   I am going to offer a somewhat different viewpoint because I'll tell you what's in.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:32.360]   I mean, I agree with you that his media power is because of his many years on reality TV
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.360]   is certainly a big asset for him.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.560]   But there's another thing that I notice of all of the candidates who tweet.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.920]   He's the only one who actually does his own tweeting.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.920]   Yeah, I think that's true.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.680]   There's something to be said for that.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.880]   Yes, there is.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.880]   Absolutely.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:54.280]   And in fact, I think that's it meshes perfectly with his appeal, which is he's seen as a guy
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.520]   who speaks his own mind, who does, who is unfiltered, unmoderated.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.480]   And if you look at Hillary Clinton's Twitter feed, you couldn't imagine a more moderated
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.040]   filtered feed.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.040]   That's a good story.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.360]   It's like campaign soundbite after campaign soundbite.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.480]   Well, eight years ago, we talked about the YouTube election and the candidates all made
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.480]   YouTube videos there.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.840]   And in the UK, at the same time, camera was making YouTube videos and they were intimate.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.240]   I've always said that someone's going to click on your nose and you're going to talk
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.440]   to them one on one.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.960]   But that's gone away too.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.280]   So yeah, it's just another way to get messages out.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.680]   And for Trump, he has no message.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.520]   He just has his bombast and he's stupid.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.160]   What do you want to tweet which he deleted?
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.080]   And this is, I'm not kidding.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.760]   This is a great, to a great degree, his appeal.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:55.520]   He tweeted that the Iowa caucus was illegally, the vote was illegally stolen by Ted Cruz.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:02.960]   And then a minute or two later, somebody come, I can see the scene running into his office
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:09.600]   saying, that is, you can be sued now, because that's, that's libel.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.520]   And, and Trump said, oh, it's amazing.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.960]   They were able to get him to delete it, but he deleted it and took the word illegally
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   out.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:22.440]   But he still said, I still tweeted the vote was stolen.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:28.520]   And that's part of his charm that he says, these devil may care.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.520]   He says what he thinks.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.920]   Even if you disagree with what he thinks, he says what he thinks.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.920]   And nobody does.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.080]   It's a continuation of the reality show, right?
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.280]   I mean, he has a savviness around these tools because that, I mean, he's been a media figure
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.960]   and people, people watch because they just want to see what he's going to say next because
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.720]   they know it's going to be outrageous.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:53.200]   And of course, he learned that from the World Wrestling Federation where he was very much
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   involved in wrestling.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.520]   Somebody pointed this out and it's really true.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.040]   It's very much like wrestling.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.760]   But I also think that's why he didn't get the votes he thought he would get.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.680]   That's why he pulled so much better than the actual of the votes because people say I like
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.880]   Trump, but when they actually comes down to voting, at least some percentage enough to
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:17.120]   switch the result thought better of it said, well, yeah, the, oh, I think it all went back
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.120]   up in its own way.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.280]   I just probably linked up to an NBC story.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:27.600]   And I quote a Donald Trump tweet based on the fraud admitted by Senator Ted Cruz during
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.280]   the Iowa caucus, either a new election should take place.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.280]   Wow.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.680]   That's a very interesting, very interesting.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.720]   He's really kind of, he's amazing to watch.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:46.560]   You know, as an orator, as a tweeter, as just a character, it's fascinating to watch because
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.560]   he is so popular.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:58.640]   The state of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.840]   that he cheated a total fraud.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.840]   Wow.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.680]   Based on the fraud committed by Ted Cruz during the Iowa caucus, either an election
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.680]   should take place.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.680]   Our cruise results nullified.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.680]   Hmm.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.680]   Oh, because he lied.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.080]   This is the illegal.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.080]   The fraud.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.080]   Okay.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.080]   Wow.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.720]   I just, it is fascinating to watch too bad.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.520]   It's at such great stakes are involved because it'd be great just to, if we're just wrestling.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.480]   The other thing that's brought me to is I wrote this post about the angry white primaries.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.480]   You know, okay.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:44.080]   So I'm saying, yes, I'm a liberal and the personal tax that then immediately, of course,
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.320]   follow, you know, somebody's writing some really long response on medium.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.160]   I can't stand people like you.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.840]   Somebody calls me a douche on Twitter.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.680]   But, but, you know, what, you take that stuff so personally, I've learned to just, you
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.520]   know, just, but what I'm saying is I don't think that that was the case and debate before
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.120]   you might say it about someone, but now you go to before the whole world because it's
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.520]   ultimately democratic.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:13.360]   And so you have a, you know, when 50,000 followers, four of them are going to call you
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.480]   names for not agreeing with them.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:20.200]   I don't think, I think that's one of the things that is interesting about Twitter is
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:27.240]   it does give much more weight to the strong voices in the crowd, you know, the squeaky
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.440]   wheels, but at least everybody gets a voice.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:35.760]   My favorite is Mr. Jarvis, your Huffington Post article show how much of a far left radical
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.720]   socialist you really are.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   So what though?
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.640]   I mean, you're not going to take, I, good Lord, I, you know, I just mute people.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.640]   I'm not a socialist.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.640]   I'm a Hillary voter.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.640]   That's true.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.640]   If you're a socialist, you'd, you'd know what to do.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.640]   All right.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.880]   Think about Google's quarterly results here.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.880]   Wow.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.240]   Although I, I mean, I think this is a great subject and we're going to be doing this for
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:02.280]   the next eight months because I really earned nine months because I really think this is
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.600]   going to be a social media election and any candidate wants to do well.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.280]   And so where are the other yes, I think you're right, but has to do and they're not doing
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.680]   a good job of using social media and maybe not Twitter because Twitter is very, is a
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.000]   relatively narrow slice, but they've got to use Facebook.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.680]   And Facebook, I'm seeing the people and, and my son, Jake is working for Hillary in New
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.760]   Hampshire right now, by the way, and he's putting up posts and you see real people and
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.480]   you, by the way, you see young people, they don't all vote for Bernie.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.480]   They're with Hillary.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.560]   That's, I think it's also about the campaign people saying things and Hillary's account
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.480]   then retweets that and you get more of a human voice there.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.480]   It's really, yeah.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.480]   It is interesting.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.480]   Fast, right?
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.480]   Right.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.480]   Interesting.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:54.080]   I mean, I guess a demagogue would be better able to use this because he or she could use
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.880]   it unscrupulously, perhaps.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.880]   That's exactly what's been happening.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:03.560]   You boy, you were going to get in such trouble with whatever Leo even allows us to talk politics.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.480]   Let alone says things yourself.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.640]   Your audience goes berserk.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.960]   I didn't name names.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.960]   I just said a demagogue.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.120]   I didn't say who the demagogues are.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.520]   In fact, I wasn't thinking of anybody specifically.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:23.120]   I was just thinking that that is one thing that does change is, you know, I mean, Joseph
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:29.720]   Gebels was a brilliant propagandist and instrumental to the success of Adolf Hitler because he knew
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:35.400]   how to use mass media and it was, I mean, wasn't he like one of the first people to really
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.880]   use mass media effectively?
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.880]   Yes.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.720]   And importantly, is that I argue that the mass media business model has died.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:49.120]   Thus, so what's the concept of the mass dies and what we really see is a mess of mobs.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.920]   And the gross numbers for Donald Trump are not that huge, right?
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.040]   The percentage of people who are actually going to vote in this party in these states
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:01.440]   is not that gigantic overall as Nate Silver has been saying when it was a little bit lower,
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.280]   it was the same number of people who believe we didn't land on the moon or such such thing.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.440]   So the gross numbers are not big, but there's a sufficient mob, and I use that pejorative
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.520]   term in this case, to, you know, get them up and say, I'm for crews.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.480]   Now, will I call Bernie Sanders people a mob?
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:22.880]   No, but they, they behave in a way that is a small, but passionate group of people.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.840]   And part of me loves that part of me loves that you can have the mob or the people who
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.440]   disagree with you, the passionate, small, passionate group of people, the people you
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.440]   agree with.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.000]   Well, even the fact that anyone can find a community and join with that community and
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.840]   take action, that's the part of the Internet.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.720]   It leverages our strengths.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.720]   I agree.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:46.200]   But as it fits into a system that is built for two parties, it's, it's, it's, it's, we
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:52.440]   are seeing the old institutions being replaced by new structures and we don't know what to
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.440]   do with it.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.840]   So when you only have two parties and you can fight over that party in a primary system
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.840]   and you can go even farther, Trump is showing you could go to the extremes in this system
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.280]   now, in this point in the election.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.760]   And there is no party institutional structure to stop that.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.880]   They don't know what to do.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.080]   So the things that I celebrate and like about the ability to find communities and join together
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.200]   and act can also be used by, you know, demagogues.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.200]   And that's what we're seeing.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.880]   Gina, you actually analyzed Twitter all the time.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.680]   What is, do you have, can you do a think up on Trump's account?
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.680]   Crump.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.600]   You all think up is really set up to do for folks who off in so we can get access to their
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.600]   tweets.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.280]   But I mean, Trump, listen, Trump, all of candidates, tweets are public.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.760]   So we could do, we probably should do an analysis over time.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.760]   It's hard.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.760]   Like, I should, we should.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.760]   We should.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.760]   You know, it's hard.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.760]   Like, I look at follower numbers.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.800]   It's so easy to pump up your follower numbers.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.000]   And it really, it really matters more like, you know, are these people interacting?
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Are they getting retweeted?
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.280]   How many people are seeing there?
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.280]   You know, how many eggs are actually responding to them?
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.880]   Like, because, because these folks get, we did some tracking the State of the Union
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.280]   a couple of years ago.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.480]   And there's just so much spam and so much garbage.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.400]   And yeah, I think, I think, I think up could do some really interesting stuff with pruning,
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   with pruning out that stuff.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.920]   But this medium piece where we're the authors comparing the follower account numbers, I
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.000]   don't know if that's, I don't think that's valid.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.280]   I don't know if that's really, you know, of anything really that important.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.680]   You know what I'm looking at that I think is really interesting.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.000]   I'm just looking at how well the candidates understand and use the medium.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.720]   And on for instance, we were talking about how AG, AJ+ puts captions on their Facebook
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:34.680]   video because people aren't actually listening, scanning their feet with sound on.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.280]   So the audio, autoplay video will start.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.280]   So they put captions.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.680]   So in effect, you're reading it.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:45.120]   And I notice for instance, Hillary Clinton's campaign videos now on Facebook have AJ+ style
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.120]   captions.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.360]   Donald Trump's do not.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.720]   And it's that kind of savviness I would propose it's going to make a difference.
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.040]   That's the kind of thing I'm talking about.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:59.040]   And how a candidate understands the medium and uses Clinton's doing snapchats.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:03.360]   And I bet that's very effective if you're trying to get a younger audience, right?
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.600]   And if Clinton is targeting women, she's got to be on Pinterest.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.440]   She's got to be on Instagram.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.440]   Interesting.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.080]   Instagram is actually a terrible content marketing tool.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.640]   You can't even link in the captions, right?
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.320]   But people spend a lot of time on Instagram.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.960]   I actually have been spending a lot of time on Instagram.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.200]   Is she, is she have a presence on Instagram?
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.200]   I haven't noticed.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.200]   Just a question.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.200]   I'm not sure.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.200]   I'm going to look right now.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.600]   That is what that's the metric I'm most interested in.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:35.280]   Twitter is a I think Twitter is really not a mainstream yet and probably won't ever.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.200]   I was talking to somebody today who really, really knows Twitter and was arguing that
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.200]   Twitter is an elite.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.200]   That's fair.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.640]   That's what's dominating Twitter.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.800]   It's kind of it's not elite in the way we normally interpret elite, but it's just it's
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.800]   Kanye's an elite.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.800]   It's a slice.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.120]   It's media people talking to media people.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.120]   Clinton is on Instagram.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.120]   Instagram.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.280]   And her bio is doting grandmother a mom.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.280]   Same thing on Twitter.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.280]   That's great.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.280]   Oh, same on Twitter.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.280]   Okay.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.280]   Yes, they've got a problem.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.280]   Well, I think she says mom grandmother.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.280]   They're smart.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.280]   They're smart.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.280]   Yep.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.280]   And you know what?
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.280]   Maybe it isn't the candidate.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.280]   Somebody says in the chatroom, well, come on.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.280]   It's not Hillary Clinton.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.280]   It's her team.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.760]   But whoever they, but you know, of course not.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.720]   Candid, I mean, look, these people aren't tech.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.080]   And we don't expect them to be geeks.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.120]   We expect them though to be smart enough to hire the right minds.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.640]   And because that is that is a reasonable expectation for some somebody who will run the country
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.080]   that they can find and hire the right people.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.080]   Absolutely.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.080]   Right.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.200]   That's maybe more important than whether they tweet.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   Yep.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   To be honest.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:52.720]   All right, let's take a look at Google's results because they are now ladies and gentlemen,
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.760]   in a completely meaning, speaking of meaningless horse races, completely meaningless horse race,
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.560]   the most valuable company in the world.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.880]   Clipsing Apple.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.880]   Public company.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.880]   Alphabet.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:10.960]   Although Jason Calicanis pointed out on Twitter on Sunday, the Vladimir Putin really is the
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.720]   most valuable company in the world.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.160]   We just don't know the numbers.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.160]   Alphabet, right?
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.520]   Not Google.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.720]   One thing that's good though about the new alphabet structure is we I think know more
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:28.920]   about how Google did than we would have before.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.440]   There's more information, right?
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.440]   More broken out.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.440]   Yeah, they broke it out.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.360]   There's Google's earnings and then there's other bets.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:40.160]   I hadn't even made the, I thought that was funny that the other bets because Alphabet.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.400]   Oh, other bets.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.920]   Alphabet's 3.6 billion operating loss.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.920]   Just half a million in revenue.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.920]   That's amazing.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.280]   Right, I mean, that's no big surprise.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.640]   Of course, the other, the non-Google companies are losing money.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.960]   They're designed to lose money.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.960]   They're long-term moonshaws.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   They're investments.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.320]   Yeah, they're investments, exactly.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.480]   And Google's doing way well enough to cover all that.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.280]   So no one was surprised by that.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.200]   I thought it was, I didn't look deep into the report, but it sounds like other bets
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.200]   is just what they're calling everything else.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.600]   So we actually don't really know.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.480]   Oh, they didn't say like, are autonomous vehicles losing this?
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.840]   They didn't break it out that way.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.840]   Right.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.440]   That'd be pretty meaningless, actually.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.440]   Yeah, I think.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:32.840]   Google had a profitable, very profitable quarter.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.280]   Is there anything we can glean from this?
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   Let me look at it.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.440]   Mobile was mobile revenue good.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.760]   They got 21.33 billion in revenue.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:50.320]   And all but 1% of that from all but half a billion of that from the Goog.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.800]   And as you can see, quarterly revenue up, up, up, up, up.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.080]   Well you can see if you're watching video.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.360]   This is the highest it's ever been.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:05.280]   And stock prices, graph looks surprisingly similar to that.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:10.120]   This is a moment of my Apple fan friends who are always like, they would always say,
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.520]   but like Apple makes more money.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.520]   Right?
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.520]   And that can finally say.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.440]   Yeah, but Google is worth more.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:28.880]   In 18% increase in revenue year over year, income up 25, I'm sorry, the operating margins
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.240]   25% up a point, mere point.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:40.680]   They mix up gap and non-gap so that makes it very complicated to summarize this.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.640]   What I'm really curious, see they don't really break it down into remote.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.880]   I mean, mobile and stuff like that.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.680]   Which Facebook basically does.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.400]   Yeah, and we know Facebook's done very well in mobile.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.680]   But I think it's a dessert, even though you're right, it's a fairly meaningless crown.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.400]   I think it's a very well deserved crown because Google is changing the world more than Apple
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:08.840]   is, I think, and has an impact and it's recognized for the value that it brings to people.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.280]   Advertising revenue up 17%.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.320]   I wish they broke it down to mobile and desktop if they don't.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.720]   Yeah, I did too.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.720]   Okay.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:26.320]   Aggregate paid clicks, paid clicks on Google websites, paid clicks on Google is complicated.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.040]   We're talking about this on Windows Weekly about what a company reveals and what it decides
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:36.280]   to hide, what they're required to reveal and what they shareholders demand of them and
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.720]   how they bury the stuff they don't want anybody to know about.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:46.760]   I'm not sufficiently sophisticated to look at the numbers and know.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:53.960]   But the question you posed, Jeff, on your Medium post is Google Too Big to Love.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.560]   We do like the plucky upstart.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.120]   Right.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.440]   And now that it's the biggest company in the world, the most valuable company in the world,
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:09.560]   my fear is that the target on itself gets even bigger and more neon bright, especially
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.560]   in Europe, where you can just hear the people, "Well, they're the biggest company in the
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.240]   world, and they're doing this, the biggest company in the world, they're doing that,
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.000]   they're just too big."
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.880]   And so what does Google do about that?
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:28.320]   I've chronicled on this show quite a bit how I think they are making moves, good and important
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.520]   moves toward publishers, which leads to AMP, whether that's a fork or not we leave to last
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:37.120]   week, and other things that are good.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.520]   And they are trying to build new relations with publishers, and I think that's great.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.840]   I remain disappointed it's primarily aimed at Europe, which means it's primarily a lobbying
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.320]   effort, more than a product effort, but we're seeing progress there.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:55.000]   There's plenty of other industries that are equally scared of Google, automotive, health,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.080]   travel, you don't need them.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.280]   There's different ways to be scared.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.360]   So they're scared like these guys are doing such a great job, they're going to put us
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:06.280]   out of business, and they're scared like these guys are such a behemoth that their monopoly
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.960]   is going to crush us.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:12.560]   Well, obviously even if it's the first fright, you're going to claim the second fright no
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.560]   matter what.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.560]   Right.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.760]   It sounds like a lot of the fear of Google is not, they're not Microsoft.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.000]   They're not in Gulf and Devour.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.840]   Well, but here's that's where you know what made me think about the parallel though, is
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:29.840]   that Microsoft in 1988 was the largest company in the world, and EU went after them and huge,
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.680]   huge issues around Microsoft.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:37.320]   What was one of the things that Microsoft did to make itself less like cold software
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.480]   and more human?
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.160]   I know because I read the piece.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.160]   They hired Scoble.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.120]   And you got to give old Scobleizer credit for humanizing Microsoft.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.160]   And so part of my point is that not just Scoble by the way, but blogs in general.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.240]   They had a lot of they suddenly spoke authentically.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:01.120]   So I suspect this will go over like a ton of what balloons, but who is the scoble of Google?
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.120]   Matt Cots.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.960]   Oh, you're right.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:07.480]   And they trust Matt Cots to speak and to be human and well-liked.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.480]   Is that still true?
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.640]   Even with Matt on leave?
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.880]   Well, he seems to he comes on and he talks about Google and nobody's saying, hey, shut
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.880]   up.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.880]   You don't know crap.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.440]   People respect Matt.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.680]   What I'm arguing is that is that in addition to having the kind of relations that Google
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   needs to have directly with industries around the world before they get all pissed off and
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:32.560]   use all their political clout to fight Google, Google also needs to need to be more human
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.040]   and it needs to be more open.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:39.200]   And the paradox here is that Google is more scared of us than we are a bit when it comes
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.880]   to opening up and being public.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.160]   They can't afford to be the silent giant anymore.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.320]   They can't afford to be the giant black box that runs the world.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:53.080]   They have to open up and one way to do that is to enable their smart, generous, amazing
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.120]   employees to speak more, talk more.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.160]   And I think Matt is a great model for that and not everybody can do it.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.680]   I grant that.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.760]   But I think that Google has to be very aware that it's positioned as the most valuable
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.240]   company in the world, the largest company in the world, the fastest growing company in
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:13.280]   history puts them in a position where they are going to get.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:18.960]   Now even worse attention than they did before and they have to act on that.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:25.520]   Well, there's another side effect of becoming big, successful and that is people start leaving.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.440]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:35.920]   We're talking about, it's called this week in Google, but we're really talking about
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.920]   the internet.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   Anything we want to.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.920]   Try to stop.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   I tell you, just try.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.920]   Just try.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:45.800]   People were complaining that we were getting political, but I don't think that was about
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.800]   policies.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.600]   If we got political, we talk about various policy measures and who's doing what and why
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.720]   you support one candidate other.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.880]   What I was interested in is how the candidates are using modern technology to change.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.040]   Story Leo, I like this one.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.520]   Good try, not to get.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.720]   Hey, did you gather from what we just talked about who I'm supporting?
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.360]   Not Trump.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.880]   I didn't call him a demagogue.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.000]   Who thought I called him a demagogue?
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.380]   All right, all right.
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.980]   Bernie Sanders, a demagogue Leo, I'm sure.
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.240]   He's kind of demagogic.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.420]   Bernie is a progressive demagogue.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.420]   Yeah.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.420]   Yeah.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.420]   Yes.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:28.140]   He's telling the same story from the other side and you know the supporters of Bernie are
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.180]   very much like Trump supporters.
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.180]   Yes, they are.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.180]   Demographically.
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.920]   Very angry, very...
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.520]   They're disenfranchised, angry.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:43.480]   They feel like Wall Street is screwing him and only Bernie can save him.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:52.380]   This is what's very fascinating about when you get on either extreme, there's similarities.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.480]   Somebody in the chatroom says, "I'm voting for Amazon's Echo for president."
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:01.480]   Damn straight, finally, a president who will listen.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.160]   Our show today, I'm so glad to have Gina here.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.160]   Gina, I'm sorry.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.160]   No, not that.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.760]   I'm out of force of habit, Jeff and I dominate now.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.760]   No, it's okay.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.160]   It's kind of Leo, the truth is it's always been that way.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.160]   Oh.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:18.440]   Port Gita has always had to fight her way and the fans like Gina best we know.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.440]   I know.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.440]   We're just going to shut that.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:25.080]   I do stay away from politics, politics, especially because I'm an expert.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.320]   Partially because I'm not an expert.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.320]   But that's the beauty of this.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.320]   You don't have to be.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.480]   Everybody has an opinion.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.480]   I don't.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.720]   I have zero opinion about politics.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.680]   I'm just going to roll with that.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:39.840]   George Burns once said, "It's a shame that the only people know how to run this country
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:44.200]   are working in barbershops and taxi cabs."
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.160]   Gratie, our show today brought to you by Squarespace.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.000]   Oh, I love Squarespace.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.720]   I become a Squarespace born-again Squarespace fanatic.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.720]   Always liked Squarespace.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.480]   I was always impressed by the technology.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.960]   But the more I use it, the more I love Squarespace.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:08.920]   The place to create your next blog or website or portfolio or use their cover page feature.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.640]   But did you know that Squarespace is great for commerce too?
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:17.440]   They make it so easy to create a beautiful, professional online store.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:23.960]   First of all, your store is available and looks great and works great on any size screen.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:28.040]   That means whether it's a four-inch mobile phone, you got to be prepared because I bet
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:34.000]   you Apple's going to sell a lot of four-inch mobile phones come this spring versus a 55-inch
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   television.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.960]   It'll look great on either size or all sizes because it's a responsive design and their
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:43.800]   checkout on their commerce is mobile optimized.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.760]   You got to have that.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.560]   I hate a site that says, "Well, you can't buy it on our website.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.560]   Go to our mobile app."
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.600]   Or, "Why don't you have our mobile app?"
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.600]   You don't have to worry about it.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:58.000]   You can sell unlimited products, no transaction fees, all your data, your financial information,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.520]   is protected with state of the art, the latest, most modern technologies because these guys
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.520]   are geeks and they know what they're doing.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.160]   That's why a Squarespace site never goes down.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.280]   You can really trust Squarespace.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.720]   With that dashboard, you can manage your business's workflow, offer fast customer service.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:20.760]   Yes, this is all built-in process orders, send shipment notifications, handle refunds
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.920]   and seconds.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.160]   They've even written an app.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.160]   This is so cool.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.680]   Not for your customers, for you.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:32.040]   You can, on iOS or Android, fulfill orders, the Squarespace Commerce app.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.880]   Manage product inventory.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:38.160]   You can resolve customer issues on the go.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.120]   Look, you've got to power your business with Squarespace Commerce.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:46.640]   The only platform that lets you create, manage and brand your store in a way that is beautiful,
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.040]   that reflects your style, that looks like it's yours.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:55.400]   Not some bland third-party, separate shopping cart somewhere out there.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.040]   You've got a basic plan.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.560]   It's very affordable and advanced plan with features for your growing business.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.680]   And of course, as always, you get a free domain name with an annual purchase.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.160]   This would be a great place to start a business.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.920]   Your site will look like it's been designed by a pro because it has.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.920]   It has.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.640]   The best engineers, the best designers.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:17.040]   And if you want to get geeky, you can play with it to your heart's content and a great
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.040]   support too.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:22.360]   I can go on and on, but look, try it right now for free.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.480]   Squarespace.com, just use a promo code twig.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.280]   That way you let them know you listen and you'll get 10% off.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.400]   Squarespace, you should.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.240]   You really should.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.240]   How serious is this?
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.240]   And meet Seagal.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.080]   Seagal is retiring.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.080]   Why?
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.080]   Why you meet?
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.080]   Why?
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.080]   He's joining.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.680]   I mean, you're seeing this across the board in the tech sector and I think it's a sign
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.200]   of a mature industry.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.920]   He's joining a number of other executives who decided, you know, I have enough money now.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.680]   I've accomplished a hell of a lot.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.200]   Yeah, is that it?
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.280]   It's like 15 years made a lot of money, like didn't spend a lot of time with my family.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:09.120]   I'm timed for me to go live my life now and let the youngins take over.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.360]   Is that is that what this is about?
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.360]   You think?
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.360]   I feel so bad.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.360]   I love this guy.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.360]   He was there.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.360]   He was their wizard of search, right?
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:22.120]   But I think it's quite significant that that the person who takes over is artificial intelligence
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.840]   and they're merging the artificial intelligence and search divisions.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.720]   That's extremely significant in my view.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:33.320]   That says the future of search is understanding what you need before you need it.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:39.560]   John Gendreah is taking his place.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:43.240]   Artificial intelligence used to be the whipping boy, right, Gina?
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.880]   Never failed computer science theories.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.520]   Yes.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.200]   That'll never work.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.960]   When did it become the thing?
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.600]   It's the vision of CS, right?
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.640]   It's fusion, not fission.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.280]   It's, I mean, it's, we got fission.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.280]   That's easy.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.280]   That's true.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.160]   Unfortunately, it's the fusion.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.160]   That's hard.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:09.320]   Yeah, it's the kind of the pipe, it was the pipe dream.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.480]   And all of a sudden now it's everywhere.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.640]   Did we just have a breakthrough at some point?
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.640]   Did we just lower expectations?
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.560]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.640]   Or decide that the applications of it were smaller and modular.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.800]   I mean, so give me.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.600]   I think we changed the definition is what we did.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.600]   We just machine learning.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.520]   It's not machine learning.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:34.520]   We thought artificial intelligence was an attempt to make a computer think like humans.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.520]   Right.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.440]   And everybody's kind of agreed net that that's a silly goal.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:45.600]   But learning, you're right, smart, get machines that get smarter that do a better job.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.200]   Would you call Google now artificial intelligence?
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.080]   Well, yeah, I was just going to ask you that.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.440]   So like, give me an example of artificial intelligence that we use on a day to day basis.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.280]   Is Google search artificial intelligence?
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.080]   Like you could argue that it is.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:01.680]   I mean, Google's crawlers and index constantly learning and connecting concepts and has an
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.360]   idea of what concepts are, the knowledge graph and all that.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:08.440]   Is that AI like the way that we conceived it years and years ago?
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.960]   No, self driving cars, self driving cars.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.320]   You know what it is as it's a continuum.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:21.560]   So search when it was first constituted was clearly a mechanical process.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.720]   It was very obviously you could see the gears working.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:29.680]   But as computers have gotten faster, they're not getting smarter.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.520]   That's a misnomer.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.640]   But they're getting and they're better design and they're more and they're accumulating
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.960]   knowledge and we are doing better with taking the information, the big data that we've now
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.520]   gather all the time and applying algorithms to it.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:47.040]   So it looks smarter.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.280]   But I would submit it's the same gears.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.320]   They're just turning faster with more information, right?
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.240]   Do you know you're a programmer?
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.960]   That's why I ask you.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.120]   Lots more lots more information.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.920]   Yeah, big data.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.640]   Look at think up is think up artificial intelligence?
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.640]   No, not at all.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.920]   It's a bunch of algorithms, a bunch of rules and it's a bunch of data.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.920]   And a bunch of data.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.560]   Rules applied to a bunch of data.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:16.200]   So it's like you say, you know, if these patterns emerge in the data, then then do this.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.040]   I know you do that over and over and over again.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.640]   It's no accident that you call it think up, is it?
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.800]   Well, you were always available.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:32.160]   No, no, but I, well, it might have been unconscious.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.920]   But but but that's the implication.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.360]   They're thinking about the data.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.880]   This is the is that the machine learning the weird landscapes?
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.600]   Yeah, these are the weird landscapes created.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.840]   Jason just said, it freaked me out.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.840]   That's cool.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.840]   Oh, wow.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:55.200]   This is art created from the neural network learning stuff.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.520]   By the way, I don't, I don't think there's any evidence that neural networks have done.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:03.880]   Although, well, I just know I take it back because it seems trivial.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:10.000]   But and this is, of course, where AI first emerges in the most trivial uses.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:17.080]   But now on iPhones and Android somewhat, but mostly on iPhones, you see a slew of apps
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:23.080]   that recognize your face and modify it, like Snapchat's thing.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:29.080]   And it's because of the improvement of facial recognition algorithms over time, thanks to
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:33.720]   neural networks, applied to massive amounts of data.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.720]   Mm hmm.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:40.200]   Plus biometric security like Microsoft's.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.200]   Hello.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.800]   Yeah, that's yeah, that's face recognition.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.800]   Sure.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.040]   That's a form of face recognition is not artificial intelligence.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.040]   That's easy.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.520]   How far apart your eyes are?
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.880]   It's it's measuring the face.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.520]   It's not hard about recognizing the same person from current age back to birth.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.600]   It's a little harder.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:05.280]   The hardest still is to look at a ton of faces and pick and say and identify their names.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.400]   That's not what's going on in biometrics.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:12.240]   Biometrics is recording your face matching what's presented to it to those measurements.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.240]   That's easy.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.240]   Right?
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.240]   That's easy.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.600]   That's not face recognition.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:22.000]   Face recognition is naming all the people in a crowd.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.440]   That's hard.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:29.880]   Although it's kind of an application of the same algorithm, I guess.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.560]   Gina, you know better than I.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.680]   It's all about the data, for sure.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.680]   Data is the key, isn't it?
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.680]   It's rules plus the data.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:38.680]   It's the algorithms plus the data.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.240]   Are the algorithms better?
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:47.400]   The failed AI algorithms of by the way, Marvin Minsky passed away this past week.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.960]   You know, speaking of AI.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.480]   Speaking of AI.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.520]   I wonder, you know, boy, I'm sad.
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:43:00.880]   I never, I didn't get to talk to him because he was the father of AI in many ways.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.040]   And I would be very curious.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.080]   He was co-founder of MIT's AI Lab.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:09.040]   I'll be very curious what he thinks of modern AI.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.520]   You know, whether he thinks we did.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.080]   Is this AI the AI he was thinking of?
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.720]   Marvin Minsky invented the first head-mounted graphical display.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.200]   Google Glass precursor.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.000]   It's his fault.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.120]   He developed logo with Seymour Pappert.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:35.880]   In 1951, 1951, he built the first randomly wired neural network learning machine.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.360]   Nice name too, Snark.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.800]   Snark.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.720]   So it's kind of timely.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:51.000]   We should have spent more time trying to get him on.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:58.600]   But here he is just passed away, sad to say, January 24th.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:04.320]   And I'm somebody, I hope somebody interviewed him about the current state of...
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.320]   Somebody had to have, right?
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.680]   Yeah, what he thought of it.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.440]   Because that's not, I don't think it's his AI.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.200]   I don't think it's the AI he envisioned.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.360]   But I might be wrong.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:19.080]   The new head of Search at Google says that the business intelligence told fortune recently
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.960]   that I think computers are remarkably dumb.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.960]   The computer is like a four-year-old child.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.960]   Right.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:29.600]   And so I think that there's an arm of this world that says, "Relax those who fear it's
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.600]   going to take over the world.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.400]   It's not going to take over the world."
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:39.000]   A good friend of mine today said it was amazing the idea that God made us in his image and
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.280]   we're making a computer in our image.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.360]   This is our effort to think that we can make something that's like us.
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.200]   But that may not be the most powerful thing there is.
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.720]   It's a machine.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:48.720]   A machine.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.000]   So really, Gina, does this sound correct?
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.960]   It's not that the machines are so much more powerful.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.960]   Of course they are.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.360]   But it's more that the data, there's so much more data.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.480]   I mean, a computer is like a four-year-old child.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:04.040]   I feel like it gives a computer a little too much credit because four-year-olds are
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.040]   actually really smart.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.040]   Yeah, smart.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.520]   But they don't have a lot of data because they haven't been alive for long enough.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.520]   Well said, Gina.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.520]   Well said.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:15.600]   I mean, I don't mean to like, but I mean, I spent a lot of time around three and four-year-olds
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.720]   and they're super smart.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:21.880]   We tell them one thing, they connect ideas very quickly faster than I think that a computer.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.880]   Right?
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:27.160]   So I mean, you know, but on the other hand, computers can calculate things.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.640]   Computers are just better at certain things than humans are.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.440]   But humans are certainly better at things that computers aren't.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.320]   So that's interesting.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.680]   So I would say the four-year-old isn't actually that dumb.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:38.680]   Just lacks--
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.680]   Short on data.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.680]   Life experience, yes.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.920]   Do you see whether a computer can go potty?
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:49.240]   In a way, it's big data and the ability to go through a lot of big data.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:53.720]   They're more than intelligence that we're talking about here.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:58.840]   Somebody mentioned this earlier today in the chairman I had looked it up.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.480]   This was among the other things we learned about the NSA.
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:10.960]   Although this is pre Snowden, was a program called Optic Nerve in which the British GCHQ
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:16.880]   was intercepting Yahoo webcam images in bulk.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.880]   And the reason--
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.880]   This is between 2008 and 2010.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:23.600]   I can't make fun of the people who put the damn tape over their webcam anymore.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:27.880]   No, because what they were doing is collecting big data.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.440]   They didn't care about those pictures.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.480]   They weren't trying to find crooks in those pictures.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:36.200]   They were trying to generate-- Oh, I guess this is Edward Snowden.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.200]   All right.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.200]   This is from Edward Snowden's trove of documents.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:44.600]   They were trying to generate giant databases to improve image recognition.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:52.400]   The program Optic Nerve saved one image every five minutes from millions of Yahoo chat users'
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.000]   feeds.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.840]   They said they only got one image every five minutes, partly to comply with human rights
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:06.560]   legislation but also to avoid overloading their servers.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:11.840]   In this database, which I'm willing to bet is still in use is really the beginning of
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:12.840]   this.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.640]   So it's just raw data.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:18.600]   That's actually been the theory of mine for a long time about the wireless wiretapping that
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:19.600]   was going on.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:20.600]   It's about the data.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.640]   It was about the data and about finding anomalies more than finding the crook.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:30.160]   I don't know that, but I just have a feeling that that was the effort.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:39.360]   One document in the cache of documents from the GCHQ, the British spy agency, unfortunately,
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:44.160]   it would appear a surprising number of people use webcam conversations to show intimate parts
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.280]   of their body to the other person.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:52.160]   Also, the fact that the Yahoo software allows more than one person to view a webcam stream
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:56.680]   without necessarily sending a reciprocal stream means it appears sometimes to be used for
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.680]   broadcasting pornography.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:07.120]   The desirable nudity was in 3% to 11% of the webcam harvest.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.240]   Well, how do they define desirable?
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.120]   I would generally define nudity as desirable.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:14.800]   But that's what's wrong with spies.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.960]   Not for facial recognition.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.760]   They're making war and not love, Jeff.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:23.160]   Too much flesh confuses the algorithm, right?
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.720]   It is possible to handle and display undesirable images.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.920]   And is no perfect ability to sense the material, which may be offensive, but users who may
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:36.160]   be uncomfortable about such material are advised not to open them.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.160]   Jolly good.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.360]   Don't go in there.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.360]   There's nudity ahead.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.360]   All right.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.360]   That's right, Dr. John Gendreya.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.360]   Gendreya.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.840]   Nice Italian guy.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.640]   New VP or?
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.040]   I think his background is very interesting.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:59.840]   How many of that came from?
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:04.400]   He was a telbency chief technologist at Netscape.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.400]   Oh, 99.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:09.560]   So that was when the browser came out in 94 Netscape.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.560]   CTO tell me.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.480]   Oh, they got him in the tell me acquisition.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.480]   Well, no, that was was that acquired by Microsoft in 2000.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.480]   Oh, that's right.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.480]   Microsoft, but tell me.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.480]   He had a stint of general magic.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.480]   Oh, yes.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.480]   Everybody.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:24.480]   You know what?
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:34.800]   You find one source, one beginning, one blue Nile source for all of the Silicon Valley, most
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.840]   interesting stuff, Silicon Valley is general magic.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.080]   Well, and Stanford research institute.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:41.720]   And of course, it's kind of the child.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.200]   All right.
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:48.240]   So business insider on his LinkedIn profile, one of his colleagues describes it this way.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:51.600]   There are three types of engineers, those who wanted to work for JG, those who wanted
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:56.480]   to work with JG and those who wanted to be JG as far reaching vision with the ability
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.880]   to go very deep, very quickly.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:03.640]   So I'm sorry we're losing single, but it sounds like, of course, Google is putting
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.800]   somebody in charge who's good.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:06.800]   Amazing.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:11.440]   And at an AI researcher, or she also joined the company after after Google bought his
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.640]   company meta web, which was the basis of knowledge graph.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.640]   Oh, wow.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.120]   That's how he's qualified.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.120]   All right.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.120]   We'll give him a pass.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.120]   Give him a few weeks.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.120]   Yeah, whatever.
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.720]   Look at my passing the Foyo comment.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:29.600]   I would guess I'm not in the inner circle here, but I would guess that there are people
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.640]   within Silicon Valley are well known because they've been to those places and are highly
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.200]   regarded.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:39.840]   And they're just they're the decks that the cards in the deck that you want to add to
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.280]   your collection.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.000]   Interesting.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.920]   General magic was created by Bill Atkinson, who was at Apple.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:59.040]   He did he was the genius behind the Macintosh internal routines, the quick draw on the ROMs.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:05.240]   And in fact, it was a bunch of Apple people that went over there folded in 2002, but boy,
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:10.600]   a lot of people got their start or worked there at some time, including Gienaondraia,
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:19.000]   Gienaondra, Gienaondraia, Gienaondraia, we have to learn how to pronounce his name.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.720]   John Andrea, I think is probably how.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:22.720]   John Andrea.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:26.040]   Sorry, probably saying.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.440]   Ben John's probably illegal.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.840]   What a surprise.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:33.200]   I'm a kind of critical of Ben John along.
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:39.800]   This is T-Mobile's very popular with its customer plan not to count against you video
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.400]   you watch on Netflix and other streaming services.
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:45.840]   YouTube is not part of Ben John alas.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.800]   And there's I mean, why wouldn't subscribers like it?
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:53.800]   But a new study from Stanford University says it violates net neutrality and is likely,
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.120]   in fact, because of that illegal.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:01.760]   Barbara Van Schweik, the law professor who authored the study said T-Mobile's Ben John
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.360]   is aptly named.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:07.920]   It feels good in the short term, but harm's consumers in the long run.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.080]   I've got to get a hangover.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:11.600]   I'm getting some weight.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:17.000]   The program limits user choice, distorts competition, stifles innovation and harms free speech
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.280]   on the internet.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:23.640]   If more ISPs offered similar programs, these harms will only get worse.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.760]   This was always our criticism.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:31.440]   It puts T-Mobile in a position to decide who wins and loses on the internet.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:35.440]   For instance, Ben John supports Vivo TV for watching music videos, but doesn't make
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.240]   YouTube or Vimeo available.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.640]   It supports Ustream.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:43.520]   Fortunately, we use Ustream for live streaming video.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:44.920]   But that's an interesting point.
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:49.680]   If you watch Twitch, you're now incentive to choose the Ustream feed instead of the
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:54.680]   big gravity feed or the Twitch feed or the, and those companies are disadvantaged.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.480]   It doesn't support MirCap.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.040]   It doesn't support Periscope.
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.920]   And now a T-Mobile says, "Oh, anybody can sign up.
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:01.920]   It's easy."
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:06.800]   He also says, "Technical requirements are more complicated than T-Mobile claims and that the
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:13.200]   carrier is tilting the player field to the advantage of larger firms."
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:18.680]   Ben John allows some providers to join easily, creates lasting barriers for others, especially
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.880]   small players, non-commercial providers and startups.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:25.280]   And that's the problem right there.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:29.280]   It rewards the incumbents and its stifles innovation.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:34.280]   Yep.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.560]   Sorry John Ledger.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:42.000]   Starring.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   Project Skybender.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:49.920]   So we knew that Loon, the Bloon project, the Google was putting balloons up in the stratosphere
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:54.000]   to provide internet access wirelessly everywhere.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.480]   Elon Musk mentioned that he wants to launch hundreds of low-Earth orbit satellites to
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.600]   do the same thing.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:04.280]   Facebook was playing with drones to do the same thing for internet.org.
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:12.360]   Now there's Project Skybender, Google's secretive 5G internet drone test.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:16.440]   Appropriately enough tested near area 51.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:24.040]   It's at New Mexico's spaceport authority and it's using millimeter wave, potentially 40
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.440]   times faster than 4G.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.800]   This is the area founder who started...
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.920]   Oh yeah, he's got a new one, right?
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:31.920]   Starry.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:32.920]   Starry.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.920]   You've got two millimeter wave.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:38.160]   Yeah, starry is commercial though.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:43.800]   And a number of people are wondering about that.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.800]   Yes.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.400]   Whether it's viable or not.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.200]   Is he using drones?
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:52.400]   They're going to trial it in Boston this summer.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:56.000]   So starry is a 1 gigabit internet service.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.120]   You may remember, Ariel, that was the crazy plan to have dime-sized antennas.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.600]   Robert Murdoch behind it.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:08.920]   Dimesized antennas that would allow you to watch TV over the air TV on your iPad from
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.520]   New York City, even if you weren't in New York City.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:17.000]   The Supreme Court put them out of business after lawsuits from the networks who thought
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.480]   that was a very bad idea.
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:21.280]   So this is his new project.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.480]   Starry, you have to put an outside antenna.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:28.520]   Yeah, it's not the same antenna technology.
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:31.560]   The problem is millimeter wave is not known to go a long way.
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:40.000]   And because it's high frequency, it gets stymied by anything in the way, including rain.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:47.320]   It's fast though.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:50.360]   There's the Starry beam radio that you would...
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:52.680]   Oh my God, it's like a cell tower.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.680]   It's huge.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.680]   Oh yeah.
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:58.680]   You have to put that in your house.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:00.440]   Okay.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:13.360]   I hope we don't see a lot of those in the air.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:14.360]   Anything else?
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.720]   What else are you guys interested in?
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:17.520]   Don't let me dominate the conversation.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:20.280]   Anything that piques your interest.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:24.520]   How about...
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.520]   Podcasts in Google Play?
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:27.160]   I was just looking at that one.
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.480]   I really want to see Google go crazy with podcasts.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.040]   And Leo, I'm really interested to hear what you think.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:36.080]   We've known about this for some time.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.080]   We were NDA'd.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.280]   It turns out.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:44.160]   So when Lisa signs an NDA, one of the things she makes sure not to do is tell me anything.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.800]   She's smart.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:48.880]   So wait, so you were NDA'd?
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:49.880]   Is the NDA up?
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:50.880]   At this point, I don't know.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:54.280]   Well, it is now because this has been published publicly everywhere.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.280]   So...
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.280]   Okay.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:00.800]   You know, that's one of the deals with NDA's is you can only reveal stuff that's commonly
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:07.080]   known since I know nothing except that we had been working with them.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:11.240]   Why hasn't Google started a massive podcast directory?
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:17.280]   Why hasn't it done transcripts of every single podcast and made them searchable and linkable?
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:20.280]   This is kind of my biggest complaint about podcasts.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:25.280]   It's just that it's hard to find certain places where people are talking about things.
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:29.520]   I feel like this is a job that Google could do easily with the suite of tools they already
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.520]   have.
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:33.680]   Well, it's kind of what they're doing, right?
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:40.120]   I guess you'd have to be a Play subscriber as opposed to just a user of Google search.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:41.880]   I spent lots of money on Play.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.880]   Yeah, I love Play.
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:47.880]   So, we as a company love Play now.
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:49.800]   We're very happy about this.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.480]   But we're on Spotify.
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:52.480]   It's very similar.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:58.280]   You know, all these guys are doing this because they're really afraid of being in the thrall
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:01.080]   of the music industry because they could pull the plug at any time.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:04.880]   It's just like Netflix creating its own content.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:08.360]   Audible's been talking to podcasters and other content creators.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.280]   I think they've hired some people from PBS.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:13.280]   Well, they hired some major content executives too.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:16.080]   But that's it.
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:17.080]   That's it.
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.080]   And not PBS.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:21.800]   Yet another podcast store or directory or place to subscribe.
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:23.680]   Like, I want to see more stuff.
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.400]   I want to listen to a podcast.
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:27.680]   I want the link that they're talking about.
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:28.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:29.760]   Come up and auto load.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.760]   I want transcripts.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.640]   I want the ability to annotate, to share.
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:36.400]   I want where I've listened up to to sync across all my devices.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:40.320]   I want to know what episodes I've listened to and I've heard to tell me automatically,
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.320]   like, what's next?
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.720]   I want to deep link into a podcast.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.720]   Yeah, deep link into a podcast.
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:50.240]   If when I express interest, I want the Google now for like, I was interested in, in Ronda
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:53.800]   Rousey, like here are the top five episodes from all these different shows that like I
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:57.760]   should listen to or whatever, you know, like, like an now on tap featured be awesome.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:02.440]   Like this is a show I should listen to because this is the topic of the show or this is the
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:05.000]   thing that the, you know, I think people make such good points.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.800]   There's such great moments and so many different shows, but there's just so much out there.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:12.160]   And I also think there's a lot of room for innovation in clients as well.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:14.720]   You know, I love pocket casts and they do a great job.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:19.080]   I still, I still find myself like this feeling like this could be so much easier.
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:22.800]   And it's interesting that Google hasn't, you know, really tried yet.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:26.360]   So I'm one, is this it or is this, I assume this is just like Google play is going to
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:29.520]   list podcasts and you can subscribe to them there just like music.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:33.280]   And it would be similar to iTunes offering.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.720]   I think from the description, you're right.
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:36.720]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:39.800]   You know, you've just invented a company you should start.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.560]   We'll call it ODO.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.960]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.520]   Well, that worked out.
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:45.520]   Okay, though, right?
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:47.760]   Well, we'll see where Twitter lens.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:50.160]   Yeah, maybe it's unknown.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:56.160]   ODO was F Williams's company before he pivoted dramatically into, and he did podcast.
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:59.920]   ODO was right about the same time as I was starting up in Twit.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.480]   And I was very, we were on the ODO directory.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.320]   That's right.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.320]   So I don't have it yet.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.320]   It's 6.3.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.840]   I only have 6.2.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.720]   So when you get your update, you can see.
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.560]   So I can't, I'm only basing this somewhat.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:18.920]   Others have published online because Lisa won't show me.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.280]   But I guess our stuff will be there.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:27.520]   I guess the reason that we are familiar with it is because they wanted a file and stuff
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.320]   for testing and so forth.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.320]   No doubt.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:37.800]   You want to be your profligate profligate.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.480]   That's a nice way to put it.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:42.600]   Permiscuous would be another way.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:48.480]   Well, we'll look for it and, you know, you should be getting the update pretty soon.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.480]   It's rolling out slowly.
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.480]   You know, I've been waiting for this update on Hangouts and I still haven't got it.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.360]   I'm very nervous about what Google's going to do with Hangouts.
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:02.680]   They've apparently decided to move everybody to messages, the messaging, you know, for SMS.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:07.240]   I'm on Google Fi too, which means I'd probably be forced to sooner than others, but I still
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.520]   don't have the new Hangouts.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.160]   Over the last week, I've noticed some drops and messages on my Hangouts.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.840]   Well, I tried to change my default to messenger as Google had recommended.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.840]   Yeah.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.160]   And all the text continue to go to Hangouts.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.600]   So I don't know what's wrong.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.160]   It's going to be a rocky, a bumpy ride, I think.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:35.400]   This is probably preparatory to either phasing out Hangouts or constraining it to be what
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:43.360]   it was kind of originally, which is for video calls and Hangouts, right?
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:50.320]   And then making messages, more of a messaging platform to compete with Facebook messenger
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:55.080]   and WhatsApp and, you know, telegram and all that stuff.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.720]   Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.240]   I love Gazelle.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.840]   And it's just in time for the slew of new phones and devices coming.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.640]   Of course, Mobile World Congress is coming coming up.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.960]   We're going to learn about the Galaxy S7 on February 21st.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.160]   Yes, we'll broadcast that live.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.520]   And of course, you know what that means.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:16.760]   As soon as the new one comes out, your old one starts losing value.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:22.480]   So now today is the time to go to Gazelle.com and get the quote for what your old device
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.480]   is worth and lock it in.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.800]   They don't lock you in.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.520]   You lock them in for 30 days.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:32.800]   They promise you they will pay you at least that much for 30 days.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:37.280]   Just go to Gazelle.com, find your device, get an instant quote, shipping is free.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:43.280]   They'll send you a box, payment is fast, and they buy all sorts of stuff.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.200]   Now here's the interesting thing.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.760]   They also sell.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:52.200]   So if you're looking to buy a certified pre-owned device, turns out just kind of a side effect
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.200]   of their business.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:03:01.240]   A good number of nice iPhones to choose from, including the iPhone 6s and the 6s plus iPads
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.440]   of all varieties, even Samsung Galaxy phones.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.080]   Every device Gazelle sells is fully inspected back by a 30 day return policy.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:13.520]   And of course, even though they work in all the major carriers, they are sold without
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:16.200]   carrier contract, Gazelle.com.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:21.680]   They're not providing financing, too, on all devices.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:22.920]   This is a firm.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.920]   You're probably familiar with this company.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.800]   You just give them some very simple information.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:31.040]   You get instantly approved and you pay off in three, six or 12 months.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.320]   This is a nice way to do it.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:34.320]   Easy monthly payments.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.520]   They'll set it up that you can do it with check, but you can also use bank transfer,
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.920]   wireless transfers, or a debit card.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.520]   Just select financing with a firm at checkout.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.840]   They are now doing a 12 month warranty as well.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:51.200]   So you have a 30 day return policy, but you can also buy a one year warranty on cell
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.800]   phones and iPads.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.840]   This is, they're using assurance solutions that covers water damage, cracked screens,
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:02.720]   which I had this for my kids, hardware defects and more.
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.120]   And now they've got 24/7 help around the clock help to process claims and return your device
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.600]   fast.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:11.920]   Don't miss out on getting the best value on certified pre-owned devices Gazelle.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.480]   They're just getting better and better and better all the time.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.280]   And thanks to Gazelle, so are your devices.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:25.480]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle.com.
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:29.040]   We're talking about the internet, the Google, the Facebook, Gina, Tarpani.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.720]   I know you only have a few more minutes.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.720]   Right?
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.280]   I can go about, yeah, I can go about 10 more minutes.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.280]   Babysitters going home.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.720]   Yeah, I got a dinner to get to.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.720]   Oh, good.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.720]   That's better.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.720]   That's better.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.720]   I like that.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.120]   Jeff Jarvis is also here from the City University of New York.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.120]   I got nothing to do.
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.120]   I got nowhere to go.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.600]   I'm just going to be in that kind.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.200]   You and I just gas on and on.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.200]   I like this.
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:00.400]   Google's giving free gigabyte internet to public housing residents.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.400]   That is nice.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.920]   Somebody impacted on their calls, but it's the right thing to do.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:04.920]   Is it?
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.680]   I mean, I guess they have to wire it up and stuff.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.680]   This is expensive.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:16.640]   Here's a picture of the president with Eric Schmidt as part of this.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.800]   Alphabet, during the call on Monday, Alphabet's CFO.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.960]   It's so hard to get used to calling him Alphabet.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.840]   Told investors that even though it's expensive to put that fiber service in, they're working
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:31.960]   with the Obama Housing Department to set up public housing residents with gigabit connections
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:32.960]   free of charge.
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:41.120]   You know, that's a great way to get people jobs to get back in the world to help kids
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.320]   learn.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.000]   That's how you break the cycle of poverty is just stuff like that.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.080]   That makes a huge, huge difference.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:52.880]   So while T-Mobile is blocking internet access Google between their drones and their public
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.480]   housing projects, we're trying to get more people online.
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.640]   And then of course, this is in Google's interest as well.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:00.520]   The more people that are online, the more Google benefits.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:03.040]   But this is a win-win for everybody.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.160]   It's not the first time they've been in the White House.
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:12.760]   In January, they were there when the government announced $4 billion budget for autonomous
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.760]   vehicles.
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:17.000]   One hand washes the other.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.160]   No, I think it's just, I do think that's playing fair.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:26.120]   That's the way to do it.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:29.200]   This one's a little weird.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:33.280]   Apple until recently when you searched for abortion was pointing you towards adoption
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:37.880]   sites, apparently a bug, not intentionally.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:43.160]   Apple is pointing extremist searches towards anti-radicalization websites.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.200]   I think that may just be in the UK.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.000]   This is intentional in the UK.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.480]   It's a pilot scheme.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:57.880]   Facebook and Twitter and Google are under, of course, the microscope because of widespread
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:06.240]   use by extremists to radicalize people and to organize and to even plan attacks.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.080]   Everyone like this is a pilot program.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:15.520]   They want to make sure that counter radicalization videos are more discoverable on YouTube and
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:24.680]   even offered when people search for things like, "Well, I don't even want to say hummus."
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.680]   That's not true.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.400]   I made that up.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:34.320]   Not the story, just the word hummus.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:39.240]   This is interesting from Jessica Lesson at the information I subscribed so I was able
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.920]   to read it.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:44.640]   Some of you may have seen synopsis and other journals.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.280]   In fact, did you like this?
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:50.520]   I'm going to go back.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:56.440]   The link that you just used came from a private email sent to Business Insider and has already
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:59.720]   been used to view the full text of the article.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:00.720]   If you are a subscriber, please.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.720]   I click on it.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.720]   I've run the rundown.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:04.720]   Please log in.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:08.360]   So hide my login because I, of course, pay the 400.
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.840]   I want to support these kinds of initiatives.
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.080]   I think the information is fantastic.
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:20.000]   Does that mean I can't show the article?
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.240]   The video you're watching has been stolen from this article.
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:27.320]   The Mirror of Friday has great contacts inside Google.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:34.440]   This matches a little bit what I think Apple is doing with the iPhone as well.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:40.040]   Google is no longer going to make it, you know, kind of the LG makes the phone or Huawei
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:44.400]   or HTC, under strict guidance from Google.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:50.240]   Apparently these companies set up inside of Google when they're making the Nexus 6P.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.960]   They set up inside Google.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:56.960]   So it is kind of a very tight collaboration, but it's apparently going to go move.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:02.840]   In fact, in the direction of Apple-style manufacturer, Google designs and manufactures
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:08.840]   it with people like Foxconn or maybe takes LG and Samsung and turns them into Foxconn
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.160]   like partners.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.640]   And so this is good.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.840]   So how is that different than what they do now?
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:20.480]   They're just going to more tightly be involved with the hardware.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.480]   That's a good question.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:24.400]   I mean, I don't know if you make the sick, if Huawei makes the 6P, how much?
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:27.120]   I mean, at least Huawei's name is on it.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:30.200]   We know that it's a Huawei device.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.560]   So that wouldn't be the case in future.
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.920]   Although it wouldn't be hard to find out.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.480]   We know Foxconn, for instance, makes iPhones.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.480]   Right.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:41.960]   But it says Huawei right at the bottom of this 6P.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.480]   I think that probably is to reassure people that, oh, well, it's a, you know.
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.800]   Yeah, I mean, I guess the way this, I imagine the way that this works is that these companies
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.280]   kind of pitch Google on various handset designs.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.880]   And Google chooses one and then works with them.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:01.200]   And so the way that this new method would go is that Google actually just designs everything
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.200]   in house.
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:03.200]   Yeah.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.360]   I love that.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:05.360]   I love that.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.800]   I mean, I always look to the Nexus line as like the definitive reference phone, Google's
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:15.160]   Google's idea of like the ideal scenario for Android, right?
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:18.080]   And so I want the best that the Google can come out with.
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:22.400]   And I don't want to feel like, well, Huawei's, you know, not so great or LG's, you know,
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:27.400]   whatever, I, I wanted to be the definitive best up to date Android, you know, experience
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.400]   hardware experience.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.880]   So I love that.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:35.000]   It makes me a little sad about Motorola because I'm sure one of the reasons Google divested
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.160]   Motorola is because they wanted to make sure that companies that were making Android wouldn't
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.560]   feel like they were competing like or Motorola had some special inside information.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.240]   They were always extremely careful to do that.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:52.520]   But if you're going to make your own phones, don't you wish you had Motorola back?
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.840]   I think right.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.000]   Well, everything else that included.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:02.040]   Well, what, what else did it include that they didn't want?
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.320]   Making all kinds of other phones.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.320]   That's the problem.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:07.640]   For Motorola to be a viable business, it had to make a large range of.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.640]   Okay.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.840]   If all you want to make is the reference.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:11.840]   All right.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:12.840]   You're right.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:13.840]   But still that expert.
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.840]   What does that?
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:15.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.840]   True.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.880]   What does that do to Android partners?
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:22.760]   Do they get, you know, Google then is fully a competitor?
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.760]   Right.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.760]   Well, that's us.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:25.760]   Yes.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:26.760]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:28.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:36.120]   I want this mirror, Max Braun, Google engineer, built a smart mirror.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:40.080]   They had these on the cruise ship I was on, except it's for the robot bartenders.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:44.400]   It was like a one way mirror device that would project information on the mirror about what
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.280]   drink was being made.
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:51.120]   But in his bathroom, it gives you weather and news and the time and date.
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.120]   Isn't that cool?
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.560]   A smart connected mirror.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.760]   I would like to get the plans for this, Max.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:01.680]   He's got like an Amazon fire stick plugged in with an APK.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.200]   Like he compiled an APK and then, and he bought the display.
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.200]   It's a really, it's really cool.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.920]   The project, although I have, I got to tell you, like I have a smart mirror.
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.920]   It's my phone.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:10.920]   It's not a mirror.
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.720]   It's just like the home screen of my phone.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:13.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.600]   It's kind of like, do I really need a smart bathroom mirror?
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.840]   No, but it's pretty cool that he was able to achieve it.
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.840]   I want one.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:26.920]   And my mirror fogs up every morning.
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:27.920]   That's true.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.920]   This would not be good if a fog that.
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:33.680]   No, but I think this is an example of displays you might see all over the house, which are
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:38.120]   it's kind of almost augmented reality on a display.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:41.760]   So the display is doing what it does, but there's an overlay that gives you additional
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.760]   information.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:47.680]   This new headlines all over my house would really would would stress me out, but the
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:49.520]   weather and time is great.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.520]   Right.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:54.880]   He does say you don't want to actually look inside because right there, the plants right
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:55.880]   there.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:56.880]   I love it.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.160]   Board from China that converts anything in the universe to a 40 pin display cable, only
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.680]   using it for HDMI.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:05.400]   These wires seem excessive.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:10.200]   Green LED glows green again with the wires.
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.200]   And what is this?
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.200]   Can't even.
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:22.360]   I, by the way, I think this is Max's own annotation, but it's based on an Android TV
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.920]   fire stick, a fire TV stick.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:24.920]   That's cool.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:26.720]   Amazon, I should say.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.360]   That's really cool.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.360]   I like this kind of stuff.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.760]   Gina, I know we got to let you go.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.760]   I hate to do it.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:34.760]   Sorry about that.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.720]   Do you want to give us a quick tip?
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.880]   Uh, yeah, let's let's do that.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.360]   Oh, man, I can't believe I'm going back to politics, but if you search for a presidential
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:47.880]   candidate and you want to know how they stand on the various issues, you can, uh, Google
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:51.640]   is now incorporated this into their knowledge graph right into the search results.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:57.360]   So say if you search for Hillary Clinton issue stances, uh, you will find out what all the
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.720]   things she said about immigration and guns and economics and healthcare.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:05.960]   Uh, and you can do that for any presidential candidate and you can also search by issue.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:10.200]   So you can say Donald Donald Trump immigration and you'll see what, you know, hit the various
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:15.000]   quotes, uh, things that he said, his dances on the issues, civil liberties, foreign policy.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   I'm glad they did this.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.120]   I thought that this is helpful.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.640]   It's a really nice interface, uh, pretty easy to read and click through.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.960]   Uh, it's, it's, it's, it's pretty great.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:29.640]   I mean, it's just sound bites from various news articles, but, um, very, uh, informative.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:30.720]   You mentioned Instagram.
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.280]   Are you, uh, following this new, this new series?
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:35.840]   I haven't seen it yet that they're debuting.
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:41.280]   Instagram is in view debuting a original video series in 15 minute, 15 second.
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:42.280]   I will see it either.
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.560]   Yeah, this is going to be cool.
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:47.040]   I have not seen it yet, but I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm going to enjoy it.

[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.640]   It follows.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.640]   It's really cool.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.880]   Like the short video format, I think is, is really, really interesting.
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.480]   I think this has, has a lot of potential.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.320]   28 episodes total of seven minutes because it's 15 minute clips.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.520]   For 15 seconds.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:01.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:04.080]   I keep saying minutes because it seems like seconds is hardly enough.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:05.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.080]   I find it.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.800]   Um, I guess you'd have to follow is it, it's called shield five.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:14.640]   Let me just search and see if there's a shield five account or maybe it's going to, you know
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.640]   what?
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:20.600]   I bet it's going to be in there where they put the ads on Instagram every five, every 10
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:21.600]   posts.
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:22.600]   There is a five account.
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.600]   Oh, right.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.600]   It's spelled out FIV.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:30.880]   I wonder if that's the somebody, just somebody opportunistically created that.
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:35.880]   I think it's the one that I'm going to be able to do it.

[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.880]   I'm going to be able to do it.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:28.880]   I'm going to be able to do it.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:33.880]   I'm going to be able to do it.
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:38.880]   I'm going to be able to do it.
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:43.880]   I'm going to be able to do it.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:48.880]   I'm going to be able to do it.
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:52.880]   I'm going to be able to do it.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:57.880]   I'm going to be able to do it.
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:02.880]   I'm going to be able to do it.
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:07.880]   I'm going to be able to do it.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:12.880]   I'm going to be able to do it.
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:17.880]   I'm going to be able to do it.
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.880]   I'm going to be able to do it.
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:26.880]   I'm going to be able to do it.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:31.880]   I'm going to be able to do it.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:36.880]   I forgot how to use Android.
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:41.880]   It's been so long.
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:46.880]   They didn't invent it.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:50.880]   They swiped it from swipe.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:55.880]   I am 7% more efficient.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:00.880]   I saved 198 taps.
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:05.880]   They predicted 11 words.
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:10.880]   It tells you what words you type a lot.
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:13.880]   The top emoji you've used,
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:17.880]   the size of your vocabulary.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:22.880]   It's not.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:27.880]   It's valuable, but they love it.
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:30.880]   Zag, which is a nice smart phone
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:33.880]   battery case manufacturer,
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:36.880]   which is a very nice battery case.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:40.880]   Oh, yeah, the Zag keyboard.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:45.880]   $100 million.
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:50.880]   I think Microsoft paid a quarter of $1 billion for it.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.880]   Not bad.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:58.880]   Nice work if you can get it.
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:02.880]   I think that's all of our big stories.
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:05.880]   Two Facebook things.
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:08.880]   You were going to do those.
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:11.880]   One story is that they're using qualitative feedback
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:14.880]   to change the news feed.
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:17.880]   They're doing it automatically,
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:22.880]   which they've been doing up to now.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:25.880]   They've obviously used some behavior.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:28.880]   They're monitoring you.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:33.880]   Now they're asking you.
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:37.880]   Please tell us.
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:42.880]   Please tell us what you want to see in your feed.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:47.880]   Do you want to talk?
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:52.880]   What was your do with this?
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:57.880]   I thought you might interest you.
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:02.880]   I've known this for a while.
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.880]   You can tell Facebook,
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:08.880]   who was it?
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:13.880]   I'm running over to move the camera.
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:16.880]   Maybe I'm not slumping.
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:18.880]   I'll sit up even higher.
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:24.880]   He told me that the really sharp people are using Facebook
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:30.880]   will work with Facebook to target their articles to --
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:33.880]   let's say he said what you could do with Twit is to have the Twit news --
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:35.880]   I don't do any of this.
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:40.880]   He said, you should be doing this.
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:44.880]   I said, I promise I will never do this.
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:48.880]   We could take that information and feed it to Facebook.
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.880]   Here's all the people who subscribe.
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:56.880]   They would generate things like a demographic set based on that
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:59.880]   of like-minded people who don't watch Twit.
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:03.880]   I could make sure the Twit video for a fee gets pushed to those
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:07.880]   people because indications are they would like it because these people like it.
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.880]   You see what I'm saying?
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:15.880]   It's basically advertising.
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:19.880]   They also say if you use tags, we can do some of this for free.
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:24.880]   But I think really this is an open to having the conversation of,
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.880]   well, you really want this to work.
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:30.880]   What we need to do is work closely together.
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:33.880]   But they say you could use tags.
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:37.880]   I think any signal that you give Facebook, they're happy to get, right?
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:46.880]   See, I think the qualitative feedback is the same thing.
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.880]   They love data, just more data.
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:51.880]   One thing I know is that you don't really want to ask people what they like
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:52.880]   because they lie.
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:55.880]   They lie worse than a Trump voter in Iowa.
[01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:58.880]   They -- a Trump non-photer in Iowa.
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:01.880]   They -- you know, if you -- we know.
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:06.880]   When you ask people what kind of TV they watch, they all say PBS.
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:10.880]   And nobody really watches it.
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:15.880]   They're always trying to impress and impress the survey taker.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:16.880]   Oh, yes.
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:18.880]   I watch a lot of "Downton Abbey."
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:20.880]   Yeah, I know this is when we used to -- people when I was at People Magazine
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.880]   and we did cover tests.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:24.880]   You know, you put Diane Sawyer, who gives you the news,
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:26.880]   or "Brooke Shields" in a bikini.
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:29.880]   Oh, no, no, no. I'm going to buy Diane Sawyer.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:30.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:32.880]   Yeah, the best cover test is --
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:36.880]   which a lot of companies now do is put both covers on the actual newsstand
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.880]   and then see which one sells.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:40.880]   Because people don't lie with their dollars.
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:42.880]   They lie with their tongues.
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:43.880]   Yep.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:47.880]   According to CNBC, the IRS is experiencing computer failure
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:49.880]   across several systems.
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:51.880]   Just you'd like to know.
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:53.880]   A little shot and freighter there.
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:54.880]   [ Laughter ]
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:58.880]   Dr. Mom put that in the chat room and said, "Tell Jeff there is a God."
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:01.880]   [ Laughter ]
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.880]   And she pays taxes.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:04.880]   Yeah, apparently.
[01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:06.880]   Apparently.
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:10.880]   YouTube is also doing original content.
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:14.880]   The first is going to appear for people who are red subscribers next week.
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:18.880]   It's called a trip to Unicorn Island.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:22.880]   Tell me what kind of audience YouTube is trying to get here.
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:25.880]   From the team at Astronauts Wanted, this feature-length movie gives fans
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.880]   an extraordinary look inside the life and journey of Lilly Singh.
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:33.880]   As she embarks on a challenging 26-city global tour where she has to remember
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:37.880]   to practice what she preaches happiness is the only thing worth fighting for.
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.880]   Is Lilly Singh a real person?
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.880]   I don't know.
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.880]   Oh, yes, as a matter of fact.
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:44.880]   She's a real person.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.880]   She's a YouTube star.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:47.880]   Oh, oh, yeah.
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:48.880]   Of course, yes.
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:49.880]   How about this one?
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:50.880]   Dance cap.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:51.880]   Camp.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:52.880]   Not cap.
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:53.880]   Camp.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:54.880]   Dance camp.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:58.880]   This feature film from Awesomeness TV weaves an amazing story of unlikely
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:03.880]   friendships, unleashing passions, discovering yourself through the power of dance.
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:05.880]   Awesomeness TV.
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:06.880]   YouTube partner.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:12.880]   Laser team in this feature-length action comedy from Rooster Teeth and Fullscreen Films
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:17.880]   four small-town losers stumble upon an alien ship carrying mysterious cargo
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:21.880]   leading to a battle to save Earth from an all-powerful enemy.
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:24.880]   And finally, here we go.
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:26.880]   Is this the...
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:28.880]   Go ahead, play the audio on this.
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:30.880]   Oh, man, I don't want to see this.
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.880]   An alien warrior will arrive to do battle with whoever is wearing this suit to the death.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:37.880]   How do we get these things off?
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:38.880]   Oh, Lord.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:39.880]   She's meant to work as a unit.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:40.880]   Who's this douchebag?
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.880]   I'm the champion of Earth.
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:46.880]   You look like the champion of swim team.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:51.880]   My dad may not be very strong or brave, but he is really good at...
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:54.880]   I love you, too, sweetie.
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:59.880]   No matter what comes your way, I will walk it.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:02.880]   Go, set yourself a thought. I didn't know we were talking.
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.880]   Well, you can tell what audience they're aiming at.
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:06.880]   It's Nick for boys, yeah.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:07.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:13.880]   And finally, Scare PewDiePie, in this reality adventure series from the creator and executive producer of The Walking Dead
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:15.880]   at Skybound Entertainment at Maker Studios,
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:24.880]   experienced thrills, chills, and laughter as PewDiePie encounters terrifying situations inspired by his favorite video games.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.880]   That's going to be a hit.
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:32.880]   Huge hit, because it's PewDiePie and they're simulating computer games.
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.880]   Oh, God.
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:36.880]   It's not for us, Jeff.
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:37.880]   No, it's not.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:38.880]   I don't know.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:39.880]   No tricks.
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:40.880]   Promise?
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.880]   I just think the world is conspiring to make me feel old.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:43.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:46.880]   Meanwhile, Vice announced its channel.
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:48.880]   It's an old-time TV channel today.
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:49.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:50.880]   Viceland.
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:51.880]   Viceland.
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:52.880]   Mike Jones and Eddie Moretti as co-presidents.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.880]   And the first lineup, I just thought I'd share this with you.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:57.880]   Balls deep.
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:58.880]   Okay.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:35:59.880]   Okay.
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:00.880]   Vacation.
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:01.880]   Noisy.
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:02.880]   Flop house.
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:03.880]   Oh, Lord.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:04.880]   F word.
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:05.880]   This build-up.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:06.880]   That's delicious.
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:07.880]   And we de-ket.
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:14.880]   What are the odds that they will have young women bouncing on trampolines in at least one of
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:15.880]   those shows?
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:16.880]   I know.
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.880]   I'm glad Spike is back, baby.
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:20.880]   Viceland.
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:27.880]   Actually, I just saw people bouncing on a trampoline in the trailer.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:28.880]   Okay.
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:29.880]   So I wasn't wrong.
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:30.880]   No, really?
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:32.880]   All right.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:36.880]   Let's take a break and come back with our tips and tools and tools.
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.880]   And numbers of the week.
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:42.880]   We already got Genis tips, so it's up to you and me to keep the troops entertained.
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.880]   But first a word from FreshBooks.
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:47.880]   Oh, I love FreshBooks.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.880]   If you're a freelancer, you do your own invoices.
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.880]   Maybe you're a small business.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:55.880]   I don't, I think I can read your mind.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:58.880]   You don't really love that time of the month, right?
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:00.880]   That's my time of the month.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:05.880]   I have to sit down and get all the expenses out of the shoe box and add them all up.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:11.040]   And figure out, you know, how many hours I worked on every project that I have to create
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:14.880]   and invoice and send it.
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:18.080]   And by the time you get to the end of that, you're going, hmm, let me get back to the
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:21.880]   thing I love, the reason I created my business.
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:24.280]   FreshBooks is going to make it so simple, so easy.
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:26.280]   It's better than having an accounting manager.
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:30.760]   It's like, it's like, it's the best stuff.
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:34.360]   First of all, there's the FreshBooks app, which keeps track of your expenses.
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.720]   You just take a picture of them and then gets it right into the invoice.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:39.640]   The invoices look super.
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:40.640]   They're very easy.
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:45.080]   In fact, really, you can almost automatically create the invoice with a push of a button.
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:49.120]   And then nice thing is that invoice goes out and you get paid faster on average five
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:51.280]   days faster because it's easy for your client.
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:56.600]   They just push a pay button and they can pay online.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:57.600]   Time and hours, no problem.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:58.600]   Use the app.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:02.200]   It automatically keeps track of it and then puts it into your invoice.
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:06.720]   Plus, if you are in a business where you go to people's houses, there are new FreshBooks
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:07.720]   app.
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:11.000]   It lets you create an estimate on your iPhone.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000]   Show it to your client.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000]   Get approval.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000]   Do the work.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.600]   Show the invoice of the client and then you stick their new EMV capable card reader in
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:20.600]   your phone.
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:23.640]   They can swipe the stripe or dip the chip and pay you on the spot.
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:26.000]   You're going to love it.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.240]   This redesigned iPhone app is amazing.
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:29.840]   Send an estimate right after the handshake.
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:32.760]   Send an invoice in seconds right from your phone.
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:35.520]   This is how your customers want to work with you.
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.600]   You could track all your bill about time anywhere you are.
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:40.560]   You could track expenses with your iPhone and camera.
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:45.800]   And of course, if you have any questions, support is always free and always there.
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:50.200]   The support rock stars at FreshBooks go above and beyond to help you out.
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:51.760]   I love FreshBooks.
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.400]   Use it for years.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:57.640]   I want you to use it for 30 days free.
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:02.080]   Go to freshbooks.com/twig.
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:04.960]   FreshBooks.com/twig.
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:10.120]   As Gardner in our chat room says, "FreshBooks equals awesome."
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:13.720]   Just do me a favor just so that Jeff gets credit.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:17.760]   Put this weekend Google in the, "How did you hear about us?"
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:18.760]   field on that form there.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:19.920]   That way they'll know.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:26.840]   FreshBooks.com/twig for your 30 day free trial.
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:31.120]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:35.200]   So Bloomberg Dadfly, which is a service I didn't know existed, it's very good.
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:36.200]   It's well-made.
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:37.200]   What is it?
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.200]   It is.
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:39.200]   It's a financial stuff.
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:42.200]   They do some really interesting analyses using data visualizations.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:46.600]   And because both Amazon and Alphabet are reporting more details of their companies, they put
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:50.680]   them together and saw what we saw, which I found really interesting.
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:53.840]   So some of the obvious we know is revenue.
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:57.080]   On Amazon, retail revenue is 99 billion, which of course cheats because that includes a
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.080]   merchandise.
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:03.240]   AWS is $7.8 billion revenue.
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:07.080]   That's actually huge, even though it looks dwarfed by the retail sales.
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:08.080]   Exactly.
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.080]   It's a good business.
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:14.880]   Google, $74.5 billion and the other bets are $0.5 billion.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:17.080]   You know, half a billion.
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.080]   Profit.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:23.800]   Amazon, of course, keeps profit as tiny as it can to not get, as somebody I know said
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:27.040]   in an article, to not get a Wall Street addicted to that crack.
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:33.560]   So it's $2.7 billion on retail and $1.9 billion on AWS.
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:36.040]   So they let that go ahead and go across.
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:37.040]   Yeah.
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:38.600]   Google, $23 billion profit.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:45.200]   And of course, as we said earlier on the show, negative $3.6 billion on the other bets.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:55.560]   Three margin, 3% on retail for Amazon, 24% for AWS at Amazon, 31% for Google.
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:58.920]   Free cash flow, CapEx, what else was there?
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:04.720]   Total debt, $17.5 billion at Amazon and $5.2 billion at Google.
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:08.280]   One wonders why Google even has debt, but that's the way they operate.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:12.440]   So I just found those somewhat interesting now that we can know a little bit more about
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:13.440]   the companies.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:14.540]   Yeah.
[01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:15.540]   This is a nice page.
[01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:16.540]   GAD.
[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:18.140]   GADfly is very good.
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:19.140]   Yeah.
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:20.140]   It's bloomer.com/gadfly.
[01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:23.780]   They're doing really neat stuff at Bloomberg Media.
[01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:27.980]   It's a kind of a funny name because it isn't a GADfly kind of a dilettante kind of...
[01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:28.980]   It's pretty, I know.
[01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:30.980]   I wonder why it is that.
[01:41:30.980 --> 01:41:31.980]   Yeah.
[01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:33.980]   But they have neat analyses.
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:34.980]   Love it.
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:37.180]   Oh, Amazon's bookish demeanor.
[01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:38.180]   Yeah.
[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:47.060]   And you considered, I know as a number, it's the number $6,000, $6.13.
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:49.420]   And now I feel punked by this.
[01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:51.140]   So I thought this was a great story.
[01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:58.780]   You remember in September, a fella named Sanme Vedd bought Google.com.
[01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:02.900]   He had gone to the new Google domains and just as a lark said, I wonder if I could buy
[01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:07.620]   Google.com and to his surprise, got it.
[01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:11.740]   He reported that when it happened and it got turned back on.
[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:16.380]   Now we find out that in fact, Google, instead of going through the lengthy ICANN process
[01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:20.060]   of getting their name back, just said, "Hey, Sanme, can we give you some money?
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:21.060]   How about...
[01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:22.780]   Let's give you a Google dollars."
[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:26.500]   That's G-O-O-G-L-E or 6,006.13.
[01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:29.620]   Get it and lead?
[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:32.260]   Somebody pointed out that's also booby, but that's...
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:35.140]   Google or booby.
[01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:37.140]   Either way.
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:41.020]   Then Sanme said, "No, but I got a better deal for you.
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:43.020]   I'll give it to charity if you double it."
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:50.180]   And they did $12,000 and $12 and $26.
[01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:51.580]   So I thought this is really good.
[01:42:51.580 --> 01:43:00.740]   This is a blog post and this came on Thursday and it came from the Bug Bounty Program.
[01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:08.900]   VED donated it to the Art of Living India Foundation, a humanitarian, educational NGO.
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:15.940]   What they told me in a tweet on Sunday is, "Oh, did you know VED used to work at Google?
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:16.940]   You've been punked.
[01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:18.580]   The whole thing is a PR ploy.
[01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:20.540]   I don't know if that's true or not."
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:21.540]   Really?
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:22.540]   No.
[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:23.540]   He's a student.
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:24.540]   No.
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:25.540]   Yeah.
[01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:26.740]   He's studying Babson College.
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:33.140]   He was an account for five years and account strategist at Google from 2007 to 2012.
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.740]   I don't see how that presumes...
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:36.740]   You've been punked.
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:37.740]   Okay, good.
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:40.380]   You're the hard-nosed journalism professor.
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:41.700]   No, I'm an optimist.
[01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:42.700]   I'm an optimist.
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:43.700]   I have a little faith in that.
[01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:47.780]   Okay, I want you to do this as a case study for your students.
[01:43:47.780 --> 01:43:48.780]   What do they think?
[01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:50.780]   I don't know.
[01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:55.620]   Speaking of case studies, you saw, kind of very sad that the intercept had to fire.
[01:43:55.620 --> 01:44:01.300]   A reporter and retract many of his stories because he fabricated them.
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:04.660]   Made up quotes people he didn't talk to.
[01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:05.660]   Yep.
[01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:06.660]   Bad apples.
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:07.860]   You know, it happens everywhere.
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:09.860]   The New York Times had the same problem, right?
[01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:13.420]   Everybody saw a press release past my email that Jason Blair, who was the New York Times
[01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:15.700]   case, was commenting on the intercept piece.
[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:16.700]   Oh, please.
[01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:17.700]   I didn't let it really care.
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:18.700]   Yeah.
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:21.420]   You know, when you're going to fabricate a source...
[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:25.580]   Actually, this guy at the intercept had probably learned a little from Jason.
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:28.740]   Because he faked emails, he created a fake email account.
[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:35.020]   He sent himself the quotes so he could say, "No, see, I have the email right here."
[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:37.580]   I mean, he was pretty sophisticated in his subterfuge.
[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:40.220]   You're going to go to all that effort.
[01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:44.860]   Well, the problem with it, it's a smoking gun now.
[01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:48.220]   You know, so the next guy won't do that.
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:49.220]   Yeah.
[01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:53.820]   A word of warning to whoever hires the next guy.
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:54.820]   I just want to give you...
[01:44:54.820 --> 01:44:56.820]   I don't have a product.
[01:44:56.820 --> 01:45:00.180]   I do want to give you an update on the Tesla because it was a last week, I think, or maybe
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:01.180]   two weeks ago.
[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:06.420]   I mentioned that I was having difficulty working with Tesla and finding it getting a date.
[01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:11.980]   And then the next day, I got a call from somebody very nice at Tesla who said, "Oh,
[01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:13.820]   I heard the podcast.
[01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:17.020]   That's when I hang my head and chest."
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:18.820]   And you know, Car for you, Miss.
[01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:21.500]   No, he didn't do what he did to Stuart Alsop.
[01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:23.740]   Stuart Alsop was a well-known columnist, tech guy.
[01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:26.780]   I think if Elon had seen the podcast, you'd be able to have a car now.
[01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:27.780]   Yeah.
[01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:34.780]   Apparently, Alsop wrote a stinging blog piece or a medium piece on how he as a Model X customer
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:39.420]   because he had pre-ordered one, went to the Model X event, had to wait two hours for Elon
[01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:45.060]   to take the stage and never ever end after three hours, it ended up not seeing a higher
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:46.220]   hair of a Model X.
[01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:51.900]   And he went away disappointed and he wrote a note on Medium in Public to Elon saying this
[01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:52.900]   terrible.
[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:57.380]   And Elon apparently just canceled this order.
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:45:58.380]   I love you, Elon.
[01:45:58.380 --> 01:45:59.380]   You're great.
[01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:00.380]   I'm excited.
[01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:01.380]   I can't wait.
[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:02.380]   In fact, I love you.
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:03.380]   I'm like, "Oh, are you like?"
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:04.380]   Well, here's the funny thing.
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:09.580]   I just got a date and it's February or March of like next month.
[01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:10.820]   No, you're kidding me.
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:11.820]   Yeah.
[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:12.820]   That's wow.
[01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:17.700]   Thank you.
[01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:23.220]   Once I understood that I had the wrong expectations, I had the expectation was like going to a
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:26.620]   car dealer and buying a car and then they say, "Yo, you'll have your car in it."
[01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:30.060]   But this is a brand new vehicle nobody's ever made.
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:31.740]   They're just now ramping up.
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:34.020]   They're making apparently 238 cars a week.
[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:37.220]   It's not, you know.
[01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:42.060]   But for whatever reason, I don't think I'm jumping the line.
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:44.300]   I hope I'm not because I don't like to do that.
[01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:45.460]   But my car, they...
[01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:46.740]   What color did you order?
[01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:48.580]   I ended up getting a titanium.
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:50.060]   It's all right.
[01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:51.060]   What interior?
[01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:52.060]   A tan.
[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:58.580]   So we talked about this because I really wanted a white, pearl white with a white inside because
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:46:59.820]   I'd seen videos of that.
[01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:01.780]   In fact, I think Elon's is that.
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:04.380]   And I thought that looks like a car from the future.
[01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:08.060]   And since I'm driving a car from the future, it should look like a car from the future.
[01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:10.580]   As Jason said earlier, there was a good stormtrooper look, right?
[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:13.940]   It does look a little bit like a stormtrooper.
[01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:16.100]   But my wife, Wiserhead, prevailed.
[01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:18.260]   And you had the same reaction as my wife.
[01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:19.260]   Oh, immediately.
[01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:20.260]   Immediately.
[01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:22.100]   Look, it just get dirty.
[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:24.020]   I used to eat salt bagels all the time.
[01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:27.460]   My family just got enraged until there was salt in the car because I'd ripped them up
[01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:28.460]   in the car and...
[01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:32.500]   Yeah, I like coffee seed which would be even worse for a white car.
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:34.740]   Little black specks everywhere.
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:38.500]   Anyway, I apologize.
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:40.380]   I'm very excited.
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:44.820]   Now I have to talk Lisa into letting me get it early because we were going to wait till
[01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:47.060]   September when my lease runs out.
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:48.060]   But don't you think...
[01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:49.060]   Oh, it's a best that.
[01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:50.060]   Oh.
[01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:53.020]   Don't you think I should have it sooner so that I can review it and talk about it?
[01:47:53.020 --> 01:47:55.100]   Oh, yes, Leo.
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:56.100]   You sure.
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:58.100]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:47:58.100 --> 01:48:00.060]   Lisa, this is kind of what I said.
[01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:02.060]   I said, Lisa, I love you.
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:04.900]   You can send me the nature box for a time later.
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:05.900]   Do you think...
[01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:06.900]   Yes, exactly.
[01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:11.860]   I think it would be okay if we took delivery of this a little bit early.
[01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:13.780]   So what are you asking me for?
[01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:21.220]   You know you're going to do whatever you want.
[01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:23.060]   People aren't buying electric cars and I think it's so cool.
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:30.860]   I got solar panels on the roof just to do that 30 kilowatt hour as a day we're generating.
[01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:35.620]   Now when I drive this car, I could say this car is powered by the sun almost directly
[01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:38.060]   and is using no renewable resources except for maybe...
[01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:39.820]   Must on principle, I want one.
[01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:46.660]   Plus, the electric car I've driven was I test drove the i3, the BMW.
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:48.660]   And as I said...
[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:50.140]   Made with wind, you know.
[01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:51.140]   Yes, exactly.
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:52.980]   And it goes like the wind.
[01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:53.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:54.980]   Electric's amazing.
[01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:58.420]   It's the electric's amazing because it's like a nuclear powered golf cart.
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:00.340]   Oh, it's wonderful.
[01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:02.020]   It's a crime so differently.
[01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:03.020]   Yeah.
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:04.020]   I'm pretty excited.
[01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:05.020]   I don't know yet.
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:06.020]   I'd be dying to it.
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:09.300]   Well, now what do you think about the Model 3?
[01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:11.700]   So this is according to Jason Calicanis.
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:15.100]   This is like the eighth time I've quoted him in this show.
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:16.100]   That's very million.
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:22.780]   Who is a friend of Elon Musk's and claims to be privy to Elon's strategic thinking.
[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:31.820]   He also owns the number one Roadster Model number one and also Model S. He says that
[01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:36.020]   really this has all been a journey to get to the Model 3.
[01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:37.020]   Yes.
[01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:43.740]   The consumer $30,000 consumer grade electric car because Elon's not in this for the monies
[01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:46.940]   and it to change the world.
[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:51.620]   And the reason this came up is because we were talking about Apple's ambitions in autonomous
[01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:54.420]   vehicles and electric vehicles.
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:58.980]   And Jason's pretty sure Apple has serious designs on Tesla.
[01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:03.580]   He's just as sure that Elon does not want to sell because he's not in the money.
[01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:04.820]   He's changing the world.
[01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:07.660]   He's really in it more to change the world and make the money.
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:10.500]   But he said maybe he wants to get to the Model 3.
[01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:15.840]   Maybe after the Model 3, the consumer priced version of this, which he's been financing
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:20.580]   with these high expensive Model S and X.
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:23.140]   Maybe when we get to the Model 3, he'll be considering selling it then.
[01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:24.340]   And Apple may well, who knows?
[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:25.500]   They may have a memo of understanding.
[01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:29.740]   Well, my van, you may find similar company cars from lots of companies.
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:34.980]   Well, this Chevy Bolt is a $30,000 200 mile range electric car.
[01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:35.980]   That's the key, by the way.
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:40.980]   That's the difference between Teslas and the Leaf and the Volt and all these is range.
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:46.060]   Well, and to me, the real test is when a car, when electric car can get as far as you can
[01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:52.380]   drive in a day, which is four or 500 miles, 300 miles even, which I think the main Tesla
[01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:53.380]   does do, right?
[01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:54.380]   Right.
[01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:56.300]   Then it becomes practical.
[01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:59.780]   If I have to stop for 45 minutes in the middle of driving somewhere and find the damn place
[01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:00.780]   then no.
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:01.780]   Right.
[01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:04.580]   Though even then, I still need, you know, it's in Tesla's interest.
[01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:05.980]   This is why he's open source things.
[01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:10.060]   The more charging stations there are in hotels and parking lots and everywhere, the better
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:13.060]   the market is.
[01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:15.180]   Right.
[01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:18.500]   I could probably just turn my outy in early.
[01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:20.260]   What's the penalty?
[01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:21.260]   I don't know.
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:23.620]   I should look.
[01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:24.980]   I mean, there's a penalty, but it can't.
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:25.980]   How much could it be?
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:29.020]   It's got to be less than having two leases at the same time.
[01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:30.780]   What does Lisa drive?
[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:31.780]   She drives an outy also.
[01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:32.780]   We like outies.
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:39.180]   I've really loved the outy, but we don't, we lease the company leases it.
[01:51:39.180 --> 01:51:43.140]   So I was, I went to visit my parents.
[01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:46.140]   My father's 90th birthday on Saturday, which is very cool.
[01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:47.140]   Happy birthday.
[01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:48.140]   Wow.
[01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:49.140]   Speak the deal.
[01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:51.380]   So my sister and I went down and I rented a car and I chose the four because I said,
[01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:55.100]   Oh, God, I'm going to try sync.
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:56.100]   Two things.
[01:51:56.100 --> 01:52:02.340]   One, I can't believe they took out the ox plug.
[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:03.340]   Really?
[01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:04.340]   Yeah.
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:05.340]   Yeah.
[01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:06.340]   Cars don't have ox plugs.
[01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:07.340]   I don't have an ox plug in my outy either.
[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:09.260]   I think I don't even have a USB port.
[01:52:09.260 --> 01:52:15.700]   I have a proprietary connection with a 30 pin plug on the other end for your out of date
[01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:16.700]   iPod.
[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:19.540]   You can buy additional connectors, which I ended up doing.
[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:20.540]   Yeah.
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:23.680]   Yeah, then I said okay, okay, okay. I'll
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:31.280]   How the test light doesn't have an ox plug either by the way, but it does have four USB ports. Alright and the standard USB ports
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:32.420]   Yeah
[01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:34.420]   So I then try to
[01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:37.800]   Just do bluetooth. That's okay. No, no, no, no, you have to the sync app
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:40.800]   But we'll only do bluetooth in sync app. It's so fun
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:45.880]   I download the sync app onto my phone and then no no I got a register with the VIN number and all this stuff
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:49.120]   No, no no no no it does standard bluetooth I
[01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:53.760]   Couldn't get it to do it. I couldn't figure out how to sit. No, it totally does standard Bluetooth
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:57.040]   It does they really changed it because I had four sink. You know, I had a Mustang for years
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:01.600]   I know that I know that and you just pair it like you do any car you see you you search for the phone and it finds it
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:06.460]   It said although they didn't have at the time at bluetooth app, so I don't know
[01:53:06.460 --> 01:53:09.980]   I mean I'm
[01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:13.820]   Somebody will tell me the answer, but I went the point was I just wanted to try it out and
[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:18.300]   And rental cars are a huge way to try out new products, right?
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:24.700]   Because I'm debating right now you still have it decided. Oh god. No. Are you thinking electric?
[01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:31.060]   No, it just isn't practical. You're gonna go hybrid, right? I would love to but that's
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:38.980]   The car that would seem to have everything I want is that Lincoln, but I'm just too young
[01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:45.380]   You and I have that same prejudice. That's for old people Jeff
[01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:50.700]   We're the old people we were thinking of the Audi Q3 was the one I was going
[01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:57.260]   Problems and they won't give me a straight answer as to I read met an Audi a big out you're looking for the Android Auto
[01:53:57.260 --> 01:54:03.260]   Yeah, and I said I was at this I was at an Instagram lunch at the DLD conference in Munich
[01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:09.180]   I meet a big Audi executive and I immediately said I have a board to pick with you. Good. I was fearing
[01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:13.300]   Yeah, I said no no. It's just it's just Android auto. He was thrilled not to hear that
[01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:20.780]   You have a straight answer about that and so then I'm considering the the Lexus equivalent
[01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:26.100]   The NX a new small version and it's really nice
[01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:29.540]   But Toyota
[01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:36.980]   Refuses to go the things they can do a better user interface. Oh, they're all wrong when they say that they're wrong way wrong
[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:39.460]   Go with go with car player Android Auto
[01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:45.740]   So Tesla did announce that they're gonna allow me to it with my Android device
[01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:55.040]   Stream some some mirror mirror mirror. That's the word the display of the of an app onto the big screen
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:55:01.780]   Made giant or at least I don't know you know what let me I'll get back to you after I get my accent
[01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:06.220]   You can maybe think about it. No, you could just transfer your lease from your Audi over to Jeff
[01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:09.740]   You want an Audi Jeff? No, no
[01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:14.140]   It's kind of like a Lincoln made in Germany
