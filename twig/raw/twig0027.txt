[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.080]   This week in Google, the show that covers Google and the cloud
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.040]   and joining us now from not quite the cloud,
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.480]   but the very snowy environs of Davos, Switzerland.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.400]   No, Davos is not the town.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.920]   It is.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.480]   It is.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.240]   That's the town.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.520]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.800]   You're there because you're the world-famous Jeff Jarvis
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.560]   host of This Week in Google, right?
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.440]   That's right, of course.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.920]   How could they have--
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.760]   I won the lottery, won the three of us, did that.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.320]   And for those of you watching on video,
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.240]   Jeff hasn't got native on us.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.040]   This is some sort of costume party going on.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.600]   He's got face paint.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.040]   It's South Africa night here.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.360]   See the little things here?
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.800]   No.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.680]   And so you could go downstairs and get your face painted.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.200]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.480]   And you're wearing a suit.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.840]   I did it for you, guys.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.120]   I did it for you.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.200]   It's quite a look.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.840]   Where it's high.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.720]   And there's the official badge.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.960]   It gets you in to things.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.920]   Oh, nice.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.400]   At Davos.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.800]   That's awesome.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.640]   And it says, but--
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.440]   I'm saying here is Davos, right?
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.640]   Clay Shurky was at another event before this last year.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.120]   And he said, people come up to me and say,
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.560]   are you going to Davos?
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.440]   He said, why are they asking me if I'm going to get divorced?
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.080]   No, you're in Davos.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.640]   Davos?
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.400]   Is it a part of the German-speaking area in Sussan?
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.080]   OK.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.080]   But it's a kind of German that sounds like nothing
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.320]   unearthed me.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.520]   So it's like Davos.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.240]   Also with this Miss Gina Trapani,
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.000]   Miss Gina Trapani from SmarterWare.org.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.920]   And Life Hacker.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.200]   And CompleteWaveGuide.com.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.640]   Hi, Gina.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.680]   Yes, sir.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.960]   So we're a little later on.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.960]   We'll go downstairs with Jeff to see what's going on
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.600]   at South Africa Night.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.920]   Is every night a different night of the week?
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.680]   No, this is the Sware.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.680]   At the end, when we're supposed to dress in tuxedos
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.440]   or native dress, I saw Michael Larianton earlier.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.840]   And he was in the Native American dress called Blue Jeans.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.920]   It's valid.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.640]   That's surprising.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.320]   That's typical of Mike.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.040]   He's not going either, either or.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.560]   He's doing his--
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.040]   I've never heard.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.560]   He plays two.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.440]   I've got to send him one of these stickers.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.240]   So while you were in Switzerland,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.960]   you got to talk to Marissa Meyer, Eric Schmidt.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.320]   Chad Hurley was there from YouTube.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.560]   And David Rummend and Cash Roron.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.160]   Wow.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.520]   What was that?
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.640]   I managed to luck into it.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.960]   They had a briefing for a certain select press.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.680]   And I whined and asked to get into it.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.160]   And so I did.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.280]   They had us meet at a cafe up the street from here.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.320]   And then we walked to the safe house.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.120]   It's an apartment that they do up in Google stuff.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.640]   And so we talked to them there for about a little over an hour.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.000]   And how forthcoming were they?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.160]   I think fairly forthcoming.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.920]   It was on the record, though I heard
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.720]   there was some discussion about whether it should have been.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.440]   But it was.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.680]   They said clearly.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.040]   And I think some news came out of it.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.200]   You wrote a blog post about it.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.480]   But here's your chance to talk about it in a little bit more
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.880]   detail.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.680]   Well, for the rest of the world, I think China was probably
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.200]   the bigger news.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.560]   But for our end of the world, I thought it was big news
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.640]   that they said that they are now going
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.560]   to consider being transparent about the splits on AdSense.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.280]   So why is that an issue?
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.200]   Well, I was at a conference before this
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.000]   in Munich called DLD, where they had a border, which
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.240]   is the largest magazine publisher in Germany,
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.920]   complained to Dave Drummond, the chief counsel of Google
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.280]   on a panel, that--
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.960]   and the Germans are really going after Google.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.440]   They're filing suits for the government.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.440]   They're trying to go up to copyright.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.440]   They're all kinds of stuff.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.240]   They're just whining like crazy.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.200]   And he said, we want a fair share.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.280]   And so I asked a fair share of what?
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.040]   AdSense?
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.680]   And he said, yes, we want transparency and a fair share.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.880]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.600]   I don't understand.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.640]   Oh, well, because we don't--
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.600]   I guess they just pay you what they pay you,
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.440]   and you don't know how much of the total revenue that is.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.360]   Right, and Drummond was saying things like there
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.800]   are some people that are up to 80%,
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.640]   and there was catcalling from the audience.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.040]   Who's that?
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.520]   And so I think that he must have come back,
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.560]   and they're saying that they've been talking about this
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.760]   for a while, but it was convenient that it came right
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.520]   after this German confrontation.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.120]   And it's a bit of peace there.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.240]   So I told the German publisher then last night
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.120]   that this had happened, and there were big smiles.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.800]   So I think the Germans and Google
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.960]   are trying to meet with each other
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.960]   and trying to find some level of peace.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.920]   But what happened here that's important
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.400]   is that at least this one German publisher put a fence
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.040]   around it, because there's this belief by some
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.200]   that Google owes publishers some of their revenue
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.600]   all around, because you have our content.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.560]   That's rather absurd.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.640]   And Drummond said, I don't owe you anything
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.040]   for a search where someone comes in and searches for a camera,
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.400]   it goes to the store and buys it.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.200]   You had nothing to do with that.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.920]   And so--
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.360]   Well, that's the course.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.440]   Yeah, why should they get credit for that?
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.840]   But the publishers are kind of acting like,
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.760]   you use our content, thus.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.720]   And of course, we all know that's dumb,
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.600]   but they don't know it's dumb.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.120]   But it's completely reasonable to say,
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.560]   but as a blog publisher, publishers, the two of you,
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.200]   you probably would agree that if they pay you a buck
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.280]   for somebody visiting your page, you'd
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.640]   like to know that's a buck out of how much?
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.320]   Exactly.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.200]   I mean, the two big complaints I had about Google
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.080]   in my fanboy book were China.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.680]   And lack of transparency about AdSense.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.560]   So they just ticked off two of them, which is kind of cool.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.520]   So do they have a time frame for when they might say this?
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.680]   No, it was very vague.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.600]   It was we were going to consider it.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.560]   But you're not going to say, we're going to consider it,
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.400]   then say, you know what we thought about it?
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.560]   We considered it in the answer.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.560]   He's no.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.120]   And they're not going to do that.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.840]   But I understand--
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.000]   I mean, I understand how-- well, they might not
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.160]   want to tell you what they're getting paid for that ad.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.720]   So I have run AdSense in years and years.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.000]   So if you're a web publisher, you run AdSense on your blog,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.760]   you log into your AdSense dashboard or whatever.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.960]   And you find out how much Google is paying you, right?
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.640]   But they don't-- so it doesn't show you
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.840]   what percentage of what they get paid for advertisers.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.080]   That's the issue.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.040]   So how did this other person know that someone was getting 80%?
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.480]   Because Drummond said that.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.240]   Some get up to 80% and some complained about that.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.320]   And then I saw Drummond here in Davos.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.040]   And he said, haven't you heard of volume discount?
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.320]   And so I think that to me, I was talking with the publisher
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.600]   today, and I think that if Google releases this,
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.480]   it also creates motivation to try
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.600]   to move up the ladder of share.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.320]   You get more traffic, more relevance, better performance.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.520]   Maybe you'll get a higher share.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.320]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.400]   I mean, that's how Amazon Associates works.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.760]   You can go into a program that's tiered, right?
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.040]   And the more that you sell with your associate ID,
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.360]   the higher percentage that you get.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.160]   But the Germans have a problem with the ads
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.600]   that Google shows on its results page itself.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.080]   Well, that was the thing.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.200]   This publisher at Burda said AdSense.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.720]   And I'm not sure he knew what he was talking about, but shh.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.240]   Those are ad words, right?
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.840]   That's the difference.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.840]   Right.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.880]   But I then saw a colleague of mine at the Guardian
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.040]   still complains that Google takes our content
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.200]   and scrapes our content, and we deserve a share of what they do.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   Well, no, because then Google would
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.080]   have to pay every website in the world.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.440]   And you're getting the value, as Eric Spina said,
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.280]   more than once now, we send you four billion clicks a month.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.120]   It's up to you to do something about that.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.800]   He also said that we're going to try
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.680]   to do a better job of--
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.080]   or you ought to do a better job of making your content sticky.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.840]   And we'd like to do a better job of having
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   that work for you because that helps us.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.400]   Right, so Marissa talked about--
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.200]   I asked about what they're going to do about newspapers
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.760]   in the press, and she said it focuses on two things.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.240]   One is make them money and find more ways
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.160]   to make them more money.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.040]   And I'll come back to that in one second.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.520]   And the second is trying to improve the form of news
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.760]   and make it more compelling and engaging,
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.280]   because newspaper people aren't making it very engaging.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.640]   On the ad side-- and I frankly didn't fully understand this,
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.560]   but what they said was that their next big push in this world
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.400]   is going to be into display.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.600]   And they're going to bring the science of Google,
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.160]   they said, to display.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.920]   Yeah, I read that on your post, and I don't know what that means.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.920]   Do you mean the banner ads?
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.200]   And so what they're going to do is set up--
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.520]   So funny to hear them say the next big thing is display,
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.280]   when most of the rest of the world is saying,
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.040]   what do we do besides display?
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.920]   But that's where so much money is branding,
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.760]   as opposed to click through stuff.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.840]   And what they said was that advertisers now buy sites.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.360]   Yes.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.920]   So Google's been donated by audiences.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.480]   And I said, well, they're going to aggregate.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.960]   Yeah, they're going to aggregate audience,
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.200]   and then give you different references and stuff.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.040]   But I said, doesn't that yet again
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.560]   disintermediate publishers and hurt their branding?
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.040]   Well, basically the answer was, if they make more money,
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.640]   dot, dot, dot.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.240]   They won't mind.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.320]   One of our German listeners in the chat room says,
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.360]   Burta is kind of the Rupert Murdoch of Germany,
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.600]   kind of old and out of touch.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.920]   Well, actually he's--
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.400]   Doesn't sound like it, actually.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.400]   No, he tried to rather hip.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.800]   They invested in glam at sea science blogs.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.320]   Oh, OK.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.680]   They're actually pretty cool.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.040]   He has the right question.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.080]   He wanted to know what percentage am I getting?
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.080]   Yeah, I think transparency was a fair argument to make.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.240]   But I'm not sure all fellow publishers agree.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.240]   But the point is, we're seeing some movement here.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.560]   And it was neat to see it from one conference to the next.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.360]   And I asked Google people whether this was actually news.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.120]   And they said, yep.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.360]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.720]   It seems very doable to me.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.600]   I mean, Amazon does it.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   You see how much--
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.960]   you get a reporter with everything that people bought,
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.520]   how much it costs, what percentage you got from that.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.000]   I mean, and it changes, depending on how much you sell.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.800]   It doesn't seem-- and this aligns totally
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.840]   with Google's whole transparency openness.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.080]   Google dashboard thing, right?
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.480]   I mean, it seems like presenting those numbers
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.080]   is the no-brainer.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:06.880]   I'm surprised by that.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.920]   No, you're right, Gina.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.240]   When they started talking about display
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.080]   and how this becomes a platform and network
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.320]   that anyone can use, any site can use,
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.080]   then as I think about it, you mentioned this,
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.600]   it becomes even more important for them
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.760]   to be transparent about that because you're
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.800]   going to hand over a big hunk of your ad inventory
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.000]   that you sell, then you can able better know
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.360]   what the business deal is.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.000]   So now, when we say display, are we
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.760]   talking about individual banner ads,
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.680]   or are we talking about buying the entire page
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.560]   and filling every ad space with a particular campaign
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.000]   or even custom graphics on top of a logo?
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.360]   Are we talking about branding a whole site,
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.160]   or are we just talking about regular banner ads?
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.440]   I think we're talking basically about regular banner ads
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.560]   and such, big ass ads, as we call them, or other forms.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.680]   There's a whole bunch of standard forms from the IAB,
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.200]   the Internet Advertising Bureau.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.720]   I'm sure Google will sell them all.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.680]   And so, they'll get as creative as they can.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.720]   But basically, I think that might work for a site that says,
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.080]   I have no sales force monetize me,
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.520]   but for a big brand, they'll give Google their remnant
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.120]   unsold inventory of which all sites have plenty.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.480]   Yes.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.040]   Yeah, that's what happens at Life Hacker, Life Hacker
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.680]   sells in all the Gawker sites, right?
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.880]   The sales team sells custom campaigns,
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.680]   some of which includes branding for the whole site,
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.320]   and then remnants are AdSense and other kind
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.680]   of programmatic banners.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.400]   But those are just banners, or units,
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.880]   versus like kind of big branding thing.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.720]   Great, more banner ads.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.320]   Yay.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.560]   So, I love banner ads.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.560]   Why not?
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.840]   Before we get to China, some other news
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.120]   from the briefing here in Davos from Google
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.320]   was that they're very proud now of YouTube
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.960]   and say it's making money.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.560]   When pressed about the definition of what that means,
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.760]   Schmidt wouldn't say, well, depends on the accounting rules
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.480]   you use, but he couldn't say which accounting rules.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.800]   So you make the point that it could be cash flow
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.960]   or it could be profit, either one.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.440]   Right.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.040]   Right.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:13.880]   But he praised Chad Hurley for finding the way
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.720]   to have YouTube make money.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.120]   He's very happy with it now that the distribution deals
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.520]   they're doing with big entertainment companies
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.320]   are working.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.600]   They did a big deal in the UK with channels 4 and 5.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.920]   Hurley said they have double click now into YouTube.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.040]   They had a serving platform, and they're selling ads
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.040]   on YouTube in 20 countries.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:36.360]   Hold on.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.760]   Heather Gold is here.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.440]   Hello, Heather.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.440]   Hey, Heather.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:39.440]   Hey, Heather.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.440]   Hey, Heather.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.440]   Hey, Heather.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:41.940]   Hey, Tina.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.920]   Jeff, I barely recognize you because you look so African to me.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.360]   Yeah, it's amazing, isn't it?
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.080]   I'll start.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.880]   The guys downstairs playing drums
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.960]   were incredible.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.120]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:00.000]   So Jeff, are the double click putting in video ads or static ads?
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.880]   On YouTube, they're--
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.240]   I think they're just those slide up ads.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   I haven't seen any pre or post-roll yet.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.360]   But I mean, I'm sure that they would like to do that.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.680]   But double click does serve those ads that come up
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.120]   and sit there and annoy you until you click the X.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.520]   Those come from double click.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.480]   And they're based on the tags with the video?
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.640]   They seem to have some relationship to something.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.760]   Because there's a lot of--
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.760]   description, caption.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.280]   --of YouTube.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.880]   I mean, it means whoever's advertising there
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.840]   is getting a lot of stuff they may not.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.840]   I mean, for example, today, I went to try to research
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.920]   some stuff, Gina, for the show.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.280]   And I went to my YouTube account.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.200]   And the latest comment on one of my videos
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.200]   is you should have acid thrown in your face,
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.840]   which is awesome.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.480]   There happens to be no way to report that person.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.680]   And so you could be advertising on that.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.920]   That's always fun, like a little homophobic terror.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.000]   I doubt its comments.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.280]   I would imagine that it's title, tags, caption.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.480]   And those things are all description.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.720]   Those things are all required, right,
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.280]   when you upload a YouTube video.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.240]   But this is historic.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.520]   But it's just, you can't control what it's--
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.840]   I mean, just given the tenor of a lot of what's on YouTube,
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.360]   it seems like a bit of an--
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.560]   I can understand if they--
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.920]   It's historically the big problem with this kind of advertising,
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.600]   to be honest, is it--
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.680]   On YouTube, in particular.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.840]   --in YouTube, MySpace, it was a big problem,
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.960]   is that you just don't know what your ad is going to be on.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.360]   And I think there's a lot of resistance from advertisers.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.760]   And the ones I've talked to say that these ads are not effective,
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:26.560]   either, that they're probably as ineffective as other display ads.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.060]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.360]   I have the effect of people reach to close them--
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:29.860]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:30.360]   --and miss the ads--
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.280]   Absolutely click.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.280]   --and click on them.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.360]   And then it looks like they got clicks.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.960]   That's how effective they are.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.880]   You hit the nail on the head.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.160]   That's exactly right.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:39.680]   You got it.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.000]   That's when it's happening.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.560]   As people are click to close.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.960]   It's like a fly over BS, which I can't stand.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.960]   They're so effective.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.960]   It's like, no, that's people trying to close them.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.600]   That's people trying to not understanding what's happening.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.200]   We had Jacob Nielsen, the user-busability expert
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.960]   on "Net at Night" on Tuesday.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.680]   And they do the eye tracking stuff.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.960]   And he said that the most effective advertising--
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.840]   his new book on "I Tracking the Web" says,
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.480]   the most effective advertising is text.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.480]   Google AdSense-style text.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.120]   And how's he judging effectiveness based on whether you
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.680]   like it or whether you click on it?
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.120]   Whether you notice it.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.480]   He said, well, to give him the full quote, text and cleavage.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.600]   But if you look on the--
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.680]   I'm not-- hey, I'm sorry.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.680]   But that's--
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.400]   --text in the cleavage?
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.440]   No, not text in the cleavage.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.880]   Well, I don't think they tested that.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.320]   So the idea is what they do is they test
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.880]   hotspots on the page where people are reading and looking.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.280]   And so they can see that you are reading--
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.880]   the display ads get completely ignored.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.760]   Now, I think you've just saved the ad industry
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.400]   and the media industry all at once.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.400]   Text in cleavage, everyone.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.000]   Well, Holly was known about the latter for a long time.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.760]   I remember on the screen savers we had a Hollywood producer
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.240]   come in and said, you know what's missing on this show?
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.920]   Cleavage, I brought cleavage today.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.320]   Thank you.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.480]   You don't have to display it.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.680]   You just have it.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.440]   That's the beauty of it.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.920]   Put it on, or I'll tell you.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.920]   No.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.000]   But if you look at Facebook, what do you see on the right--
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.120]   maybe you guys don't see it.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.320]   But on my Facebook, that's what's always on the right,
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.320]   as there's a text ad and there's cleavage.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:13.920]   Always.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.080]   I'll go there right now.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.960]   Generally, well, because you're a guy, if you're a woman,
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.200]   you don't get as much cleavage.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.400]   Is that the case?
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.560]   Yes, because they're trying to give you things.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.680]   I get crazy stuff that I would never be interested in.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.440]   But they try.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.000]   They're trying.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.800]   That I want something pink.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.320]   Really?
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:28.880]   Stuff like that.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.120]   You get more pink ads?
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.280]   I totally get pink ads.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.040]   That's interesting.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.080]   And they try to pull you stuff that I
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.320]   guess people that you're really connected to somehow
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.200]   they've decided are endorsing companies,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.160]   which I don't understand that.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.160]   Oh, I really hate that.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.440]   Because I can't believe some of the people I know,
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.000]   they're like, I want to call my friends and say,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.720]   did you really-- what did you do that has Facebook
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.640]   saying you endorse this company or this ad?
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.680]   In any event, it's interesting that Google, after all of that,
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.000]   after all we know about what seems to work on the internet,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.960]   is saying display ads are the next big thing.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.360]   I wonder if that's a little disingenuous.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.880]   Isn't there a lot of pressure on them
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.120]   to say that YouTube is not draining the company dry, Jeff?
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:08.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.840]   I think these are two separate things.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.800]   The display ad thing is them trying
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.840]   to give more money to publishers and get more inventory
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.160]   from publishers and more information.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.720]   I think on YouTube, you're exactly right.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.440]   And you know what?
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.160]   If it's a stop of drainage, that's fine.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.160]   We had the discussion in the earlier show
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.880]   that maybe it doesn't actually cost them as much as we think.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.760]   And they didn't want anybody else to own video.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.200]   So what he's saying is there's profound progress at YouTube.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.240]   And I think that's something.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.320]   Also, a word on the New Google Books settlement,
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.240]   the new one, because the first one got trashed,
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:52.080]   because mostly because of the DOJ said it's probably illegal.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.080]   And yesterday was the last day for comments
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.680]   on the new proposed settlement, according
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.960]   to an article in R's Technica on their Law and Disorder blog.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.200]   Pretty much the same suspects filed pretty much
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:10.680]   the same objections to the New Google proposals.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.640]   Ursula K. Le Guin organized 350 authors
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.960]   who objected to the fact that the agreement would apply
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.280]   to anyone who didn't opt out.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:22.680]   She said it should be opt in, not opt out,
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.400]   and that it's a change in copyright policy.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.080]   The state of Richard Wright weighed in as well
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.160]   in what R's Technica called a diatribe.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.600]   - And a state had a diatribe?
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.160]   - The state was diatribing.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.360]   - It's like from the grave?
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.640]   - I don't know.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.640]   Well, maybe his heirs are very defensive of his stuff.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.560]   - I think the J.D. Salinger's lost book
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.000]   should now appear only on Google.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   - Yeah.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.600]   - Be a Russian piece.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.400]   - One of the changes, this is really goofy.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.280]   One of the changes Google proposed,
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.480]   Google will help set book prices,
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.920]   but this is an engineer, boy, engineers figured this out.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.560]   Help set book prices by developing an algorithm
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.600]   that simulates what the prices would be
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.480]   if there were competitive market conditions.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.880]   Amazon said, well, that's price fixing
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.440]   by a computer instead of a human.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.520]   What's the difference?
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.480]   The claim Amazon says that this is acceptable
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.600]   or well-intentioned price fixing
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.120]   because it will supposedly mimic the market
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.200]   does nothing to save the revised agreement.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.320]   It also argued that some of the changes
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.000]   only cover direct-to-consumer sales
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.120]   and keep exclusive arrangements in place
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.200]   for subscription and institutional services,
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.200]   basically the same.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.880]   Internet Archive had the same objections,
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.480]   public knowledge objected.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.920]   I don't know if this book deal's gonna ever go.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.120]   I really don't.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.920]   - So what, Jeff, if you could orchestrate it
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.600]   the way you wanted it, what do you think it should be?
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.440]   - The book deal?
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.800]   - Yeah.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.080]   - Oh, she should make me think of this late at night here.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.720]   - Sorry.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.960]   - I think this is, boy, greater minds than ours
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.000]   have attempted for years to figure this out
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.600]   with no success.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.360]   So, Jeff, if you can't figure it out in one minute
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.840]   at Davos, I don't blame you.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.040]   - And well, this is the place for diplomacy
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.400]   and solutions to the world, all the world's problems.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:20.160]   I think what we've gotta do is put the fence around
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.760]   the real issue, which is,
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.960]   your friend works and leave those aside
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.600]   and give control to this,
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.280]   which basically already exists,
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.480]   to rights holders, whether that's the writer
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.840]   or the publisher, and get on with it.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.120]   And then we can, it's like the health bill,
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.280]   we can mop up the details later,
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.960]   but stopping the digitization of books
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.240]   and the benefits that come from that,
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.560]   I think is criminal.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.320]   - It does seem to be that the orphan works
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.920]   are the chief area, although Google still would have,
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.560]   according to the R's report,
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.960]   a significant degree of control
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.320]   over the future market for digitized works,
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.760]   essentially asserting that they're the ones
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.640]   who get to sell them once they digitize them.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.680]   - The orphan works.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.920]   - Well, is it only orphan works?
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.040]   I guess so, if they're not orphaned,
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.640]   then the rights holder.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.960]   - The rights holder has the rights.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.880]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.880]   - So, it's also--
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.920]   - For some reason this reminds me of a Wuppy Goldberg movie
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.640]   I once saw, really bad one,
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.400]   Jump and Jack Flash, where the evil person's plan
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.120]   was that they'd found a way to take everyone's like half sense
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.800]   or somehow when there were bank accounts
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.920]   and sucked all of them up and became--
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.440]   - Same plot point has used in office space
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.600]   and Superman 3.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.440]   - Really?
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.280]   (laughing)
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.680]   I'm sure it's gotta be in 10 other films.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.800]   - It's a great plot point.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.800]   - It's like, if someone said
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.120]   "I know I'll build an internet company on that, yes."
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.640]   (laughing)
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.480]   - We will take the crumbs.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.840]   - Well, anyway, it's just, so there's an update on the,
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.040]   I was asking this last week,
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.400]   what's the story with the Google book deal?
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.880]   And then, you know, it is now, of course,
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.160]   in the hands of the judge,
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.400]   but it sounds like the same exact objections.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.560]   And the DOJ weighed in again saying,
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.400]   "This would change copyright law,
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.880]   "so you gotta think the judge is just gonna say,
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.880]   "well, I don't know, what's the judge gonna say?"
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.720]   We asked you to go back--
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.880]   - They don't like to change things.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.360]   - No, not copyright law,
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.680]   not with a civil suit.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.240]   It's kind of an ethical--
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.560]   - Yeah, and it is a problem.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.680]   Like in Germany, the publishers are hiding behind the skirts
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.480]   of Chancellor Angela Merkel,
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.840]   asking to change copyright law for their benefit.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.560]   Copyright screwed up,
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:26.240]   but if we start, you know, mucking around with the law,
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.120]   there's, you may need to do that,
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.920]   but bad things can happen then.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.760]   - It gets out of control,
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.320]   you never know what's gonna happen in the legislative process.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.280]   - So the YouTube page has been redesigned.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.600]   Anybody noticed that?
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.320]   I don't like it.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.400]   I can't do full screen as easily as I used to be.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.080]   - Why? What can you do it as easily?
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.880]   - Is it just me or is there no longer
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.480]   a full screen button on the darn thing?
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.600]   - There's a full screen button?
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.720]   - Yeah, I don't--
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.040]   - Oh, maybe it's just me.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:54.880]   - That changed.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.720]   - Well, well--
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.840]   - You mean that thing with the four heroes?
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.240]   - The four arrows?
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.400]   (groaning)
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.320]   - You pressed the four arrows.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.320]   - Yeah, okay, it is on some.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.720]   I guess not on all videos then.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.960]   - Did they add this little,
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.200]   what is this little two-way arrow thing?
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.040]   Is that new?
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:09.880]   - That's, see, that's what I said.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.720]   On some pages, I only see that,
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.560]   and then it's a pop out.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.400]   - It has this middle deal.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.240]   - Yeah.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.080]   I don't like the middle deal.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:16.920]   - I do.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.080]   - I don't see the four corner one on all my pages.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.400]   - Is it doing the four corners only on HD or?
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.400]   - I don't know.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.440]   - I have to say, yeah, it doesn't,
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.400]   I don't know what the difference is,
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.440]   but they don't all have it sometimes.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.480]   - Like here, okay, I'm looking at a page right now.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.240]   Here, I'll put it up on the screen.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.560]   Let me play with the settings here briefly
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.800]   so I can get it up on the screen for you.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.680]   Take it out of double box.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.960]   And this is, I don't know why,
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.240]   for some reason this video,
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.480]   you see is like a lot of them.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.880]   It doesn't have that pop out box anywhere.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.240]   It just has this arrow thing.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.560]   Watch this video in a new window.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.000]   And then when I do that,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.320]   then I think usually I get the four corner pop out.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.640]   Yeah, see now I can go full screen,
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.480]   but I have to, it's two clicks now.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.840]   But that's not on every page.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.360]   A lot of these pages don't have this,
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.760]   they just have the simplified player bar.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.360]   I can't figure it out.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.800]   And then I've got the HTML5 thing going on.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.440]   - And how's that changing it?
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.840]   - Well, I'm no longer using Flash,
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.920]   and maybe that's what's changed.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.480]   - That might be it, 'cause I keep clicking and I can't find.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.080]   - You get it, okay, so maybe,
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.440]   maybe it's 'cause I went to HTML5.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.520]   - Hey, is this camera on?
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.920]   - You have an option to do that?
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.520]   - Yes, that's kind of a neat new thing.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.600]   - It lets you set the preference.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.640]   - Yeah.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.200]   - Oh, I see, I didn't know that.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:35.040]   - So if you Google YouTube HTML5,
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:40.920]   then you'll go to youtube.com/html5,
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.880]   and then you can say,
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.360]   "I want to enter the HTML5 beta."
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.080]   And then I guess in some cases,
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.480]   maybe that's why I get a full screen
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.680]   is when you do a pop out,
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.960]   then it suddenly goes to Flash,
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:53.880]   and now I can go full screen,
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.360]   'cause apparently HTML5 doesn't have full screen.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.200]   - Well, if you had an iPad, it would just be sense.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.920]   - Okay, you said the i-word,
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.800]   and now we gotta talk about it.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.880]   - We gotta talk about it.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.320]   - All right, we gotta talk about it.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.400]   It was inevitable.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.960]   - Did you notice that we've got a full half hour
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.800]   and we haven't mentioned it?
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.000]   - I knew you had it, because I like that
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.440]   Gina's length says she's trying to not,
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.920]   'cause you can go there.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.280]   - No, let's go there, but before we do,
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.120]   let's do a commercial.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.280]   - I want an i-keeper alternative and an i-pawn.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.840]   - Okay. - Sorry, Jeff, Jeff's looking like what?
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   - What?
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.680]   - What?
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.960]   - All the guys-- - That's just zonked.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.040]   - An i-pawn.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.720]   - Jeff looks like he should be in Twilight.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.200]   - But I can't interrupt. - I can sleep.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.680]   - You look like he should be in Twilight.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.680]   - Avatar.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.840]   - Avatar maybe. - Avi, Chris.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.800]   - Avi, are you blue?
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.440]   - Well, no, I'm happy.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.720]   - Let me quickly do a commercial for GoToAssistExpress
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.120]   and we'll come back, give you a chance
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:53.000]   to gird your loins for an iPad discussion.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.000]   Gina got it.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.680]   So, GoToAssistExpress, my friends,
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.240]   is the great tool created by the folks at Citrix
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.760]   who are experts in remote access,
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.960]   designed specifically for folks in IT and support.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.080]   I've been using a GoToAssist since 19,
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.600]   maybe since 2000, 2001, we're on the screen savers.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.560]   We used to use it all the time.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.680]   It's easy for you, easy for your customers,
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:24.280]   that's important, and it's very, very effective.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.680]   Here's the deal.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.000]   Even if your customer doesn't have it installed,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.960]   all you have to do is send them a link.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.720]   They go to GoToAssist.com.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.800]   Quick 30 second download, usually less if they have high speed.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.280]   And now you're able to work on their computer,
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.680]   even if they're not there.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.400]   They can give you unattended access.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.760]   You can have eight sessions at once,
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.720]   so you can start and install,
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.040]   move to the next one, the next one.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.960]   It is really designed for the support professional.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.120]   It gives you a list of running programs,
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.320]   including the operating system
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.760]   and any security software running,
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.440]   so you know what you're working on,
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.520]   you know what the problems are,
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.320]   you know if there's spyware running.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.880]   You can copy files from your computer
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.920]   if you've got patches or fixes over to theirs.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:01.720]   I can go on and on.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.440]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.960]   If you're in the support business,
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.240]   maybe you're in IT or you have software that you support,
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.480]   you really got to know about this one.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.240]   Go to Assist, express the new online tech support service
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.880]   from Citrix.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.080]   It is fantastic.

[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.400]   but they have a day pass for you do occasional support,
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.000]   that kind of thing with family and friends.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.160]   - Like a spa.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.240]   - Yes, it's like a spa.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.400]   - That's how I was going to think of it.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.480]   - Day pass.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.640]   - Doesn't that mean it sounds nice?
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.480]   - It's like a spa.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.320]   - You get a roll.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.320]   (laughing)
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.960]   - So I was speaking of spas.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.800]   - Yes.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.640]   - How's that?
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.480]   How's that for cool?
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.320]   - Is it super-swank there?
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.560]   - Sauna is now.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.800]   - Say again?
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.280]   - I've addicted to the sauna.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.120]   - Ah.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:56.960]   - And you're not even in film.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.000]   - Sauna is awesome.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.080]   - And down here in Davos, it's magnificent.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.080]   - Well, it's good when it's really cold.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.280]   - One of you know, last two days,
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.320]   it's a cabin outside the hotel.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.760]   You walk through the snow to the sauna.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.840]   - Jeff, is everything like paved and gold?
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.080]   Do you feel like you're in the middle
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.280]   of the center of the little, you know,
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.600]   star chamber that rides in the world?
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.600]   - No, here's the way that happened.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.160]   The hotels are all sucky.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.000]   - Really?
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   - They're awful.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.760]   Oh yeah, they're terrible.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.600]   They're terrible.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.280]   It's a summer camp for moguls.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.120]   - Wow.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.320]   - Oh yeah, I've noticed that about rich people.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.760]   I went up to the Bohemian Grove.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.600]   Somehow the richer they--
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.120]   - You went to the Bohemian Grove.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:34.960]   - Yeah, and somehow the--
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.960]   - We barely just spent the rest of the show on that.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.040]   - The richer they are, the more down-market they like.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:40.880]   - Seriously?
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.680]   - I peed on a tree.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.520]   - You did?
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.360]   - Sure.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.200]   - Do you feel closer to Kissinger?
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.320]   - Well, he wasn't there at the time,
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.360]   even in cross streams.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.480]   - You know, it's funny.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.560]   No, I didn't.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.200]   Even at the Bohemian Grove,
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.200]   the George Schultz Kissinger types
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.280]   have a removed cabin distant from the rest of--
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.440]   - And is there cabin really all that different?
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.280]   - No, and that's just--
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.120]   - It's shag carving here.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:05.960]   - No, it's rustic.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:06.800]   And that's the whole point.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.560]   - Is this kind of burning man for old farts?
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.520]   - Yeah, when rich, really, really rich
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.480]   and powerful guys get together, it's the same.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.960]   - Okay, that is proof that the really rich
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.520]   and powerful people are wasps.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.520]   - They are wasps.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.360]   They're wasps.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.160]   - That's exactly right.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.120]   - I am googling Bohemian Grove right now.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:21.960]   - Oh, you never heard of him?
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.800]   - I don't know what you were on.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.720]   - Even Grove is this creepy little place.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.480]   - I'm not old and rich and powerful for earlier.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.400]   - Here's the deal, Gina.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.200]   They don't let women go, so, you know,
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.120]   except prostitutes, they bring up.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.520]   So it's a place--
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.480]   - Just for the record, I saw no prostitutes.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.280]   - A little bit north, well, female, anyone.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.160]   Little bit north of San Francisco.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.440]   It's connected to the Bohemian Club,
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.560]   which is in San Francisco.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.600]   - Very nice gentleman's club in San Francisco.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.160]   - Darted years ago by journalists and artists,
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.240]   but it's not that Bohemian,
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.680]   'cause it's mostly now George Shultz and Kissinger,
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.680]   and they all kind of get together.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.200]   And conspiracy theorists go like,
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.320]   "Bazooka with this thing."
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.400]   Like, Gina, if you start googling,
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.920]   it'll be like, there's a ritual with a giant owl.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.760]   - It's the same thing.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.840]   - It's a mad at midnight,
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.480]   and they all have group sex with a twig.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.360]   Like the people think that that's how the world's getting run.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.200]   - It's not.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.240]   - It's not exciting.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.160]   - But it is a time where a lot of really powerful people
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.440]   from--
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.720]   - If there's a complaint about it,
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.560]   it's that they have access to each other
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.480]   in a way that we don't because they get together,
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.600]   but they have that no matter what.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.680]   In their private jets at Davos, wherever they are.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.080]   - It's ritualized, and I think that creeps people out,
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.480]   'cause I know, I mean, I know you dropped out, Leo,
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.880]   but I stayed at Yale long enough to witness the--
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.720]   - Skull and bones.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.040]   - Skull and bones, the boyfriend, yes,
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.880]   I had a boyfriend who was in that wolf's head,
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.040]   and I went into one of the--
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:34.880]   - Have been in there too.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.720]   - Society been in there.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.560]   - It's BS.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:37.760]   - Yeah, but they have some creepiness.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.920]   - Oh, they make up stuff.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.920]   So people get like, it's to totally give people
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.360]   the sense of that they are somehow magical.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.560]   - They're trying to feel safe.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.680]   - They're trying to feel special.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.320]   - They need magic bones and stuff.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.320]   - And it's the same BS.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.560]   They're just like you and me.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.960]   There's no power. - What's better are scared.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.160]   They're just more scared. - They're more scared.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.320]   - That's why they need the start-up--
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.520]   - They need the power. - And the bones and stuff.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.840]   - Well, that's what I see here at Davos is,
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.680]   what's here are the powerful who are all being disrupted.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.160]   - Yeah, they're scared for real.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.000]   - Really?
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.720]   - Oh yeah, yeah, I did a session yesterday.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.120]   I led one on transparency in international organizations,
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.440]   and that ain't coming soon.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:18.560]   Bankers, governments, whatever media companies,
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.600]   the powerful are here,
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.960]   but they're not gonna be powerful for long.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.280]   - But I think Apple chose the name iPad
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.160]   on these camp things.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.600]   - There were no girls, that's for sure.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.600]   - I'm sure this is what happened.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.440]   There were no women.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.800]   - There were no ladies there.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.680]   - It did happen to Puyini Grove.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.720]   - Could very well be.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.920]   Could very well be.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.720]   All right.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.920]   - Okay, you wanted to talk about iPad or--
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.840]   - No, you were the one who dropped that.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.600]   - I know that people are, I mean,
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.960]   that might not be technical enough.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.000]   - I think iPad is appropriate because it is,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.840]   it's kind of a cloud device.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.760]   It's certainly aimed at the Kindle, in my opinion.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.000]   - And the netbook.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:52.840]   - No.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.280]   - No, you don't think it's aimed at netbooks?
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.520]   - No, I think it's very precisely not aimed at netbooks
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.320]   because if for half the money you could get
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.520]   something that has a camera, flash, multitasking,
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.680]   all the things that people want and a keyboard,
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.400]   all the things people complained about,
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.240]   it's, no, I know that Steve mentioned the netbook,
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:10.120]   but I think really it's aimed at the Kindle.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.080]   It's a Kindle plus.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.840]   - Well, is that because you think of the kind of person
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.880]   who wants a netbook as someone who might really program
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.080]   or use it for a bit more seriously?
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.480]   'Cause a lot of the netbooks are aimed,
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.280]   at least for as far as I understand in Europe,
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.960]   and this is mostly from Clive Thompson telling me this,
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.440]   that those devices are aimed at trying to make
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.040]   the computer more like the phone
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.880]   so that the device costs very little
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.040]   so that you're really sucked into the ongoing--
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.120]   - Well, if that's the case,
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.840]   then an Apple did a better job
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.160]   than whoever's designing the netbooks.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.360]   The netbooks are just little laptops,
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.560]   underpowered laptops that are really cheap
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.880]   and they sell well.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.720]   - Right.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.200]   - Because they're really cheap.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.080]   But then I don't think that's what Apple
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.520]   should be going after.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.280]   To me, it's a content device,
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.040]   so having a camera doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.680]   In fact, I don't even understand why they put
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.720]   a keyboard extension on it.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.280]   But I'm curious if in Davos, people are talking about it
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.120]   because I would think if I were creating magazines
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.600]   or newspapers, I'd be very interested in this device.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.360]   - Oh yeah, a lot of publishers came by,
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.640]   I couldn't as if it was going to be the Messiah,
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.520]   and the when it wasn't, they still had hope.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.120]   The publisher of the New York Times is here.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.560]   I talked to a lot of German publishers
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.440]   and UK and American publishers.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.720]   One of the publishers came by and said,
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:21.080]   oh yes, finally, we can go like this again.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.560]   We can move the pages.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.760]   And I said, sorry, but serial media is over.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.240]   Serial media is gone, the link is--
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.680]   - Yeah, but there is something to be said for skimming.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.680]   You think skimming's dead?
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.240]   - No, but I--
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.120]   - So this is a great skimming device.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:35.960]   This is a device--
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.040]   - And you can skimp most anything,
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.080]   but I think what they really want--
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.560]   - You can't skimp on the Kindle.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.720]   You cannot skimp on the Kindle.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.720]   Kindle's a crappy skimming device.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.040]   - Well, they really want to,
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.640]   something that regains their control over our experience.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.480]   - Well, that's not gonna happen.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.120]   - And, no, that's not.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.000]   - Although, Apple's trying, you know,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.280]   the fact that Apple has made this ecosystem
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.000]   where really most of the time
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.440]   you don't look at stuff in web pages,
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.280]   the New York Times will have a New York Times button, right?
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.280]   A New York Times icon,
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.560]   and a New York Times application
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.480]   where they did control the interface
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.440]   and all of that stuff.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.680]   Ultimately, you and I both know
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.160]   they're gonna have to do it on a web page
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.880]   if they wanna make it,
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.360]   but the iPad gives them a way to make it a button.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.440]   And I'll tell you, as Twit,
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.880]   that's the only way we can do it
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.480]   because it doesn't support Flash,
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.280]   so what we will do is have an HTML5 style application
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.480]   that has video and audio in the chatroom,
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.040]   and it's gonna be an excellent experience
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.760]   for somebody who wants to consume our content,
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.680]   live or on demand.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.360]   And I think that a lot of content creators,
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.080]   if they're creative,
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.000]   will think of ways to make this
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.520]   a very powerful platform for them.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.640]   - I think it's exciting for creators.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.480]   - Yeah.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.320]   - Definitely.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.760]   - What's the total penetration this thing could possibly be?
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.000]   How many units could really--
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.040]   - According to TechCrunch,
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.520]   and I don't know if Mike knows something
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.120]   or is BSing as often as the case,
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.440]   but he says three million candles
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.480]   have been sold in two years.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.040]   That's not very many.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.080]   I think that, and how many iPhones?
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.400]   75 million iPhones in three years.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.120]   I think you're much closer to the iPhone
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.120]   than the scale. - I would scale.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.680]   - That is the candles and the scale.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.640]   If you could sell,
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.720]   I think they'll sell five million in the first year,
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.960]   they'll sell 10 in the second, 30 in the third.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.120]   That's a pretty powerful platform.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.760]   - That's no salvation.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.480]   - Well, not powerful, but it's not a salvation.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.120]   - Well, I mean, the thing is, Jeff,
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.240]   isn't there two things?
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.720]   There's their actual business
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.520]   that could be in terms of wanting that saved,
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.800]   and then there's the way life works
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.120]   as I know it being saved.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.760]   And as you've been such an eloquent spokesperson for it,
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.840]   that's been over a long time.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.960]   But in a way, I read a really nice little piece
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.120]   that Gruber linked off to.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.280]   I added it up there, Gina, by Fraser Spears.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.600]   The same thing is kind of happening for a lot of geeks too,
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.960]   in the sense that the web is hitting a place,
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.080]   to some degree, not everywhere.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.600]   It's big enough to do everything.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.040]   Where they experience San this device is,
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.640]   I mean, it's not as geeky.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.720]   It doesn't give you all that control you talked about, Leo.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.560]   And so in the same thing, post-social media,
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.640]   there's gonna be a way in which people will experience it
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.200]   that talks about the touchpoint center
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.480]   and the team of publishing business works on emotion
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.480]   and feeling and connection.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.760]   And it comes from that human experience down,
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.440]   as opposed to from the code experience up.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.800]   And I think that is disconcerting for a lot of geeks.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.600]   And I agree with this piece, I've spears it.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.760]   That's one of the reasons people online
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.240]   have been a little wonky about this.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.680]   - Oh, people are very upset about it.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.640]   It says if there's two groups of people,
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.160]   there's people who had such high hopes for it
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.280]   that it couldn't live up to them.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.840]   They didn't get the unicorn and pixie desk
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.960]   that they were counting on.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:26.800]   - Right, right.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.160]   - And then there's people who hate Apple
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.960]   and just kind of hate the idea of a closed box,
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.760]   which it is and are saying, well, it's too closed.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.360]   - The spears is saying it's people
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.760]   who are doing the opposite thing
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.280]   what Jeff's saying the publishers are doing,
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.600]   which is they liked the world in a way the way it was.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.160]   Geeks feeling like you gotta go through us
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.280]   'cause we make the stuff work
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.960]   and we know how it works and publishers getting
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.000]   gotta go through us 'cause I know how things really work.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:48.840]   - That's a good point.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.000]   - And both of them losing that, essentially.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:51.840]   - But you can't.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.480]   - You know what I think it says too is that,
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   and Mitchell Baker, the head of Firefox,
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:03.280]   which of the foundation said here at Davos
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.200]   that are actually up at the DLD
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.480]   that the browser is outmoded now.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.000]   Just in the sense that we haven't seen
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.080]   any big changes in too long.
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.680]   And so maybe one of the impact of the Apple product
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:18.320]   is that it makes us rethink the browser and the webpage.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.360]   - Well, and that happened when the iPod Touch came out.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.120]   Everything was application based.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.440]   But it does have a pretty full featured browser,
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.760]   minus flash, which frankly I don't mind losing flash.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:35.480]   - Eric Schmidt here, when we asked him about the tablet
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.240]   and asked him whether they were gonna have one,
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.760]   he said, "Somebody tell me the difference
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.920]   "between a tablet and a big iPhone."
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.520]   - Well, there isn't, and that's the whole point.
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.400]   - I'm planning making the tablet my new phone.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.240]   - Really?
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.080]   - Yeah.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:49.920]   - How?
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.760]   - We type on tunnel vision.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.600]   - You wanna hold it to your ear?
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:52.440]   - Lever, flave, I'm gonna be like big doc.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.520]   You wanna hang around your neck?
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.360]   - Totally.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.360]   - It's bling.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.120]   - And I'm gonna get to have different images on it all the time.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.280]   - I actually, I handled it and I loved it.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.880]   - And then, you know, 'cause then where I've Wi-Fi,
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.240]   I can just have Skype 'cause I hate E-T-N-T.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.800]   I'm trying to get away from them.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.480]   - I thought it was a beautiful device.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.920]   - So you're buying one Leo, right?
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.920]   - Well, I'm the wrong person to ask
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.360]   'cause I have to buy everything.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.760]   But yeah, I'm actually, and I think if I were,
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.720]   well, I am a content creator,
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.920]   but I think the contractors are gonna be very interested in this.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:22.400]   I think Amazon is gonna have an interesting challenge.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.880]   But remember, Amazon's not really in the Kindle business.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:25.880]   They're in the book business.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:29.200]   So in the long run, you know, it's interesting.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.800]   Macmillan, all of a sudden, disappeared
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.480]   from the Amazon store yesterday.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.400]   And the thinking is, oh, Macmillan's preparing
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.600]   to move to the iBook store.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.920]   But if I were Amazon, I'd be meeting with Steve Jobs
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.000]   like Crazy right now saying, let's work this out.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.800]   We wanna sell books on the iPad.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.720]   - Did you just, the night before the iPad was announced,
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.160]   I got a cable that I said iPad,
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.800]   it's as bad as Vlog and webinar.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.120]   - Yeah, we're stuck with those too.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:55.840]   - Yeah, Amazon announced that they reversed their split
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.880]   on share, on royalty share with publishers.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.640]   They went from 30, 70 to 70, 70, 30.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.920]   And Paul Schreiber said that to me, thanks Paul.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.920]   And I did tweet it, I can look for the link from him.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.360]   But it's like, well, you know,
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.160]   and I always thought that share was wrong.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.000]   But--
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.240]   - Heather, is that after cost to AT&T?
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.080]   What they've said about--
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.680]   - That's an interesting point.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.520]   But I don't know if--
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.840]   - It's the more that half the money goes to AT&T.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.680]   - Wow.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.520]   - And then Amazon was saying, well,
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.120]   we give you the publishers more than half of what's left.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.840]   - No, Amazon put out a press release on their site
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.320]   saying that not comparing themselves to the iPad,
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.400]   I'm really saying I'm assuming they put the release out
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.600]   because of the iPad,
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.000]   that they reversed their split from 70, 30 Amazon publish,
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.480]   like book holder to reverse 30, 70.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.160]   - So maybe Amazon is trying to hold on to the business.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.480]   They also announced an SDK.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:47.160]   They're encouraging developers to write third party applications,
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.080]   which, well, Gina as a developer,
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.920]   surely the Kindle is not the platform
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.720]   you can't wait to write for.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.560]   - No.
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.400]   (laughs)
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.720]   - I mean, come on.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.320]   - I mean, it's a nice idea, but--
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.520]   - It's ridiculous.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.480]   - So, you know, I think the only question that remains at all
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.800]   is it is comfortable to read on the iPad,
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.920]   we won't know this for two months,
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.640]   on the iPad as it is to read on the Kindle,
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.480]   because if it can--
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.320]   - The ink is the difference.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.160]   - Yeah, but I'm not that--
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.960]   I've never, the ink isn't that high contrast, it's solid.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.400]   - I just, you know, I just hate looking at a bright screen,
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.680]   a backlit screen is just hard on the eyes.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.440]   - Okay, so that's the real question.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.440]   - I do think that the iPad with the Kindle app
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.280]   and InstaPaper would be a much better,
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.560]   better browsing experience,
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.320]   and I can't, as much as I have a lot of problems with it,
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.000]   I can't wait to hold it and try it as well,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.240]   and I'm sure it's a beautiful thing to hold.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.680]   - It's an amazing thing to hold, I have to say that.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.520]   - So what about you two, are you gonna buy it?
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.800]   - It would be quite as comfortable to read on the eyes,
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.880]   as the Kindle.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.040]   - Yeah, so well, we don't know, but that's a question.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.840]   Don't you read on the LCD all day?
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.320]   - Yeah, and at the end of the day,
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.040]   I don't wanna look at a screen anymore.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.320]   I wanna pick up my Kindle or the book of the paper
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.320]   because my eyes are done.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.280]   - So Jeff's question, would you buy it?
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.640]   - I'm not sure yet, I don't think I'm gonna buy it,
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.440]   I'm gonna go to the store and check it out.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.600]   I mean, to me, the iPad is just a giant iPod touch.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.560]   - Would you buy it if it had Android on it?
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.400]   - Yes.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.320]   - No, interesting.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.160]   - Yes, I would.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.120]   - Well, that's where I think Google goes to,
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:16.160]   is that Schmidt here in Davos emphasized
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.520]   that the strategy is entirely to get as many devices
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:21.840]   out there as possible, and then the audience for it
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.280]   will lead to application development,
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.880]   and he said, "The phone is the applications."
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.360]   - Yep, yep, and that's true.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.560]   And the reason why I would get it,
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.000]   if it had Android on it, is because my issue with it
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.440]   is that Apple decides what you can run on the device.
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.040]   So Apple decides that you can't get a porn app,
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.200]   and Apple decides that you can't get Google Voice
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.160]   on your iPhone, and maybe Apple's gonna decide
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.520]   that you can't run the Kindle app,
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.000]   because they've got their own bookstore.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.320]   They haven't done that, but they could,
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.120]   Apple decides, right?
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.120]   And it's a device that's just not that customizable.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.760]   It's not OS X.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.440]   I don't know, maybe everyone was like,
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.560]   well, why is everybody surprised that it's so closed?
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.000]   This thing is a computer, and I thought that maybe
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.280]   there's a possibility that it'll run full-on OS X
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.600]   versus this kind of lockdown iPhone operating system.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.800]   - Do you think someone can make it run OS X?
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:12.960]   I'm not as small as you are.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:13.800]   - Or Android.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.040]   How about running Android?
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:18.680]   With the custom chip that they developed at house,
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.400]   it will be much more difficult.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.560]   - That's probably why they did it.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.280]   - I think I have a lot of faith in our hackers.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.080]   - It'll be jailbroken right away.
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.440]   - It'll be jailbroken.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.760]   Although I'm hearing that that custom chip
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.040]   will make jailbreaking difficult,
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.800]   and it could be a while.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.000]   And Apple goes out of their way to un-jailbreak
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.960]   with every software update.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.040]   Your device gets un-jailbroken,
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.520]   and that takes time and effort.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.040]   They don't want people to jailbreak.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.040]   They make-- - Otherwise known as regaling.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.360]   - Yeah, regaling. - Regaling.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.200]   - Yeah, regaling.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.040]   - Is that what it's called?
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.040]   I love that. - I'm just calling it that time.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.640]   - I like it. - I've been regaled.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.560]   - Is this where the iPhone goes then?
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.840]   Are they gonna have the jailbreak-proof chip?
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.960]   - The iPhone? - I mean, well,
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.200]   I feel like that developing a chip in house
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.120]   is a significant thing for them to do.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.040]   And I've heard a lot of reasons why they may have.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.600]   Maybe they needed a chip that was fast enough
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.120]   that could handle multitasking, right?
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.280]   'Cause it's one of the big reasons that Android,
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.800]   one thing, big thing that Android can do,
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.720]   the iPhone can't do, did they do it to prevent jailbreaking?
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.360]   I mean, did they do it so that they can offer something
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.240]   different that anybody else could possibly offer
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:30.320]   because it has Apple proprietary hardware.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.120]   - Supposedly, it's ARM code, it's an A9.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.120]   It's a custom ASIC part with the A9 cortex on it
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:44.760]   and ARM chip on it and custom GPU on it.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.760]   But really, I think you hit the nail on it.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.600]   I mean, it's not so very different than, say,
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.280]   a Snapdragon or the Tegra.
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.840]   In fact, it's a lot like a Tegra 2,
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:58.840]   but Apple controls what code can be run on it.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.760]   So I think you probably hit the nail on the head
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:05.400]   that the real reason for a custom chip is not performance,
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.240]   but control. - But control.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.160]   - Wow, that's big reason. - That's all said.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.760]   - I don't know, Groobard, I mean,
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.160]   not like you'd say everything, but he's mostly writing
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.560]   about performances first.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.640]   - We didn't know about the chip and it's only lately
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.480]   that that's started to leak out.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.880]   And it's not coming from Apple and it may not be true even,
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.680]   but some bloggers are saying,
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.880]   there's one blogger, I'll see if I can find the link to it,
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.880]   who says I talked to a foundry and they said,
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:34.200]   yeah, this is the A9 in here.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.520]   So Apple's being very cagey, Apple's not saying.
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.880]   All they're saying is we designed it.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.640]   - This all said, I just want you all to know
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.440]   that I'm gonna do my best to get my book
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.880]   in the iBook store.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.720]   So, you know, as a publisher. - Oh, that's great.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.560]   Well, and think about this. - I am gonna do that.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.440]   - Think about this, Gina.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.520]   Now, not only is it a book,
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.160]   but it's a book that can have video and audio and multimedia.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.960]   - Yeah. - It's a much richer experience.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.400]   - It's a very potter book.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:58.880]   - It could come alive.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.160]   - It can come alive.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.080]   So it's the EPUB format, right?
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.400]   But it's with lockdown.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.640]   So EPUB is an electronic book standard, right?
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.920]   Pretty open standard from what I understand.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.720]   I actually, I've just gotten into this whole
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.880]   electronic book publishing thing,
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.760]   so I don't know a whole lot.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.040]   But from what I understand that there will be DRM.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.360]   So you will only be able to read the book on your iPad,
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.560]   or I'm assuming there's gonna be some sort of limit
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.040]   to the number of devices you can read it on.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:25.840]   - EPUB doesn't require DRM. - No, it doesn't.
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.240]   But Apple is going to include DRM.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.360]   - If you sell it in the iBook store.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.920]   - If you sell it in the iBook store, right?
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.760]   So does EPUB support multimedia then?
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.400]   It supports video. - Uh-huh.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.480]   - Oh, that's fantastic.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.680]   Yeah, so I'm excited about that.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.520]   - That's pretty cool.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.040]   - So as much of a problem as I have with it being
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.840]   sort of a closed platform, and as much as I don't,
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.080]   you know, wanna have a device where Apple
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.120]   decides what I can run and run on it,
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.040]   and you know, what I can't, as a publisher,
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.960]   I am gonna put my book in the bookstore
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.520]   because people are gonna buy it.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.880]   - It's gonna bring so many more people to digital books.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.560]   I mean, maybe I'm the most pedestrian one,
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.360]   probably the four of us, but I'm probably gonna get it.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.440]   But my thinking is, you know, I got the iPhone so early,
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.480]   and I'm really hoping my contract's done soon.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.960]   And once that happens, I might just go back
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.240]   to this other phone and use that for everything else.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.000]   'Cause when I travel, for no other reason,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.480]   it is like, I travel a ton, and the idea of carrying
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:14.040]   something that's one pound round is one and a half pounds
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.800]   is nice. - Yeah, okay, but you travel
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.080]   with a laptop too?
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.680]   - Yeah, I travel with this MacBook Pro,
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.640]   and I love this computer, but you know,
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.800]   I really like to limit my weight on me.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.600]   - So you, what if you have to do a long email
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.800]   or something, or are you gonna come from?
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.200]   - I get that little ducky thing.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.640]   - Really? - Yeah, I would.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.040]   I mean, I'm pretty good on the phone.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.760]   Like I have teeny, me hands, but I would see--
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.440]   - It's pretty tough, it's better than the phone.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.720]   It's pretty type of thing. - I'm sure it'd be better
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:39.560]   than the phone. - I mean, it's got,
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.120]   the keys are almost the same size as the laptop.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.640]   - Well, I wanna try the physical little thing
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.600]   where it stands on the little stand, and I would type,
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.640]   'cause I can see on the, I write a lot of airplanes,
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.720]   and I can see that as a really nice little simple way
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.960]   to, for me to do just basic writing,
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:55.040]   I mean, I wouldn't be doing video editing on it,
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.080]   but-- - It's my guess that people
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.600]   who wanna laptop out of it are gonna be
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.000]   a little disappointed that it's not quite there yet.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.520]   On the other hand, Apple clearly thinks so,
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.920]   'cause they're offering pages, numbers, and--
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:06.120]   - I think for a lot of people's use of a laptop,
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.120]   I don't know what the ergonomic experience will be,
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:10.160]   but it'll be sufficient, because I think most people
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.640]   don't use-- - They don't use much.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.760]   - Not maybe, probably people on Twitter are me,
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.920]   but I certainly can think of lots of people
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:16.840]   who don't use it. - Yeah.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.840]   - Hi, let me show you my slide deck.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.680]   - Right. - God, I'm in,
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.080]   fortunately I have more slide decks,
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.440]   that's unfortunate.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.040]   - Well, Leo, how does the file system work?
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.840]   Like with iWork, if you launch it on the iPad
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.960]   and you create a file, then what?
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.080]   Do you email it to yourself?
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.480]   Do you see it with iTunes?
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.880]   What is it like? - You can see,
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.280]   you know, this is very unclear,
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:37.200]   and it doesn't appear to have an accessible file system.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:39.640]   - There's no explorer, you can't look at your file system,
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.480]   you can't bring it in-- - And then you're gonna see--
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.000]   - But nor does the iPod touch.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.200]   - Like the way iTunes, you'll be able to control the system.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.880]   - It's really, as far as I can tell,
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.800]   it's running iPhone 3.2, it is an iPod touch
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.960]   with a big screen. - Right, so--
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.120]   - But you're creating files in iWork, right?
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:55.320]   - Yeah, you're clearly creating files somewhere.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:58.120]   Now, maybe, remember Apple has a cloud solution
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:01.160]   for its iWork already.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.840]   - Does it? - Yeah, and in fact, it works.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:05.240]   - Not mobile me. - No, it works quite well.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.800]   So it's possible that they will support that.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:09.640]   I would expect them to support that.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.920]   - It's not mobile me, they have a separate cloud solution.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.360]   - Well, maybe it's linked to mobile me,
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.160]   but if you use iWork, you could just say,
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.720]   I wanna save this up to the cloud and share it,
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.320]   and it works quite well.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.920]   You can share it, you can have it accessible to yourself.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.080]   So maybe-- - Right, and the chat rooms
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.760]   is when you connect iPad to Mac PC,
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.320]   you get a file system mount point with shared docs.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.160]   - How does he know that? - You're changed
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.480]   with iPad apps to be a Gruber.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.000]   I wonder how Gruber knows that.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.320]   We didn't really, I mean, we got to play with it.
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.840]   We didn't get to connect it to anything.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.000]   (laughing)
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.560]   - He just touched it in his mind.
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:40.920]   - I can tell. - He knew everything
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:41.920]   that was in the device.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.200]   - Well, you know, there are questions
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.200]   and they're gonna have to solve that.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.600]   And certainly you could probably sync it.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.640]   You know, to me, it seemed very odd
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.560]   that Apple released these three applications
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:54.720]   and a keyboard, because that seemed counter to me
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.560]   to what this device natively is,
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.960]   which is a content consumption device.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.920]   - It sounds like it doesn't know what it is.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:01.720]   - Then that's a mistake.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.240]   If Apple, you know, I think Jobs made some mistakes.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.040]   He shouldn't have mentioned netbooks,
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.720]   'cause it's not where he's,
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.200]   he should have mentioned the Kindle more than an netbook.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.160]   He shouldn't have made these applications
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.560]   'cause that implies that it's a computer.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.440]   You know, I don't even know if he should have had email.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.720]   It's really a content consumption device.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.840]   - But what about all the people who like
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.760]   really cheap computers who use them unbelievably simply
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.080]   for a little bit of word processing?
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:25.920]   - Maybe, maybe. - And we'll see
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.680]   if you'll think for those people, it is a lot,
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.360]   it's a less expensive laptop where Apple competes
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.640]   with other companies that have less expensive laptops.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.840]   - I think the 499 price point is a key part of it,
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.720]   because if any more than that, it's too much.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.600]   - They're seriously in the content business
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:40.800]   in a big way to me.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.040]   - That's the biggest thing you're right.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.520]   - They want to be in the content.
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.400]   They're going to replace the interface for the television.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.040]   I mean, I've known they wanted to work.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.120]   I mean, I did some work with Tony Fiddell,
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.560]   who helped make the iPod happen at the startup
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:53.600]   before he went to Apple,
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.600]   and it's one of the things I know he's been thinking about
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:57.360]   for an awfully long time, and I know he's left Apple,
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:00.440]   but I'd be very surprised if they weren't thinking about
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.160]   how do I get the main interface to all of this programming?
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.800]   Because that's going to be a tremendous point
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.560]   of business control, just tremendous,
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.080]   and frankly, the interface from Comcast
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.000]   and every other company is so horrible
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.400]   that it's a big opportunity.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.120]   So that's my just entertainment background
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:15.960]   sense of the device.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.240]   - No, I'm with you, and I think that that's when
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.040]   the device explodes, is when all these
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.200]   content companies start building.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.640]   You know, Gina, you may not want to publish a book
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.640]   in the iBook store, you might want to make
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:28.640]   a complete Google Wave application instead.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.080]   A lot of publishers do that,
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:33.000]   which will give you a lot more control.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.160]   And by the way, you know, look at the kind of ecosystem
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.080]   Apple has built recently.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:42.480]   You can have in-store, rather in-application sales.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.080]   So games do that now, they'll sell levels
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:45.240]   within the application.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.760]   You never have to exit the application
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.400]   to buy another level.
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.280]   - Right, right.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.920]   - I mean, there's a lot of capability here
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:54.240]   that I think content creators are just going to just die
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.680]   and get involved in.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.960]   - And it makes the form of content you work in
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.360]   or malleable because we've had,
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.800]   I mean, you know, Jeff, the entertainment business
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.920]   has traditionally had all these separate revenue windows
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.400]   and they've done it by having it be a separate form
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.960]   and they've been very attached to the form.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.760]   It's a book, it's a CD-ROM, it's whatever.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:13.480]   And now because right away, even the publishing itself
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:16.120]   has multimedia within it, you're already shifting
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.400]   your content experience past those static forms.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.880]   So I think it has, I think that might have-
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:23.280]   - I think you're right Heather.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.200]   But it also increases the cost of creating content.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:29.840]   It was no big deal to add a little something.
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:31.280]   - Wait a minute, wait a minute though,
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.240]   but there's no dead trees and no trucks
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.320]   and no, doesn't it reduce the cost of content?
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:37.520]   - But no, it's more creative.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:42.280]   So you make a movie and you make it for DVD
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:43.600]   and you add some scenes.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.400]   You make a book and you-
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.720]   - Yeah, but the-
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.080]   - Right, now you make some stuff new.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:49.920]   - You're making some stuff new.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:50.760]   - You're making some stuff new.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:53.040]   - Isn't 30, isn't the cost
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.160]   of the New York Times only 35% of the cost
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.200]   of the New York Times is actual editorial?
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.440]   - But that's also-
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:02.360]   - But what I'm saying is Leo, that when you add the need
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.920]   to create that content in another format,
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.080]   you have increased the cost of the content.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.200]   - Well I can tell you-
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.960]   - The New York Times does video online
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:11.840]   and they never did that before
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.840]   when they were just a newspaper, that kind of thing.
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.000]   - Right, right.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.960]   - And they're gonna save all this money on dead trees.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.960]   Doesn't that pay for it?
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.040]   - That's a separate issue.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:20.880]   It's a separate issue.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:24.080]   - The main thing is that this doesn't eliminate
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.600]   the dead trees yet, I think it'll happen,
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.040]   but it doesn't eliminate that.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.080]   But it does increase your cost of content.
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:31.640]   So you make something for the paper,
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.120]   then you make it for the web,
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.920]   and now there's this new richer experience
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.320]   and you have to make it for that.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.280]   - So what I'm saying, Jeff,
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.320]   is I think we change the production process,
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.080]   which I think has slowly been happening,
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.640]   which is you don't iterate,
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.320]   you make the stuff more all at once.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.040]   The production process shifts.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.080]   I don't think it's we made one item
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.880]   and then we shift everything into separate forms.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:52.880]   - Well, you're right about that.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.200]   - I think the creation process changes.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.240]   - All of these, these are gonna have new expertise
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.960]   and new thought through this.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.600]   And I think that what we're gonna see at first
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.640]   is shovelware, so everybody be underwhelmed.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.480]   - Right.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:04.320]   - And then somebody took a little long
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.160]   and do wally stuff,
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.400]   but then you gotta hire people to do the wows.
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.440]   - That might be the big risk for Apple here
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.840]   is shovelware, 'cause that's what killed CD-ROMs.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:15.480]   People were not willing as content creators to innovate.
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:18.040]   And it completely killed the format.
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:21.400]   And I could kill the iPad if content creators don't step up
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:23.400]   and say we're gonna take advantage of this medium.
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:27.320]   - But the difference is between CD-ROM and this is,
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.200]   think of all the iPhone app makers.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.280]   There is a lot more room
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.080]   if you're letting all the independent filmmakers,
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:36.480]   all the people that, whatever I see at South By,
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:39.080]   who are already making more transmedia kind of forms,
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:42.120]   who are making films that involve gaming
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.440]   with the film that involve book elements
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.280]   and you create that.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.120]   - Yeah, but your audience for a lot of stuff
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.120]   is much larger, Heather.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.720]   - I'm just saying that the competition,
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.920]   oh, doesn't only come from HarperCollins
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:51.920]   and the other big publisher,
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.480]   it also comes from independent creators.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.120]   - Who have a much faster way to distribute
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.680]   than they ever did with CD-ROM right next door,
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.560]   like on the same screen, in the same shelf space,
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:06.000]   as so-called shelf space is the next publisher.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.400]   So, and with more of a sense of,
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.040]   I think that kind of linear model
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.960]   is still the mentality of publishing better than me,
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.400]   but from what I know, the entertainment business,
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.480]   they're still very slow to think.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.440]   They think across synergies,
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.760]   in terms of objects. - Oh, absolutely.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:22.760]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.520]   That's why they talk about this desire
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.800]   for this serial experience again,
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.160]   that they can put out their magazines.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.720]   It's basically the new PDF in their mind.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.360]   - But if they were creating transmedia
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.880]   from the beginning, it would be a different process.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.680]   I'm not saying it's simple, but I know I spent five years
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.880]   on my own talk show trying to develop a kind of
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.560]   shoot, once run, anywhere model.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.680]   I mean, it's weak and it's small and it's indie,
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.880]   but I think if you had a little more resource
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.640]   and they, you know, a studio certainly do,
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.080]   there are ways to do it.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:48.960]   There are ways to create,
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.440]   if you put a little more time and money
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:53.520]   up front in the creation, then you've got it.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.520]   You can make, you know, the app piece of it
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:56.520]   that lets you upgrade.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.720]   And the social gaming possibilities to me
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.280]   of this device are pretty awesome.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.280]   - You better if it had multitasking.
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:03.280]   - Oh. - Yeah.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.080]   - Oh. - That's the only,
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.600]   no, it's the first thing I thought of too,
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.200]   and it kind of bugs me because you're only,
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.720]   it's almost like going back to DOS,
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.440]   where you're going to do one thing at a time.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.360]   - What if you make an app that puts multiple things
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.760]   in the app? - You'd have to do it that way.
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:16.640]   In fact, that's how we would,
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.520]   if we did a Twid app for it, that's what we would do.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.040]   You'd have, 'cause I'd like to have chat
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.840]   at the same time as you're watching or listening,
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:22.680]   but in order to do that,
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.200]   you'd have to make an app that has it all built in.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.240]   You can't just kind of have one going
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:28.320]   in the background while the other's going.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:29.400]   - But then at least you'd see it all along.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:30.240]   - It's not ideal.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:33.200]   You know, I wonder if the reason there's no multitasking
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.540]   is because it needed to be compatible
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:37.800]   with the iPhone, the iPod touch, and they don't,
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.320]   for good reasons, they don't support it.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.640]   I mean, when you have such a limited device,
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:44.560]   I can, you know, I crashed my Nexus One Gina today.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.960]   Well, I was trying to listen to a podcast
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.640]   and listen hadn't downloaded it.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.120]   So I put dog catcher on there
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.840]   and it started downloading in the background
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:53.840]   and it used up all the CPU cycles.
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:55.600]   And I couldn't dial the phone,
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.280]   I couldn't do anything to the phone, I rebooted it.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:00.400]   And I had to kind of trickly, quickly before dog catcher
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.920]   launched its task, get in there and uninstall.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.560]   I mean, it took me 45 minutes
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.320]   before the phone was functional again.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.160]   - Really?
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:09.840]   So when it crashed, it just froze completely?
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.560]   - And it only responded to the power button
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.680]   or was there some sort of...
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.120]   - So you push the application button
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:18.440]   and the application slow.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.040]   - Oh, wow.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.160]   - It was so tied up, and this is the problem
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:25.760]   with multitasking is you've got these very limited processors
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.520]   with very limited RAM and it's hard for them
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:30.520]   to do more than one thing in a time.
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:34.560]   And when it's a phone, I think it's okay to say
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:38.240]   the phone has to be able to work as a phone all the time.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.560]   It cannot be tied up.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:44.240]   But when it's a pad, then I think it's okay to have multitasking
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.800]   because first you have a little more RAM,
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.280]   you presumably have a little more power
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.800]   and maybe you don't need to be so concerned.
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.240]   - But get out of mobile think.
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:54.440]   So Heather's sitting there on her couch,
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:57.480]   she's using this device and she's got Bluetooth,
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.040]   heads that on and it's her phone.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.600]   - Well, it's...
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:03.000]   - Yeah, I've ran on.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.080]   - It's your desk, it's still a phone then.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.040]   - Why do I need both?
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.120]   I mean, I do for when I don't have wifi,
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.920]   but when I have wifi, I'd be really happy
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:13.920]   for it to be my phone.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.880]   - Well, presumably they'll allow Skype on it
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.360]   and it does have a microphone.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:19.960]   - That's why I want there to be a camera.
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.560]   I do tons of video chat.
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.320]   - Well, I'm sure versions you'll have a camera.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:24.360]   - I'm sure the version too will have it too.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:26.960]   - Heather will be doing podcasts with you, Leo,
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:28.200]   on her new pad before--
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:29.040]   - No, it could be the--
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.560]   - It could be the name of the podcast.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.160]   - And I'll be running around the neighborhood
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.640]   and even getting a tour while I do it.
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.400]   - Are you ready for podcasting?
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.720]   - Padcasting.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.040]   - I hated podcasting.
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:40.200]   I can't even imagine calling it a podcast.
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.720]   - Pwn, I'm going with the iPhone.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:42.800]   - I pwned.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:46.200]   - The question, the multitasking thing,
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.800]   I mean, this is a computer science problem,
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:49.320]   which has existed since, you know,
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:50.880]   for decades at this point.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:52.520]   You know, this isn't a new issue.
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:54.600]   We're just dealing with limited resources again.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:55.640]   It became less of an issue
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:57.800]   when you had really powerful desktop computers.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:58.640]   - Right.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.080]   - It seems like, I have to say,
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:02.000]   if your Nexus One froze like that
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.160]   and couldn't recover itself,
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:06.560]   couldn't, didn't know well enough
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:08.160]   to kill the process on its own or whatever,
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.120]   that's just bad design.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.840]   I mean, it should show that if it slowed down at that point,
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:12.920]   it's like you have 45 minutes
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.080]   to get it back into a functional state,
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.160]   that's just unacceptable.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:16.000]   - I agree.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:16.840]   - Definitely.
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:17.680]   - I agree.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:18.680]   - And you know, the iPhone,
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.160]   when something crashes on the iPhone,
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.000]   it just shuts, you know, just closes, right?
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.440]   Like the process, you know, just closes,
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:24.680]   which is also kind of weird
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:25.920]   because it doesn't give you an error message or whatever,
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:27.240]   but at least it just--
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.520]   - You don't lose phone functionality
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.480]   and that's the key to the whole thing.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:35.080]   And I can understand why it needs to be that way.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:36.360]   But I don't understand on a pad,
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.360]   but unless you're starting to now use it for communications.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:39.360]   - I don't know.
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:42.000]   I would and I think once they put a video camera in it.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.400]   - Well, that's gonna be the maxi pad.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.400]   That's the next generation.
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.360]   - Maxi pad, oh, you've already made it.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.200]   (laughing)
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.760]   Great.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.080]   - Can we just go back to the name thing?
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:50.920]   I just want--
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:52.760]   - It's a little offensive.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:54.920]   - You know, why is it offensive?
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.960]   - Only not because, go ahead, Gina.
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.440]   Take it away, Gina.
[00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.560]   - All the jokes have been made, right?
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.840]   I just want to make it really, really cleared
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.440]   all our male listeners.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.440]   I don't want there to be any doubt in anyone's mind.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.960]   Like when an American woman hears the word pad,
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.120]   she thinks maxi pad.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.480]   And crunch pad is okay and think pad is okay
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.480]   because like the first word is the focus of the word.
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.840]   But iPad is pretty much all pad.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:18.680]   (laughing)
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.440]   So we haven't associated the word pad with maxi pad.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.360]   So what amazes me is that there was this like meeting
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.200]   of like Apple's marketing department.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:29.240]   And Nate decided that they were gonna take the risk
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:34.240]   of having 50% of their market associate this device
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.560]   with a maxi pad and like some maxi pad.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.840]   - I had no idea.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.760]   - This is the responsiveness you guys is never,
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.040]   and this is true to me of most things
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.440]   that people call sexist to racist.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.720]   Well, I shouldn't say speak for racism,
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.360]   but it's not like the thing in of itself is that horrible.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.360]   It's that it's clear that you ignored all those people
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.520]   and you never considered them as though they were part of,
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.920]   and they clearly weren't in the room
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.520]   or couldn't we're not in the room.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.360]   - No, it's funny.
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.120]   - What's the Barnes and Noble ebook they called again?
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.560]   - The Nook E-Reader.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.400]   - Nook E.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.920]   - And so again, they didn't ask you in the teenager.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.760]   - Right.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.400]   - And hey, the wee. - The Ouija and Hart.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.720]   - And the wee, which.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.760]   - The wee, but this is the thing.
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.640]   Like the wee is kind of a goofy name
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.840]   that maybe three year olds use to describe, you know,
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.200]   their private parts, you know.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.280]   The Nook is kind of like also a teenager.
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.280]   Pat is just, it's just not, it's not a good,
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.320]   women just don't have good,
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.560]   I have a hard time writing about it.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.760]   Like I don't wanna, I don't wanna write it.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.000]   - That's 'cause I feel kind of close.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:25.840]   - It's just getting another name.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.160]   - No, it's funny, my wife and daughter
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.960]   said the same thing to me yesterday.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.800]   And it's true, a guy doesn't really,
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.760]   doesn't leap to mind.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.360]   It's funny because you'd think it'd be a guy would be more
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.720]   offended by it than a woman.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:36.560]   I don't understand.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.920]   - The offense is not that it's bad that you mention
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.640]   something in your menstruation.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.840]   I mean, I don't care about that.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:45.800]   It's the business, it's the ignoring people in the process.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.400]   And acting as though you're not gonna buy it
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.440]   nor were you gonna name it.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.280]   It's not the.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.440]   - But women wouldn't avoid it because of the name, right?
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.280]   You wouldn't not buy it.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.280]   - No, no, we wouldn't let you know that they ignored you.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.320]   And they thought you weren't really part of the whole thing.
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.160]   It's like.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.480]   - Well, can I say just in defense?
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:04.200]   - The tutors is not named for me to go, well, maybe me,
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.040]   but I don't know.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.840]   - But can I say in their defense, it's not,
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.120]   it wasn't, it was, they just didn't know.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.240]   We didn't know.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.760]   - Why were there no women in all of them?
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:13.600]   - There are no women.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.440]   That's a bigger complaint.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.440]   - That's what we're talking about.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.480]   - But as a chief in the marketing department,
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:19.560]   someone would have said, someone would have put the brakes
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.400]   on it.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.960]   This is the thing that's so incredible to me is that
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.240]   I think it's one of the biggest marketful laws
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.760]   that ever made.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.600]   - That's what we're saying.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.400]   - It's kind of amazing because they're so good at marketing
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.760]   and then they're pretty good at names.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.240]   I mean, the eye thing is getting a little old,
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.600]   but for the most part, it's worked.
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.240]   And I think that their marketing is always just absolutely
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:39.000]   pristine and perfectly straight on, but woo, this was bad.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   - Steve Jobs, when Walt Mossberg asked him about it,
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.040]   Steve's response, and it's on video,
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.840]   Cara Schwisher was there with a flip camera.
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:51.240]   And his response was, you know, people hate an iPod too,
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.720]   they'll get over it, they'll get used to it,
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.720]   they'll incorporate it.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.360]   I think there's a real cluelessness.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.680]   - Well, they will, but it also doesn't,
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.520]   it doesn't relate to me.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.000]   It was a long time ago, it was at Apple,
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.680]   but it definitely wasn't that gender savvy back in the day.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:03.520]   - Yeah.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.360]   - So it's--
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:07.880]   - Well, in some point, it goes through a company being open.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.200]   - Good point.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.640]   - As antithetical as it is to think so,
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.160]   to release the names beforehand and be clued in
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.520]   by their users.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.320]   Jita, you have been right on it saying, are you nuts?
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.600]   (laughs)
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.240]   - Right, right.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.760]   - Spider in our chat room says he's developing a stylus
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.840]   for the iPad called the 10 Pen.
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.280]   - 10 Pen?
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.360]   - Here we go.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.080]   - So I haven't heard that one anyway, that's a new one.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.240]   There aren't that many new jokes though.
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:40.040]   - I said the pricing model was light, medium, heavy.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:40.880]   (laughs)
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.800]   I mean, sorry, this is never a story.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.160]   - So there's two issues here, one is that.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.640]   The other big, bigger real issue is,
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.840]   are there actually no women,
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.080]   but do we know that there are no women?
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:53.280]   I know there's women in the marketing department at Apple.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.360]   Maybe they don't have any clout.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.600]   - I haven't been there in a while long enough to know,
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.920]   I mean, Katie Cotton used to run this.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.000]   - Katie Cotton's still there.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.840]   I worked with her, I get that's how long she's been there.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.360]   Yeah, but you know, it's one thing to work there,
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.040]   it's another to have any real input,
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:04.880]   that someone listens to you.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:05.720]   - That's the question.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.280]   - Were there any women on stage at that event?
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.120]   - No.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:09.960]   - When is Apple?
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.520]   I ask you, everybody out there who loves Apple,
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.280]   including me, when have you seen a woman on stage,
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.120]   "Rapple?"
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:15.960]   - Never.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.800]   - You never have to do it.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.640]   - Not for Apple, but a partner was on stage.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.120]   - Which partner?
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.920]   - Her name, she was terrible, by the way.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.800]   That's why I remember her.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.960]   She was with the brand or one of the other people,
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.080]   and she was a partner when the iPhone announcement
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:27.920]   that had been on stage.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.640]   - It's just sad, it's just--
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.360]   - But that's one woman in four years.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:32.960]   - It's pathetic.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.240]   I don't know that there's ever been a singer.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.400]   - Roshoe, thank you, it was Roshoe.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:37.520]   - When has there been a senior woman
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.360]   executive at the top?
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:39.680]   - She was with Microsoft, business.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.440]   - At Apple, other than, well I guess PR,
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.520]   I mean, Katie's pretty behind.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.360]   - Okay.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.200]   - Who will you seek by a few?
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.960]   - Yeah, Marissa Meyer would never have allowed us.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.120]   - Marissa Meyer would have occurred to her
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:49.960]   as a child.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.120]   - Yeah, Marissa Meyer would have stopped this dead.
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:52.960]   I'm sure.
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.160]   - She's probably laughing.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.480]   - I'm, this is just my prediction,
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.680]   I would love to ask her about it, but yeah.
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.200]   - She's probably laughing.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.880]   - But it's just the name, come on, right?
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:02.720]   I mean, it's just the name.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.400]   - It's just the name, I'll totally get over it.
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.400]   I'm not gonna, we're never gonna have to talk about it again,
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.600]   but it's just your tablet or something else.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.720]   - I mean, I, you know, when I write about it,
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.000]   call it the iPad, 'cause, you know,
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.320]   when people Google the iPad,
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:18.240]   I want them to find the right things on my site, you know,
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.400]   but it's just one of those things where I just think
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.960]   it's important, there are a lot of jokes
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.440]   and people are saying, well, it's not that bad,
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.280]   it looks like I--
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.760]   - I need the right point, you know, that is the point.
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.400]   - That's the point, and so I'm over it,
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.400]   and maybe we will get used to it,
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.680]   maybe I won't ever think about it again,
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.440]   but for right now, it really felt like, wow,
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.440]   this is really big mistake.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.440]   - And my wife and daughter who are not in the tech industry
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.480]   don't really care about it,
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.440]   had that immediate reaction as well, so.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.280]   - That's what they're trying to sell.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.360]   - I think it's, yeah, it's gonna be a universal reaction, so.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.800]   - Yeah, pretty much.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.000]   - It's a pretty big, you know, strange thing.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:48.840]   - What else?
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:52.240]   I don't wanna, I could talk about that iPad forever.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.480]   - Well, Jeff doesn't have a number,
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:55.120]   but Jeff was, in lieu of a number,
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.480]   Jeff was gonna take us downstairs to see the party,
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.320]   you wanna do that?
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.800]   - No way.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.560]   - Yeah, let's try it, he's on a laptop.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.480]   - All right, Jeff.
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.480]   - The big gala is going on.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.960]   - I think you're gonna talk and we'll walk in.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.280]   - He's missing the big Davos gala right now.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.200]   - Is Angelina Jolie down there?
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.280]   - I'm sure she is.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:13.040]   - No, no stars this year.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.800]   - No stars, not even Robert Scoble.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.640]   - No stars, no, Charlie Rose,
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.480]   I think is probably the biggest.
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.840]   - Jesus star.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:20.680]   - That's pretty much it.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.520]   - He's a star.
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.360]   - This is cool.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.200]   - Really?
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.080]   - I think I've seen the best name.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.160]   - This is, yes.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.920]   Another word.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.400]   I may have dropped out earlier at Yale,
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.480]   but I know the word.
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.440]   So.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.280]   - You're smart.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.840]   - I think we could do every show walking.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:36.680]   - I know, I love this.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.240]   - It's really cool, I love that.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.080]   Oh wow.
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.520]   - This is something you cannot do.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.680]   - This is what you're missing people
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:45.760]   by not running a Fortune 100 company, if that's not--
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.080]   - Or being a blogger.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.120]   He's Jeff Sears a blogger.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:49.960]   - You're so dressed that.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.520]   - Okay, I'm all announced, Sarah's in a second.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.920]   - I'm still adjusting to that guy.
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:57.880]   - I could take you by the YouTube booth.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.520]   Here is the South African swag we're gonna get.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.880]   It's a two gig thumb drive.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:04.720]   - That's small.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.800]   - I don't know what that has in South Africa.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.200]   - Oh, there'll be press materials on it,
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.200]   that's what it does.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.440]   - Okay, well, I'm going down the stairs
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.920]   into the main conference room,
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:17.720]   trying not to fall on my ass doing so.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:23.040]   - Okay, here we are in the main party.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:27.240]   - Wow, look at that.
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.080]   - From the internet.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.720]   - Wow, we're on the internet.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:34.360]   - You're from here South Africa, yeah?
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:35.200]   What's your name?
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:39.120]   To be sued, so you're on a podcast called
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.080]   This Week in Google.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.040]   - Jeff, you're gonna have to hold the microphone up to him.
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:42.880]   - Yeah, I can't.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.720]   - Unfortunately, we can't really hear him.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.560]   - Okay, thank you very much.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.120]   We're three months to party.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.720]   - Well, yeah.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.200]   - Almost ran into a delegate.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.200]   There's an ice-
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.040]   - We're in the main room.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:51.880]   - I'm in the main room.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.720]   - Of an Ibex, I think.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.560]   - First food.
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:56.680]   - How white is the party, Jeff?
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:58.760]   (laughs)
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:01.760]   - I can't hear you.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.080]   - She wanna know how white the party was.
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.440]   How white is the party?
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.840]   - Here's a gentleman painting.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:13.000]   - Oh, that's pretty.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:13.840]   - No.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.680]   - That's neat.
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:15.520]   - Really new.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.960]   - Okay, you want me to go into the hip room
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.160]   where the rock music is?
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:25.080]   - Yeah, let's see if you can find Eric,
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.920]   or a Sergey or Larry.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.240]   - I want, you know what I want, Jeff?
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.240]   You're gonna have some fun.
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:30.840]   Please find a venture capitalist
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.320]   or a very leading politician
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.400]   and make them dance with you for us, please.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.440]   - There was video of Bill Gates dancing.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:39.840]   I don't remember. - That's awesome.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:40.840]   - It was pretty funny.
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.480]   - There.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.680]   - I wanna see that.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:44.760]   - I've danced with Bill Gates.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:45.600]   - No way.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:46.360]   - He does the white man,
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.080]   calm decks, he does the white man's underbite.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:48.920]   Yep.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.240]   - You've danced with Bill Gates.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:55.000]   - Well, next to him, parallel dancing.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.360]   I didn't like, I wasn't holding him.
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.640]   - You went to watch Manly affection.
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:58.640]   - Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.200]   - We just lost Jeff's connection.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.040]   - Oh.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.280]   - Leo, I would have paid a lot of money
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.080]   to see you dancing in parallel dancing.
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:06.920]   (laughing)
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.480]   I don't feel like you really would have that.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.600]   That would have been a highlight.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.800]   I feel like just the fact that you said
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.760]   that happened at all.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.880]   I'm getting such a pleasure from thinking about that.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:15.480]   - Oh, can I show you this is how he dances?
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.320]   - He did it. - And I'm not kidding.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:17.160]   - Do it.
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.480]   No way.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.840]   - It is totally the like guys over fight.
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:21.840]   - Oh, totally.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:26.000]   It was, it was, and you kinda had his butt like stuck out.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.320]   - Oh, nice.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.240]   - I think there's new video of him dancing though.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.800]   I remember seeing this on the internet recently.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.800]   It was at Sundance.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:35.640]   It was at Sundance.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.000]   He partyed at Sundance.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.360]   Well, he wasn't. - He was at Sundance.
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.880]   - Well, he's a philanthropist now.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.360]   Probably couldn't get an invite to Davos, I don't know.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.200]   (laughing)
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.120]   - I'm really, I wanna find the Bill Gates dancing.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.320]   - Gina, can I ask you a question?
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:52.720]   How do you feel about like how much people
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.120]   in this like Twitter army like you?
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.200]   - They adore Gina.
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.480]   - They adore you and it's not in this kind of gross
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.280]   you're a pinup girl like,
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.560]   - Oh no, no, no, she's respected.
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.880]   - They like have mad respect for you.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.240]   - Yeah.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:08.200]   - I really feel like I'm--
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.720]   - I think you're a little jealous actually.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:11.160]   - I just feel like, can I never measure up to you?
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.000]   I know that.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.640]   (laughing)
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.480]   Like geeky too.
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.840]   - That is very sweet.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:19.480]   I deeply, deeply honored and privileged.
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.640]   (laughing)
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.840]   And the feeling is mutual.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:22.680]   - Aw. - Everyone is real.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:24.160]   - Everybody loves everybody here.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.200]   - So let me ask you a question.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.760]   So if Twitter said we're gonna have you be in this,
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.720]   I mean Vanity Fair said we're gonna take this,
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.560]   do this article,
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.320]   will you compose naked in a raincoat and high heels?
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.160]   - Oh no, she never did that.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.080]   - But that's would you do that.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:35.920]   - Here's Bill Gates.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.840]   - Vanity Fair would ne--
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:39.600]   Oh nice, Bill Gates dancing on screen.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:40.640]   That's fantastic.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.560]   - It's not a video but a multi shot.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.120]   - That's fantastic.
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.440]   - Yeah, it looks like he's playing air guitar.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:48.920]   I'm afraid.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:49.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.600]   - Heather, I can assure you,
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:53.560]   Vanity Fair will never ask me to get naked into a raincoat.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:54.840]   I just, I don't--
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:56.320]   - Did they do that to somebody else recently?
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:57.160]   - We did it.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.000]   We talked about it in Tamil Vision.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.400]   They did a piece a couple of weeks ago.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.240]   - Oh I saw that.
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.800]   - Twiliberty, where they picked a bunch of women
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.040]   with large follower numbers,
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.040]   including Felicia Day and--
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:07.600]   - There's a weight ceiling on that,
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.920]   which I am well above.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.240]   (laughing)
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.600]   To be very quite honest.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.360]   (laughing)
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.760]   - Yeah, I thought that was completely horrible.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:19.640]   - Yeah, I think it kinda caused this big response
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:22.440]   on the social media blogging world,
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.400]   which I try not to dip into too much,
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:25.800]   but it was kind of weird,
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.440]   and it was a very disparaging piece
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.120]   about Twitter, the platform in general.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:32.720]   Just kind of people talking about the old same old thing.
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:37.040]   - So, yeah, it's Vanity Fair, what'd you expect?
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:37.880]   - Right.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:38.720]   - Deep thought.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.680]   - Well then they had a larger piece on,
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.920]   oh God, who was it the next week?
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.920]   Let it not be Ashton Kutcher, somebody,
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.320]   anyway, it'll come back to me.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:48.720]   Kevin Rose, somebody was showing me,
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.320]   I think it was, no, I'm sorry.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.160]   - Wasn't Kevin, I'm sure.
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.360]   - I'm mixing it up with Fast Company,
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.920]   Rob Tua, but did a kinda hunky picture.
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:55.760]   Okay, easy back.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:56.600]   - We got Jeff back, yeah.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.560]   - I'm back, I'm in the YouTube booth.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.400]   - Ooh.
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.200]   - Sorry, the wifi ended on the way to the hip party.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.040]   - That's okay.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.560]   (laughing)
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.400]   Now Jeff is--
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:05.880]   - Is it a big thing or not?
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.400]   - Yeah, we got a great view.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.240]   - All right, good.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:11.640]   - This is Jeff Jarvis in Davos, Switzerland?
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:14.800]   - No, I'm in a chair that swivels, so I can make you all--
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.400]   - Oh, I'm getting sick.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.760]   (laughing)
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.520]   - This is how James Cameron did Titanic, actually.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.720]   - This is great, you're taping something
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:26.080]   that's gonna be on YouTube, eventually.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:26.920]   - Yeah.
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:27.760]   - That's right.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.880]   - Jeff Jarvis dances.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:31.200]   (laughing)
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:34.360]   Bite your lower lip and you got it made.
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:38.840]   Well, we're gonna wrap this up with our usual tip of the week
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:39.840]   and tool of the week.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.440]   We won't do number of the week 'cause Jeff doesn't--
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:43.520]   - Got a party instead.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:46.440]   - Jeff is at a, yeah, we got a party instead, that's right.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.400]   Although I did, I think I bookmarked something
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.280]   that I thought you might use for a number.
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.920]   Let me see if-- - Ah, good.
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.840]   - Can find that, what was it?
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:58.480]   Oh well, I don't remember off the top of my head.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:01.640]   Gina, what's your tip of the week?
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.080]   - Okay, my tip this week, I'm giving this a little blind
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.520]   because I haven't used an iPhone in a while,
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.600]   but my tip this week is for Google Voice users
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:12.800]   who are using the new web app on the iPhone.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.440]   I had Greg from DC wrote me and said
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.040]   that a really good thing to do with the Google Voice web app
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.480]   is that you can actually bookmark contacts
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.400]   and put them on your iPhone's home screen.
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.840]   And so that gives you access if you wanna search
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.360]   for a contact from your quick search box
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.840]   or if there's certain people who you call over
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.240]   and over with Google Voice.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.800]   Since it's a web app and not a native app,
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.320]   it's not integrated with your contacts on your iPhone.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.840]   But if you bookmark a contact, each contact has a permalink.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.880]   You can just tap that person and initiate a call
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.080]   through Google Voice easily.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.440]   So thanks to Greg for sending that one in
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.840]   and I hope someone will correct me
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.880]   if that doesn't work as advertised.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.120]   - That's great though, that gives you like 90%
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.680]   of the functionality you'd wanna get in a Google Voice app.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.200]   It'd be nice to have my voicemail and all that.
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.880]   - That's the extension, the Chrome extension?
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.800]   - No, it's for an iPhone. - No, it's for an iPhone.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.480]   - Yeah, on the iPhone, you can just add it to your home screen.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.280]   - No, there's one contact that you call on.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:10.120]   - And was it Google that did this?
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:13.000]   - Yeah, this is just the Google.com/voice,
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.680]   just the web app that you visited on the iPhone.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:18.120]   It's a brand new overhaul interface
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.720]   that they just launched this week.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.280]   - Fantastic.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.560]   - They're suggesting in the chatroom
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.360]   that a number for a Jeff would be 270,
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.320]   that's how much it costs, according to one Wall Street
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.560]   analyst, to build an iPad.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.680]   - Thank you, chatroom.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.720]   - That's a good number.
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.880]   That means they have $200 a profit built into each
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:35.880]   and every one, that ain't bad.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:37.240]   I find that a little hard to believe,
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.520]   'cause I think Apple's time.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:39.760]   - We'll see the teardown soon.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.080]   Don't forget there's development money
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.200]   that went into the chip.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.440]   - Right, good point.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:44.800]   But not just the chip, the whole thing.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.000]   They've been working on it since 2003.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.960]   - All the money they spent coming up with the name,
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:48.800]   that was expensive.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.880]   - Yeah, oh man, that was expensive.
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:52.960]   That branding guy, boy, he costs a lot of money.
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:55.120]   - Wait till you find out that it was a woman who did it.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.280]   - Oh, let's have a round.
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.880]   - Yeah, that'll be a good one.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.040]   Here we are sitting around saying,
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.720]   this guy didn't even have a girlfriend.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:02.040]   - Well, yeah, let's be honest,
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.440]   there are always people who will kind of work against
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.440]   their own interests, so I know in Hollywood,
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:10.080]   I worked with plenty of women who are happy to advocate
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:12.680]   tarding stuff up in bizarre ways.
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.360]   So I made it as possible a woman theoretically could have
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:16.760]   done it in an odd way.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:19.120]   - I think by the way, the use of the word tarding
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.320]   is offensive to charts.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.760]   So can you cut that out?
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.240]   - Sorry, strawberries are green.
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:27.280]   - Here's another number, one more number.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.840]   This is from Eric Schmidt.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:35.120]   And it comes from an article in the City Herald City,
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.360]   University of London.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.560]   The prospect that Google's business in China
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.000]   might not reach his fifth birthday
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.320]   must be particularly difficult for Eric Schmidt.
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.400]   As Google's chief executive, he claimed to have,
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.080]   and here's our number 5,000 years of patience
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.280]   for Google's business in China.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:56.040]   That's about as long as China's been around.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.280]   - Oh well. - Oh well.
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.680]   Couple of numbers there, see?
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.600]   And finally, yes, my tip is a Google Friend Connect tip.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.080]   I use Friend Connect on my blog.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.120]   I think it's kind of cool.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.560]   It allows, in fact I'll show you my blog at leoville.com.
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:13.240]   It allows people to sign up and become your friends,
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.360]   I guess it adds some social to a blog.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.960]   So it's a little widget you could put on your blog
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.440]   and I have 1,100 members of the blog.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:26.240]   But you can sign in and so forth and you get avatars.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.160]   But here's a new feature.
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:30.360]   But also, if I should sign in because it'll show it
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.760]   on my blog, it also now allows you,
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.520]   oh, don't look, I'm gonna enter my password.
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:39.880]   You didn't actually have to look away, that's okay.
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.320]   Heather looked away, I thought that was very sweet of you.
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.800]   (laughing)
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.320]   So now, if you go to your blog
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:48.920]   and you have Google Friend Connect on it,
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:51.600]   it says find out more about your visitor's interests.
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:55.280]   Perhaps not the best language Google should have used.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.240]   But what it is, is a poll.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.560]   - I like that they didn't assume they were friends.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:00.400]   That's kinda nice.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.840]   - So you can now add a poll gadget
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.480]   to your Google Friend Connect.
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.680]   And this is kinda nice.
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:09.200]   So basically, just by embedding Google's Friend Connect
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:11.600]   into my blog, I now have the ability to add polls.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:12.440]   - It is nice.
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.080]   - I can ask them all sorts of stuff,
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.480]   basic questions about location and gender.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.520]   I could say, what's your gender?
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.360]   Do you like the name iPad, for instance?
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:23.280]   - And they resell this data to everyone.
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.120]   - Oh.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:24.960]   - I'm sure they do.
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:25.800]   Nevermind.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:26.640]   - Sorry.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.480]   - Forget I mentioned it.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:28.800]   - I'm sorry, I spent some time with a friend
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.760]   who does all this SEO crap the other day.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:31.600]   - You think they really used it?
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.400]   - And from what he told me, yeah, like they sell
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.800]   not only stuff based on people purchase
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.080]   or click through on your site.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.440]   There's a lot of tracking the cookies of who comes through
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.360]   and then running crazy algorithms.
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.360]   Who knows if it works?
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:44.200]   I don't know.
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.040]   - No, you've got a point.
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.040]   - They're finding out trends of who goes where.
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.360]   And there's like multiple levels of sales
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.280]   of so-called marketing traffic data.
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:53.200]   So I'm sorry, it's the first thing that came to my mind.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.360]   - I like them. - So this is what, for instance,
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.920]   if I just added that poll, congratulations, Leo.
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.040]   When they join you, just join Leo,
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.960]   and Leo, Leo, another's no more about you.
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:02.800]   What's your gender?
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.880]   - You wanna be PC, you add another dot, you know.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.400]   - I should add a third.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:09.320]   - Pick your own choice, your choice, unknown.
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.560]   - Yeah, take your choice.
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.160]   - GLBTQS349.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.640]   - There are so many genders at this point, Leo,
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:18.280]   when I perform in the alphabet community.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.200]   - It's so confusing.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.600]   - I just let everyone pick their own.
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.680]   - Pick your own, you know what?
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:22.800]   - You could be a silon,
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.640]   you could be whatever you want.
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.840]   - We're post-modern here, we don't have gender.
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.080]   - You may not have one.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:27.960]   - Who made genders of--
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:28.920]   - You may have multiple.
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.280]   - Arcane concept.
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:31.120]   - You may be transplacing.
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.320]   - Is it good on a good choice?
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.400]   - Silon, I'm silon.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:34.320]   - I want to do choice.
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.160]   - Why not?
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.000]   - Okay, you know what?
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:36.840]   - Let's put that as an option.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:39.440]   - I'm adding silon to my poll, that's fantastic.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.480]   But of course, you know when you do that,
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.280]   99% pick silon.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.240]   - Can they get to add their own option in there?
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:48.000]   - Sure, sure, I can add all sorts of,
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   oh, do you mean they add their own?
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.680]   - Yeah, like, I like that in polls
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.920]   where you can give an option for people to input
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:53.920]   or descriptive language.
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:55.520]   - It's very, I was very impressed.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:57.720]   It's a very sophisticated polling widget
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:00.200]   that actually gives you more capabilities than,
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.280]   so you can add text, paragraph text, multiple choice,
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.960]   checks boxes, choose from a list.
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:07.160]   It's a very flexible polling widget, I really like it.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:11.400]   You know, it's nice.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.560]   - So that's my tool of the week,
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.680]   if you want to add polls
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.160]   and you're already using Google Friend Connect
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:16.600]   or if you're not using Google Friend Connect,
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.000]   you might want to take a look at it.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.600]   This way, all your friends information
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:20.760]   will be known by Google.
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:23.120]   Why should they have any more privacy than you do?
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:23.960]   Think about it.
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.680]   (laughing)
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:30.480]   Gina Trapani is the creator of smartherware.org.
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.760]   That's her blog, but she also is seen
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:35.440]   in many other venues, including, of course,
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.480]   the Harvard Business Review.
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.320]   We won't hold that against her, Heather.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.920]   - She's the coolest thing on the Harvard Business Review.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.760]   - Yeah, she is.
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:43.600]   - Pretty much.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.720]   - And in a raincoat, we all love her.
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:46.840]   (laughing)
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:47.680]   - Thank you, Leo.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:50.440]   Completewaveguide.com is where the book is.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.320]   Jeff Jarvis did "YomenDuty"
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.840]   taking us to Davos Switzerland
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:54.720]   in the middle of the night.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:55.720]   - Mm.
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:56.560]   - Yeah, everybody's tired.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.400]   Everybody's gone home.
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:59.360]   The YouTube booth's empty.
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.200]   - Yep.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.840]   - There's nobody there.
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.040]   Well, go ahead and flip the switch
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.960]   and just like, you know, do something funny.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.040]   Do something weird on YouTube.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.920]   They left the server up.
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:09.760]   - Thank you, Jeff.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.640]   Jeff's blog is Buzzmachine.com.
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.000]   That's where you can see the full article
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.280]   on what he learned with his special exclusive
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:19.160]   super duper meeting with Erica Schmidt
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.760]   and Marissa Meyer in the gang.
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:25.240]   And Heather Gold is a performer,
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:27.880]   a comic and the host of "Tumble Vision" here
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.400]   on the Twit Network.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.600]   Is that every Tuesday night?
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.760]   - Thursday at seven.
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.600]   - Thursday at seven PM.
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:33.560]   - Seven PM at the center time.
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.360]   And I actually have some kind of,
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.920]   are we allowed to plug at this point?
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.160]   - I just plugged them.
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:40.680]   - I have a, I'm doing a couple of workshops,
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:41.920]   one here in San Francisco.
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.440]   We got it a second one, the fifth of February
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:46.320]   and there's one March 27th, New York
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.960]   and presenting.com.
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.600]   Speaking skills, how did "Tumble"
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.920]   how to engage the room, how to be yourself in public
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:52.760]   and feel about that?
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:53.560]   - Unpresenting, you call it.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.480]   - Yes, 'cause half of it's unlearning.
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:56.320]   - That's great.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.760]   - The bad crap that people think
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:59.120]   they have to do to get listened to.
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:01.400]   Don't try to be Steve Jobs, just be you
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:02.560]   in public a little better.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.400]   It works really well.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.440]   - I have, I've been reading a book called
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.000]   "The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs"
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.080]   and I realize I can't.
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.440]   - I totally had an argument that guy on Twitter.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.400]   I think it's a giant mistake.
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.960]   - It's got good information, but you can't be Steve Jobs.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.240]   - No, you can't.
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.120]   So it's a waste of time.
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:17.960]   Be you.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.520]   He also cannot be you.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:20.760]   - That's true.
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:23.160]   - Why assume that you don't, you may have some
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.160]   massively important thing.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.440]   You certainly wouldn't have called your device the iPad
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:27.920]   so you've got one up on him.
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.040]   - There you go, there you go.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.440]   Thank you Heather, great to have you.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.760]   We'll catch you Thursday night on "Tumble Vision"
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.360]   on live.twit.tv.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.320]   - "Tumble with M's."
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.600]   I know it's a new weird word,
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:38.960]   but you explain it on the show.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:39.800]   It makes sense.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:40.640]   - It's a Yiddish word.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:42.160]   - It's a Yiddish word, it means the act
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:45.040]   of social engagement, someone who mixes things up.
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:46.880]   - Yeah, and that's your expertise.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.880]   - Yes, and we have lots of good Kathy's here last week.
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:50.720]   She was awesome.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:51.560]   - She's great.
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:52.560]   I think she's fascinating.
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:53.680]   - And you know what I have next week?
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:55.520]   I have to say this is, I'm pretty excited.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:57.760]   Ali Willis, who is an amazing songwriter.
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:00.960]   She wrote "Earth Wind and Fires, Boogie Wonderland,"
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:03.280]   September, she wrote "New Tron Dance,"
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.520]   she wrote "Color Purple" soundtrack
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:06.760]   short "The Theme Sign of Friends,"
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:09.320]   and she's an incredible artist in multiple levels
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:12.040]   and has been doing online community stuff
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:13.400]   since super early days.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:14.240]   - Wow.
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.920]   - She's a super infamous party thrower.
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:17.080]   I'm gonna talk to her a lot about parties
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.200]   and I think I'm gonna go to one later this month.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.080]   So I, you know, she's pretty cool.
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.440]   I would tune in for her.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.400]   - All this Facebook stuff really is just
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.880]   thrown a party, isn't it?
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:27.480]   - Yeah, yeah, how do you get everyone out
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:28.600]   to have a really good time?
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.120]   Actually, very much, very much that's what you want, right?
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.640]   You want people involved and engaged.
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:33.720]   - Yeah, well that'll be fun.
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:34.560]   I can't wait to see that.
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.040]   She's got a cool site too.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.200]   - She's got incredible stuff.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:39.840]   Her site is so deep, it's insane.
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:41.440]   AliWillis.com.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:44.000]   Thanks for joining A-L-L-E-E.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:44.840]   Willis.com.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:46.120]   Thanks for joining us all.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:46.960]   We appreciate it.
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.040]   Well, thank you for being here.
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.440]   You can watch live every Saturday afternoon
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:54.200]   at 215 Pacific, 515 Eastern time.
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:58.360]   That's for Davos time, that's 11, 15 and 9.
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.640]   - Late, late, it's late.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.760]   - Way late, way too late for anybody
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:04.080]   of our age to be up, Jeff.
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.000]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:06.840]   Take care.
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:09.420]   (upbeat music)
[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:12.000]   (upbeat music)
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.580]   (upbeat music)
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:17.160]   (upbeat music)
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.160]   You
