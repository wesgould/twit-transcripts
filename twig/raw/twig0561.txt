[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.720]   for months. How we're strip mining the US economy. We'll also talk about that electric
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.000]   taste machine and the electric smell machine. You'll need to go with it. And the confusion
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.760]   of HBO Max launching today. It's all coming up next on Twig. This week at Google comes to you

[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.560]   we get together with two really smart, cool, fascinating people. And we chew the fat for a couple
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.840]   hours. I thought this show was long until I found out Joe Ruger does three hours routinely.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.640]   Welcome to my friend Jeff Jarvis. Wait a minute. I gotta get it. It's over here. I haven't written
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.320]   down. Jeff is the cat. Can you see me? The cat is camera right on. Jeff is, believe it or not,
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.120]   that guy with the Hello, my own fan. You're on Jeff. He's the letter to Professor for
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.160]   journalistic innovation. And I'm crazy. You are graduate school of journalism at the City
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.520]   University of New York, but he can't figure out how to use zoom. I'm just showing off my hair.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.480]   Nice hair. Oh, it's a nice ceiling fan. And a lovely ceiling fan.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.160]   It should be on the day. It looks like you've got some heat down there in Bedminster. No, it's
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.040]   nice. 70 degrees outside. Two windows open bird to stripping. The fox is running by. The deer
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.880]   running by. Yeah. I'll help you, Colin. And I did like to read. Yes. That is Stacey Higginbotham
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.480]   of the law for college and I do look that she is. Higginbotham and Jarvis. She is the host of Stacey
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.000]   on IoT's IoT podcast. And the major Domo at Stacey on IoT.com. I had to think of a term for you.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.480]   Major. I was wondering where you were going with that. What does that mean? The head of the house?
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.280]   I think so. Yeah, something like that. The person in charge. Hello, Stacey.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.760]   Hello. I'm glad to see the printers back after you're jot with the fancier skype types.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.160]   Oh, yes. You guys don't rape plants. Y'all don't rape the lavas every week. I'm sorry.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.360]   Andrew come and re-repossess the llama plant. They actually belong to Anna. Oh, that's cute.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.480]   So you borrowed them from Anna, but you had to give them back. Well, you know, we had to plug the
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.280]   printer back in. Yeah, you need a printer because do you really? What do you print?
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:56.160]   My data printer and I print. I've been planned. I've been printing floor plans.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:05.600]   Oh, the big move is coming. When do you move? The month. June something or other. Oh, so you're
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.240]   going to take the rest of this month, all three days and the first parts of June to remodel.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.880]   Theoretically, I mean, it won't all get done, but yeah, they're going to rip out carpet.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.840]   They're going to put some floors in. They are going to do some. They're literally
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.200]   no cabinets anywhere in the kitchen. So what? Those won't all be ready, but they're at the
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.560]   average lived there. I don't. People who did not cook. Yeah. Hey, as minimal as kitchens go,
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.040]   I love it, but I'm like, right? Where did they put anything? I can't make case someone here.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.200]   Exactly. There was no microwave. How could I melt the sheets? Oh, well, good. I'm
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:54.960]   envisioning Stacy with an iPad and she says, Wayfair and she clicks. So my mom would tell you that I
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.320]   am far too elitist for Wayfair. Yeah. Mom would be right. I suspect.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.920]   She's like, is this one of your elitist luxury purchases? And I'm like,
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:13.280]   yes, but it's the wire cutter best pick, mom. Yes, see, see, see, see. You know, that is a New
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.640]   York Times publication, you East Coast Elite snob. I do. I do.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.440]   Well, good. Congratulations on the new house. What do you do? What do you use to print your floor
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.680]   plans? Is there some special software we should know about? Y'all, I have been playing with software
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.920]   friend. Let me get the name of it. Right. So I've been playing with Modzy, Modzy, M-O-D-S-Y.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:44.560]   And then I've also been playing with software called Icovia, I-C-O-V-I-A.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.800]   Who this Modzy looks pretty sweet. So Modzy is really interesting. It's a venture back company
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.800]   in San Francisco. And they actually have done a lot of deals with companies like, I think West Elm,
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:05.040]   Creighton Barrel and CB2 and all of those. Oh, and Wayfair, look. But some companies, so like
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.040]   see me too. I have a lot of pottery barn stuff. I like the pottery barn stuff.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.880]   So you can go to, if you go to Modzy through one of their sites, what you do is you'll pay them
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.920]   $49 or $99 and they'll do a room for you. Oh my god. That's good for an interior design. Holy cow.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.600]   Well, caveats. Here are the caveats. If you go through one of the
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:37.600]   companies, they're going to obviously put stuff from that company. Yeah, but you get a credit
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:44.800]   towards merchandise that pays you back from the design. But they put other stuff in there.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.040]   And there's different price categories and it's lovely. So my daughter would do it in my daughter's.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.040]   Yeah. This is really interesting, Modzy. So you haven't decided yet if you're going to use them
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.840]   or their design or you just, so you just plan with it. I use their design for my daughter's room.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:08.640]   I'm probably going to also use it for my study. I've been thinking about paint swatches, but this
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.880]   is probably not this weekend Stacey's interior design. No, but I think this is actually very,
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.280]   this is perfect for the show because what this is. I mean, normally you would hire somebody to come in
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.360]   and she it's usually a woman would say, well, you know, tell me about your vision and
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.160]   she'd do a doesn't interior design for you. It'd be great expense. They'll they have deals just like
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.680]   Modzy. They have deals with the furniture supplies. In fact, we have a furniture store in town.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.800]   You can't go in unless you're an interior designer. They won't, you know, I don't want riffraff off
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:45.920]   the street. And this is this is like a much more, I think obviously much more affordable
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.360]   way to do it. And I bet you gives you as as good a result, maybe even better because you have
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.240]   more control over it. I'll tell you in two weeks when they're they're apparently redesigning spaces
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.120]   right now. So hot. Everybody's in their quarantine and they're like, Oh, yeah, nobody. Yeah. This is
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.120]   the contact free interior design. The other thing we found out is our we have a second freezer in
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:16.320]   the refrigerator and the in the garage. It died. Uh oh. You cannot get freezers of any sort. Yeah.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:24.640]   Right. Everything bought out. Is that weird? Yeah. Yeah. Everybody popping their crowd cow
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.840]   meat in there, which by the way, good service. Oh wait, crowd cow. Look, I'm giving crowd cow.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:37.200]   You it's a cow or crowd. Crowd. Crowd. Crowd. Your crowds. You're crowd sharing a cow.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:46.640]   Oh, I see. It's a local meat and they deliver. They deliver beef, but they also deliver chicken
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:59.600]   and other fish. Food. Little pricey. Little bit pricey. Yes, but it's it's local is the thing. It's
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:07.280]   local and sustainable. Um, I don't know. It's local to us in Seattle. Maybe it's local based on
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.800]   your zip code. Yeah. Let me put my zip code in and see. Uh, because the truth is we have a lot of
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.400]   farms in our Oh, yeah. So here's the local farms delivering to us. Kagosha, much a pan.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:27.440]   Floresville, Texas, Cordova, Alaska, Charlottesville, Virginia, Silverton. So it's not that local,
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:33.760]   but this is not small farms, small farms. Tenants, Haba, Fisherman's co-op tenants, Haba, Maine.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:40.000]   Yeah. That's kind of cool. So I remember when I was when I was a young, and we went visit my
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.560]   grandmother, uh, Mabel Lee in Lewistown, Illinois, and she had a farm. She didn't know
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.240]   about the farm had a farm and her side of beef that she'd get for her share of the beef from the
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:59.040]   farm versus the farmer would go into Augie's meat locker and we'd go up there on a Saturday and say,
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.120]   Augie, uh, well, I feel like a few tunnel ones. Can you cut those off my beef and Augie would cut
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.960]   it off and then wrap it up with the best sausages, warm sausages over there. God. So yeah, you had,
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:16.400]   you had shared community meat storage. Hi, Jen meat store. I'm sending this link right off to my
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:24.480]   lovely wife for both. Mod C and crowd cow. Yeah. Well, it's, you know, nowadays, we're very
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:30.080]   fortunate. I want to say this is, you know, this is obviously upscale, but we're fortunate that we
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.720]   don't have to go shopping that everything can come to us now. You know, you don't have to go out at
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:40.960]   all. And, uh, you know, I, I hope you all are equally fortunate because it's scary to go out
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:48.080]   there now. We were walking around town last night. It wasn't exactly Lake of the Ozark, but there were
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:53.600]   that, you know, there were places were open and people were dining and there were really,
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:59.120]   yeah. People were excited and happy and, you know, it was Memorial Day and close
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.760]   breathing on each other. You know, I think that what they're trying to do, and I guess this would
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:09.760]   be safe. First of all, for instance, there's one restaurant, weirdly named Ayahuasca that.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:17.360]   Okay. Okay. You go there and throw up. I be careful about what I'd eat there. Anyway,
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.680]   they have indoors and outdoors. There was no indoor dining was all outdoors and it looked like
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.560]   they had spaced the tables out sufficiently, but the waiters coming to your table. There are lots
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:32.000]   of, I mean, there were maybe 40 people in a, in the outdoor patio, maybe not that many, but
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.720]   there were quite a few, 10 tables were filled. So I don't, it's makes me, I'm just, maybe I'm just
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:45.760]   chicken. I just, Lisa and I, let's go home and have dinner. We just, I couldn't bring myself to do it.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.120]   Well, again, my wife stole. Let me go to Taco Bell drive through. That's shocking.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.120]   Maybe she likes you, Jeff, and wants you to survive.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:03.760]   Maybe she just has good taste. I don't know. There's making my own. So Google,
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.960]   not hard to make it be burrito. Let's be honest. So being in cheese burrito,
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:12.000]   something you could probably do pretty close to the, yeah, it was Taco Tuesday yesterday. We have,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.200]   you know, we do our taco night. It's not that hard. Google will be reopening offices July 6.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.320]   That seems a reasonable timeframe. However, not everybody will have to come in.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:31.360]   Um, so no, Pachai says we're not going to be entirely remote, but they have offered workers a
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:38.240]   thousand dollars for home equipment, not, not specifically computers. They all have that,
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.280]   but for like furniture, uh, home office supplies, things like that.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:49.760]   Is that enough? Well, I was going to say my steel case, so I have a steel case office chair that I
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:58.000]   love in. I sit in for like 50 hours a week. And that's like a $700. So right. And then my sit,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.320]   stand desk was. I don't know, like maybe 500. I can't remember. It doesn't seem like that much.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:11.280]   Yeah. It's expensive to get office furniture. Yeah, because I mean, this is not like going into
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:18.640]   office depot and buying a chair that you're going to, you know, curl up in and get back problems from.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.240]   I don't know. I have a steel case too. I love it. Actually, it's a really nice chair.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.360]   Oh, yeah. It's heavy. Yeah. But good.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:34.480]   And here's a comment on that Fox business story by Mr. Trump is the best mega. That's awesome.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.160]   Well done. Google happy to see American companies doing right by their employees.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:43.200]   And then Google's founders were Jewish. Okay, I'm just going to stop reading Fox business.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.760]   Yeah, I was like, why? Why are you reading that? That's like, don't read the comments,
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.600]   especially not on Fox business. I think I'm hyperventilating now.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:01.120]   Oh, that's true. Scooter X points out that lots of chairs are easy to find and reuse chairs.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.640]   Oh, yeah. It's cheap. Now you can get an air on. Well, it used to be in San Francisco.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:10.080]   Air on chairs. You'd find them on the street free because all of these startups have gone out of
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:16.800]   business. I expect us in our peche says I expect us to need physical spaces to get together.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:24.000]   I think that that's not unreasonable. While probably many of the engineers and coders
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.440]   are perfectly happy to be introverts and happy to work at home, there's a lot to be gained from
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:36.080]   collegial exchanges of information. And I think I would bet you we've been talking about this too,
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:41.600]   because we have a lot of workers at home that in time, well, maybe like some people maybe can
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.320]   stay home, but we'll have like Friday, everybody will come in or something like that. We'll have a
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.600]   lunch date or something like that. So I watched the entire Zuckerberg, I don't want to get ahead
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.600]   of us, but I watched the entire Zuckerberg announcement about working because they decided to make the
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:01.280]   town hall public. Can I just happen to bond? Oh, okay. Yeah, what did he do? And so it was very
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:07.440]   interesting because it was very marked, very serious. And he was trying to be open about things.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.360]   And so, you know, everybody's headline was you move, you're going to lower your pay,
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:19.760]   but they pay now based on location. So that's so weird to me that they would take an engineer
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:26.320]   making $150,000 a year in Mountain View. And if he moves to Boise, they cut him to 75. That
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:31.680]   seems so weird. I was thinking about it today, preparatory to the show, and it wouldn't be hard
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.720]   as ever with Facebook, just to say it differently. Here's the salary for this work. But if you live
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:42.160]   in a place that's expensive, we will give you more, more rather than saying we're going to pay you less.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.440]   For real people are smart enough to figure that out. I know, but these are engineers.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:54.000]   Let me because I am very curious. So as someone who's been a remote worker for over a decade,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.920]   and I worked for three different companies that way, there are so there are tax implications
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:05.040]   for workers. And I we're not talking about that. But like, for example, when I worked for
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.240]   the deal, which was a New York company and even for fortune when timing was in New York,
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:18.800]   to avoid paying New York City taxes on my earnings, so state and city taxes, I had to be
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:25.280]   located in Austin for the benefit of my employer, not just me. So there's some really interesting
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:31.760]   your choice. Right. They had otherwise I would have to pay taxes and living in Texas.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:37.520]   The New York freelance taxes are awful. Yeah, I was like, I do not well, I was a salaried worker,
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:44.320]   but yeah. So there there no one's really talking about this, but I am really interested in how
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:50.320]   that changes. The internet changed state tax laws. We've had this big debate and there was this
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:56.960]   period of fluidity. There are lots of sales tax. Yeah, sales, sorry. Yes, sales tax. There are lots
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:03.680]   of states who tax workers who tax a company based on their workers. And they will tax you if you're
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:10.480]   just floating around in Idaho because it's fun for you. So it's a big point, Stacy, I'm saying,
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.760]   very he went he went at some length of saying that you have to say where you are. There's going to
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.000]   be like an audit of that. This is very serious. Otherwise you could get in trouble with the taxes,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.720]   we could get in trouble with the taxes and you have to you know, you can't say you're, you know,
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.520]   I guess you can't say that you're living in expensive New York when you're actually living in an
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:37.840]   expensive Maine. And so we made a point of saying that they're going to audit you on that and verify.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.840]   And it's a tag. He also said, you know, he tried to argue that we may not save money
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.800]   with this. And I know people are rolling their eyes, but he had made a few points. First in the
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:53.040]   short term, he said definitely we're going to, you know, fill a 25% and have more space. Our space is
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.840]   very inefficient. But then secondly, he said some people will end up traveling more because back to
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:03.120]   your point a few minutes ago, Stacy, was that people will or maybe it was your point Leo.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.080]   It was your point Leo that people will want to come they'll be expected to come in on a regular
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:14.640]   basis rather than having offsite still have onsite sleep with it. But I think I will be the case.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:22.560]   You'll need to because Facebook does off sites constantly, constantly. And so I think that the
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.360]   people's you might go live in Vermont, but you're going to be flying to California a lot.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:37.360]   Yeah, I mean, that's that's true. When I was editing at Gigaome, we had to plan an offsite and I was
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:46.640]   in charge of that as editor. And we were remote first operation. So yes, we had people in California,
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.800]   but we had most of our editorial staff was actually in different places around the country.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:58.160]   Overall, I think it was cheaper. But yes, my people in and house them. But we just turned
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:03.280]   basically we then turn the sites into retreats. So then everyone just went to a place and you
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:12.480]   can do room blocks and things to make that less expensive. But yes, was it considered a benefit
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:18.880]   or an oh no, I'm going to go to the damned offsite? Well, you know, it depends on how we were doing.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:25.600]   And where the and where the offsite is. Yeah, we used to do it like caramel, caramel by the sea.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:32.560]   So that was nice. We never went to Hawaii, but we did one in New Orleans and that was probably
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:42.160]   inexpensive, but good. And we'd like to I mean, it was nice to see each other because otherwise,
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.920]   we didn't ever see each other. We were just all virtual on Slack and we were tight.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.200]   Like that's one of the tightest groups of people I've ever worked with. But
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.960]   the tax stuff is really interesting because this, you know, I mean, states and localities are very
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.640]   in the federal government for that matter too. Very good at getting their
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:06.400]   quote fair share of taxes. And they know, you know, that's a really interesting issue. And I
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.040]   hadn't really thought about it. But I'm sure that there are tax consequences to Facebook as well.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.920]   And and California will want to tax those employees, even if they're living in Idaho,
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.080]   because they're working for California company is complicated.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:25.360]   Yeah, it's complicated. It was no fun. And you know, I've been seeing ads. I don't know if
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.320]   you've seen these you know, you have it because you're not California. But there are ads all the time
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:37.920]   on CNN and other channels to fight the California freelance law. They have an
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:43.840]   ad. Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's a woman who said, I'm a real estate agent, but I but I deliver for
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:52.400]   DoorDash and and or Uber eats or somebody a grub hub. And it's great because I can set my own hours
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:58.720]   and and then a tight close up in dramatic music. And in this time, this is the only way I can make
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:04.320]   money. And the California state legislature has decided I don't deserve to have this freelance
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:08.720]   job. And then there's a big long disclaimer at the end paid for by Uber grub hub, DoorDash,
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.840]   and I don't know what I don't know if there's a petition or they're going to do about I would
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:19.040]   suspect they're going to try a ballot initiative to terrible for the news businesses.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:26.400]   Yeah. Well, we you know, Aunt Pruitt, we hired a guy who was a freelancer for tech republic.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:31.040]   He was living in North Carolina. When he moved here to California, tech republics said, I'm sorry,
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:37.920]   we can't use you anymore because this California freelancers law. Oh, because he was in California.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:43.680]   He was all right. But you hire is and not he's full time for us. But he also had
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:49.120]   another he wanted a freelance for tech republic. Oh, okay. Sorry. I thought all of a I was like,
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.840]   Oh, no, this is the worst way to find out this. So what that he's not that he's not working for us.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.240]   Well, yeah, that's what I thought. I thought you were trying to legally reference. No, no,
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.880]   he's employee. And that's you know, he we're in California. We play he pays California state
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.600]   taxes because he's in California. But I guess he was I don't know if he was filing more than the
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:12.800]   35 articles a month or what it was or maybe just my my sense. I don't know. But I mean,
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:18.080]   tech republic loves and as we all do, my sense is they just didn't want to deal with the mess.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:24.160]   Are they based created? Kentucky, little public Louisville. Wow. So they have Wow.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:31.280]   So as as someone who hires, well, okay, the mayor phrase said, I don't hire freelancers. I have
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:39.360]   I have Kevin as a contractor. The way that employment law is structured is really hard for small
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:46.160]   businesses, especially if you're hiring someone from another state. Oh, I know. And as a when I
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:53.760]   want to hire people like or like pay freelancers for things. Luckily, I'm not impacted by anyone's.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:59.520]   I'm too small of a job for those people. But like, I totally believe in paying good rates for my
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.920]   writers because. Oh, and I'm sure that the public was paying him well. But the
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.320]   account I don't know. I was nothing to do with how much you're getting paid. It doesn't refer to
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:14.000]   that at all. It's no, I know. But a lot of them a lot of them paid like, I mean, it could go home.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.560]   Oh, I was so embarrassed to quote our rates to people. It was horrifying. No, I know that. Yeah.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:23.760]   Well, that's what was Dr. Morpies and Chad says. Oh, so tech republic was exploiting him.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.400]   I don't I don't think so. And that's the issue. And that's the same issue with this woman,
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:34.160]   the real estate agent who's driving delivery for Grubhub. If the worker doesn't consider
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:40.080]   themselves exploited, they say for various reasons, I want this freelance job. I don't want a real job.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:47.120]   You know, maybe her spouse has the health insurance. And she likes to set her own hours.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.880]   You could think of lots of reasons why that'd be legit. Why should the state of California
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.760]   assume I'm being exploited? And I've talked. Every time I'm in it, you don't.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:01.360]   Well, it's just you don't make laws around individuals to happen to be at the
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:07.840]   I don't want to say protected who are less at risk. You don't you make laws to protect people
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:13.520]   that are falling through the cracks that are at risk. Absolutely. And the law was around was
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:18.480]   to protect Uber drivers. I mean, Uber. Right. It's to protect people who don't have access to
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:23.920]   health insurance and who are being exploited. The fact that this one poor woman who may or may not
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:31.200]   even be real feels pissed off because she happens to be in a great position. Well, good for her.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:37.920]   But she has to recognize that there are a lot of people who aren't. And if we don't fix this at a
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:47.120]   bigger level at a state level, then you then those people continue to fall through the cracks.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.520]   And we're stuck where we are today, which is not. Okay, that's fair. But what do you do about the
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:57.440]   harms that that creates for a whole class of people like say, freelance writers?
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:05.040]   So those should be addressed individually in the law or maybe you look at those harms and you say,
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:10.960]   well, here's here's what we're trying to do. Either we adjust the law or it forces people to
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:17.680]   to adapt. I mean, forces companies to adapt in that space or they say we don't want to hire
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.560]   anyone from California and then a bunch of freelancers leave California.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.760]   Yeah, well, that's a risk too. Right. I mean, laws are always always a trade off.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.520]   Right. It's always going to piss someone off.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:32.400]   Yeah. In fact, the thing that really pissed people off. Okay, first of all,
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:40.640]   these ad campaigns are paid for by Uber and Lyft. So it pissed them off and rightly so because it
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:46.240]   was to protect their workers who are gig workers and are not given the courtesy of real jobs.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:52.640]   However, they did in the law make exemptions for just kind of randomly for certain jobs.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.400]   Like they attempted to address the harms, but they left out journalists.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.640]   That's because the journalists don't have great lobbying power.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.360]   Apparently, that's my real problem is it all has comes down.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.280]   Well, the publishers do the journalists don't.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:09.200]   Well, there you go. Now, meanwhile, let's go to Switzerland.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:16.080]   The land of this of the what is that the land of chocolate chocolate cows,
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.800]   cows, watches, banking, the German language.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.680]   Tages on ziger. I'm sure Jeff would do that better.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.240]   Onsiger.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.440]   Tages on ziger reports that Switzerland's top court is ruled.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:36.080]   Employers are required to contribute to employees rent payments if they're working from home.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:44.880]   I mean, honestly, what we have we do in fact do this. We don't pay their rent,
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:50.080]   but we help pay our employees internet. We actually have a stipend for them.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:50.720]   Let's go to do it.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.960]   To cover additional expenses that they may incur because they're working from home.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.320]   Plus, that's our fair share. Now, we didn't think about helping them with the rent.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.080]   We didn't go that far. I mean, they still got to live.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:09.600]   Even if they come, I don't know, but they didn't change their situation
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.960]   because they're working at home, except you wanted to have good access.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:19.920]   The problem with like way, way, way, way back. I'm old enough to remember when you could charge
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.200]   for some space at home off your taxes and not go to jail for it.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.480]   Yeah, you could still do that, right?
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.680]   But also do that.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.120]   Stacy, do you do it?
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.920]   I used to. Now it's my own company. So it's a little bit different.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:37.920]   But when I worked for a company at their behest in a dedicated office with a door
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.200]   where it was only used for work, yes.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:41.920]   Yeah, of course.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:48.480]   And what you do is connect that square footage off the total cost of your home square footage.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.960]   That's fair. I think that's fair.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.040]   And that's it's an audit flag.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.880]   It is an audit flag.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.720]   Oh, yeah. I never got audited.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.160]   Never never got out.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:58.880]   Not what's.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.400]   Not what Stacy's not.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.160]   I know. No one's going to get audited now.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.080]   There's not even anybody home anymore.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.440]   Not what they'll.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.760]   Lisa renewed.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.480]   They're watching.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.120]   We renewed Lisa. No, they're not watching.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.000]   They're not watching.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.160]   We Lisa renewed her son's passport and you have to sit in birth certificate and
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.760]   Social Security card and stuff.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.080]   And then COVID hit and they never sent any of that stuff back.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.120]   We got the passport.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.400]   Oh, geez.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.800]   They still have his birth certificate and Social Security number.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.080]   And she's been calling and running.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:26.960]   There's nobody there.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.240]   They're all.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:28.400]   No.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.120]   It's crazy.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.040]   As they say, unprecedented times.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.560]   These are unprecedented times.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.920]   But it is kind of hard if you're 17 years old and you don't have a Social Security number
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.520]   to take, get your first job.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.520]   I mean, she has it has a number.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.320]   It doesn't have a card.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.200]   So now she has to go get a new card.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:51.360]   Google's CEO gave everybody a day off.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.080]   So that you could become the best version of yourself.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.720]   A well-deserved day off.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.360]   He said it in email to his staff.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.960]   I know many of us have been running hard nonstop for a weeks now.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.080]   And it may be experience.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.040]   He was even even he has got the COVID's and may be experiencing some burnout.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:19.360]   So I used TGIF, a company wide meeting as a chance to announce an official day off in May 22nd.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:24.320]   Take the time to do whatever you need to do to prioritize your well-being.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.080]   So there.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.800]   That is a nice thing to do.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.800]   I like that.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.320]   Thank you, Sundar.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.800]   In fact, I'm going to take this show off.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.080]   Oh, I'm like, well, wait, I have.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.160]   Now, it's like we have things to talk about.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:40.960]   Oh, good.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.360]   Hey, Google.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.200]   Hey, let's talk about Google.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:43.680]   All right.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.520]   Oh, we have been actually I lied.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.400]   I just got so engrossed in the conversation about.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.920]   All about Google.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.760]   We had a point.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.040]   It related.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:58.080]   So we were supposed to get we talked about this last last week, where's from?
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.080]   Last week, where we're supposed to get our Pixel 4A's at Google I/O two weeks ago.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.200]   Obviously, there was no Google I/O, so no Pixel 4A's.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:10.480]   Now, John Prosser, who has become the go-to rumor monger,
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:15.360]   he says it was originally, the Pixel 4A was originally May, then pushed to June.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.640]   It's now pushed again.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.080]   They will come in just black and barely blue.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.120]   That doesn't sound good.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.400]   Sounds baby blue.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.560]   Sounds like an S&M punk band.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:33.600]   Current plan for announcement July 13th, no 5G seems like they're ready to ship.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.080]   The decision is mostly based on market analysis.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.040]   So what the stores open again?
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.720]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.840]   How many people go into a store to buy their Google phone?
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.000]   I just feel like everyone is at all playing.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.400]   I think us Google people don't, but to find somebody who's not a Google person.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.680]   They've got to see.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.240]   Aren't they buying iPhones?
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.040]   I mean, is Google really going to convince those people?
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:03.200]   Well, there's going to buy in a motor roll of phone when the person
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:08.160]   comes and doesn't have a strong prejudice more than the other to the Verizon store and says,
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.040]   "I need to get a phone."
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:14.320]   And there is sitting next to the iPhone, a Pixel 4 at a good price,
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.120]   or 4A, I guess, not a 4.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.960]   In barely blue.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.160]   In barely blue and just black and blue.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.120]   And doesn't seem good.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:32.320]   And then you want it to be sitting there because honestly, I know we all order them online,
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.080]   but I think the vast majority of phones, you have to be at a phone store.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:41.200]   I know that because the Huawei representative, when I asked, well, you could sell them direct,
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.920]   just because we lost the Verizon card.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.200]   She said, "There's no point in marketing or doing anything else
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.240]   for a cell phone in the US unless you're in stores.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.120]   There's just no point.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:51.920]   You won't sell any."
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.120]   And I think that's probably true.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.640]   I think that's one of the reasons that's one of the things that killed
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:03.360]   Microsoft's phone ambitions is that even though they could get them into the stores,
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.400]   they were always in the back and the store employee would never say,
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.760]   "Oh, yeah, we got this Microsoft phone.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.800]   Maybe be interested in that."
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.040]   No.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:14.400]   And that really killed a very expensive business for Microsoft.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.320]   So I think that that's the market analysis as we will.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.440]   I think you're exactly right.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.000]   Actually, let's see what Android Central says.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.800]   Andrew Martinik, here's why Google is delaying.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:34.000]   Well, US consumers spending in marches down by 7.5%.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:41.680]   Economic impacts, Amazon pushing its annual prime day from July to September.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:49.840]   Google's hardware business is insignificant, so there's no scramble to get the Pixel 4
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.120]   out and start making money on it.
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.640]   To put it simply, Google can afford to wait another month.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:59.840]   The optics of a slow launch are in some ways more damaging than a whole month of
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.120]   lost sales in the balance sheet.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.000]   That makes sense.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.680]   It's like having--
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.000]   It does.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.840]   It's like don't open a movie today because you'll have the first weekend
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.280]   sales will be bad and then you sink that trace.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:15.760]   Do we think that things are going to get better by fall?
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.880]   We all live and hope, don't we?
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.600]   I mean, honestly, I sit here and I'm like, I don't know.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.400]   I'm really thinking about this because I'm like, okay.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.120]   Well, you know who's really thinking?
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.960]   I'm sure this one of the reasons you're thinking about it.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.960]   What do you do with the kids?
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.400]   Are they going back to school in September?
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.800]   Yes.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:44.800]   Where I'm at, they're looking at all the way back, which no one actually thinks is possible
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.000]   and they say that, or all the way remote or some weird hybrid.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.320]   And everyone's pretty much going for weird hybrid.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.360]   I mean, it's like where--
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:59.280]   there's variations on a certain percentage of kids will go back to their classes and then
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.960]   they'll do online--
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:06.720]   You'll be in the building for some amount of time and then online the other time while
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.480]   other percentages of kids are building.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.280]   Oh, that makes sense.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.320]   So 25% of the time and that way they can separate them out.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.040]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.640]   So that's one option.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:20.480]   And then the other option is have them come back some of the time and do something like that,
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:25.680]   but also recognize that we're going to have to shut things down again periodically as cases rise.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.760]   But the truth is we have no idea.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.480]   Right.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.040]   No.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:34.880]   And I don't think-- I mean, anybody who's looking at this and says, hey, we're going to open the economy
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.240]   back up and it's all going to be hunky-dory.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.240]   I mean, we've lost-- is it 25% of jobs or 20% of jobs now?
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.520]   I can't even remember where we're at.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.160]   But those people aren't going to be buying new things.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.760]   And how many of them will be going back to work?
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.600]   I mean, a lot of these businesses are gone.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:57.600]   And that's--
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:57.600]   So--
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.560]   And that's just gone.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.360]   They're not coming back.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.080]   It's scary.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.360]   I mean, it's really scary.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:03.760]   It's--
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.160]   Half of all of Hertz's employees have been fired.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.400]   Some huge number.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.040]   There's 14--
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:09.680]   I had no idea.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.200]   Hertz was in bad shape before.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.480]   Oh my gosh.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.680]   They're like a financial engineering wonder kid.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.960]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.000]   What you're going to also see is all of these heavily leveraged companies.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.320]   And that--
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:20.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:25.360]   --retail especially are just-- they have no resiliency.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.560]   So it's just going to go buying a lot of newspapers too.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.880]   The Hertz had $24 billion in debt before COVID.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.320]   So--
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:34.720]   I do.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.360]   Like, what is this going to do to private equity?
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.200]   And I used to cover private equity, right?
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   So I'm not-- like, I don't think it's evil.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:45.200]   My knee-jerk reaction isn't private equity's evil.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:49.200]   However, the way that it's been handled from a financial engineering perspective
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.800]   of the last 20 years or so, it's definitely skirted like the edge of--
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.360]   you're definitely pushing a business to the edge.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.080]   And if they teeter off, that's all right.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.600]   It's not like your responsibility.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.400]   I'm ignorant on this.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.040]   You're the expert.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:03.600]   So I'm going to--
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.040]   Is it the fact that they're so highly leveraged, there's so much debt?
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:07.920]   Is that the problem?
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:14.000]   So what-- yes, the leverage is hard, but two, they go in and they--
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.680]   they bring out a bunch of debt, but they also pull a lot of the cash out of the business.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.960]   So there's the two-- it's the two things happening at once.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:32.880]   And what happens is you're running it as optimized and with this narrow ability to not fail resiliency.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.880]   It's-- you're taking away all of their resilience.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.360]   It's equivalent of just-in-time manufacturing.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:42.560]   Yes, or just living-- I mean, it's living paycheck to paycheck.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:51.200]   Which in good times when there are no bumps in the road is sensible because you're very efficient.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.440]   I don't think it's ever sensible.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.000]   Oh, really?
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.080]   Because-- well, good times are never going to--
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.760]   You know there's going to be a bump in the road, yeah.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.320]   Right.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.480]   They're called good times for a reason, people.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.840]   It's not normal times.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.360]   Now, so leverage is--
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.320]   Well, Stacey, I want to add your list, right?
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:13.200]   So they-- in the case of newspapers, the hedges sell hard assets.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.160]   They sell the real estate.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:14.720]   They sell the real estate.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.520]   They sell the real estate.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.000]   They--
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.400]   That's the chain sell.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.800]   That's the chain sell-- Al Dunlap.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.560]   Dunlap approach, which is you buy a business, sell it off for parts.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.000]   Right.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.400]   Then you pull cash flow out, which newspapers still have.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.320]   And then the real killer is you don't invest.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.200]   Right.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.240]   Obviously.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.600]   But in terms of trying to think, oh, how can we save this business in a new reality?
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.360]   Well, if you don't invest in R&D, you're not going to get anywhere, and nobody is.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:46.960]   So those things mean-- and so every major newspaper chain in the US is now controlled by hedge funds.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:47.360]   Oh, yes.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.640]   Or families that have had it.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:48.880]   Oh.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.040]   So--
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:55.120]   Again, I'll go to the business reporter here.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.720]   How can you call that good business in any sense?
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.280]   It's not.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:05.200]   Well, so it gets to the fact that in the last 50 years, we have stopped--
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:10.080]   this even ties back to if you want to say Mark Andreusson's "We Need to Build," right?
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:17.440]   We have moved from a nation that is focused on building hard assets to a nation that is
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.120]   really good at financial engineering.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.280]   A nation of value extractors.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.640]   Yes.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.200]   I mean--
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.320]   We're strip mining the United States economy.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.200]   Yes. And there is value in hedge funds.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:38.960]   So prior to probably the late '80s, I guess when we started getting into like a hedge fund,
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.360]   actually, they would take a family business.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:47.280]   And if the family didn't want it anymore, like some-- the younger heirs said, "Eh, I'm not into this."
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.440]   They could sell it, get out of the business, and hedge funds would do things like, you know,
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:57.520]   create roll-ups maybe or help build that business for a while and then resell it to somebody who
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.360]   it made sense to sell it to, right?
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:04.720]   They were adding value in a way that now they're just basically extracting cash.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.680]   So, yeah, strip mining is probably everything.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:15.920]   Yeah, but all right, the heartless business person says some businesses deserve to go away.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:16.400]   They do.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.440]   Not saying which ones they are, but they are past their prime.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:25.520]   So I just wrote a post-- I wrote a piece for Tortoise a week ago, or two weeks ago,
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:30.560]   which I went through all the ways we're screwed in the news business, in the private industry
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.200]   by revenue stream.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:36.880]   And the post I just wrote, I said, "Okay, here's some sprouts from the ashes."
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:42.720]   It's got to burn down, and we're not going to recreate what we had, and we're going to build
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.000]   things that are new.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.440]   And they're coming in small ways.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.760]   There's Village Media, which Google and Richard Jinger has loved for good reason,
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:55.360]   not a Canada, that runs good, basic, local businesses.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.560]   There's a company in Norway I talked to.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.000]   Hedge funds don't--
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.640]   I agree with you, Jeff, but hedge funds aren't picking their businesses based on things that
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.000]   deserve to fail, right?
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:04.800]   Right, right.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:10.480]   Well, no, what they are doing, Stacey, is their buying distressed debt,
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.960]   and the debt is distressed for a reason.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.040]   Not always.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:15.520]   So--
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.080]   Not always.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.800]   Some of the distressed debt that they're picking up is from prior sales,
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.840]   prior hedge fund investment.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.800]   So, I mean, yes, there are businesses that should be failed, but--
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.920]   or should fail.
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:38.240]   One could take an analogy, though, and say that there are businesses that were pushed to a place
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.360]   where they couldn't actually make the investments they needed to make.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:41.920]   Absolutely.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.000]   And part of the reason they're not making those investments is because
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.960]   Wall Street is rewarding the financial engineering and the quick extraction of cash.
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:56.480]   So, an investment does take time.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.360]   It takes time.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.080]   It takes money.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.040]   Look at--
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:04.960]   In their ways, the government can actually encourage people to go back to that, like,
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:10.720]   aren't it making it more tax efficient to invest in R&D as opposed to,
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.320]   you know, who's your older buybacks?
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.080]   There--
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:16.720]   Yeah, going.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.240]   Would you invest in JCPenney?
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:24.320]   No, but JCPenney has been on the edge since, like, the '90s.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.280]   Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:25.280]   JCPenney's--
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:25.280]   JCPenney's--
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:25.440]   JCPenney's--
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.160]   So, at some point.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.400]   But it wasn't the--
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.400]   I'm sorry for everybody who has a job there.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.240]   I'm sorry for the people that are paying rent to.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.520]   I'm sorry for their suppliers.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:37.840]   But JCPenney has not been a going concern, as you just said, for a long time.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:42.160]   But JCPenney was optimizing for cash extraction.
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:48.240]   Had JCPenney been working, had the market rewarded investment and things,
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.000]   and they could have done it.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.680]   And what will actually be really interesting is in the last, say, five years,
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.560]   companies in the retail space that have been investing, right?
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.440]   So, actual forward-thinking companies have actually been investing in
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.960]   experiences in the store.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.600]   So, you think, like, it's a fora you could get, like,
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.920]   you buy stuff there and you get the hydrophacial and you go in and it's amazing,
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.000]   or you go into, like, sacks and there's the spa.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.160]   So, high touch retail experiences has been the new thing.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.920]   With COVID, that's all changing so rapidly, so suddenly.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.560]   Do those companies--
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.400]   should they go out of business because of this?
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.200]   Even if they were--
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.000]   like, let's say they're all reasonably managed, right?
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.120]   They're not on the--
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.640]   they've got resiliency.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.920]   Do you think that this sort of event means they should
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.680]   go out of business or what do you think should happen to those?
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.240]   No, you're right.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:42.480]   You're right.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.520]   I should not have used.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.960]   I complain on the other side.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.560]   There's no business plan as ever built on the verb should.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.000]   Either way, right?
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.920]   Newspapers saying, people should pay us.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.440]   Well, only if you're worthwhile.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.520]   Neither or should you say a company should die.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.800]   So, I retract the use of the verb.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:03.280]   But what I'm saying is some are all but hopeless.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:08.480]   And so, it's hard to expect anything but leaching them of their last
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.080]   cash and their real estate leases and such.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:12.880]   And so, that's where--
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:19.520]   I worked with a guy in our business who warned me and I was on an advisor's
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.400]   work in the beginning.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.160]   Hedges will do what hedges will do.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.320]   Buy and disrupt stuff.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.360]   They will get rid of stuff.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.720]   They will do this stuff, right?
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.760]   And they're like a lot.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.600]   You might feel sorry for the gazelle, but the lions eat gazelles.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.400]   And that's what they do.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.360]   And so, we have to recognize that reality.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.920]   So, yes, I retract my verb.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.760]   Do you think it's a structural flaw in our economic system or it's just--
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.520]   Yes, if you look at--
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.360]   Like, use the lion and gazelle, right?
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:52.320]   We have way more lions right now than we have gazelles.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:44:01.680]   And right now, we're in a wildlife ecosystem that gives the advantages to the lions in ways
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.920]   that maybe nature doesn't normally do.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.840]   And we can only take this so far.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:09.920]   The lions-- Well, in my backyard, I have more deer than wolves.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.920]   I mean, stretch my shrubs.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.520]   So, I just wanted to say that.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.520]   But let me just stretch the analogy a little bit.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.800]   The lions have to be careful if they eat all the gazelles.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.520]   They're going to die themselves.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.680]   And I've always wondered why this--
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:24.160]   You know, this--
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:28.720]   I think I don't think it's unfair to say this predatory capitalism
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:32.480]   doesn't understand that you can't keep doing this forever,
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.200]   or are they just so short-sighted that they just go,
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.680]   "Well, I'm going to eat until I get behind."
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.280]   They do, though, because the government--
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:42.000]   The government, in some ways, bales them out.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.880]   They still have their preferred tax treatment.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:45.760]   I mean, there's--
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.560]   Too big to fail.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.400]   There's a lot happening here that I'm kind of like--
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:56.480]   And look at now at how the government has totally stripped the agencies in place
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:02.800]   that were put in place to help kind of monitor the protection board.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.080]   Yes, thank you.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.560]   That-- I was like, "God, that consumer is something, something, something."
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:07.840]   Well, I still think that right.
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:08.640]   But yes.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.720]   But I think that's clear.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:13.360]   But it's also-- it's self-reinforcing,
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.920]   because the reason things like the consumer protection board go away
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.280]   is because these people got so wealthy that they could
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:26.880]   essentially buy off Congress to make tax laws in their favor.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.000]   Fair and wise, the problem.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.160]   And so it's self-reinforcing.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:35.520]   They get more and more successful, and then the bonds are released,
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.280]   and they can get more and more successful.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.160]   And what you get is massive income inequality.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:43.040]   What you get is a situation where you are very
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:48.880]   unresilient, where you have a nation where not only have individuals not saved money,
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.720]   but companies haven't saved money.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.560]   Nobody's prepared for the rainy day.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.520]   The rainy day came, and all the roofs are caving in.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.040]   So--
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.000]   Who could have predicted--
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.320]   Well, obviously, some people did predict this.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.840]   But as a manager, I would defend a company for saying,
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:10.240]   how could you have planned for every exigency of this?
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.440]   You'd been killed by your stockholders if you just held cash in reserve.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.560]   But Stacy, you were raising your hand.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.280]   You think you could have?
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.800]   You can plan.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.840]   I mean, so this is really an interesting thing.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.240]   So remember when Michael Dell took Dell private?
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:26.720]   The reason-- one of the reasons he did that is because he felt like this was a time
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.360]   where things were changing and he wanted to make those investments.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.240]   It's also probably my fault.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.640]   Oh, you--
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.160]   You talked to Michael Dell into that?
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.880]   No, I caused Dell Hell.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.760]   What?
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.040]   You talked about this.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:43.680]   Dell Hell?
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.400]   What's Dell Hell?
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.840]   You don't-- oh, we never talked about this?
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:48.400]   Well, we might have.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.120]   I don't have much of an obvious--
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:49.600]   Oh, no, it's--
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:49.600]   Oh, no.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.080]   --of the existence.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.800]   We've been doing this for years now.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.120]   In the early days of blogging, I complained--
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.760]   I'm sorry, I just-- Stacy, I wasn't trying to interrupt you.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.480]   I was--
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.280]   Go ahead and finish--
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:46:59.680]   Finish that.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.640]   Just want to take credit for--
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:00.880]   Finish.
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.400]   --Michael Dell's going--
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.320]   Well, no, I get blamed for it by saying--
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.600]   By the way, Michael Dell took Dell private, but then didn't he then?
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.240]   He took it back public, yes.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:10.720]   Go public again?
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.200]   He sold off.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.400]   Yeah, he came back to the company.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.720]   It feels like it was a financial--
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:17.600]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:18.160]   I'm looking at it.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:18.640]   This is good for--
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:19.040]   It wasn't--
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.480]   Well, I mean, yes, there were--
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:25.200]   So he took it private because he wanted to focus without the short term.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.440]   He wanted to focus on things.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:27.680]   Yes.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.400]   He ended up selling off parts that had been acquired.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.280]   And there--
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:41.600]   I'm not saying that all public finances are finances bad, right?
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:45.040]   There is a big role for capital and they deserve to make
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:48.560]   money for taking on extreme risk.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.480]   I am by no means against that.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.080]   However, we have become so short-sighted.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:48:00.960]   And what I like to think of is we have optimized far too much for short-term returns,
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:06.240]   and it makes it very difficult to build anything that makes it difficult to build resiliency.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.320]   It makes it difficult to invest in R&D.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:12.880]   Is Warren Buffett the counter to that?
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.640]   Sometimes.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.000]   I mean, he does well talking about it.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.240]   He sold off his newspapers when he gave up.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.560]   He does act, though, like a value investor.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.720]   Like, I'm not trying to make a quick buck.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.880]   I'm investing in the company because of its fundamentals.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:27.600]   Things I know.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.160]   Dairy Queen.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.520]   And it's a very quick--
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:33.760]   and it's a valuable company, and I feel the value go off.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:36.160]   And he's done very well out of it.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:36.480]   I don't know.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.640]   I find knew anything about this.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.200]   I'd be rich.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.280]   So I clearly don't.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.880]   Well, in the benefit of the market--
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:43.920]   I mean, the benefit--
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:50.400]   one of the challenges here is if you are taking a long term versus a short-term company,
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.680]   right now, you are going to make bank as a short-term investor.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:00.240]   You will never lose playing to the lowest common denominator.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.280]   The problem is you're going to look around one day.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.040]   This is where we--
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.320]   I feel like this is where we are.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:09.040]   You're all at the lowest common denominator.
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:09.760]   You're like, well, crap.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:10.560]   How do we get here?
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.480]   And then how do we build value going forward?
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.760]   And that's--
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:17.360]   if we're not already there, we're close.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.200]   I sold all my stocks.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:23.680]   I'm just sitting with a pile of cash in my retirement fund
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.440]   because I don't know what the hell's going to happen.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.720]   And I don't want to write it down.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:29.440]   And I know it's going up.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:30.400]   And everybody's looking--
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.880]   Lisa's saying, what did you do that for?
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.000]   I don't know.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.040]   Actually, she did it first.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.120]   She did it in January, which was very smart.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:41.920]   I don't know if keeping your money and your mattress is a great way to go.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.120]   I mean, you're older, so yes.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.120]   I mean--
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.200]   I'm so old that if I don't do that,
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.760]   I could be bankrupt before I have a chance to make a point.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:50.640]   Yeah, I'm worried too.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:50.960]   Right.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:51.360]   But I also--
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.880]   So the taxes I would pay right now,
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.680]   if I sold or anything, would be horrendous.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:56.000]   Right.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.600]   So that's part of--
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.280]   I mean, and that's part of this is like--
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:10.960]   we have divorced real risk, like actual risk in a lot of cases
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.440]   from the value that people are paid for--
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:13.920]   Well, so--
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:14.880]   taking on that risk.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:20.640]   And part of that is because we've gone to like securitization of assets,
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.240]   which means the original risk just gets passed up and down the chain
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:26.640]   for like a few more basis points, right?
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.520]   And that's not sustainable.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:34.880]   I don't know if we have to go--
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.720]   That's those complicated derivatives that all the--
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:42.000]   financial and math wizards who got out of Harvard and MIT
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.160]   with their math degrees instead of going to work as--
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.840]   Well, that's why Hertz is bankrupt.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.880]   Yeah, they went to Wall Street and they created a bunch of derivatives,
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:51.360]   and no one knows how the hell it's going to work.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.520]   I know how they work.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.040]   Except Stacy.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:55.680]   Thank God.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:59.280]   I'm like, I'm like, as a former bond reporter, I know how to--
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.240]   No, I'm glad you're here.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.640]   Because I swear to God, I think it's just crazy.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.880]   Crazy.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.640]   So you want to hear my Del story?
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:07.200]   Yeah, what do you--
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:07.840]   Tell me about Del.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:10.000]   Actually, before you do, let's do a commercial.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:10.880]   We'll come back with Del.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:11.920]   Hey!
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.320]   I was going to read your article sprouts from the ashes,
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.440]   but as you know, I've exceeded my medium limit for the months.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.760]   So all I got was--
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.280]   Give us not a Buzz machine yet.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.280]   I hate this.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.760]   I know everything about the Buzz machine.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.960]   I hate this.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:28.000]   Are you windowing Jeff?
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:28.880]   Show my screen, Jeff.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:29.760]   Thank you.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.120]   I can't read your article.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.080]   It fades out.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.520]   It just--
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.080]   Oh, hold on.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:34.880]   I'll give you the words.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:35.440]   No, no, no.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:35.920]   It's like--
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:37.120]   The link on the--
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:37.120]   On the--
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:37.920]   It's fine.
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:38.480]   It's fine.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:38.720]   It's--
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.840]   I think it's fine.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.240]   I know I've read all my free stories for the months.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.800]   Yeah, you wasted on Zoom cats.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:45.520]   I wasted--
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.640]   It's your fault, Jeff.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.880]   I wasted on Zoom cats,
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:50.800]   which we will also talk about later.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.480]   I'm going to have to pay my five bucks,
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.000]   just so we can do Zoom cats.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:58.400]   You're supporting writers.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.120]   It's a good thing.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.120]   I'm supporting Ev Williams.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.160]   I don't know if that's a good thing.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.480]   It's a good thing.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.720]   Ev, Ev, Ev help start blogging.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.160]   Ev help start Twitter, adult--
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:14.720]   I agree.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.160]   Keep your mouth shut.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:19.120]   Ev help start medium for writers as penance.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:19.920]   Ev's a good guy.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.840]   Really, was that the plan?
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.720]   The medium is just--
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.400]   You know, he's not going to make any money on it.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.080]   He's just going to give all the money to you guys.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.760]   That plan?
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.120]   No, no, I think he wants to make money on it,
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:32.720]   but I think it's penance for everything being short and quick.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.040]   One other programming note,
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.480]   we usually do it after hours on Friday
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.040]   4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.520]   This is going to be a special one.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:44.880]   We're doing an Ask Me Anything.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.120]   We've done a few AMAs with various hosts.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.840]   This time it's Father Robert Ballisare,
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:57.040]   Renee Richie, and somebody who just crossed the 1 millionth subscriber mark on YouTube.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:01.200]   OMG Chad, host of OMG Craft.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.960]   He used to be the producer for this show.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:06.480]   Now he's a big shut, but he'll be on our AMA.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.680]   Again, that's this Friday, 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.960]   You can watch live at twitter.tv/live
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.400]   and then we'll put it up on the Twitter YouTube channel afterwards.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:19.200]   AMA, Chad, Padre, and Renee, that sounds awesome.
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:23.680]   Today our show is brought to you by LastPass.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:27.120]   It's good to have LastPass in your back pocket.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.000]   If you're a business,
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.040]   thank goodness we were using LastPass Enterprise
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.640]   and then our whole company goes home.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:41.280]   And they're logging into our websites and our bank accounts and all the vital stuff from their house.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:46.240]   I was so glad we had LastPass.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:50.320]   LastPass can be deployed quickly in the midst of any event to ensure your business keeps running
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:54.880]   smoothly. Every employee logging is secure. Enterprise, great password management.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:56.400]   That's what they're famous for.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.800]   It's what I started using LastPass for 10 years ago.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.560]   That's what we had was passwords.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.680]   And LastPass encrypted them, kept them safe.
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:09.120]   And from a business point of view, LastPass password management ensures oversight of shadow IT
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:13.120]   and enforceable policies across all password protected accounts.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:21.120]   We enforce, for instance, two factor things like minimum password quality, things like that.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.240]   But they've got more now.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.240]   And I love the single sign on, for instance.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:28.080]   It manages employee access also for IT in a centralized view.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:32.160]   So IT always has insight into who has access to what from where, but your employees love it
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.840]   because there's no passwords at all.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:35.760]   They just say yes on their phone and they're in.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.800]   It's more convenient and more secure.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:42.080]   LastPass also uses multi-factor authentication.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:48.720]   So not just biometrics, not just fingerprint and face, but they also use contextual factors
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.640]   like geolocation, IP address.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:59.360]   And that helps them make sure that everybody is the right person to use the right resource.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.480]   That's so important.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.240]   And they do such a good job of it.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:07.120]   By the way, you should remember anybody considering a password manager, LastPass does it right.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.320]   They don't send or store the master password ever.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.440]   LastPass doesn't have it.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.800]   If they can't access the data, hackers can't access the data.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:20.000]   Encryption happens exclusively at the device level before syncing to LastPass for safe storage.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   Only users can decrypt their data.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.080]   They use 256-bit AES.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:29.520]   That's the same encryption used by banks and the military to store your password.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:30.960]   It's just impressive as heck.
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:37.600]   LastPass protects everything, every resource in your business while providing a seamless workflow
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.720]   for your employees.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.440]   Account access and passwords can easily be shared.
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:42.080]   And that's important.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.040]   Employees are at home.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:46.000]   You don't want them sharing passwords.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.680]   And securely, LastPass has it.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:48.400]   It's built in.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.600]   It's very easy.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.800]   I love the SSO.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.040]   I love the multi-factor you will too.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:56.960]   LastPass can make remote works simple and secure.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:59.200]   So go to lastpass.com/twit.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.560]   Find out how LastPass can help your business stay productive and secure,
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.560]   no matter what happens.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.840]   LastPass.com/twit.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:13.440]   Thank you, LastPass for supporting our fine little podcast here.
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:17.280]   By the way, did you see that Google's going to put us out of business?
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.640]   They started a new podcast.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:22.720]   Probably the most boring podcast you can imagine.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.240]   Hey, what's a podcast?
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.120]   Yeah, Google launch.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:25.600]   Okay.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:26.400]   New podcast.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.800]   It's called Search Off The Record.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:32.240]   John Mueller, Martin Martin, Split and Gary Ilias,
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:35.280]   teaming up to present a mixed bag of content.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.640]   Sounds like this show.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:37.520]   No, it's not a podcast.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:38.480]   No, it's not a podcast.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.320]   Google Search.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:46.800]   Trending topics in SEO Search Console features fun stories and more.
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:51.760]   And they promise they will share information that's never before been documented.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.760]   Never before.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.400]   Such as...
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.760]   It's really geeky.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:56.160]   Backround.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.360]   It's basically my like.
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.960]   Background information on the decision-
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:56:59.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.040]   Making process behind launches.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:03.760]   So that's all I-
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:04.880]   I didn't say talk about Google.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.240]   So they have an advantage over us.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:10.480]   They actually said this show about Google.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.720]   Search Off The Record.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.360]   It's called.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.400]   And I just thought I mentioned that.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:17.520]   But one thing they don't have, they don't have Dell Hell.
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:23.840]   So if you go to the rundown, the market caps slide.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.760]   This is what I was blamed for.
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.240]   You were blamed for market cap.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:30.560]   You laugh.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.160]   You don't know my power.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.760]   You don't know what I could do.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:34.080]   All right.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:34.400]   Let's see.
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.320]   This is a Flickr post.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.200]   So did you post this picture?
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:39.840]   I post.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:40.560]   No.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:45.280]   I posted in 2005 my complaint about my Dell computer.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:48.880]   And it went viral as we say now.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.000]   There was no Twitter at the time.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.120]   There was no Facebook at the time.
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:51.840]   It was just blogs.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:53.440]   It was a wonderful world.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:55.520]   And I complained righteously.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:56.880]   Don't that I ever do that.
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:00.080]   And it went crazy.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:00.800]   Oh, that's so funny.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:07.200]   So there were people with torches and pitchforks behind me
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.080]   saying, yeah, what?
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:09.600]   He says Dell sucks.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:12.320]   And 2005.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:14.560]   15 years ago.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.520]   What was your complaint, man?
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:17.840]   Oh, the customer service.
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:20.000]   I had just had a lemon and I couldn't get it fixed.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:20.960]   And I was complaining.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.320]   Oh, that feels right.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:27.040]   And so Michael Dell had basically left the company,
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:27.920]   all but retired.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:29.520]   And it wasn't because of me.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.320]   Dell had problems.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.800]   All I always say, I was not an influencer
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.520]   when I said resonated with people.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:36.800]   And it spread like crazy.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.920]   There were tons of stories.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.600]   There was a business week cover story.
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.480]   And stock price did go down.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.560]   It wasn't because of me, but I got blamed for it.
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:46.400]   And so then I interviewed Michael.
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:47.680]   Then they did all kinds of wonderful things.
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:48.800]   They hired bloggers.
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.760]   Got him in Lettleman Chaka as the official Dell blogger.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:55.040]   They hired technologists to go solve bloggers,
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.640]   problems with their machines.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.600]   And then there was kind of a kiss and make up with Michael.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:02.640]   I didn't interview with him for business week in 2007.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.920]   I love this.
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:06.720]   Top story, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:07.920]   Dell learns to listen.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:10.080]   The blogger who brought you Dell hell
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.120]   and set off a firestorm of complaints about the PC makers
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.800]   woeful customer service.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:15.120]   Thanks.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:17.040]   Dell has come a long way.
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:19.040]   Wow.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:21.040]   You have a lot of power.
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.680]   See, stay, see, see, see.
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:26.160]   I'm very impressed.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:28.240]   The guy who brought us Dell hell.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:31.280]   I never, ever, ever, in all my years,
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:33.600]   was able to put a company out of business.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:36.240]   It wasn't as much as I...
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:38.640]   Dell isn't out of business as an ad-stand.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:41.680]   Or affect their stock price for that matter.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.200]   Wow.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.080]   Very impressive.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:47.120]   I don't think you've ever told me that story, actually.
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:48.240]   I can't believe it.
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:50.240]   I was known for it.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.920]   Used to dine out on that story.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.280]   Oh, did I ever?
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:56.160]   Oh, I got gigs talking.
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:01.680]   And here we were just thinking you were a former TV guy critic.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.640]   Oh my God.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.280]   It complains a lot.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.680]   The only reason I called Jeff to say,
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.040]   "Can you do this show?"
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.400]   Is because I used to read him in the San Francisco Examiner long before...
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.600]   Oh, no.
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.160]   Dell hell.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:15.120]   Oh, no.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.240]   When my hair wasn't white.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:22.400]   This is actually kind of funny.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.200]   Last week, or was it on Twitch?
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.720]   We were talking about...
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.000]   I think it was on Twitch.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.840]   I don't know how you keep this straight, by the way.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.360]   I would be...
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.000]   I would be bottle-
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:32.560]   I know.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.680]   I would never say that.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.720]   I'll see if we remember.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.440]   We were talking about housing prices
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.360]   and how it's very expensive in Silicon Valley.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.640]   There's a San Francisco gate column now.
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.040]   The Chronicle has their website, the gate.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:48.560]   There's a column where they find the most expensive,
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.040]   ridiculously small apartment in San Francisco.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.000]   And they're like,
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.840]   "This one's a storefront with a loft bed
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.760]   and a workspace below it
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.280]   and a kitchen the size of a postage stamp for $3,000 a month."
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.240]   And it's a great column.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:02.720]   I love it.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:07.200]   So we were talking about it,
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.560]   and Carson, who is on...
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.240]   I admit, stuck at home.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.680]   He's not here.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.640]   He's at home.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.280]   And...
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.640]   We couldn't have Carson Kim.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.920]   We could have him coming in to the joy of the show.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.360]   He doesn't even want that.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.680]   When he gets on Zoom calls, he's like silhouetted.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:22.320]   He's got a big...
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.120]   He doesn't want to see...
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:23.920]   He doesn't want anybody to see him.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.040]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.440]   He's pulling his hair out.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.400]   He's got a fiddle-like go.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:28.720]   I don't know.
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.440]   Something's going on.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:37.280]   Anyway, he posted houses in St. Helena, Montana,
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.960]   or Helena, Montana,
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.200]   where near his family mentioned his estate,
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.000]   where he grew up.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.200]   Here's where...
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.040]   Where Facebook employees could now move.
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:47.440]   Could they...
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.120]   This is $699,000,
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.680]   which I know to most of you sounds like a lot for a house.
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.000]   But here in California,
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.960]   this would buy you a one-bedroom apartment.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.840]   It's five bedrooms,
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.960]   five baths,
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.560]   4,500 square feet.
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.000]   It looks like the...
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.760]   The Adams family mansion.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.760]   And there's a story that goes with it.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:08.720]   Apparently.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:09.120]   Taunted.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.640]   Look at this.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.920]   It's got two pianos.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.480]   I guess it's a piano.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.160]   That's the same piano from the different angle.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.160]   But it has two guitars.
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.760]   I'm easily confused.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:20.720]   It does have two guitars.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:21.920]   I've been looking at a real estate list.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.240]   I'm like, "Oh, I see exactly where this is going."
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.520]   Don't you think this is a nice house, though?
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.480]   This is really nice.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.000]   It is not to my taste,
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:28.560]   but it is...
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.520]   Oh, that's very cool.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.560]   That's really cool.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.000]   You like the...
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.920]   Look at the ceiling.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:35.920]   Let me see.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.440]   Look, it's not Michelangelo,
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.440]   but you could get somebody from Wayfair in there and just pruss it up.
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.720]   Yes, a little naughty pine, isn't it?
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:48.080]   But it's a classic Victorian.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.040]   But here it is.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.280]   This is Carson's explanation about this.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.880]   Fun fact,
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.560]   this house is infamous for being where they fixed the election
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.760]   that got Helena to be the capital of Montana.
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.720]   That was so exciting, Carson.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.160]   A little piece of history.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.680]   Why, what are you scandal that must have been?
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.480]   I am amazed.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.960]   Helena must have been a fire pit
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.160]   of politics.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:16.960]   This one is just four blocks from where Carson grew up.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.760]   Whoa, other side of the tracks.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.520]   Yeah, other side of the tracks.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.200]   I'm not sure about the cement steps, though.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.400]   We'd have to do something about that.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.000]   It's very hell in Montana.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.360]   Finally, well, it snows there.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.000]   You know, you don't want to put too much money into brickwork.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.720]   And then finally, this is the home he says,
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.560]   "If I ever get Joe Rogan money,
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:38.560]   we should move to it here."
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.480]   You know what? I would move to Helena, Montana, in a heartbeat
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.440]   if it didn't snow.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.880]   You don't need Joe Rogan money for this.
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.400]   No, it's 828,000.
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.960]   Where do Hank and John Green live?
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.560]   Right. One of them is in Indiana,
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.480]   but the other one I think is in Montana, isn't he?
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.480]   Montana is pretty, but Lisa won't let me move there.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.600]   She said you'd be bored.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.560]   Look at this.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.440]   Look at this beautiful bedroom.
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.400]   Now that's a bedroom.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.760]   Man, that, but I, you need a rotating bed in that bedroom.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.800]   If not, yeah.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.240]   No one ever needs a rotation bed.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.000]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.160]   Okay. I'm now downgrading it.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.200]   Unless you're a certain type of board.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.200]   No one ever needs a rotating bed.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.920]   This is, this is, this is the backyard.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.600]   Yeah, that's not awesome.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:21.840]   No.
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:24.560]   I'm judging that and saying not awesome.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.640]   It's a new show for the Twit Network.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.560]   House hunting was Stacy and Leo.
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.800]   Here's the mountain you look at on.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.120]   Or maybe you're on it.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:33.760]   No, you're on it.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:37.040]   I don't know.
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.200]   All I see is the snow goes all the way up.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:42.640]   It just goes, I just see 10 feet of snow on that thing.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:43.520]   So, so what?
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.000]   So you're isolated at home just like now.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.440]   Oh yeah, wouldn't be any different would it?
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:48.720]   Right.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.040]   Anyway, that's apparently Carson's dream house.
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.800]   So on Twitter, there was someone who was blogging.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:58.080]   Let's see if I can find it.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.200]   Carson says,
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:03.600]   "If Twit ever gets, it's Gimlet, Joe Rogan, payday, and Leo gives him a cut.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:08.400]   Carson will buy this house purely despite all the kids who bullied him in seventh grade."
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.960]   Is he from Montana?
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:11.600]   Oh yeah.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:11.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.520]   This is his hometown.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.640]   Oh, OK.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:15.600]   I did.
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:16.960]   OK, here it is.
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:19.040]   It's on apartment therapy.
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.640]   It was published five hours ago.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.000]   This Maryland mansion has a full holiday themed village in the basement.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.320]   [Laughter]
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.720]   The office was on Twitter like a day or two ago.
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.000]   It is hilarious.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:32.720]   Send me the link.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.520]   I want to see it.
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:36.400]   Oh, I'm copy.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:38.560]   I bet.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.160]   What would I google your holiday?
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.320]   Google.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.680]   Go to--
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.720]   Park in basement.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:45.680]   --in basement.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.640]   Probably that would be enough.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.680]   I mean, how many--
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.840]   How many two bedroom--
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:53.280]   that town home with basement in the holiday park?
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:57.520]   No, apparently there's a place called Holiday Park in Newburgh, New York.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:57.920]   OK.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:02.000]   I'm trying to get scrolling down to the bottom where I could stick stuff other.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.400]   Oh man, our other is really long today.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:04.960]   Yeah, I know.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.040]   We're just scratching the surface here.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:08.320]   All right.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.160]   I'm going to just add--
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.120]   I'm going to--
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:11.920]   Speaking of other--
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:12.560]   There you go.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.840]   I know this was going to happen.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:19.920]   John Krasinski's down home, you know, not trying to make any money,
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:26.000]   just having some fun, some good news, YouTube series is moving to CBS All Access.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.600]   And--
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.080]   There you go.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.680]   --this is the part I love.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.600]   Krasinski will no longer star.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.680]   It's like--
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.640]   You're kidding me.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.680]   What are you--
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:40.400]   It's like when they took Carpool Karaoke and they took James Corden out of it.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:47.760]   ViacomCBS is licensing some good news, putting it on a stream--
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:52.400]   behind a streaming paywall and taking John Krasinski out of it.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.240]   What did CBS buy?
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.080]   They're morons.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:56.960]   Oh my god.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:57.520]   Oh my god.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.080]   Oh my god.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:58.640]   Some good news.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.120]   A little bit.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.240]   They bought the--
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.000]   I don't know, the production value.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:02.800]   That's what they bought.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:04.080]   All right.
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.520]   I put the link in right under--
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.560]   Oh my lord.
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.000]   But they couldn't finish the ceiling?
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.800]   Wait a minute.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:11.360]   Wait a minute.
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.880]   Okay, wait a minute.
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:13.600]   Okay.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.040]   Christmas basement for sale.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.360]   Oh, you don't get the whole thing, just the basement?
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.520]   No, you get everything, but--
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.640]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:23.280]   This Maryland mention has a full holiday theme for it.
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.080]   No, I think that's--
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.200]   I think that's not the--
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.760]   Oh, this is the actual Dickens' face.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:28.240]   Oh, that's the--
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:28.800]   Oh, okay.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.080]   Very well.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:30.960]   Quiet is nice.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.000]   No.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.600]   Not quite as fancy.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.440]   Each picture, yeah.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:35.920]   Okay.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:36.880]   Why is there a car?
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.280]   Is that the garage as well?
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.880]   And yeah, they didn't finish the ceiling.
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:41.440]   I see what you're using.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.400]   No, that's just part of our scene setting.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.600]   That's the move. Santa's Jaguar?
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.200]   I guess.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.320]   That's the title feature.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:48.880]   Platoon.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.320]   I think it's fascinating.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.920]   Oh, there are.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.120]   There are cars.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.280]   Somebody put a lot of effort into this.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.320]   Oh god, yeah.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.600]   But you can't--
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.000]   I think there's--
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.600]   I think this must have caused a divorce.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.640]   It must have.
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.560]   Oh, there's a whole bunch of cars.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.240]   Try to be done.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.680]   I feel like that couldn't cause a divorce.
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:09.280]   Because, you know, that's the sort of thing you talk to your spouse about.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.120]   And if you have that kind of money, you're just like--
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:11.520]   Or--
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.320]   Yeah, okay.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.280]   I don't know why Jerry keeps disappearing in the basement.
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.600]   He seems to be working on something down there.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.080]   And the house itself is--
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.120]   I mean, again, not to my taste, but it's not a terrible house.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:27.120]   Well, let's go buy it.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.280]   4.5 million.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.080]   Ah!
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:34.640]   See how much a holiday village will add to the value of your home?
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.200]   Seven bedrooms, eight baths.
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:40.240]   Yeah, I think that's adding to the value.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.400]   I think the holiday village is probably something you're like--
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.360]   That is just--
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:45.760]   Oh, wow.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:47.440]   Look at all the washing machines they have.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.120]   They have two sets of washing machines.
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.120]   Well, when you have seven bedrooms and eight baths,
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.800]   you got to have a lot of washing machines.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:53.520]   A lot of sheets.
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.320]   I guess you have--
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:58.000]   They also have a rather grand dynasty-style drive.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:04.960]   Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:11.360]   Go to the office and see the family portrait over the fireplace.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.960]   Oh, Lord.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:15.520]   This is some crazy person's house.
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:21.280]   So the holiday stuff starts on 54.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:22.080]   I'm having fun.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:22.880]   Go one more.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.520]   I see that.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.480]   Look at that sculpture.
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:27.440]   There you see the one person.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:28.160]   No, keep going.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:28.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:29.200]   There--
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.240]   Here's the family.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.280]   Father.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:31.920]   There's the family.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:33.120]   I don't see a husband there.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.320]   I think that--
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:34.640]   Oh.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.120]   I'm dying out.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:37.600]   I'm trying to--
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.480]   Cut him out of the picture.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:40.880]   See?
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.880]   You think that's the two boys who are the husband,
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.520]   just a surprisingly young looking fellow.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.600]   After a spay in the list, what do you know?
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.680]   Maybe that's the daughter and the two sons.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:51.280]   Did you ever think of that, Jeff?
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.080]   Oh, could be.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:52.640]   Could be.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.160]   Do you ever think of that?
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:54.960]   That'd be, that's true.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.280]   That's good.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:55.840]   It could be.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.440]   Why is this fiddle under glass?
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.320]   Does anyone know?
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:58.480]   No.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.920]   Is it better not touch it or dad's going to be really mad?
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:04.640]   Anyway.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:07.440]   I thought this was funny, and since we were talking about crazy real estate--
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.000]   We have gone to--
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.440]   This show has gone way downhill.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.200]   I think I'm going to go listen to that Google podcast, honestly.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.600]   There's a balcony over the kitchen.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:15.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.200]   No, you ought to have a balcony because--
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.480]   Did you throw up an apple?
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:24.160]   Okay, what happened here?
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.520]   Where did I lose control?
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.400]   Stacy's fault.
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.360]   This was Stacy's fault.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.240]   That was my fault.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:28.720]   I'm not--
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.520]   Which was actually carsten's fault before that.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.040]   And my fault before--
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.160]   Yeah, I don't take any response.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:34.800]   I am not--
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.640]   I have taken no responsibility at all.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:37.600]   Just like the president.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.560]   It's not my fault.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.480]   Not my fault.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.840]   So--
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:44.560]   Amazon.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.120]   Google?
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.080]   Amazon.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:47.120]   You want to do some Amazon?
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:47.840]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:53.680]   We already mentioned that Prime Day is moving to September.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.000]   So to give you time to save up some money.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.600]   Here is--
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.800]   No, I'm not going to do that.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.480]   That's too depressing.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:08.480]   Apple's--
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.240]   I mean, sorry, Amazon's local podcast play.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:15.360]   Yeah, so that's a podcast story.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.800]   So they're trying to get--
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:17.920]   I don't understand this.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.760]   They want to do local sports and things.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.320]   They also want new content for their devices.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.800]   So it's not just podcasts.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:25.920]   It's also--
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.600]   And then there's also an internal fight
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.640]   that apparently audible wants the podcast.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.320]   But other parts of Amazon want the podcast.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.760]   So they think podcasts are hot.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:37.600]   I could see us all here working for Bezos.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:38.160]   Oh?
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:38.400]   Oh?
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.240]   They're using the Alexa Fund,
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.880]   which is a venture-armed tied device innovation
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:45.200]   to invest in local podcast companies.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.400]   Localized--
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.120]   So local news podcast?
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.240]   Yeah, well, localized news,
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.360]   localized sports.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.400]   They want to explore short-form audio content
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.600]   that could be surfaced
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.880]   when users ask echo for information about topics
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:57.680]   like news and sports.
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.520]   You know, I've actually experienced this.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.280]   There's an echo game you could play.
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.240]   The question of the day--
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.200]   It's a trivia question.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.560]   I started doing it.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:09.280]   And there's a podcast about the question of the day.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.480]   They call it a podcast.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:13.920]   And it plays automatically after you ask the question of the day.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.400]   You actually have to take steps to stop it.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.040]   That just sounds awesome.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:22.800]   But it shows that what they're really looking for
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.320]   is audio content to come out of the echo
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.800]   that's associated with what you're asking about.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.360]   For instance--
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.440]   Do you think they would make it exclusive to the echo?
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.680]   Yeah, why not?
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:34.000]   Sure.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.640]   If it's local especially, right?
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.320]   Because the echo knows where you are.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.080]   This is one thing podcasts right now
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.960]   don't have a very good local story.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.800]   It's one thing radio did for years.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.920]   In fact, the best radio I always thought was live, local.
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.240]   We're in your town talking about the stuff you care about.
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:55.600]   And podcasting that could do it.
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.520]   I've always thought a way of doing it.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.800]   You know, one thing I've wanted--
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.040]   I tried to write business plans for this years ago
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:01.840]   and never went anywhere.
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:02.720]   Like any of mine.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:08.480]   But so Chicago City Bureau trains citizens to go out
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.240]   and cover meetings and do things like that.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.560]   If you brought me an edit,
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.280]   a half hour edit of the best bits of the school board meeting,
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.760]   in my town, I'd listen.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:19.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:20.560]   Because I care.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.080]   It'd have to be curating.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:23.040]   No, I don't think so.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:23.920]   A lot of busy buddies.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:24.640]   A lot of busy buddies.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.440]   Yeah, you got an edit.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.640]   It's a long time.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.720]   It could find a full five hour meeting.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.400]   No, I know.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:34.560]   I watch three hour meetings online
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.160]   of my city council meetings
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.480]   because I find them fabulously entertaining.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.840]   Well, you two are piecing a pod.
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:40.240]   There you go.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:40.800]   There we go.
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.240]   Oh, I should totally make that into a podcast.
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.360]   Yes.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:45.920]   See?
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.080]   Trademark Jeff Jarvis.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.000]   Now it's called hyper personal.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:50.560]   Yeah.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.440]   Hyper personal.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.280]   You always talk about hyper local news.
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.520]   Hyper personalized audio content,
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.080]   according to a person familiar with Amazon's plans.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.520]   Now here's what Axios is saying.
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:01.040]   Local advertising, local,
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.920]   which is it would attract local advertising, right?
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.600]   You'd have Bill's Bagel shop
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.840]   and the, you know, the donut store in the corner.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.600]   Local advertising is a $150 billion market
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:16.160]   totally dominated by local radio, right?
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.360]   But Amazon--
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.480]   This is also why--
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:20.960]   Could do it.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:23.280]   Why Facebook started the stores.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:25.040]   And this is why I wrote in that post
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.960]   where I put up a friend link so you can get to it
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.440]   about village media.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:34.560]   So village media can haul in
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.720]   million and a half bucks in local revenue
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:39.440]   for a local blog with a few employees.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.120]   You know, I want to dispute this line
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.920]   in the Axios story where they say it's reported
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:47.040]   that Audible's efforts to invest in more original podcast
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.880]   shows with celebrities have confused podcast producers
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:53.280]   due to the fact that Amazon music also has plans
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.720]   to distribute podcasts.
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.720]   I just want to say I am not confused.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.440]   Just going to figure that out.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.200]   I figured I could tell the difference.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:01.840]   I understand.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:05.920]   So Spotify, Apple's rumored to be working on
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:09.200]   not only turning news plus into audio shows,
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.000]   but actually starting a podcast division.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.840]   It's so interesting how when a category gets hot,
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:18.080]   everybody just jumps in.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:21.600]   And I can't get $1.50 for this show,
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.840]   so I don't understand it myself.
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.160]   Spotify said last week it signed an exclusive deal.
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:27.440]   Yeah, that's the Joe Rogan deal.
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.240]   Apple wants to create original podcasts.
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:34.000]   And this, because more than one third of Americans
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.840]   listen to podcasts every month.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.160]   But, and I'll vouch for this,
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:44.160]   ad revenue for podcasts is still tiny compared to other mediums.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.080]   That's because, according to Ben Thompson, who ought to know,
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:51.200]   podcast monetization is currently too decentralized.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:54.400]   Do you listen to Ben's podcast?
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:54.880]   No.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.560]   He just launched another one, didn't he?
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.760]   Yeah, he doesn't understand.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:58.320]   15 minutes.
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.080]   He doesn't know what he's talking about, but okay, fine.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:03.040]   Believe me, it's not decentralized.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.200]   Spotify's big time investments could help
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.200]   centralized monetization for the genre.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.120]   Yes, that's a problem.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.120]   Centralize it in Spotify's pocket.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:14.480]   Apple has the largest portion of podcast listeners,
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.240]   and that's also somewhat inaccurate.
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:20.480]   Almost half of podcast listeners use iTunes.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.680]   It doesn't mean Apple has them.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:23.680]   Right.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.560]   It's a big difference.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.960]   It's not a publisher, it's just a directory.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:29.040]   So, anyway.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:33.680]   Anyway, some day podcasts are going to be huge,
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.760]   and you will have been, you could say,
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:39.120]   "Not you won't be saying I'm the Dell Hell Guy anymore."
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:42.400]   You'll say, "I'm the guy that started podcasting."
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.200]   You could say that.
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.440]   How many years have been doing this one?
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.080]   I don't know.
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:46.800]   Way too long.
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.640]   Five hundred six hundred episodes.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.640]   Don't get him sad and bitter again.
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.320]   Almost 11 years, Jeff.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.760]   Almost 11 years.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.520]   No, I've never done sad and bitter.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:56.080]   The company.
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:56.640]   No, no, you.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:57.920]   This one.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.240]   This is the 51st episode.
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:01.440]   Jesus.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:04.320]   Even if we had 50 a year, 52 an year.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.200]   You're going to be sick of me.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.480]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:07.120]   I'm sick of me.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.720]   No, it is kind of amazing that we've been
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:13.040]   five hundred and sixty times four hours each.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:13.920]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:14.480]   It's a lot of hours.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:17.840]   Wait, these are not four hours long.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:18.640]   They just feel well.
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.720]   Maybe they used to be with Stacey.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.760]   No, no, no.
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.440]   It's never been--
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.400]   It's actually gotten longer.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.360]   It's gotten longer, yeah.
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.480]   What?
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:27.840]   Let's make it short again.
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:28.560]   You know what?
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:29.760]   I now--
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.840]   Now that I know that Joe Rogan,
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.400]   100 Millionaire Joe Rogan's podcast,
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.160]   averages more than three hours.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.560]   We're heading for four today, Stacey.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.840]   I don't feel guilty at all.
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:42.400]   I only had soup and bread.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:42.800]   No, no, we're not.
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:43.680]   I'm going to need more food.
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:44.640]   No, we're going to be done.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:47.520]   I'm not hungry yet.
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.160]   We're fine.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:51.680]   Do we care that Twitter is--
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:52.880]   Finally is labeling.
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:56.640]   By the way, they didn't label Trump's tweets about
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.240]   Joe Scarborough's assistant being murdered,
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.440]   which were blatantly bizarre and wrong.
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.200]   But they did label his tweet saying
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.360]   email voting is bound to be filled with fraud,
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.440]   which I think is less provably wrong.
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:14.080]   But for the first time, Twitter is going--
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.200]   They kind of did the next one.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.720]   There was the fewer.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:16.960]   Right.
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:17.840]   They didn't want it.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:19.360]   And they kind of picked the next one.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.400]   Oh, is that how it works?
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:20.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:25.280]   And they've said that Facebook and Twitter are both--
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:28.400]   and that is defrauding people about elections is bad,
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.480]   so they could jump on that.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:34.240]   So this is what you see, and I don't follow Trump on Twitter, obviously,
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:36.880]   but you'd get a big fact check label.
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.960]   Get the facts about mail-in ballots.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:39.680]   It doesn't even take.
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:42.240]   Some people said that may look like Twitter's agreeing with Trump.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.000]   Right. It doesn't look like it's disagreeing.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.760]   Yeah, that's not saying--
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:48.960]   And then the right wing has gone.
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:50.480]   If Trump's threatening to shut down--
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:51.520]   That's it.
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.880]   We're going to put them out of business,
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.640]   if they don't fix their bias.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.640]   The right wing is picking on individual Twitter employees,
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.960]   whom I know, and finding any of their tweets that are anti-Trump,
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:04.080]   and you say, and this proves--
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.920]   Of course-- and don't they see the irony here?
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:08.960]   Is there complaining about their freedom of speech being impinged upon?
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.280]   But then they're going out for anyone else's freedom of speech.
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.840]   Oh, no, but the irony?
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.480]   Are you kidding?
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:15.680]   Yeah, I know.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:16.400]   I know.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.280]   Are you kidding?
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.360]   I'm on Jeff.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:27.440]   Half the Twitter accounts pushing to reopen America are bots.
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:32.480]   And the only problem with that, to my mind, is how media thinks that--
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:34.080]   Oh my god, America wants to reopen.
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:37.600]   And they've got 500 people on the street in an entire state,
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.440]   and bots used as their basis.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:44.960]   200 million tweets discussing COVID-19.
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.240]   This is from Carnegie Mellon.
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.840]   They analyzed them.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:56.160]   Half the accounts, including 62% of the 1,000 most influential retweeters,
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.280]   appeared to be bots.
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:02.720]   Non-- not real people, they're automated retweeters.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:04.640]   Who makes these bots?
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:05.120]   Do we know?
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.760]   Russia?
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:11.120]   Well, this is what Business Insider says.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:11.600]   China.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.160]   China.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:12.640]   China.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.080]   There are a few possible--
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:14.800]   Like, I don't know.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:15.200]   That's--
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:16.080]   No, we don't know.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:19.440]   There are few possible explanations for the surge in bot activity.
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.360]   People may have more time to set up elaborate bot networks during stay at home orders.
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.480]   I think that is true.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:29.120]   The availability of botnets for hire has exploded recently.
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:29.760]   That's the problem.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:34.240]   You can't tell if it's somebody trying to destabilize the US.
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:37.760]   If it's just a bunch of weirdos.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.360]   You just don't know.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.000]   It could be Brad.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:40.480]   But I can't.
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.240]   Because I don't follow Brad Parskow.
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:42.560]   I don't think I'm--
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:42.960]   I don't think I'm--
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:43.120]   See them.
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:45.920]   How come you don't see them?
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:48.960]   Because I follow people I like and know.
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.520]   That's the problem.
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:53.280]   Oh, somewhere on Twitter there's a bot.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:53.920]   Yes, there is.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:54.800]   Somewhere on Twitter.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:57.040]   Yes, but a lot of people retweet the bots.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:02.240]   I see bots because people who I follow for their technical or some other
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:04.400]   acumen also tend to retweet those things.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.000]   So they are out there, Jeff.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.360]   Well, that's a larger problem, then.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.880]   Well, yeah, I think that's the issue for people.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:11.920]   It's not that they're--
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:15.360]   It's not just that the bots exist.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.200]   It's that people who maybe--
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.840]   Like, my journalist friends do not retweet bots.
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:24.480]   But the people I follow in like cloud computing or maybe in the security space or
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:29.120]   corgi space, very big bot retweeters.
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:29.680]   What?
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:30.960]   Is that true, really?
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:32.720]   That's--
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.880]   Those are like normal people who like--
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.480]   Normal people are the problem because they--
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.120]   I see that once I got one back to Facebook,
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:40.480]   I see that a lot of Facebook, which is
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:47.360]   normal users don't aren't really distinguishing between anything.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.320]   They just--
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.240]   Share that, share that, share that.
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:57.440]   I think life would be better without Twitter, but that's just me.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:00.480]   I know neither of you agree with me.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.200]   I'm the only one.
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:03.840]   You're the only one.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:04.960]   So here's some--
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:08.640]   I like how you made that into a song.
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:09.840]   That's good.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.240]   Sorry.
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.200]   It's our new--
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.440]   We're going to start releasing a soundtrack.
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:14.240]   I think--
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.600]   Didn't they try it briefly?
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.840]   They tried musical podcasts?
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.360]   Like for one like second--
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.560]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.960]   It was like the musical TV shows.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:23.920]   It didn't work very well.
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:24.320]   I need it.
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:24.560]   Gone.
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.480]   You know what?
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:26.880]   You know what?
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.160]   Took true crime.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:29.600]   Oh boy.
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.200]   If it bleeds, it leads, baby.
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:34.000]   Are we going to talk about true crime again?
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:34.800]   No, no.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:35.360]   We're OK.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:40.320]   We're going to talk about the fabulous, fabulous ruling
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:47.520]   from John Cauffinor of the US District Court in Seattle.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:55.120]   And it goes back to a arrest in May 2019 in Washington state.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:59.840]   A guy was indicted on several charges related to robbery and assault.
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:02.080]   He was using a Motorola smartphone.
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:06.160]   When he was arrested, he says one of the officers present
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.680]   hit the power button to bring up the phone's lock screen.
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:14.560]   The filing doesn't say that any officer present attempted to unlock the phone or
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.720]   make the suspect do the same.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:24.480]   In February 2020, the FBI also turned the phone on to take a photograph of the phone's
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:28.720]   lock screen, which displayed the name "streasy" on it.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:35.120]   The lawyer for the defendant filed a motion arguing this evidence should not have been
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:37.360]   sought without a warrant and should be suppressed.
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:40.320]   In other words, they didn't unlock the phone.
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.680]   They just looked at the lock screen.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:45.360]   Is that evidence that requires a warrant?
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.440]   The district judge said, "Yes."
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.440]   Really?
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:49.760]   Yes.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:53.760]   The judge determined police looking at the phone at the time of the arrest and the
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:57.120]   FBI looking at it again are two separate issues.
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:02.160]   Police are allowed to conduct searches without search warrants under special circumstances.
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.440]   That's probable cause, right?
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:08.400]   And looking at the phone's lock screen may have been permissible as it took place
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:14.160]   either incident to a lawful arrest or as part of the police's efforts to inventory the personal
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:14.560]   effects.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:21.600]   So, and he then did say, "I want to," he asked the police to see if their search
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.120]   of the phone fell within those boundaries.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:27.680]   So he didn't give them a complete pass, but he said, "There are circumstances.
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.280]   That's part of the normal process."
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:34.240]   But he said, "The FBI's actions crystal clear and counter to the defendant's
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:40.880]   Fourth Amendment rights. The judge ruled FBI physically intruded on the defendant's personal
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:44.560]   effects when the FBI powered on his phone to take a picture of the lock screen.
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:45.440]   That is a search.
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.600]   The FBI did not have a warrant.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.520]   It was unconstitutional.
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:52.640]   Good decision will allow us.
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.720]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:58.800]   It's just one court, US District Court in Seattle.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:01.680]   Is it a precedent?
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.600]   I don't know necessarily if it is.
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:07.440]   It could be certainly brought up in other cases, but I don't know if it's binding.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.560]   I know it's not binding.
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:15.920]   Well, it's binding if people try to refer to it or if it gets appealed and goes higher up and
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:16.720]   then they change it.
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:17.200]   It could go higher up.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:21.360]   It would have to be appealed before it would become binding.
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:24.320]   As I don't know, I don't know lawyer.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.040]   What am I saying?
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:25.520]   I don't know.
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.360]   I don't know.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.560]   Is there something you hear about licking things?
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.360]   Did I see that?
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:32.320]   Yes, there is.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:32.960]   Yes, there is.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:33.920]   Well, Carson put it in.
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:34.880]   I did not put it in.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.000]   Who wants to take ownership besides Carsten?
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.280]   I can explain it.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:41.840]   I read it.
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:44.800]   I did the homework.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:50.640]   Carsten thought it was a cure for my missing Taco Bell.
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.240]   That you could let that.
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:56.560]   I could get this device that would simulate the flavor of my
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:05.280]   bean and cheese burrito because it has three little pistons there that mix various flavors.
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.600]   What is he reading?
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:10.080]   What is he reading that he would find?
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:16.160]   This lickable screen can recreate almost any taste or flavor without eating food.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.120]   Now see, I need that.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.040]   I need that.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.560]   This is, of course, from where do you think?
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.400]   What country do you think would be doing this?
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.240]   Yep, Sweden.
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:27.920]   Major University in Japan.
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:29.600]   Yep.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:33.040]   They've invented what is being described as a taste display.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:37.520]   Folks, don't pass around the taste display.
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:38.320]   I'm just saying.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:39.200]   I'm just looking at this.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.800]   I'm like, this looks like licking a live battery and something you should not.
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:42.800]   Exactly.
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.400]   It's like what you prank people with.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:54.880]   It's five different sensors that can trigger five different tastes on a user's tongue.
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:59.600]   We all know sweet, salty, sour, and bitter.
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:02.400]   The Japanese believe there's umami.
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:05.040]   I believe in the Japanese umami.
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:06.320]   I believe in umami.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:07.440]   Delicious.
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:11.520]   So this could be interesting.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:12.640]   I mean, think about it.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:15.200]   Like you're eating something that's good for you.
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:17.600]   Sorry, I didn't mean to be that.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:18.720]   Then you just lick this on the side.
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:20.480]   This is, there's this synthesizer.
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:24.000]   They've got a sweet gel, a salty gel, a acidic gel, a bitter gel,
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.200]   and a new mommy gel.
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:30.080]   Just injects MSG right to your tongue.
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:34.640]   I'm just going to, I want to call foul on this because as everybody knows,
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:37.680]   if you don't smell it, you can't taste it.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:43.680]   These are these five flavors do not compose the entirety of these of the tastes.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:44.640]   Censor him.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:49.520]   He's going to launch into a wine stomp thing.
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.200]   No, it's true.
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:53.360]   Hold your nose and taste something.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.520]   You might know it's bitter, salty, sweet, or sour,
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.440]   but you don't know it's delicious.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.320]   You don't know what it is.
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:03.040]   That's why COVID-19 is such a horrible disease.
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:07.280]   You lose your censors people.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:07.840]   Oh, that too.
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.040]   That too.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:09.760]   I'm just saying.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:14.080]   Um, it could be, but honestly, if I can't taste something, kill me now anyway.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.880]   Um, bleep burp says you can't smell salt.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:19.360]   So there.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:20.560]   Okay.
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:24.720]   Yes, you would know it's salty, but you wouldn't know it's a fine coke he saw.
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:26.320]   Jacques without the smell.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.880]   No, but like acidic things you can actually taste without the smell too.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:31.840]   You taste acidity.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.320]   You don't you taste one of those five, four or five.
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:35.520]   I don't know if you could.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:37.360]   I don't you might sense who mommy.
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.360]   I don't think you taste to mommy, but anyway, then.
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:41.920]   Mommy or mommy.
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:43.360]   So magic leaps not dead yet.
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:44.160]   I'm not dead yet.
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.160]   Raise 300.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.720]   Who would give them $350 million at this point?
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.520]   They were about to fire everybody.
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:52.160]   Soft bake.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.000]   Was it soft?
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:54.800]   No, who was it?
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:55.680]   No, that's a joke.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:56.160]   That's a joke.
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.720]   Um, well, it was actually that's an interesting point because it was people
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:02.160]   who had already put money in.
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:05.840]   I was about to say people who already invested the crazy amounts of money.
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:06.160]   Right.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.360]   The two point six billion.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:12.640]   Hey, good for them for using a Warren Act filing is a way to talk about something.
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:13.200]   I love it.
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.840]   Oh, you business reporters are crazy.
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:16.960]   What's the Warren Act?
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.240]   Is that Elizabeth Warren?
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.560]   No, no, no, no, the Warren and W.A.R.
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:21.840]   And it's a Warren filing.
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.200]   It says it's the workforce.
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:27.120]   Every state's workforce commission requires you to file.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:27.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.200]   Before laying people off.
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.920]   So the who is unknown.
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:36.400]   Uh, or the why a key health care company may be involved,
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.520]   according to tech crunch.
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:41.200]   And you know, the tech crunch has the sources Brian Heater writing.
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:44.400]   Whatever the case, the company is withdrawing the Warren notice
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:47.760]   because they were going to lay off the rest of the staff.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:51.200]   So apparently they are not going to lay them off.
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:56.240]   They're moving to enterprise though, as you can tell on the website.
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:57.600]   No more flying whales.
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:05.920]   You know, we talked about this on a Twitter sometime ago that really the issue is what
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:11.360]   Magic Leap's trying to do is not the kind of thing VC was invented for.
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:20.080]   It's long term blue sky research and it needs a lot of money over a long period of time
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.760]   with no pressure to produce to.
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:24.960]   And that's what that is what VC was built for.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:25.440]   Really?
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:26.720]   Yes.
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:27.440]   I thought it was.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:29.120]   VC's funded things like Intel.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.960]   Oh, no, VC's had a.
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:33.760]   VC versus private equity.
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:39.760]   No, VC's were created to do seven to 10 year fund life cycles.
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.280]   Is that what they are today?
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:44.160]   No, VC's have changed a lot.
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.080]   The good ones are still good ones there.
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.280]   But yeah, if you're.
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:51.920]   Yeah, because really it would be.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:56.400]   Imprudent to think that Magic Leap was going to create something in a few years.
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:31:00.480]   This is a hard problem and you need to throw a lot of money at it to solve it.
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:05.600]   And they had some very good technology, but they had a hard time making it small and,
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:06.720]   you know, usable.
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:14.400]   This is the conversation, by the way, was all about Apple's AR and VR ambitions and why they
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:18.400]   might be a better steward of this because they have a lot of money and they have a long,
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:20.640]   a little bit longer term outlook.
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:26.080]   Traditionally, you know, I think of Bell Labs, for instance, or Xerox Park where companies,
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:31.360]   these large companies would always devote a certain amount of their money to blue sky R&D
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:35.360]   because they knew in the long run it would give them some benefits.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:36.240]   That's part of their spectrum.
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.680]   We're going to be a VR business.
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.160]   Um, no, there will be.
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:45.280]   I don't think it's going to be huge consumer business for a while.
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:48.640]   I think we'll see, you'll see things in gaming.
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:53.840]   It's actually quite successful in industrial right now, both AR and VR.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:32:02.000]   So training people in VR is something that's done in actually putting VR headsets on workers
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.120]   is also done today.
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:12.800]   So Carson says, if you pair the lickable screen with the digital smell interface,
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:19.440]   then you're cooking with gas.
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:23.600]   I hope not because what if those things, they look a little iffy?
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:24.400]   What if they spark?
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:30.400]   Well, actually the beauty of the Android, you don't have to cook at all.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:32.800]   Just simulates eating.
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:35.600]   It wouldn't fool me for very long.
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:42.640]   Let's take a little break and then we have the, well, let's be crazy.
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:43.680]   Shall I call me crazy?
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:44.720]   Should we do the change log?
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:45.600]   Sure.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:52.800]   It's time for Jeffrey, the Google, the Google change log.
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:53.760]   Log.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:58.240]   Very disappointing.
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:02.800]   Very disappointing to report the original Google home.
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:07.280]   If you've got one, save it, put it away, put it in your Christmas basement because
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:09.440]   it's no longer available on the Google store.
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:15.840]   Could this be the sign, the end as Rita El-Kori writes in Android police,
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.520]   the end of a cylindrical era?
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:22.000]   Could this be a sign that Google has something better?
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:32.000]   There was selling for $99 in the US store, the no longer available notice showed up 12 hours ago.
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:35.840]   Same in Canada, same in Japan.
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:38.160]   That's not a change.
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:41.200]   That's just a warning about a change that's soon to come.
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:48.000]   But I thought it was still appropriate for the Google change log.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.800]   Google messages preparing end-to-end encryption for RCS messages.
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:56.000]   This is that technology that no phone company seems to want,
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.240]   but Google's really pushing because it would give them parity with Apple's messages.
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:05.680]   And man, if you had end-to-end encryption, now how much would you pay?
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:07.360]   This comes from 9 to 5 Google.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:13.200]   They're looking at a dog food build of Google messages versus 6.2,
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:18.800]   which has end-to-end encryption settings in the settings page.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:22.880]   That's, I think that's fantastic.
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:23.840]   That's fantastic.
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:26.880]   I'd like to know what kind of encryption they're going to use, but
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:29.760]   we'll find out more to come.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:34.320]   Google's going to make wheelchair accessibility more prominent in maps.
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:39.760]   So that's a good idea using its new accessible places feature,
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:45.600]   a mode that when toggled on, we'll more prominently show where you can get in
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:48.400]   if you have mobility issues.
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:54.320]   When accessible places is switched on in maps, a wheelchair icon would indicate an accessible
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:57.440]   entrance and you'll be able to see if the place has accessible seating.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:00.240]   Next time you don't complain about these technology companies, look at this.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:01.600]   I know that's fantastic.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:02.240]   Yes, it turned on.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:02.800]   Amazing.
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:03.840]   Yeah, I think that's great.
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.800]   Great.
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:10.880]   130 million wheelchair users worldwide, you know, of which 30 million reside in the US.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:16.960]   And it built it using crowdsourcing, using the local guide volunteers,
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.480]   who by the way, I'm one of.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:21.920]   I mean, I didn't realize this, but I often get asked by Google,
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:24.240]   "Oh, can you tell us a few things about this place?"
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:25.600]   Almost always accessible.
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:26.720]   Yes.
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:27.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:27.600]   Yes.
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.160]   Always.
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:29.200]   That is always a question.
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:29.760]   Yep.
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.440]   And is this place good for families?
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:32.640]   That's another popular one.
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:33.120]   Yep.
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:34.240]   I like to answer those.
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:34.720]   I do.
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:35.840]   If I know the answer, yeah.
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.200]   Is there parking, that kind of thing?
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.840]   So we're all local guides now.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:40.640]   I think that's great.
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:41.600]   We were doing good things.
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:42.400]   We didn't even know it.
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:51.040]   Google Maps has also added a tool for donations and online classes during quarantine.
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:54.640]   It also lets shops list special hours for seniors,
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:56.800]   which is great.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:00.640]   I don't know why they always make the special hours for seniors like 6am.
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:07.200]   Because people get up early.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:08.240]   I like to sleep in.
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:11.040]   I beg to go to the bathroom five times.
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:14.080]   Yeah, but that's mean I'm going to get dressed and go to Nama Yoga Lotus.
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:15.840]   What?
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:16.480]   Huh?
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:17.840]   Huh?
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:17.840]   Huh?
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:18.320]   Huh?
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:18.800]   Huh?
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:18.800]   Huh?
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:18.800]   Huh?
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:18.800]   Huh?
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:19.280]   Huh?
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:25.360]   Well, apparently that's one of the places that has special senior hours.
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.760]   Senior Yoga coming soon.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:35.280]   Google Now let's businesses clarify what online services they offer during the pandemic.
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:38.320]   This will let the businesses communicate.
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:44.000]   They call it attributes, short notes that show up under business information in the listing.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.440]   So here it is.
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:50.960]   The Nama Yoga Lotus Studio, for instance, a real popular one with the Google folks.
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.600]   Hours or services may differ, I guess, is what it says there.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:56.160]   That's the note.
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:00.320]   They're also expanding a tool called Reserve with Google that lets people book
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:01.760]   appointments directly from a listing.
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:02.720]   I like that feature.
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:06.880]   So I could just press that Nama Yoga Lotus button and book online.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:11.040]   You might ask me why I'm picking on Nama Yoga Lotus.
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:11.520]   I don't know.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:12.960]   I just Google is apparently.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:16.240]   It's a yoga studio in Mountain View.
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:17.760]   I think probably Sundar goes there.
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.760]   That'd be my guess.
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:20.480]   Not anymore.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:21.840]   Oh, no, not anymore.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:22.720]   Actually, you know, it's funny.
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:26.960]   Lisa and I were both talking about, boy, we really want to do yoga classes.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:28.000]   I guess we'll do them online.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.800]   But there are a lot of yoga studios in Petaloma, but they're all closed.
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:33.120]   Yeah.
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:34.400]   Yes.
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:37.920]   Google is now testing something interesting.
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:43.120]   Voice confirmation for purchases when you make them through Google Assistant.
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:49.520]   So it's so.
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:51.920]   Long pause.
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:58.480]   It's so the idea is you could it would know your voice.
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:02.320]   So it's had the ability to know your voice for quite some time,
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:04.640]   but it would use it for authentication in this case.
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:06.880]   But what's new here is the authentication.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.920]   And I will say that my Google still does not recognize my voice,
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:11.600]   although it does recognize my face.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:16.000]   So yeah, it seems a little yeah, it's really creepy how well it recognizes my face.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.040]   I might have the hub max.
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:20.560]   I could be like you could just get a little bit of me and it goes boom.
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:21.680]   Hello, Leo.
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:22.800]   It knows me, man.
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.960]   It really knows me.
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:32.720]   Google Play Store tests showing popular gameplay videos with the game listings in the listings.
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:38.160]   This is something Apple added a while ago, but Google and I thought Google had it.
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:41.600]   I guess not, but they're going to have little videos so you can see the game.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.200]   Game play watch.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.640]   Oh, this is new though.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:45.680]   Watch others play.
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:47.440]   You can go to the YouTube.
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:50.240]   What do they call that?
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:50.880]   Play with me.
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:52.560]   Play along section.
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:55.120]   That's going to be linked right in the play listing.
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:55.920]   That's interesting.
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:59.520]   Oh, do you use Gmail anymore?
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:00.400]   Do you still use Gmail?
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:03.360]   So yeah, I use Gmail.
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.320]   No, I don't use Gmail.
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:06.800]   Oh, because he's proton.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:07.760]   What do you use?
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:09.680]   No, I use fast mail.
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:12.720]   I use Gmail, but I get so much spam.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:17.040]   Partly, it was my fault because my Gmail address is LaPort at Gmail.
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:23.680]   And every freaking Frenchie in the world seems to think that they should send me spam.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:25.440]   So I get a lot of French language spam.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:31.040]   But I also get a lot of stuff because this must be very common.
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:37.200]   I get like reservations and confirmations and all sorts of stuff in French.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:43.200]   And I think it is that it's like Francois LaPort at gmail.com, but they put a space between
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:47.120]   Francois and LaPort. So it just goes to me, LaPort.
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:50.400]   And basically the Gmail account for all LaPorts worldwide.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:55.120]   This is why now you know why I no longer use Gmail.
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:56.960]   Anyway, I'm going to defer to you.
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:03.680]   But apparently the quick settings menu is now changed and pop.
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:05.360]   Settings page is just awful.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:07.440]   It always has a quick settings.
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:08.960]   What is the quick settings?
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:09.760]   I don't even know.
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:10.640]   Yeah, like what?
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:12.160]   All right, let me log into my Gmail.
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:13.920]   Well, no, I'm in my Gmail.
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:14.400]   Let's see.
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:15.920]   Okay, look for quick settings.
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:19.360]   I don't know what they're talking about when they say quick settings.
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:20.880]   Like the hamburger menu?
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.240]   Look, LaPorts.
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:25.440]   One to five was a very key.
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:28.560]   Reci, Univer Massage.
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:30.000]   I thought it was Massage Nouveau.
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.040]   Massage Nouveau.
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:33.200]   Oh, it's a terrible bad French.
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:34.560]   What language is this?
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:36.400]   But dankt voor und duneoti.
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:38.400]   Dutch, I think.
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.720]   Yeah, so apparently there's some Dutch LaPorts as well.
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:42.720]   Apparently donated to six euros.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:44.560]   Nice job.
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:45.600]   Jesus.
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:46.080]   Nice job.
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:47.120]   You see why I don't use this?
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:50.960]   Well, you could just have a different address on Gmail.
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:51.920]   I maybe I should.
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:52.640]   French days.
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:56.720]   D'Oremise,
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:58.240]   tous lous sitte,
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:40:59.520]   le French days.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:02.160]   Wait a minute.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:04.960]   Do French people call it French days?
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:05.920]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.120]   That doesn't make any sense.
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:09.440]   So let me see here.
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:10.640]   Let me go to my settings.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:13.360]   I don't see anything quick about them.
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:18.240]   Where are these so-called quick settings?
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.680]   Huh.
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:21.440]   Huh.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:23.120]   I don't see them.
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:24.160]   Ooh.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:27.280]   Maybe I don't have them yet.
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:29.280]   Maybe they know I'm not using it anymore.
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:32.720]   Well, anyway,
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:37.680]   that was supposedly the biggest settings over hall in years.
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:39.600]   But I don't see anything.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:42.560]   And finally, YouTube's app gets bedtime reminders.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:47.120]   So you don't wake up slumped over your phone at 3am.
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:48.800]   Nice headline, Ryan.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:55.360]   They have had break reminders in YouTube for a while,
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:56.960]   but now they will actually say,
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:58.400]   you know, you've been,
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:00.080]   it's time maybe you should go to bed.
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.000]   Maybe you should go to bed.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.640]   You have to turn this on though,
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:05.680]   and you can snooze them.
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.000]   Set a bedtime reminder.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.920]   Signing to YouTube,
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:11.600]   go to settings and turn,
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.840]   remind me when it's time for bed on.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:16.720]   How does it know?
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:19.280]   Oh, you have to have to have a set the starting end to time.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:24.400]   I have more than one friend who gets warned by TikTok
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:26.320]   that without having to set anything,
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:27.440]   you've been on too long.
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:28.320]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:29.760]   I think they should do that.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:33.920]   And that, my friends, is the Google change law.
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:36.400]   [loud crash]
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.400]   We've done our duty, my friends.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:42.240]   Now it's time for me to tell you about Express VPN.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:42.800]   You're home.
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:47.520]   Oh, oh, I am so mad at the United States Congress
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:48.640]   in the Rio, in the,
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:52.080]   in the authorization for the Patriot Act.
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:54.400]   You know, they tried to put in
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:58.880]   an amendment to it that said the FBI
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:02.000]   can't just go looking at your internet history without a warrant.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000]   That failed in the Senate with, by one vote,
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.760]   I think it's going to fail in the House too.
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.240]   The FBI is going to be able to just go to your internet service provider
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:12.960]   and say, I want to see everything Stacy's been up to
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:16.000]   for the last, as long as she's been a customer.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.040]   And they'll just hand it over.
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.080]   No warrant, no nothing.
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:22.480]   If ever there was a time to start using a VPN at home,
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:24.240]   I know you're thinking, well, I don't go out anymore.
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:25.040]   I don't need a VPN.
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:26.160]   I'm a member of the coffee shop.
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:27.760]   You might want to be using it at home.
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:28.800]   But let me tell you something.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:30.880]   If you're going to use a VPN, it's got to be fast, right?
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.800]   You don't want to feel like you're suffering
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:34.480]   because you're using a VPN.
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:40.000]   And maybe more importantly, whatever privacy issues you're concerned about with your ISP,
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.520]   you're just kicking the can down the road.
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:45.200]   That new VPN provider, they're going to see everything you're doing too.
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:49.920]   So you got to pick a VPN with a good privacy policy.
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:52.560]   That's why I use Express VPN.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:56.480]   By the way, the privacy policy has been verified by independent third party audits.
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:00.240]   They even went so far as to create a new kind of VPN server.
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:05.440]   They call it trusted server that when you go to express VPN,
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:08.880]   you can do it in your phone, iPhone, Android, you can do it on the computer.
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:10.480]   You can do it in a lot of places, TV.
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:13.680]   When you press that big button, it turns on the VPN.
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:18.880]   It spins up the trusted server at that VPN location just for you.
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:19.520]   That's yours.
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:23.120]   It runs in memory and only in memory and it's sandbox.
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:24.320]   It cannot write to hard drive.
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:25.680]   And then the minute you leave, it's gone.
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.720]   It's like footprints in the sands of time.
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:32.160]   It just your presence is not recorded.
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:36.240]   That means Express VPN, not only do they not log your information, they can't.
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:39.280]   And I think that's really important.
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:46.000]   Not only can the FBI get it, but your ISP can legally sell information about your
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.480]   internet visits to ad companies and most of them do.
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:51.520]   Express VPN does not.
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:54.880]   Plus they secure your browsing.
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:57.280]   They secure your internet traffic.
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.960]   That's what a VPN does.
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:02.960]   And if you think, oh, don't worry, I using Cognito mode and Cognito mode
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:07.440]   does not hide your surf surfing history from your internet service provider.
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:10.480]   They can still see every website you've ever visited.
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:16.880]   When you're home, when you're about now, you should always use Express VPN.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:17.440]   It's fast.
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:18.560]   It's easy.
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:20.960]   They have servers all over the world, 90 plus countries,
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.520]   which means you can use Express VPN to be in England, for instance.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:29.040]   If you want to use the English Netflix and watch your Doctor Who series or Japan,
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:32.080]   if you want to watch anime series, it's pretty cool.
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:38.400]   Protect your online activity today with the number one VPN, not only, not just me,
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:42.240]   CNET and wire degree Express VPN.
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.680]   And we've got a great deal for you.
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:45.440]   Less is seven bucks a month.
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:47.120]   Now I know you say, well, I get it for free.
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:47.920]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:51.280]   Free VPN service is worse than your ISP.
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:52.800]   They've got to monetize you somehow.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:54.720]   That means they are watching you.
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:57.120]   They're even injecting ads in your stream, all sorts of stuff.
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:58.640]   Use the best.
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:01.520]   It's not expensive and believe me, it's worth it.
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:04.160]   ExpressVPN.com/twig.
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:08.480]   The best deal, you get a three months free when you sign up for a year.
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:12.480]   ExpressVPN.com/twig.
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:13.600]   These guys are the best.
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.760]   That's what I use and that's what I recommend everybody use.
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:18.960]   ExpressVPN.com/twig.
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:20.240]   Thank you, ExpressVPN.
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:24.160]   Taco Bell is going to be an advertiser.
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:25.200]   Yeah.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:26.240]   With Quibi.
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:28.320]   Oh no, they already are, but they don't want to pay.
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:30.160]   Nah, would you want to?
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:35.200]   They're revising deal terms with Quibi.
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:37.520]   Revising deal terms.
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:42.960]   Because Quibi, that's the short form video thing created by Hollywood's
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:45.920]   Jeffrey Katzenberg and Silicon Valley's Meg Whitman.
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:50.880]   They had ad deals worth $150 million at launch,
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:56.000]   including Taco Bell, Pepsi owns Taco Bell,
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.320]   Yum Brands, Anheuser-Busch, Walmart.
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.400]   According to the Wall Street Journal,
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.960]   I've all asked for changes to the contracts
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:06.160]   because of concerns about the service's low viewership
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:10.000]   or the impact of COVID on their businesses.
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.800]   And that's true, that's happened with us.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:14.560]   Advertisers are suffering.
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:20.080]   And we've actually, what we've tried to do to many of our advertisers is give them deals,
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:22.880]   you know, give them value ads and things like that,
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:24.880]   because we know the business is hurting.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:26.960]   We want to keep them happy.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:33.520]   Quibi had hoped to get, I think their plan was to have 16 million customers in three years.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:36.640]   They want to get 7 million in the first year.
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:39.280]   You know, they're not doing bad as of last week,
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:42.000]   according to the Journal, 4.2 million installations.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.640]   And 1.5 million users signing up to their free 90-day trial.
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:50.160]   We won't know for a couple of months.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.680]   It started April 6th, so what is that?
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:56.800]   April, May, June, July 6th, we'll know if people stick around.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:01.520]   This is what the Quibi's Head of Advertising Partnership said.
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:05.120]   "We deeply value the commitments our advertising partners have made
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:07.600]   and are working in close partnership with them
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:10.320]   to learn and help them be successful in the platform."
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:11.280]   We're saying the same thing.
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:18.480]   But yeah, you know, it's tough for everybody right now,
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:22.160]   but Quibi, it's been tough.
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:24.320]   Today's the day, by the way, for HBO Max.
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:30.880]   I'm going to say, what is that?
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:34.720]   Well, that's the biggest problem they have.
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:38.080]   Not only what is it, but should I pay for it, do I already have it?
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:43.920]   I was just Mark Harris, who I worked with on Entertainment Weekly, was just tweeting.
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:46.880]   Several hours in, I have no idea how to get you back, so I'm on my TV.
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:50.880]   Well, because I don't think you can, because I think that they're making you pay another $15
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:51.600]   for HBO.
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:55.840]   If I want to watch Anna Kendrick, tough nugges on you, you fool.
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:59.200]   You already paid us every month for years, even though Showtime is better.
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:08.720]   HBO Max, weirdly, despite coming out today, is not available on Roku or Amazon devices,
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:11.200]   which are dominant in the marketplace.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:12.560]   You can get it on Apple TV.
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:15.200]   You can get it on Chromecast.
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:19.040]   But tell me if I'm wrong, if you already subscribed to HBO,
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:21.040]   you don't get to be on that.
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:21.840]   No, you don't get any deal.
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:28.400]   If you buy HBO, I'll a cart with their HBO Now program, it will convert to Max,
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:29.360]   probably already has.
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:31.120]   So it's the same price.
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:35.600]   So that's for people who buy it with HBO.
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:37.920]   I do with my cable company, but we don't get it.
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:38.080]   No.
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:41.440]   That pisses me off.
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:43.040]   Unless you're with Spectrum.
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:46.480]   Are you with Spectrum?
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:47.440]   No.
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:51.840]   Some cable companies, AT&T, are you with AT&T?
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:53.280]   I'm in the files.
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:55.600]   Verizon?
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:01.920]   So this is the problem is that many people are getting it for free because of side deals.
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:02.560]   AT&T.
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:05.200]   AT&T is getting it for free Spectrum, which is another cable company.
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:07.440]   AT&T owns HBO Max now.
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:08.320]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:10.240]   They're all Warner HBO.
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:16.320]   Well, then I bought the Super Killer Mondo AT&T on my Android phone,
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:17.280]   but I can't get it there.
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:17.840]   Oh, you should.
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:18.800]   No, no, no, no.
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:21.120]   If you have an AT&T, no, I know.
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:23.840]   But every now and so then they screwed me over on that.
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:26.640]   And I don't want to have to deal with AT&T right now.
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:27.200]   I just can't.
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:27.600]   I can't.
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:28.400]   Yeah, I can't.
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:29.920]   I'm in a pandemic.
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:30.640]   I can't do it.
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:33.440]   So it actually looks pretty good.
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:35.040]   They got a lot of content.
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:36.720]   They got friends.
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:37.680]   They got friends.
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:38.720]   They took it off Netflix.
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:44.400]   And they, although I did see a survey of people asking them,
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:46.000]   "Where could you watch this show?"
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.080]   And people are so confused.
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:50.080]   It's just like, I don't know.
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:54.400]   Isn't friends, the survey said that people under a certain age
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:59.440]   all thought that Netflix created friends have been there so long.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:02.480]   So HBO Max is the next quibi.
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:04.080]   I don't know.
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:07.360]   I don't know.
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:08.000]   I just don't know.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.840]   I just think they've got to get their branding and their whatever straight.
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:13.600]   I think they're trying to make it so...
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:18.880]   I think they're actually intentionally making it a little confusing
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:25.680]   so people will sign up for this thinking.
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:26.240]   Oh, Jeff.
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:29.040]   Verizon Fios is a partner.
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:30.480]   Oh, there you go.
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:32.080]   AT&T.
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:32.960]   I don't know.
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:39.440]   AT&T, Cox, DirectTV, Hulu, Optimum, Spectrum, Verizon, Fios, and YouTube TV and Comcast.
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:41.840]   But you still have to pay for it.
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:43.600]   No, at no additional cost.
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:46.880]   No, I don't get HBO Max on Hulu, do I?
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:47.920]   I don't know.
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:50.400]   Go to the HBO Max Help Center.
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:51.040]   Help.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:53.200]   That is pomax.com.
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:57.520]   It says you're all of Verizon's existing Fios customers.
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:57.840]   Yeah.
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:59.280]   It's a private HBO or HBO now.
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:00.960]   We're going to get an Exist H1, Max and launch.
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:02.960]   So here, go to this Help Center.
[01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:04.080]   Help.hpo.max.
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:07.520]   Sign in via provider.
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:11.600]   So, geez, Louise.
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:13.520]   This is worse than the IRS.
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:16.080]   Okay, I don't know.
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:18.000]   You're right.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.200]   It might be another Quibi.
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:22.720]   The thing is, the difference is nobody wants to watch anything on Quibi.
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:26.080]   HBO Max, because they're owned by Warner, which is owned by NTT,
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:27.280]   they have a lot of content.
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:30.000]   And they have all the HBO content.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.640]   I mean, you know what?
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:35.440]   I think this is where the value would lie.
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:39.520]   If you cut the cord, you got rid of your cable television,
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:44.160]   and you bought HBO Max over the top, and maybe Netflix,
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:46.160]   and one or two other things over the top.
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:48.320]   And then you might be happy.
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:52.480]   I'm not paying for a lot of things.
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:53.520]   I'm trying to remember.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:56.000]   So, Amazon Prime, am I paying for it?
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.440]   No, sort of.
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:59.040]   So, that's one.
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:01.520]   Hulu, I'm paying for it.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.360]   Netflix, paying for it.
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:06.240]   Disney Plus, not paying for it, because it came with Verizon.
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:07.600]   Right, it came with Verizon, right?
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:10.960]   They see, this says, I'm going through the process.
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:12.640]   It says, "Start your free trial."
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:14.560]   I'm not trusting this.
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:15.440]   Yeah, I know.
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:16.400]   That's going to be a problem.
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:17.200]   Trust this.
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:18.080]   That's going to be a big problem.
[01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:20.880]   You may have to have HBO for it.
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:21.840]   I do have HBO.
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:25.120]   Oh, well, why do you want HBO Max again?
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:28.880]   No, because it's because it has programming, HBO doesn't be a plus.
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:30.000]   Yes.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.760]   That's what's so absurd about this.
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:35.200]   So, cancel normal HBO and get this HBO.
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:36.000]   Is it the same price?
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.400]   Actually, that's not a bet.
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:40.240]   Probably not, because trying to cancel it all.
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:41.440]   I got a package on fire.
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:42.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.680]   It's probably a can't just cancel.
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:43.680]   Oh, you're on fire.
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:46.960]   So, because I just buy these things through Amazon.
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:49.360]   If I want to watch a show, I just subscribe for a month.
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:51.360]   And then I cancel at the end of the month.
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:51.920]   Right.
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:52.560]   It's very easy.
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:57.760]   I need to cut the cord, Jeff.
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:00.880]   It says, "Bill, prove rise, and I'm nervous about this."
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:03.280]   I think I just signed it up for $15 a month, and I'll get it.
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:05.760]   Well, don't do that.
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:06.400]   Don't do that.
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:06.960]   I can't do that.
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:07.360]   That's too late.
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:08.080]   I just did it.
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:10.240]   I just, I'm just, I'm just, you know, I'm going to rant.
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:11.280]   I'm going to rant.
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:13.440]   All right, we're going to wind up.
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:16.160]   We're going to wind up the show.
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:17.120]   Give it a headache.
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:20.240]   With my last free story of the month on Medium,
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:23.600]   I am giving this to you as a gift.
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:24.960]   Of course, the month's almost over.
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:25.200]   But...
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:31.600]   Every type of, this is actually from Jeff Jarvis.
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:37.200]   Every type of Zoom call participant illustrated by cats.
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:38.560]   This is the tenderly.
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:39.040]   You know what?
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:43.200]   I am going to pay for, I am going to subscribe to Medium,
[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:45.360]   just because tenderly, because it's about recipes,
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.920]   animals, humans, reason, books, and vegan life.
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:48.480]   And fun.
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:50.400]   That sounds great.
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:51.600]   And it is fun.
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:53.120]   This is Jack Shepard's article.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:55.520]   There are, are you ready?
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:58.000]   Here are some of, now this is a visual thing,
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.360]   but I'll describe it.
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:02.240]   There is, of course, everybody knows the one who's too close to the camera.
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:06.800]   Mr. Muffin genuinely believes you can only hear him
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:11.120]   if he puts his entire face into the camera when he speaks.
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:14.880]   And there's a very close-up picture of a kitty cat in Zoom.
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:18.240]   Not the least bit concerned with looking bad on Zoom.
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:18.880]   No, it's like the clue.
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:20.160]   It's why cats are perfect.
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:20.880]   Cats are good.
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:21.520]   They don't care.
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:23.600]   Actually, it's quite a pretty cat.
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:24.480]   I like those eyes.
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:27.200]   A cuticle, a sugar, a poker, a nose.
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:28.320]   These are good photos.
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:29.120]   Just to kill you.
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:29.840]   Yeah, this one.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:34.160]   So he used stock photos and stuff like that.
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:36.080]   But well done, well done.
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:36.800]   Oh, very well done.
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:38.400]   The one who doesn't understand in lighting,
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:39.360]   no matter what time of day or not,
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:42.080]   your meaning is you can be certain cookie
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:44.960]   is going to be lit in a way that is appropriate for telling a ghost story,
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:45.760]   but very little else.
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:47.920]   By the way, this is why we don't have a Carsten cam.
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:50.960]   Because that's what Carsten looks like.
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:51.840]   Ooh.
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:52.320]   On the guy.
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:53.280]   No, he knows it.
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:55.520]   He sits in front of a big right window.
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:55.760]   Yeah.
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:57.680]   His eyes don't glow.
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:58.960]   There's a little kitty with eyes.
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:55:59.440]   That's unfortunate.
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:00.320]   All but they do.
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:00.960]   All but they do.
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:03.360]   I'll bet he has special lenses that hide from us.
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:03.760]   Yes.
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:04.720]   I bet they glow.
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:05.040]   Yes.
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:07.120]   Carsten is definitely a Lovecraft demon.
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:10.000]   The one who got a just got out of the shower.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.560]   Austin Tim says she was Tim is late to me.
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:13.840]   Because of technical difficulties,
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:16.960]   which is true if you take technical difficulties to mean
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:19.760]   waiting for the conditioner to sit for three minutes.
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:21.760]   And there's a very weird little kitten.
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:24.960]   Doesn't look too happy either about being wet.
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:27.120]   Do you bathe your cats?
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:28.320]   No.
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:29.120]   I don't have a cat.
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:29.760]   Terrible idea.
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:31.200]   I don't think you're supposed to be them.
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:32.480]   I learned that lesson.
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:33.760]   Uh oh.
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:35.920]   That poor cat.
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:36.400]   That's pretty scratchy.
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:36.880]   Did you guess?
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:37.360]   Oh man.
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:38.080]   There were two of them.
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:39.760]   Dusty and Poppy.
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.120]   They we just got them and I thought,
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:42.000]   well, they're kind of dirty.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:42.960]   I'm going to throw them in the--
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:44.080]   Because I didn't know.
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:44.960]   I only had dogs.
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:45.520]   Oh.
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:46.480]   I'm going to throw them in the tub.
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:48.480]   Yeah.
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:50.000]   That's painful.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.480]   The one who refuses to use video but has
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:54.960]   like the world's most glamorous headshot.
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:55.840]   You know this guy?
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:57:00.400]   This guy is a good looking guy but he won't put the video on on Zoom.
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:01.200]   He just leaves his--
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:02.720]   You know, because you get a still a headshot.
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:04.240]   Addiness.
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:05.520]   Addonus says he can't get--
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:07.520]   Did you put a headshot over yourself up on Zoom?
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:08.240]   I haven't bothered.
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:10.080]   Yes, I do have a picture.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:11.840]   It's a very--
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:14.080]   It's a nicely lit picture just like Addonus's.
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:17.040]   That is one pretty cat.
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:18.720]   His eyes match the ivy.
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:23.200]   Oh. I don't like these naked cats though.
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:24.160]   Was that a manks?
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:25.920]   And they never do anything about the naked cat.
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:27.040]   Cleopatra's never mentioned.
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:28.400]   She's just there.
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:30.240]   She's just there staring us down.
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:30.640]   She's scary.
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:31.920]   Scaring the bitchesis out of us.
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:32.800]   She looks like a demon.
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:35.760]   The only one, I'm the one with a wacky background.
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:37.840]   There's no way Garfunkle's paying any attention
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:40.240]   when anyone is saying because he changes his background
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:43.280]   every five minutes and looks around to see who's noticed.
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:46.000]   Her-- his background, pretty great cat,
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.600]   comes from the movie Cats.
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:50.080]   O-E.
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:52.800]   Midnight.
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:56.800]   The one with random family member cameos.
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:57.840]   We've all seen this one.
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:58:00.720]   Princess is clearly working very hard
[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:02.400]   and it's unclear what her husband does
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:05.840]   and why he needs to do it with his shirt off.
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:06.320]   There he is.
[01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:08.240]   Staring over his shoulder.
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:12.400]   You know, you never tire of cat-fick pictures, do you?
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:12.800]   You don't.
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:13.280]   You don't.
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:14.080]   You just don't.
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:14.240]   No.
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:17.280]   I prefer puppy pictures,
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:19.200]   but I do enjoy a good cat picture.
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:20.240]   I'm just saying.
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:22.400]   I prefer, but I also--
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:24.400]   I am pretty into all animals.
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:26.320]   This is, by the way, Nana Banks,
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:28.480]   I'm being informed by the chat room.
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:31.360]   This is a Sphinx cat.
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:35.200]   The hairless cat.
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:37.760]   And then there's the one who can't get the camera placement right.
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:39.920]   We have this a lot on all of our shows,
[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:40.640]   the kitty cat.
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:40.960]   Yes.
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:42.240]   That's just the top of the head.
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:42.800]   That's me.
[01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:44.560]   Just the top of the head.
[01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:45.360]   And the one--
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:47.680]   Oh, this is actually a good audience to ask.
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:50.320]   I will ask you two, since you all are cat fans.
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:53.520]   I'm at a walk with my husband two days ago.
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:57.200]   And this cat just comes running up the street.
[01:58:57.200 --> 01:58:57.600]   It's just--
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:58.880]   It sees us--
[01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:00.240]   It's not running like in a--
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:01.360]   I'm chased by somebody.
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:03.200]   It's just like trotting up the street.
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:05.600]   And it sees us, and then it starts trotting towards us.
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:09.200]   So I bend over, and I stick my hand down
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:12.080]   to give him the opportunity to either sniff or rub,
[01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:14.560]   because it's clearly coming directly for us.
[01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:17.120]   And to walk by the cat, help rude.
[01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:17.760]   And what happened?
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:18.720]   My husband--
[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:20.800]   He said that is horrifying,
[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:23.600]   and you should never do that, because, you know,
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:25.440]   it's a strange cat.
[01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:26.320]   But I'm kind of like--
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:29.040]   It's a cat, and it acknowledged my existence.
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:31.120]   You must take a moment to say--
[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:32.080]   Yeah, not on your right.
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:33.200]   What do you need, cat?
[01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:35.360]   Your husband is a heartless cat here.
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:36.320]   He's no, no, no, no.
[01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:37.360]   He's cat-phobic.
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:38.800]   It's clearly he's cat-phobic.
[01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:40.800]   He wouldn't--
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:41.200]   He wouldn't--
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:43.360]   I mean, if it was a dog, he wouldn't do it for a dog either.
[01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:43.840]   He's just like--
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:44.080]   Well, I know.
[01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:45.120]   I wouldn't do it for a dog,
[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:45.920]   because dogs will--
[01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:46.480]   Dog no.
[01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:46.800]   Dog no.
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:47.840]   Dogs could attack you.
[01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:48.480]   There's--
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:49.200]   But cat--
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:49.600]   I don't--
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:51.280]   I think it's rare that a cat would come at you.
[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:53.680]   Yeah, I'm like, cats--
[01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:55.120]   cats normally are like,
[01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:56.480]   they don't care about you at all.
[01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:56.720]   Okay, I just--
[01:59:56.720 --> 01:59:58.400]   Little head and stretch, and that's it.
[01:59:58.400 --> 01:59:59.040]   That's all I want.
[01:59:59.040 --> 01:59:59.920]   Little head and stretch.
[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:01.280]   No, I think that's fine.
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:01.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:03.680]   I felt like that was the appropriate cat etiquette.
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:04.160]   Cat-a-kit.
[02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:06.240]   The thing to remember, though, Stacy,
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:07.600]   as a non-cat owner,
[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:08.960]   I think it's important for you to understand,
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:11.120]   is if the cat were a little bit bigger,
[02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:11.840]   it would eat you.
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:16.000]   That's probable.
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.480]   But because it's so small, you're fine.
[02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:19.920]   It could still bite you.
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:21.040]   I mean, I get to see that.
[02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:21.920]   No, no, no.
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:22.880]   The cats aren't stupid.
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:23.840]   They're not going to bite you
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:25.520]   unless they can eat you.
[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:29.520]   But honestly, if the cat were a bigger cat,
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:30.400]   it would just eat you.
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:31.760]   Okay.
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:32.320]   That's fair.
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:32.880]   Yeah, but they're just--
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:33.760]   they're not dumb.
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:34.240]   They're just--
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:36.080]   you know, I'm not going to bite you for no reason.
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:36.800]   What's the--
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:38.080]   there's no percentage in that.
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:42.480]   Do you have a thing this week, Miss Stacy?
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:43.520]   I do.
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:45.360]   It is across the room.
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:46.560]   So hold on one second.
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:47.920]   The only thing I want to worry about
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:48.880]   if I were Stacy,
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:51.280]   because she has all those Bluetooth gadgets,
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:53.200]   we talked about it yesterday on security now.
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:54.240]   There's new Bluetooth--
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:54.640]   What do you mean?
[02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:56.400]   Called bias.
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:57.040]   All right.
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:00.960]   That means Bluetooth is forever broken and insecure.
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:01.920]   What?
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:03.280]   Nothing.
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:07.120]   I missed whatever is--
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:09.200]   whatever downside the Bluetooth there is happening.
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:11.120]   No point worrying about it at this point.
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:12.960]   Uh--
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:13.520]   Hi.
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:14.320]   Yes.
[02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:14.640]   Okay.
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:15.280]   Here's my thing.
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:16.640]   This is--
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:18.720]   I haven't opened it yet,
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:22.080]   because I am moving, as you guys know.
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:24.000]   And so I bought something to make my--
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000]   what's it called?
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.400]   Breaker box.
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:29.200]   Smart.
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:30.720]   And so this is going to allow me to
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:35.280]   see what energy is being consumed by certain appliances,
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:37.200]   but eventually it will also--
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:38.000]   ouch--
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:38.800]   be able to
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:43.520]   give me insights about how I should be using
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:44.400]   my electricity--
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:45.200]   Oh, this is cool.
[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:46.160]   --in theoretically.
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:48.080]   It could one day communicate with my utility,
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:48.560]   but that's--
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:49.760]   I've always wondered how these things
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:51.920]   know what device is using the electricity,
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:53.680]   because you put it in one place, right?
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:54.480]   Or you open it in all devices.
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:55.200]   Yes.
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:56.720]   So this is what it is.
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:01:59.760]   This is the Wiser Energy System
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:01.280]   by Schneider Electric.
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:02.240]   La-la-la.
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:03.280]   Okay.
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:04.880]   And these things--
[02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:07.120]   this is to be installed by a professional electrician.
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:08.240]   I should also mention that this is not--
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:08.800]   Oh, absolutely.
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:09.360]   Don't mess with it.
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:10.880]   This is not something you should do.
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:12.880]   Cats may not kill you, but electricity will.
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:16.560]   These are the little things that go into the breaker box,
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:17.520]   I believe.
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:20.160]   I believe, Leo, I have a friend who did research on this.
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:23.520]   Every appliance has a signature--
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:24.480]   Oh, did I not answer?
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:25.040]   Yes.
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:26.960]   Every appliance has a unique signature--
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:27.600]   Like a MAC address.
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:30.400]   --and now it's just a pattern.
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:31.840]   The way it uses electricity.
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:33.680]   And they're all unique?
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:35.040]   Yep.
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:38.560]   Well, I don't know that every June oven is different
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:39.920]   from every other June oven,
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:42.000]   but June ovens are recognizable.
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:44.320]   Wow, I had no idea.
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:45.920]   Yeah.
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:46.400]   That's--
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:46.720]   That's--
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:47.040]   That's--
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:47.280]   So--
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:50.000]   My electrical engineering prof prof at Rutgers
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000]   did work on this.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.040]   Yeah, I've always wondered,
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:54.400]   because you see these devices.
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:57.040]   So this is the--
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:59.680]   This is from how they gather that data, I don't know.
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:01.440]   They pull it from--
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:02.880]   They sit on your breaker box.
[02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:04.960]   They're attached to either individual circuits,
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:07.120]   or they're attached at the, like,
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:08.880]   junction of the breaker box.
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:09.680]   Like this one--
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:11.280]   Yeah, see, there it is.
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:12.800]   Well, that thing is actually in the breaker box.
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:13.520]   Yeah, you don't want to do that.
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:14.080]   Yeah.
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:15.280]   No, I'm not touching this thing.
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:18.240]   I will wire a light switch or an outlet.
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:19.120]   How much is this?
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:22.160]   Uh, I don't remember.
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:24.480]   I like this idea.
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:26.160]   Yeah, maybe when we get the electrician out,
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:27.840]   we would get one of these.
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:28.800]   I think that's a very--
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:31.680]   So it tells you what's using all the juice.
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:32.880]   Yeah.
[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:33.920]   Because we have a lot of--
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:34.560]   And it can make some polyceric--
[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:34.880]   Which--
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:36.240]   Yeah, because we have mysteries.
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:37.600]   We use a lot of electricity.
[02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:38.880]   I can't quite figure out--
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:40.640]   Is it because the computers?
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:41.680]   Is it because of the lights?
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:42.560]   What is it--
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:43.360]   What is using?
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:48.320]   So another company that does this--
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:52.560]   And Wyser actually uses their technology,
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:54.720]   their algorithm technology is Sense.
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:56.720]   And Sense also makes a physical device.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:58.320]   So you could go with either of these.
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:03:58.880]   Oh, OK.
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:01.280]   299.
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:02.640]   There you go.
[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:02.880]   Yeah.
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:06.240]   Plus installation.
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:08.800]   Yes, plus your electrician.
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:10.320]   So those things clip on to--
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:13.840]   Yeah, just put those on a circuit somewhere.
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:15.360]   Yeah, that doesn't look too dangerous.
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:17.040]   I'm not going to touch it.
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:18.800]   It does need to be professional.
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:20.960]   Normally, I'm like, go try it out.
[02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:22.720]   You can do it for this one.
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:23.840]   No, no, no, no, no.
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:23.840]   No, no, no, no.
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:25.040]   I'm going to open up the box.
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:28.240]   Well, I open up that box all the time.
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:29.520]   When your breaker gets thrown,
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:30.720]   you open that up.
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:33.280]   You don't take the cover off the box.
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:34.800]   Exposed to all the wires.
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:35.280]   Oh.
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:37.280]   You don't play around with the wires, do you?
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:37.280]   No.
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:38.400]   You just split the switch.
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:39.200]   Yeah.
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:41.040]   And then when it jumps again,
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:43.680]   I put a penny in it or a little something to jam it.
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:47.440]   So, OK.
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:47.760]   Nice.
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:50.320]   You said that so you was scold who mistakes
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:51.360]   because you're not supposed to do that.
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:52.320]   I know.
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:53.520]   You're supposed to yell at him now.
[02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:54.240]   I just like--
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:55.680]   I wasn't paying attention.
[02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:56.080]   No, I know.
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:56.400]   I'm sorry.
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:58.080]   I was reading some of the comments.
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:04:59.120]   He was baiting you.
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:00.800]   And you didn't take the bait.
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:02.320]   I didn't--
[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:03.280]   From Schneider.
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:04.080]   It used to be baited.
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:06.320]   The electronics.
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:07.520]   Jeff, you have a number for us?
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:09.040]   Yeah, sure.
[02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:09.680]   So, I saw one.
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:12.720]   I always put in more than one in case they get stolen
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:14.720]   because I need more than one.
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:15.920]   So, I put this one.
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:17.440]   25 years of CNET.
[02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:19.680]   That's kind of OK.
[02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:20.800]   I'll do better than that.
[02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:22.720]   No, but I do want to mention
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:26.480]   that we talked about that fairly extensively on Sunday
[02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:28.080]   because Lindsey Turrentine,
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:31.920]   who is senior vice president for content strategy at CNET,
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:33.360]   was on Twitch.
[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:35.200]   And she told us she was about to do this
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:36.640]   because it's just 25 years.
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:39.040]   And I told her my story,
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:41.120]   working as the fourth employee of CNET
[02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:42.720]   in the early '90s before they--
[02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:43.680]   There we go.
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:43.760]   Yeah.
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:46.640]   So, you know, that was--
[02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:48.240]   If you can watch it and see that.
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:49.440]   But yeah, that's kind of interesting.
[02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:50.720]   So, I thought that was kind of worthwhile.
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:51.200]   That was good.
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:52.320]   And so, I thought it was all right.
[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:52.480]   Yeah.
[02:05:52.480 --> 02:05:53.200]   Leo was a connection.
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:56.080]   But then, only five years later,
[02:05:56.080 --> 02:05:58.800]   telling us a lot about this whole world.
[02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:01.120]   What started on this day today?
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:03.200]   Fcompany.com.
[02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:04.720]   Oh, wow.
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:06.800]   Oh, Pud's little adventure.
[02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:07.680]   Pud.
[02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:09.520]   Yeah, so Pud, Facebook, today,
[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:11.600]   that it was 20 years ago today.
[02:06:11.600 --> 02:06:12.720]   I have his mug somewhere.
[02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:13.600]   That is so cool.
[02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:17.920]   And it's so funny that 25 years ago, CNET--
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:18.800]   Oh, wow!
[02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:19.520]   The internet!
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:20.480]   Everything's going to be amazing.
[02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:21.120]   It's all going to change.
[02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:22.320]   It'll only five years later.
[02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:23.040]   Yeah, it's all left.
[02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:24.720]   Well, his--
[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:26.560]   You know, and I actually asked Pud about this.
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:29.680]   I was talking to him about it because his theory was,
[02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:32.240]   every few years he wanted to create a site
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:33.680]   that he would set it up.
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:36.080]   And it would just run itself and make him money.
[02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:40.320]   Because the way F Company worked is people would send in memos
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:42.320]   from their messed up company,
[02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:44.640]   and it would become content in the site.
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:46.320]   And everybody would say, "Ah!"
[02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:49.440]   Pud also talked about how he made a success out of it.
[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:51.200]   So he launched it 20 years ago.
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:53.520]   But one of the things he would do is he'd go around to
[02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:57.200]   forums and other sites and say,
[02:06:57.200 --> 02:07:01.840]   "I can't believe what this jerk is doing on F Company.
[02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:04.960]   Can you believe-- how does he get away with publishing those memos?"
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:05.920]   Brilliant.
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:08.720]   Brilliant marketing.
[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:10.080]   Pud's great.
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:12.320]   He is a great guy, very smart.
[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:14.160]   I wonder what he's doing.
[02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:15.200]   He's in New York now.
[02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:17.520]   He's a father who would have thought.
[02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:18.560]   He's married and father.
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:20.480]   I haven't seen him in a while.
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:21.440]   What's his real name?
[02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:22.080]   Philip?
[02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:22.800]   The Kaplan.
[02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:23.600]   Kaplan, that's right.
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:25.760]   Well, that's neat.
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:28.320]   American entrepreneur,
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:32.480]   Muslim as--
[02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:34.080]   Hmm.
[02:07:34.080 --> 02:07:34.560]   There's his--
[02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:35.920]   And we also did Adbright.
[02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:38.480]   Adbright, wow.
[02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:40.560]   Yeah, which he founded in 2004.
[02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:46.160]   He joined Charles River Ventures as an entrepreneur in residence in 2009.
[02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:54.240]   He was a picture of him with Martin Sargent and Cat Schwartz at the Cloud 9 bar.
[02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:57.520]   These are all tech TV people around the year 2000.
[02:07:58.160 --> 02:07:59.680]   He's first starting a company.
[02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:02.640]   I guess I do know him.
[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:05.840]   That's pretty funny.
[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:11.360]   2011, he formed 80 HD Labs and Incubator for web and iPhone apps.
[02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:18.080]   Its company Tiny Letter was acquired by MailChimp in 2011.
[02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:20.160]   Then he founded Fanon.
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:21.120]   Yeah, I forgot to name it later.
[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:22.240]   He's pretty amazing.
[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:23.680]   Pretty amazing.
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:26.080]   But he's almost not a summing guy there.
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:26.800]   Oh, he's great.
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:30.880]   But he even said, my goal was always just create these little income--
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:32.000]   Like a car wash.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:35.920]   Yeah, and then you walk off and they just keep spinning off money and you do the next thing.
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:36.880]   Yeah.
[02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:37.760]   Quite a smart guy.
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:44.800]   Well, folks, we've come to the end of this fabulous program and only an hour shorter than
[02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:48.080]   the fabulous Joe Rogan experience.
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:48.960]   Oh, we can do it.
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:49.920]   We can deal with Neo.
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:51.120]   We can do another hour.
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:51.120]   We can do it.
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:51.520]   We can go--
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:52.640]   Make Stacy suffer.
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:53.120]   Rogan.
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:57.760]   Her heart's why he's worth so much more than me.
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:01.040]   I'll tell you right now, he does a longer podcast.
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:02.960]   He has time on his hands.
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:05.360]   Well, I don't know.
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:09.840]   They smoke weed though during the podcast and they drink and stuff, right?
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:10.560]   No, you know what?
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:14.320]   Huge respect for the guy.
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:16.720]   But it's a culture I don't get.
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:18.640]   It's a manly culture.
[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:19.440]   I'm not a manly.
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:23.840]   And I just don't get my son loves it.
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:26.720]   But I just don't get it.
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:28.160]   I'm not-- you know, I don't go to the gym.
[02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:29.840]   I don't go--
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:33.520]   That's not my-- I don't understand it.
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:35.760]   In fact, to be honest, I'm terrified by it.
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:36.720]   I'm intimidated by it.
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:37.680]   So--
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:39.600]   The culture?
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:39.760]   Or--
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:40.400]   Yes.
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:42.400]   The fact that it's kind of masculine.
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:43.920]   No, I just don't want to hang out in it.
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:44.720]   I always shrivel.
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:48.880]   And just the fact that Joe Rogan's 5'7" and he still scares me,
[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:50.080]   tells you something.
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:53.280]   It's just not my thing.
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:54.560]   I got in trouble with--
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:57.760]   Last week on the show, I said that he was the PewDiePie of podcasting.
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:09:57.760]   Yeah.
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:01.200]   And somebody came on and they scolded me that,
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:02.880]   how can I say anything against him?
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:03.600]   What he really is--
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:03.840]   Look at that.
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:06.240]   --is the Howard Stern of podcasting.
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:07.120]   Because he's really doing--
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:08.560]   Howard Stern would object to that.
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:11.840]   Well, but he's doing it for podcasting, what Stern did for satellite rate.
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:14.000]   And I've had arguments personally with Stern.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.280]   He made fun of podcasting.
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:16.320]   He's over to make money on it.
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:17.600]   He got to where he hates it.
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:18.560]   And I wonder what he thinks.
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:19.680]   Even though he made more--
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:21.520]   He's got to respect the money that Rogan got,
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:22.880]   even though Stern makes a lot more.
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:23.280]   Oh, yeah.
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:26.320]   Well, I'm sure that's the first thing that comes to Stern's mind.
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:27.680]   Yeah.
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:29.280]   Yeah, well, I make a lot more.
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:29.840]   I win.
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:30.640]   I win.
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:32.480]   Oh, hey, it's been fun.
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:34.080]   You guys, I like hanging out with you too.
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:35.760]   I like hanging out with you too.
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:36.720]   With Higgin' Both of us.
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:38.160]   Plus, we got nowhere to go.
[02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:39.280]   We got nothing better to do.
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:39.840]   That's a new--
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:40.560]   Well, here we are.
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:41.280]   That's new.
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:43.040]   I've got better things I can do.
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:45.920]   Well--
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:48.000]   I mean, I have fun with y'all.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.560]   But eventually, I do need to leave and--
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:52.400]   Stacey and IOT.com.
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:54.160]   Don't forget to sign up.
[02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:56.880]   She's got another event coming up next month.
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:10:58.560]   It's going to be fantastic.
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:01.920]   Is it Stacey on IOT.com/COVID?
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:02.640]   Is that where you go?
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:04.720]   That's where my last one is.
[02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:10.000]   This one is Stacey on IOT.com/edge.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:10.800]   Edge, that's right.
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:12.640]   All about machine learning at the edge.
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:16.400]   That's a couple of weeks away, June 11th.
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:17.760]   So make sure you get over there.
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:18.240]   It's free.
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:20.320]   But I think it's great she's doing these.
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:24.240]   And I want to really encourage everybody to participate.
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:25.120]   Great--
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:26.320]   And if you want to see the COVID one,
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:27.600]   it's at the COVID link.
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:29.600]   So if you missed it and you're like,
[02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:30.560]   I really want to know this.
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:31.040]   Oh, no.
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:34.000]   There's my little pop-up.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.760]   Isn't that great?
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:37.600]   I already subscribed.
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:38.400]   Oh, we need to update it.
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:40.320]   We have almost--
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:41.600]   We have like 15,000 subscribers.
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:42.560]   I bet you do.
[02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:45.280]   And I'm not dismissing it because I don't think
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:47.120]   it's the greatest IOT newsletter in the world.
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:48.560]   I already subscribed.
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:50.560]   Stacy on IOT.com.
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:53.200]   And you should also listen to her fabulous podcast
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:56.880]   that she does with Kevin Tofel, a contract employee.
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:00.880]   That's the IOT cast.
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:05.680]   Stacy and IOT.com, thank you, Stacy.
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:09.280]   Go enjoy your queso and your planning.
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:10.480]   Jeff Jarvis--
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:13.040]   I think I'm getting ready for a man bun, don't you?
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:13.520]   You.
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:14.400]   See, I got a haircut.
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:15.440]   Oh, look, he can do it.
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:16.640]   You could do it.
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:18.240]   And it's like a little troll.
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:20.160]   You look like a band.
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:22.320]   Nice white hair.
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:23.760]   Your white hair is very white.
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:24.640]   I do have good hair.
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:25.520]   It is what?
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:25.920]   A top.
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:28.480]   And I'm in the makeup chair at MSNBC.
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:30.800]   They always say, oh, you have great hair.
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:31.600]   Oh, that's nice.
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:32.240]   Be sure to do that.
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:33.200]   That's very nice of them.
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:34.480]   They never say you have good things to say,
[02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:35.600]   but they say you have good hair.
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:36.480]   Your hair is excellent.
[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:39.920]   The director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:42.080]   with the Craig Newmark Graduate School in Jordan's--
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:42.720]   That's important, Mark.
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:43.680]   You can stop.
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:45.120]   I gave it the emphasis.
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:47.680]   The Craig Newmark Graduate School Journalism
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:48.400]   with the--
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:49.360]   Craig watches us.
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:52.160]   When we come back, we need to get Craig on the show.
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:53.360]   We'd love to get Craig on the show.
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:55.360]   I'd love to get Craig on the show.
[02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:56.720]   Thank you, Jeff, for being here.
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:00.160]   You can read his writings on Medium and BuzzMachine.com.
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:03.040]   And what's the new place that you put your thing?
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:06.720]   Oh, Bitly slash COVID Twitter list is my--
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:08.000]   Oh, we got to do that.
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.360]   That's right on the screen there, bitly.
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:13.440]   B-I-T dot L-Y slash COVID Twitter list.
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:16.480]   That is-- I have to say, I have TweetDeck open.
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:18.800]   In fact, I'll prove it right now by opening TweetDeck.
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:23.840]   And you'll see column two on my TweetDeck is your list right there.
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:28.720]   And I have to say, that is one thing that makes Twitter pretty awesome.
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:32.160]   It is pretty amazing to watch the scientists at Science.
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:32.720]   Yeah.
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:33.920]   They're pretty wonderful.
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:35.600]   So I do-- I think that--
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:39.840]   And a lot of women and scientists of color who you do not see enough of
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:46.560]   on in TV and feature stories about male heroes of science.
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:47.600]   Nice.
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:48.800]   Nice.
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:50.640]   Yeah, it's worth following.
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:52.000]   Thanks.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:52.800]   This is everybody.
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:55.760]   We do this show every Wednesday, about 130--
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:57.440]   Every damn Wednesday.
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:13:58.960]   Every damn Wednesday.
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:13:59.920]   130 Pacific.
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:02.960]   That's 430 Eastern.
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:04.480]   That's 2030 UTC.
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:07.760]   The way you could watch that live would be to go to Twitter.tv/live.
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:10.160]   There's a live audio and live video stream there.
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:11.600]   Actually, they're multiple of each.
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:14.560]   If you're watching live, go to the chatroom,
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:16.320]   irc.tuit.tv.
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:22.640]   Hang out there as a nice bunch of people chatting in the background about everything we're talking
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:24.320]   about.
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:27.440]   If you don't watch live, you should get the on-demand version of the show.
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:29.760]   It's always available at twitter.tv/twig.
[02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:36.080]   That's the website or on YouTube or in your favorite podcast client.
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:38.400]   In fact, subscribing is probably the best thing to do.
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:43.120]   Apple podcast, Google podcast, pocket, cast spotify, slacker, stitcher, everywhere
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:45.200]   you want to get us you can.
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:48.320]   Subscribe to Twig, you'll have it the minutes available.
[02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:55.120]   And if you do listen on-demand, let me point out our great forum for asynchronous listening.
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:57.040]   It's a twit.community.
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:59.760]   Go there and you can participate in the conversation.
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:01.040]   Every show has an entry.
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:04.880]   And there's quite often conversations.
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:08.000]   Some of our hosts pop in from time to time, I do as well.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:11.360]   That's twit.community.
[02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:12.160]   Thank you everybody.
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:14.720]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:15.120]   Bye-bye.
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:20.560]   Hi, I'm Jason Howell, host of All About Android, where each week I'm joined by Ron Richards,
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:26.000]   Florence Ion, and a rotating crew of Android journalists, developers, and enthusiasts,
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.600]   where we talk about the latest news, hardware, and apps for the Android faithful.
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:35.040]   You can subscribe by going to twit.tv/AA or find the show in your podcatcher of choice.
[02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:37.120]   That's all about Android.
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:46.560]   [Music]
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:16:14.240]   [silence]
