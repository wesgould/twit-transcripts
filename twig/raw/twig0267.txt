[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff and Gina are here. They're both wearing their round Moto 360s.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.400]   We'll find out what they think. Is Google rushing a conversion to SHA-2?
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.000]   We'll talk about that and a whole lot more this week in Google. Up next stay tuned.

[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.440]   I want to be clear not just Google.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:54.440]   We cover the cloud, the Google verse, the Facebook, the Twitter, all that jazz, Gina Trapani is here from ThinkUp.com. Great to see you Gina.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.840]   Hi, great to be back.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.640]   All about Android host. She's also Android developer and a smart ass person.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.240]   Oh, thank you.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.440]   It was my day.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.440]   Thank you.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.440]   Yeah, I was out of your form.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.440]   I'm playing your title.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.040]   We missed you last week.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:22.040]   Yeah, last week was one of those weeks we're having a baby and a startup and a spouse on a job hunt just all collapsed on me right at the moment where we were supposed to start the episode.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.440]   So I apologize for missing, but I'm thrilled to be back.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.240]   We had a big episode because we were talking about somebody said, Leo, you're doing native content now on software.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.540]   No, it's not native content.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.040]   But we did talk a lot about the former note now known and I love it and I'll show you a little more about that.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.240]   Jeff is also here. Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at CUNY, the city of New York.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.040]   He's also an author of books like What Would Google Do and his latest.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.040]   Oh my God. When I said, What Would Google Do?
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   Chrome woke up and said, What? But I'll do anything. What do you want?
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.040]   Huh? Huh?
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.040]   What? You said something? You're talking to me? You're talking to me?
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.040]   That's weird.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.040]   And private parts and a blogger at Buzzmachine.com.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.040]   I have a new book for walks only coming out November 6th called Geeks bearing gifts.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.040]   Oh, actually new futures of news. Can't wait.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.040]   I'll believe that you can wait. It's a metastasized white paper.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.040]   It just grew and grew and grew until it was a book.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.040]   I love the title though. Yeah. Geeks bearing gifts.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.040]   It's inspired by a former news corp executive who was actually attacking me and said the way I'd be geeks bearing gifts.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.040]   So I said, No.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.040]   Oh, I like it. You turned it around. Beware of geeks bearing gifts.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.040]   Yeah, that's the old I'm saying geeks bearing gift. The Trojan horse and all of that.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.040]   Right. Right.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   So we were talking about a known, which is a posse solution.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.040]   We had Kevin Marks on last week. This is part of the indie web.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:01.040]   The notion that you should own your own content, that stuff should emerge from your site to the social networks.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.040]   That's what posse stands for post once syndicate everywhere, I think is the idea.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.040]   So I set up my posse. First I did it on with known, but I actually downloaded the software.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.040]   And I've got I've got it running at Leoville.net because at Leoville.com I have my blog.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:30.040]   So this is known running. It allows you to post in things like MP3 files, check ins, text, you know, blog style articles, links, pictures.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.040]   So this is this is pretty cool. Yeah. I mean, it's kind of like a tumbler.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.040]   I haven't got it all all set up yet. I haven't got the federation of the social media working yet.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.040]   We're just it's technical. It's still not anything wrong with known, but I like it.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   I want to present a matter VC presented here in New York yesterday and six, six neat companies very well done presentations and matter and known was there.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.040]   It's a bit odd. They like pivoted the night in one night to present entirely as a tool for education.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   I think they're bigger than that. I think that they.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.040]   Well, they're looking, you know, they're looking for a niche. They can fill effectively and then expand beyond that.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.040]   I think it's known is not the key story here. The idea is that you should.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:20.040]   We said, I feel like it's very old fashioned now instead of posting on Twitter or Google plus or on Facebook.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:30.040]   You should post like, well, pictures are a good example. Put your pictures on your site and then federate and known to let you do this to Flickr and Facebook and Twitter.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.040]   And if you want, unfortunately, because there's no right API for Google plus, that's not one of that group.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.040]   And that's a good reason for Google plus to add that.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:47.040]   Do you think they ever will, Gina? We were we got a little heated offline debate with Alan Tepper said, well, I use a program on WordPress that lets me post to Google plus.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.040]   Well, it does that illegally.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.040]   Yeah, I mean, yeah, he said that jet pack, which is.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:03.040]   Which I use to one WordPress. Yeah. Yeah, WordPress is kind of WordPress.com or automatic kind of, you know, proprietary layer on top of WordPress post to Google plus.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.040]   Alan explained that it uses an app to do so. I'm not, I'm not really sure.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:16.040]   You know, I thought, well, they're just hacking the the rest API, right? They're figuring out what endpoint, you know, Google itself posts to.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:22.040]   You know, they're sort of using a hack. He said that they're using an app. I'm not really sure if that I don't think that qualifies as a right API.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:31.040]   The developers page still very clearly says that there is no right API for Google plus, but there's clearly some sort of solution for a jet pack kind of situation.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:45.040]   Yeah, so I'd like to see Google plus, you know, support a right API, but I don't know all signs are indicating that Google may be sort of not pulling back, but not maybe pushing more aggressively Google plus upon the folks who aren't using Google plus.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.040]   And the folks who aren't using it seems like they're adding features and supporting it for the folks who are using it and plenty of people are.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:58.040]   But I don't think we're going to see a right API, not after all this time. Yeah, which is disappointing. Yeah, it's a little bit disappointing.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:04.040]   And I would think now that they're kind of it's not a central part of their strategy. Maybe they could do that.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.040]   Yeah, I mean, maybe you would know, implement something similar to how jet pack is doing it.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.040]   I'm always reluctant to do that because those things are not guaranteed to work going forward. So.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.040]   Yeah, yeah, you use a backdoor, you know, you can't be sure that backdoor won't be locked. Right.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:25.040]   At least Google could could bless some paths in. Yeah.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:31.040]   Apparently you can post a Google plus with who's sweet. So maybe there is a maybe there's a legitimate way. I don't know.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   I mean, they're very clear. There is no right API. You cannot in some third party program post to Google plus.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.040]   But if you create a Google app app and then post to that, I'm not sure I'm not exactly sure how it works.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:48.040]   It doesn't seem exactly straightforward. But anyway, to get back to known, this looks really, really nice and you like it, Leo.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:55.040]   So you're going to be posting to your your main instance. So how so how so this is like your tumbler except the city.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:06.040]   It's somewhere. Yeah. And when you post when you get it set up, which I haven't yet because we're you know, I'm, you know, I'm self hosting and I'm doing weird things and it's, you know, it's just some little thing.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:22.040]   I'll fix it. But when you post as you post, there's buttons depending on the content to post to a federated social sites, Twitter, Facebook, if it's an image flicker, if it's audio sound cloud, you can highlight all or some of those.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:31.040]   And then that post goes on your blog. The image is stored on your blog, but it sends it also out to these other places. Not the first time this has ever happened in the world. It's not brand new.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:44.040]   But I love, I'm, I've always said you should, your content should exist on your site, you control and you don't control Twitter or Facebook or Google plus. They control it.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:51.040]   So now when you post a known, can you also syndicate to your blog because you're, you're differentiating between your known site and your blog. Yes.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.040]   I haven't set it up, but I think there's a way to do it to WordPress as well.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:06.040]   You know, I played with Tumbler. I said this to Ben and Aaron when they were here. I played with Tumbler logs before Tumbler. I used Tumbler. I love the idea of a quick posting mechanism.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.040]   Yep.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:20.040]   I just think it's, you know what, it's not going to change the world. It's one more way to encourage people to have their own personal website where their content is stored in their control.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:28.040]   And just having had experience of not having that control encourages me to do that. I want to, I want to own my content.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:33.040]   Absolutely. Cool. Yeah. It's kind of silly.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:43.040]   The David Johansson has been, David Johnson is doing it on an Nginx server. I want to talk to you, David's, let's email me or something.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:51.040]   Leo Leo.com because that's the problem I'm having. Nginx is in between me and Apache and I think it's causing problems with Mod rewrite. Okay. Just a little programming.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.040]   No.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:10:00.040]   Moving on. Google's changing its tune on net neutrality. Remember, we were kind of up in arms when Google sided with Verizon in a briefing.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:08.040]   I think it was to Congress saying, you know, net neutrality is all well and good for home Internet service providers, but you shouldn't have net neutrality when it comes to mobile.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:17.040]   Four years later, they say, maybe you should. What has changed?
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:25.040]   I think they finally just wised up that we were mad. I remember when this happened. We were mad that Google raged. It was devil's deal.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:34.040]   You know, even I suppose the Google fan boy was having fits with them that this was this was evil and awful. A lot of Google employees were quietly grumbling.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:40.040]   But, you know, we knew then what was going to be the case, which is that the mobile web is the web.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:49.040]   It's also odd because Google is a member of something called the American Legislative Exchange Council and they oppose net neutrality rules.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:59.040]   And people said, you got to get out of that group and Google wasn't saying, so I feel like Google is like any big company nowadays that contributes to every political party just in case.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.040]   It's too bad.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.040]   Steve Gibson took. Go ahead.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:14.040]   No, I was going to say, I mean, their agreement with Verizon's me always felt like this compromise on willing compromise, but something that they did because they felt like they had to at the time.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:21.040]   So maybe enough time has passed now being really optimistic, but enough time has passed. They're saying, yeah, you know what? Not anymore.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:30.040]   I think it made sense maybe because the bandwidth issues with wireless were very different than the bandwidth issues with home Internet.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.040]   And so maybe in that case, I don't know.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.040]   Well, I think we were stretching. We played with that, right? We were stretching.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:45.040]   Yeah, I think this ranges around Google's corporate relationship with Verizon full stop.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:52.040]   And this was about them having to suck up Verizon for other deals to get the phones in. Google's less.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:12:01.040]   You know, now Android is spread everywhere. The guy who handled the phone relationships is gone. So maybe they just changed.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:13.040]   Here's one that piffs me a bit. And Steve Gibson, too. Now there's a little technical, so bear with me or watch yesterday's security now.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:27.040]   When you go to a secure website, a website using SSL, its identity is verified using something called a certificate that is generated for them by a certificate authority.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:33.040]   A certificate authority goes to some lengths to prove that they are who they say they are and then issues a certificate.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.040]   You know, they'll call them. There's all sorts of stuff.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:43.040]   So when you have an HTTPS to Amazon or Google or someone else, that is secured by a certificate saying they are who they say they are.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:55.040]   These certificates, about almost all of them, nine out of 10 certificates, use an encryption algorithm called SSA1.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:06.040]   SHA1 is not broken. It has not been hacked. But it's not it's not using, I think, a long enough boy.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:16.040]   I might not be right on this, but for some reason it is computationally as computers get faster, faster each year, more likely to be crackable.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:27.040]   It isn't yet. But in some time in the next few years, next 10 years, computers become fast enough that SHA1 is not going to be a secure way to encrypt.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:33.040]   Microsoft says we're going to deprecate it in our browser and explore it by 2017.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:40.040]   So certificate authorities start using the more secure SHA2 for your certificates.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.040]   It's stronger and it's used and it's supported everywhere.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   Google has decided in its infinite wisdom to hurry this process.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:14:07.040]   And starting just before Christmas, when you go to a website, and again, 93% of secure websites use SHA1 certificates, you will start to get a successively severe warning in the Chrome browser.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:18.040]   At first you'll get a little orange triangle, then you'll get no lock at all, then you'll get a big X and a line drawn through HTTPS.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:29.040]   Google says we're declaring a slow motion emergency. Here's the three different logos. Before things get worse, nobody's taking this seriously.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:39.040]   Now, what Steve pointed out is this kind of heavy-handed nanny work from Google. First of all, Google uses SHA1 in all of its certificates.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:54.040]   It is a certificate authority and continues to use SHA1. They're exempt from this because their certificates last only for three months and they've decided that they will only do this for sites that certificates expire in 2017.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:15:02.040]   So they've kind of cleverly loop-holed their own equally insecure, if you say it's secure certificates out of this.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:15.040]   Wait, wait, wait. They only show the insecure icon for certificates that expire in 2017. So eventually it'll be 2016. It'll get more and more severe.
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:24.040]   And Microsoft has said we're going to only do it in 2017. In other words, the thought is, well, we're going to give time to certificate authorities to upgrade their--
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:34.040]   OK, so in order to implement this, I as an HTTPS website would have to go to my certifying authority, get a new certificate using SHA2 and install it.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:45.040]   And Google's saying you all have to do that in the next three months, or we're going to start penalizing you by showing that your site's insecure. It's not, by the way. It has not been cracked.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:59.040]   It's just presumed that as computers get faster, it'll become easier to crack. And it's very aggressive. Global sign, which is a good cert authority that we use and others use,
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:11.040]   say this is insanely aggressive. We've got to reissue all of our certificates in the next three months. We're not prepared to do that. Google says, too bad, we're going to do it.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:25.040]   Now, it's such a technical issue that I doubt you'll see much coverage of it anywhere. And I do encourage you to listen to Steve talk about it, because I think he does a good job of better than I am explaining it.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:33.040]   Eventually, what you'll get is that warning that says there is mixed content on this page. Some of it's secure. Some of it's not. You've seen that.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:47.040]   And the thing is, anybody using Chrome will get this. So prepare in three months to hear from your mom and your grandma and your sister and your brother and other non-technically literate people in your family and friends who will say, what's going on?
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:17:01.040]   Amazon, my site's not secure anymore. The sites I'm visiting aren't secure anymore. Why am I getting, why is the lock gone? It's not because it's not secure. It's because Google has decided in Chrome not to show the lock.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:10.040]   I feel like this is more of the nanny state stuff from Google, like saying, hey, if you have HTTPS, you'll rank higher in our search.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:24.040]   Well, I mean, SEO, Google's, the things that the Googlebot responds to better, in so many ways, people structure their markup and their sites based just because they want to rank higher in Google search.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:29.040]   It's kind of amazing, I think, how much Google really does a fact how websites are built. And this is another way.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:34.040]   And they're wielding their muscle. And maybe this is not appropriate.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   Well, I mean, but in the name of security, you know, after Heartbleed, I mean, we're at a weird time right now.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.040]   It's different than Heartbleed. This is Steve's point because Heartbleed is an actual flaw.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:56.040]   Well, right. Heartbleed is an actual vulnerability and this is not, right? But I think because Google's saying that the clock is ticking and someone's going to crack this and we know that.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   So why don't we just speed up the time and beat them, right? And like, that's what's with the three month timeline.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:10.040]   I mean, this is good for Google. You know, it makes them look good. It makes them look like they're being proactive. It makes them look like they care about the way, you know, whatever, all these things.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:21.040]   But it really does put the onus on website administrators, myself included, you know, to get this sorted a lot more quickly than maybe we would otherwise.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:28.040]   And it does seem aggressive, but, you know, it's a kind of in the name of security. Why else? Why else would they do this?
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.040]   Right.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.040]   But they are such an awesome measure.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:36.040]   Well, that was one of the things that chat was bought yesterday is maybe they know it's been cracked.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.040]   Maybe they've cracked it.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:48.040]   Bruce Schire posted a estimate by Jesse Walker on how much it would cost to forge one of these certificates using Amazon Web Service pricing and Moore's Law.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:57.040]   Two million dollars in 2012, 700,000 in 2015, 173,000 in 2018, 43,000 dollars in 2021.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:04.040]   Based on these numbers, Schneier suggested an organized crime certificate would be able to forge a certificate in 2018.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:11.040]   A university could do it in 2021. So, in other words, it's not imminent. It's not knocking at the door.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:19.040]   Microsoft says 2017, we're going to start doing this on Internet Explorer and all the certificate authority said that's fine.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:24.040]   That gives us time. We're going to do that by 2017. Now, Google says, no, no, three months.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.040]   2015, if it is...
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.040]   2015.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.040]   Oh, well. Interesting.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:37.040]   You know, I am just parroting... This is a little bit up above my pay grade and I'm parroting what Steve says.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.040]   But Steve says this is a... He feels this fairly arrogant of Google.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.040]   Steve is overkill.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.040]   Huh?
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.040]   Jeff?
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.040]   Steve is cautious.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:54.040]   Steve is not a pro-lax security guy, by any means.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.040]   Even the show is security now.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.040]   But I don't know.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.040]   All right. I brought it up.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.040]   Probably shouldn't have.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.040]   No, I'm glad you did. It's interesting.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.040]   So the lock doesn't go away in three months, right?
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:15.040]   The lock... You have the mix content warning, which you'll see on HTTPS pages that loads, say, non-HDPS images.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.040]   Right?
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:22.040]   So it's the lock with the... And then, you know, and so maybe, I don't know, three months later, did they give a timeline on when the icons actually change?
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:31.040]   I mean, the one thing you have to be really worried about where things seem to look really broken and maybe get blocked is when the lock is like the, you know, the red X.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.040]   You know, this is a attack.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.040]   And they're not saying they're going to do that in January.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.040]   Yes.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.040]   Soon. I can't remember what the timeline is, but pretty soon.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:45.040]   So here's a site created by somebody called Shaw.com.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   Check your site for weak SHA certificates.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.040]   It's by ConClone.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:56.040]   Dang. Google.com is using Shaw 1 and plans to migrate to Shaw 2 in 2015.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.040]   Even Google is still using this.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.040]   So excuse me.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:09.040]   And if you put in Amazon.com, dang. Amazon.com is using Shaw 1, Bank of America.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.040]   Everybody's still using this. It's not like it's been broken.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:20.040]   So Google is just simply by itself saying, "Too bad. You guys are going to have to fix this now."
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:25.040]   If anybody should be working fast to change it, this place is like Bank of America.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:31.040]   But so Steve is in the chatroom. He says, "Yes, in January, you'll start seeing the big red X.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:35.040]   This is not secure on Bank of America and Amazon and others.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.040]   If they're, if they don't update their certs by then."
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.040]   Okay. I agree.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.040]   That's crazy.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.040]   I agree.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.040]   That's crazy.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.040]   And with you, thanks, Steve.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.040]   Now maybe maybe in three months, everybody will have moved to Shaw 2.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.040]   It will have only cost a little bit of money.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:59.040]   These things, you know, maybe, maybe I never really go, "Oh, well, thank you, Google, for getting this done."
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.040]   Even though it wasn't an urgent thing.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   It's almost as aggressive as Apple deleting your iPhone album.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:13.040]   Don't get me started. You're poking the bear, Gina.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   Cue the YouTube album.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.040]   Cue the YouTube album, which we all have thanks to Apple.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.040]   I know. It's everywhere.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.040]   Get away from it.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.040]   Not me. No, you two.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.040]   No, I am too old.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.040]   Now you are trolling.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.040]   All right. Let's take a break.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.040]   Those are three stupid stories. I'm sorry I brought any of them up.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.040]   Would you guys look at the rundown and find something good for us to talk about?
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   Well, I do an ad.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   I'm putting you in charge. And we'll do the changelog.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.040]   Gina's back. We really need a changelog.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.040]   I also, I think we talked, we didn't do a very good job talking about Hangouts
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.040]   and the, and the move of voices, the merging of voice and Hangouts last week.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.040]   So maybe we can get Gina to explain that a little bit.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.040]   And most of all, Ben and I know you're talking about it a lot.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.040]   And I like it. By the way, I like it.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.040]   That's a radical stance.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.040]   He was a gutter.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.040]   And I'm using it now for my SMS messaging and everything.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.040]   I'm making calls with it. I like it.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.040]   But we'll talk about it in a second.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.040]   Our show today brought to you by Full Sail University.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.040]   I love this name.
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.040]   Set your sales, set your sales for adventure.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.040]   Set your sales for a bright future.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.040]   Full Sail offers both online and campus degree programs.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:30.040]   Set it on real world experience in the areas we know a lot of you are very interested in.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.040]   Entertainment, media, technology, and in particular marketing.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:39.040]   You know, marketers nowadays. In fact, I'm really, I think I want more people to take these programs
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.040]   because I feel like a lot of marketers don't understand what's going on.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.040]   You need to kind of get what's going on with the Internet.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.040]   You need to reach audiences and consumers in the new digital environment,
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   using web-based channels and understanding search technology, analytics.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   Full Sail University has an online Internet Marketing Masters degree program designed for pros
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.040]   who want to keep pace with these really fast-moving marketing technologies.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:08.040]   Things like search engine optimization, social media marketing,
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.040]   web metrics, analytics, online consumer behavior.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.040]   You'll be working on real projects with real clients to gain experience
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:20.040]   and generate results. And of course, your instructors are not, you know, not just teachers.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:26.040]   No, my friends. They're in their industry vets experienced in these things.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.040]   Full Sail University's online and they're good teachers too.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.040]   Full Sail University's online and campus degree programs are centered on real world education
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.040]   and experience with technology and workflow.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.040]   Through their innovative curriculum, you can get your masters in 12 months.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.040]   And through their project launch box program, Full Sail students also receive a MacBook Pro
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:50.040]   preloaded with Apple's complete line of creative software tools as well as degree specific sets
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.040]   of pro level applications. Really neat stuff.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.040]   They also offer masters in business intelligence.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:00.040]   That's something, boy, if you learned that, you'd be really on your way.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.040]   Innovation and entrepreneurship, new media journalism to learn more about Full Sail's
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:09.040]   master degree program in Internet marketing or any of their related programs.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:19.040]   We invite you to go to fullsell.edu/twigf-u-l-l-s-a-i-l.edu/twig.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:26.040]   Set your sale for your future Full Sail University.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.040]   Let's get the trumpets into the change log.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.040]   I think this is a good time.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.040]   Unless you want to talk about voice.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.040]   We'll do it in the change log.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.040]   Somebody messaged me that his OB high is working again.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.040]   Is what now?
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.040]   I'll let me tell you about the OB high.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.040]   This is another one where I felt guilty because I've been telling everybody to get one.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:54.040]   It's this little device, the OB 100 that I have was like 80, 90 bucks, that essentially
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:26:02.040]   lets you use Google Voice to connect your regular home to the OB device, which then you
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:07.040]   connect to the Internet, and then you can use Google Voice for your phone number and your
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.040]   phone calls.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.040]   Gotcha.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.040]   So cool.
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.040]   It's like 100 bucks.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.040]   That's great.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:21.040]   So I had one and then we were all very afraid that it would stop working because Google had told
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:26.040]   everybody, "We're not going to use XMPP anymore."
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.040]   XMPP.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:35.040]   And the good news is with the move towards to hangouts, it works again.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.040]   So very good news.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.040]   I'm going to have my head in mind in a drawer.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:46.040]   So if you want a home line that uses your Internet, has a regular phone number, you may
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.040]   call in and out.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.040]   It's using Google Voice, so it's free-loaded into the US and Canada, and it's very inexpensive
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.040]   globally.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.040]   This is a good way to do it.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.040]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, play the trumpets, sing the song.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.040]   The Google Change Law.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.040]   Time for the change law.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:07.040]   Change your panties back with all the new stuff from Google.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.640]   Well, I have to apologize.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.200]   I know you started talking about this last week, but I just got it yesterday and we just
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.560]   started talking about it.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:18.040]   Google Voice, integration, rolling out in hangouts.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.480]   This is pretty cool.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.440]   So you use Google Voice and you're on Android, you know, the Google Voice Android app has
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.880]   been kind of long neglected.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.280]   And that's because everything's migrating into hangouts.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:33.400]   A recent update, you get a little prompt at the top of the app, like Chad is showing
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.640]   on the screen there, thank you, Chad.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.560]   Saying, hey, do you want to migrate Google Voice to hangouts?
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.120]   That means that you'll receive your voicemail and you'll send text messages in hangouts.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.120]   So you have the option.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.760]   No, don't do it, not now, and turn it on.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:51.680]   I turned it on because I have this Moto 360 on my wrist here and I want to be able to
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.880]   respond to text messages through voice and you can't do that through Google Voice.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.440]   You can do that through hangouts.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.080]   So turn it on, Gina.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.200]   So turn what on?
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.200]   My 360?
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.400]   No, no, no.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.400]   So you're advising.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.720]   I turned it on right away.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.960]   And yes, I like it.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.960]   I like it too.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.280]   I'll be honest.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.280]   I went to go send my wife a text message yesterday and I got this prompt and now suddenly I'm
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.720]   like going through the settings of hangouts and I'm annoyed because all I want to do is
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.720]   send a text message.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.280]   Yeah, it's timing wasn't the most of this.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:26.880]   And it took me a moment to hangouts to send SMS from my Google Voice number and not from
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.640]   my phone's native number.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.640]   That is in settings.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.280]   It took me a moment to find it.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.280]   It is in hangout settings.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:36.400]   You can set it to do that by default because I use my Google Voice number for everything.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.640]   And once I did that, I was really happy with it.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.680]   I also had the Jeff, I had your problem where I was like, wait a second now.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:48.240]   Each one of these conversations are SMS conversations and which one of them are hangout chat conversations.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.600]   I managed to sort of unmerge those.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:55.200]   And so once I sort of just got used to that the hangouts interface, I was really happy
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.200]   with it.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.960]   Now, the thing that you should know though, one thing that I do a lot in my browser, I
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.000]   use Google Voice in my web browser a lot.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   I have the tab open.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.040]   I send us a text message from it.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.600]   Once I made the switch, I went to my Google Voice inbox on the web and I couldn't send text
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.680]   messages from it anymore.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.480]   You have to use the hangouts app on your desktop.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.080]   So that was also a little disconcerting with all change.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.520]   There's a little bit of like, wait, you know, my old way doesn't work.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:25.200]   But now you can send texts from your desktop using hangouts.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.160]   You can make call that hangouts thing.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.000]   If you've got Chrome running, it's just like an app standalone app.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Yep.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   I love it.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.080]   Yeah, I really, I really dig it.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.580]   I really dig it.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.160]   Google also rolled out a new app, the Hangouts Dialer.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.160]   Did you get this?
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.160]   Yes.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.720]   The iOS has had for a while, lets you turn your Google Voice account into true Voice or
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.120]   RIP solution.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.480]   You can make wipe calls from your phone, which is really nice.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.800]   And I was kind of annoyed that iOS had this first.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   You kind of need to get this if you're going to use the Hangouts fully as you're kind of
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.440]   all in one messaging center.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:06.000]   So you can make calls, you can do text, you can do now MMS because you can say, before
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.080]   we couldn't use Google Voice to send anything but text, you can now because you're using
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.080]   Hangouts.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.800]   So you can send images and movies and audio.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.280]   I mean, I like this.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:20.320]   It's really, I took them a while to get this worked out, but it seems to work really well.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.320]   I get my voicemail, you know, audio in my Hangouts.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.560]   So now, so now when you, about then the mess.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.800]   So you can say, I haven't actually tried this yet.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:34.600]   You can send an image from your Google Voice number to another phone number and it works.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.000]   I tried and it didn't work.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.440]   Oh, well it's supposed to.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.920]   I think you can send because it will make it an attachment on the internet.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.680]   But I don't think you can receive MMS.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.520]   That was what I noticed.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.520]   Okay.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.000]   Yeah, I'll have to play around with this a little more.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.040]   I'm interested to know, does it reroute it to just a Hangouts message?
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.320]   Does it, does it make it attachment?
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.320]   Does it send it via email?
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.880]   Because sometimes like that happens.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.320]   But that would be, that would be tremendous because that was always my sort of big complaint.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.760]   Well, my understanding, I can't, I'm going to try to send a picture right now and I'll
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.840]   see what happens via SMS.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.840]   So when you, when you're sending messaging somebody, you have a little drop down that
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.880]   says you can choose the various ways you could send it.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:18.160]   And I'm going to try to send it via SMS photo ready to send and I'm going to send it.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.160]   It says it's an SMS.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.160]   Oh, you know what?
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.320]   I think it's going to use my T mobile SMS.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.320]   Right.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.320]   What you could also do with Hangouts.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.280]   Anyway, it seems like you can now.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.840]   I mean, it's, it, you have the option in the interface to send a photo, right?
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.800]   Which you didn't have before with Google.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.800]   Yeah, we may not get through, but it's in.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.800]   Right.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.240]   But I mean, you know, you, you have another way that you can send it.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.160]   Having the two different apps was always, you know, I always just sort of lived in the
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.160]   Google voice app.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.960]   And of course, you just get all the benefits of Hangouts being very actively developed,
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.400]   modern, updated app, which the Google voice has been sort of decrepit.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.440]   I was always going to die, finally.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.440]   And rotting.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.400]   I don't think it's going, I think the back end is going to stick around now that they
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   did give you the option.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.400]   Don't enable this.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.120]   So folks can stay on Google voice if they want.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:05.720]   I think that that's, you know, Google sort of stepping gently into the new, the new thing.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.720]   I don't know.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.640]   I'll be interested to see if at some point they actually just straight up deprecate Google
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.640]   voice.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.960]   And Chad, I just got an attachment for me.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:12.960]   That's so weird.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.480]   I was on a call like a Skype call with a friend and I asked him to send me a photo from his
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.480]   iPhone to my Google voice.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.480]   See, I did.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.480]   I got it.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.440]   Here's a very attractive picture of Chad.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.440]   Thank you.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.440]   via Google voice.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.440]   Says via Google voice.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.920]   It's sent to it says send from my.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.720]   So it sent well.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.440]   I just was not able to receive one.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.920]   Maybe that was a glitch.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.360]   Yesterday, I was using Google voice.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.400]   He was using his normal AT&T.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.720]   Yeah, I know I'd be there might be an issue there.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.720]   I don't know.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.720]   Interesting.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.080]   And when you go to your Google voice app now that you've made the shift, it will say in
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.080]   the Google voice app, no, no, no, no, no, use me.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.080]   Hangouts.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.080]   Hangouts.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.080]   Don't use me.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.080]   I got nothing.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.080]   Yep.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.080]   It doesn't go away.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.600]   Your old messages are still in there, but it says, nothing news coming here.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.600]   Right.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.040]   It also displays voicemails really nicely.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.040]   I agree.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.600]   You get the transcription.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.880]   You get the transcription.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.800]   You can you have a big play button.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.640]   It gives you a progress bar.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.320]   It's very, it's very nice.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.280]   And it's it comes out in almost as a card instead of just where on the voice app, it
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.920]   was a full page.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.920]   Yes.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.920]   It's very nice.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.480]   I feel like this is what Apple's trying to do with a message.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.480]   I message.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.920]   I message slash messages.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.920]   But it works.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.000]   And it's cross platform, which is nice.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.560]   So I've always been able to see phone calls to my Google voice number on my iPad.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.880]   My iPad starts ringing when people call my Google voice number and I could pick up
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.160]   and I could talk and all of that.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.440]   And that's really cool.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.520]   So this is full unlike Apple's solution.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.960]   This is fully cross platform Android, iOS and desktop.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.960]   If you're using it.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.960]   Yeah, it's really nice.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.960]   It's really nice.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.920]   So now Android Central lets you abandon the Google voice app entirely.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.240]   They pointed out very smartly.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.980]   Don't remove don't uninstall the Google voice app because that means any calls are
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:06.720]   you make from your stock dialer won't look as if they're coming from your voice number.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.000]   So keep it installed for now.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   And hopefully that'll be built.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.640]   This is all a transition.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.240]   It's not it's gradually being done.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.240]   Yeah, I'm pretty happy about it though.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.880]   I have to say I embrace the hangouts.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:23.000]   I didn't like it at first because I didn't want to use such a heavyweight tool for my
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.320]   text messaging.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.080]   But now that everything is a unified inbox, that's really great.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.080]   That's worth it.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:33.820]   And you say for Android where now we can reply to for the next part of our watch.
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:34.820]   That's it.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:35.820]   Yeah.
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.820]   And I want to talk about this watch by the way with you all as well.
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.300]   But I'll get through the I'll get through the change log first.
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.340]   We're going to do a whole Moto thing after the change log.
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.340]   Let's do a Moto thing.
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.060]   I want to hear about I want to hear about your Moto moto's.
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.060]   Yes.
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.060]   I got leather baby.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.060]   Oh, I can't wait.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.060]   I want to see.
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:59.780]   Ever ever stylish Leo.
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:04.920]   So remember that demo we saw at Google I owe where they were running Android apps in Chrome
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.240]   OS.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.820]   That is happening for everybody.
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:12.040]   So we got four Android apps now available to run on Chrome OS.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.280]   Duolingo, great app.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:20.460]   Evernote, sight words and vine are all available in the Chrome Web Store for Chrome OS users.
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.460]   Okay.
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.820]   Have you installed this Jeff?
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:24.900]   I installed the Evernote.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:25.900]   Yeah, and it's great.
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.140]   I mean, it works now.
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:30.900]   That was because I complained before I stopped using Evernote because it wasn't native on
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:31.900]   Chrome.
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:39.220]   And so when like computer died, which is very rare on my Chrome Vocal, when it did, I lost
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.820]   the material because it wasn't saved to the cloud.
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.260]   Now it does save locally, which is very important.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.140]   And that means that other applications will do the same thing.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.180]   And that's a big deal.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:51.460]   So it's the tablet optimized layout, right?
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.540]   Because it's on your Pixel, your Pixel's touch screen.
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:56.060]   So when you launch Evernote, it looks as if it's on a tablet, right?
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:36:00.660]   And you can touch it to interact or that you use your keyboard obviously to type into
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.660]   it.
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.540]   Let me call it up here.
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:07.060]   And it just acts like it's on your Nexus 7.
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.060]   Well, it's weird.
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.260]   I can't find it because I have the Evernote.
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.740]   I have an Evernote Web.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.460]   That's what I've been using.
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.700]   So I do use Evernote on it.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.700]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.700]   I just know I can't save stuff.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.700]   You can't-- in the web you can.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.700]   Right.
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.820]   But, you know, so that's still in my applications.
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.020]   No, I can't find the Evernote.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.020]   Yeah, I didn't get a chance to add the skill back.
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.740]   Oh, because you can't have--
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:35.300]   I'll advertise the apps on--
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:35.800]   I know.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.980]   That really bothers me.
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.740]   You can drag them around though, right?
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:39.260]   Can't you?
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.940]   Yeah, but I can drag them into any order you want.
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:42.940]   I can stop.
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.660]   I don't have time to drag stuff.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.020]   But I have a beautiful--
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.620]   That's what the alphabet's for, to put stuff in order,
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.740]   in some random order based on the first letter of their name.
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.060]   Please.
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.940]   That's why we created the alphabet.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:56.940]   [MUSIC - "JETTTY"]
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.420]   I don't care anymore.
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.340]   Well, I don't want to get Jeff too agitated.
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.620]   I don't really know what Google's doing here.
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:07.660]   I don't know what this means.
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.180]   My heartbeat is going when you do.
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:09.860]   So it's time to--
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.860]   Yes, there you go.
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:11.860]   You can get me to my goal.
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:15.460]   So there you go.
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:18.740]   Android, App, so Gromo, West, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.740]   It's--
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.540]   We really want to talk about the Moto 360.
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.020]   It's dipped in chocolate.
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.380]   It's just in chocolate.
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:25.980]   One more.
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.180]   This is a pretty big launch.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:30.260]   So Google released an updated My Maps app.
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.700]   This is renamed the--
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.420]   used to be named the Google Maps Engine Lite,
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.740]   very long, forgettable name.
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:37.900]   Now it's called My Maps.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.100]   And they opened up the map gallery to the public.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.340]   And that's at google.com/maps/views.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.580]   My Maps is a way for you to create your own customizable maps
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.060]   if you're going to a conference or planning vacation
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:52.060]   or you're just mapping your town for visitors.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.020]   So if you go to just regular Google Maps on the web now,
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.700]   in the search dropdown, there's a My Maps section.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.740]   We can create a custom map as you like and share it.
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.900]   And there's a new Android app as well.
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:03.900]   It's called My Maps.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:04.820]   And it's in the Play Store.
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.740]   And it's for free where you can create your own maps there
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.780]   and view them as well.
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.220]   So really nice map stuff.
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.940]   I'll tell you the truth.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.060]   And I'm not like burning to make my own map.
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:19.060]   But when you think about it, we're
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.060]   planning trip to San Diego.
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.380]   And I want to hit all my old haunts.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.140]   And that's a really good way to do it.
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:26.020]   Or you go to a conference or you want to show a friend
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.780]   driving directions to your place on the back way.
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.700]   So you should be able to-- yeah, they're My Maps.
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:34.580]   Here's the example Mashable gives us a London food map.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:35.380]   See, this would be nice.
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.060]   So you could just install--
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.380]   I don't know how you would--
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.580]   I guess it's a bookmark, right?
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.340]   And then you'd go to this map and Google Maps
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.060]   is that how it worked?
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.860]   And then you could look at the different restaurants
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.020]   in London.
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.500]   Yeah, well, I mean, if you're using Android,
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.020]   you can install the My Maps app.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.780]   And you can do a little bit of a map.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:52.380]   And I think you can--
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.860]   So you need the My Maps for reading as well as writing.
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:56.860]   I think so.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.140]   I think so, although I don't see why you shouldn't be able to just--
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:02.340]   Since I should make a URL, it could become a URL.
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.100]   I mean, I'm on My Maps on the Labs.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.620]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:10.620]   And finally, another bit of Chromebook news.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.420]   Anyone who uses the latest developer version of the Chrome OS
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:17.060]   can now stream videos stored in Google Drive directly
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:20.820]   to their Chromecast device, of course, televisions.
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.460]   So, Jeff, if you've got the dev channel--
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.300]   You're following all those televisions.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:25.820]   What's that?
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.100]   We've kids out there.
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.220]   We used to call them TV sets.
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.140]   Television, right.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.420]   TV set.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.940]   Go turn on the TV set, Joey.
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.340]   Is that your test, still on?
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:42.460]   I was watching the movie Avalon the other day, Barry--
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:43.620]   what's his name?
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.100]   The guy does all the Baltimore movies.
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.740]   It's a wonderful movie about immigrant family in Baltimore.
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.580]   And it's in the '50s, and they get a TV.
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.980]   And there's just a test pattern.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.180]   But the whole family sits around watching the test pattern.
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.420]   And then somebody says, I think it's changing.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.780]   That means a show must be coming soon.
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.060]   The pitch sounds like it's going down.
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.780]   There was nothing to watch.
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.300]   Wow.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.900]   There was something on the TV set.
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:07.940]   The TV set.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.460]   Television set.
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.660]   Bunny ears, rabbit ears, I recall.
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.620]   Such a good movie.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.900]   Love Avalon.
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:18.500]   So there you go.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.180]   That's streaming from Comcast, your television set.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:21.860]   Very 11th.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.140]   Or sorry for Chrome OS from Google Drive.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.780]   You don't even need rabbit ears, kids.
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:27.780]   Yay.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:28.260]   It's amazing.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.380]   No need for rabbit ears.
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:30.780]   So they've added to--
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:31.660]   this is good.
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.900]   I thought we were going to get a flood of these Chromecast
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.340]   apps, but apparently Google's still gigkeeping this.
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:38.860]   Yeah.
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.860]   I mean, it feels like there's a few new ones here and there,
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:42.380]   right?
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.020]   But it's been a trickle.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.340]   But I don't know.
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:48.900]   More and more, I'm surprised.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:53.500]   Twitch, we got watch Disney iHeartRadio, drama fever.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.460]   I don't know what that is.
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:56.780]   Do you know what drama fever is?
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:57.220]   No.
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.060]   I don't know what that is.
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.660]   That sounds right at my alley, though.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.660]   I think it has to do with the Kardashians.
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:04.340]   I'm thinking.
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:06.420]   I don't know.
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:07.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.140]   Yeah, drama fever.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.500]   Oh, my God.
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.660]   This is right up your alley.
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:13.740]   Holy cow.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.660]   Oh, boy.
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:16.700]   Holy cow.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.340]   It's all chick flicks.
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:19.980]   No, I don't know.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:22.060]   I don't know what the story is on this.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.300]   So it's another movie channel of some kind.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.140]   I think just this week, Twitch and Disney and--
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.060]   Yeah, these are all new on Chromecast.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:30.580]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.020]   So I mean, we are getting there.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.620]   We're getting a few here and there.
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.820]   That's OK.
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:36.420]   It's OK.
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:41.300]   That's Love by Sung Dong 2.
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.820]   Oh, boy.
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.740]   And drama fever now on the Chromecast.
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.460]   Now on Chromecast.
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.140]   Well, that's all I got for the change log.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.700]   That's the Google change log.
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:59.100]   So when was it?
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.860]   It was Tuesday.
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:05.940]   No, Monday, 11 AM Central Time.
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.420]   The Moto Maker site went live with the brand new Moto X
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:11.980]   second generation.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.340]   Ah, your new baby.
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:14.980]   My new--
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:15.540]   Is that what you called it?
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:17.380]   I called it my new baby.
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:18.900]   They have some previews.
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:23.740]   But I decided to go with a little bit of leather
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:25.100]   with the cognac--
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.780]   You want good boy.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.100]   The cognac.
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.940]   And then on the front, I'm going to have black.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.260]   And I'm going to have a little gray trim.
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.980]   So it's very masculine.
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:37.060]   I'm very tempted to do this.
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.660]   Men's Club look.
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:40.460]   That is men's club.
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:41.500]   It's very men's club.
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.860]   All I need is a little cigar smoke.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.420]   And I'm set.
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:49.300]   Unlocked 525.
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.180]   That's kind of nice.
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.180]   It's fairly affordable.
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:51.780]   That's with the--
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:53.180]   Well, that makes it look cheap, yeah.
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.100]   Yeah.
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:58.620]   That's with the $25 surcharge for leather.
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.620]   They have the wood as well.
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:03.100]   The Moto 360-- let's see if it's still available,
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:04.260]   because it went back on sale.
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:05.780]   Yup, still available.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.420]   So obviously, they got a big shipment or something in.
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.220]   You guys both got Moto 360s from Google I/O.
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.060]   Yes.
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:12.660]   And--
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.220]   And the new first.
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:18.700]   Well, but let me just say one more thing, which is the Moto
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.460]   Hint.
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:21.700]   Well, you can order it now.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:24.780]   Which is the Scarlet Johansson earpiece
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.940]   that you put in your ear just like--
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.340]   You're helping out by saying that.
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.700]   Walking Phoenix, whoever--
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:33.180]   Her.
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:33.680]   Her.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.100]   Just like the movie Her.
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:39.380]   And by the way, yes, you can get it in leather.
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:45.100]   So I got a brown leather matching brown leather earpiece.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.220]   Now, we know that's going to have terrible battery life,
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:50.140]   because it comes with this special extra battery that's
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.100]   its case.
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.620]   I also predict I'm going to lose it out of my weird ear
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:55.220]   within about eight hours.
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.300]   I mean, it's the smallest--
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.660]   it's basically a Bluetooth headset.
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:03.260]   But it does have some additional Moto X features.
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.220]   You can talk to it.
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:06.740]   That guy looks a little dorky.
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.460]   He looks like walking in Phoenix.
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.460]   Little bit.
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:09.980]   A little bit.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.100]   So the idea is it looks like a pretty little earring
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.380]   or a gauge in your ear.
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.380]   And you just talk to it, you say--
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:22.100]   And I think I'm going to say OK Jarvis.
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.420]   Maybe I'll say OK, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:25.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.220]   Because you can wake it up now.
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.700]   The new Moto X, you can wake up with any phrase you wish,
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:32.700]   if it's sufficiently complex and long.
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:35.620]   You get up to 10 hours of talk time with the case.
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.220]   The case contains two extra charges.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.340]   I'm thinking that means it's about three and a third hours
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:41.620]   per charge talk time.
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.900]   So it's not a really long thing.
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:44.580]   But I like it.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.860]   So I call this-- if you've ever played World of Warcraft,
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:50.460]   you get these armor equipment sets.
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.540]   I call it my legendary equipment set, the Moto 360,
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:56.380]   the Moto Hint, the Moto X.
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:57.980]   I will be invincible.
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:59.820]   You're going to be decked out.
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:00.820]   You're going to be decked out.
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:01.340]   It works with all phones.
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:01.820]   It is.
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.820]   It's a bluesy headset but does some additional stuff
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:04.420]   with the Moto X.
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.460]   So it'll work with an iPhone or anything else.
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:07.780]   It's just a Bluetooth headset.
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:10.100]   It's like your-- you're working on Bluetooth.
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.060]   When do you get it?
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.460]   The phone comes on a week from Friday.
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:21.460]   The watch comes October 4th.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:26.180]   Hint comes-- both of them come after I get back from London.
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:27.180]   But I will have the phone.
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.500]   And the main selling point to the Moto X, according to you,
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.540]   in your view, is--
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:34.180]   Well, you had the old Moto X, right?
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:34.940]   Well, briefly.
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:38.460]   It's just like-- well, it's just like the one you didn't like,
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.580]   except--
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.660]   It's faster.
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:42.660]   It's bigger.
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.420]   It's 5.2 inches instead of 4.7.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.980]   Yes, it's faster.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.620]   And it has better battery life, supposedly.
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:50.540]   Oh, I forgot.
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:54.540]   And a much better camera, 13 megapixel camera.
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.980]   Yeah, I'm finding the one plus is what you said last week.
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:58.900]   It's-- it's a--
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:45:59.620]   It's a little capable.
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:00.540]   It's vanilla.
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:01.900]   But the show is the Nexus 5.
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.020]   This is vanilla.
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:08.140]   I want a pistachio with this world of caramel and--
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:09.780]   cluster on top.
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:12.620]   You're deman-lifying the phone by saying you want it.
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:13.540]   That's what I love.
[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:14.540]   I love it.
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:16.220]   I'm noticing all your masculinity points here.
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.940]   And it will be-- it's going to be very interesting,
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.700]   because I don't know what I'm going to use day to day.
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.220]   And I guess I should be like Brian Williams
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.140]   and not say what my preference is.
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:25.660]   No, because you'll use both.
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:26.780]   You'll try and it'll say--
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.540]   I will have the iPhone 6 plus, the big one.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:32.980]   I will have the Moto X. And I will have--
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:35.340]   I think the one plus is going to be in contention.
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.300]   One of them-- because I don't want to carry three phones.
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.780]   That's just stupid.
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:39.820]   One of them all carry.
[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:40.820]   Yeah, that's pretty.
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:41.820]   But I shouldn't say--
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:44.620]   not to mention who you voted for, but phones.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:45.300]   I mean, it's right.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.700]   That's right out in front of you.
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.940]   We should mention before the show started,
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.100]   Jeff Jarvis posed this question.
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:51.020]   It's an interesting question.
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:55.180]   Should tech journalists not state their preference
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.260]   if they're going to cover--
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.660]   so should people not know what phone
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:01.020]   I use as the daily driver?
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:05.740]   If someone lives in the iOS ecosystem and they cover Android,
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.740]   they've made that choice as a consumer,
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:11.020]   I think that's worthy of transparency.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.540]   I think there's two different kinds of reporters, though.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:18.700]   There's a traditional reporter who's just the fact,
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.820]   I'm in no opinion.
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:21.860]   And then there's people like me.
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.220]   I'm a reviewer, a pundit.
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:27.420]   So I make a choice based on my best judgment,
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:28.740]   having tried every phone.
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.540]   And I want to communicate that choice saying, for me,
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:33.340]   I chose this because I like this.
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:34.860]   When people ask me with a phone again,
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:36.940]   I don't universally say, oh, you should get the one plus one.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:37.700]   That's it.
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:38.780]   I ask them questions.
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:41.820]   And then depending on what's the reasonable thing for them,
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:42.460]   I will tell them.
[00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:44.060]   And sometimes it's an iPhone.
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.460]   Sometimes it's a Moto X. Sometimes it's a Windows phone,
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:47.820]   even.
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:48.540]   Well, hardly ever.
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.860]   But sometimes it's a Windows phone.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:54.020]   Yeah, I mean, the question I always
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.380]   want to know from you, Leo, is what phone are you currently
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.780]   using, like given this latest device now?
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.780]   Because it's like the ultimate statement.
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.700]   It's the ultimate review, to me.
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:04.980]   Well, it's important, though.
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:06.380]   Well, Jeff made the point that it's
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.220]   important to know because of-- for your bias,
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.460]   for reasons of bias.
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:09.820]   Sure.
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.580]   And it's important to you because it gives you
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:15.300]   a data point on what phone you should get.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:16.460]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.260]   I mean, I see friends of mine who've always been iOS.
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.780]   A friend of mine I was just talking to before I started
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.460]   the show said, oh, I sent a--
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:26.060]   I upgrade iOS E, and I sent this message to my wife,
[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:27.300]   and I can't wait for it to write me back,
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:30.660]   because I want to see what it's like to reply to a message
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:31.860]   right from the home screen.
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:33.140]   You should be able to do that.
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:34.780]   And I was like, oh, you can do that now.
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:35.580]   Like, that's great.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.940]   And he was like, yeah.
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:39.140]   And I was like, yeah.
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:40.500]   Yeah, we'll do that for you.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.020]   And I was like, look, I don't want to be a jerk,
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:42.940]   but good for you.
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.380]   And he was like, oh, Android has three versions ago.
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.100]   But it's OK.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:49.580]   I enjoy it.
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:52.140]   But it's this sense of revelation
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.300]   about that when folks gush who have been iOS only
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.740]   kind of gush about iOS features,
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.420]   I'm not trying to take away from Apple.
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.660]   In a lot of ways, they do these things really more
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:03.100]   thoughtfully or maybe more designed.
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.260]   I will totally admit to that.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:08.540]   But it is when people are cutting out paper sizes
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.540]   and the i6+ it's like these phones exist.
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.020]   You don't have to cut cardboard out.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.860]   Like, there are phones that are the size.
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:14.340]   Isn't that funny?
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.420]   Isn't that funny?
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:18.100]   Everybody was doing that making cardboard dummies.
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:20.060]   Oh, get your wakey iPhone.
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:23.140]   I've had three colleagues at the office where I've said,
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:24.620]   you know, this is the size of the iPhone.
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:25.140]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:25.500]   Oh, really?
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:26.180]   Can I touch it?
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:27.180]   Yeah.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:27.700]   Yeah.
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.180]   Our one plus one is almost exactly the same size.
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:31.180]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.860]   I went to a conference this week, and I went to the XO conference
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:34.860]   at the festival.
[00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:37.300]   And when I would go to iOS, people would be like,
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.340]   meet the size of your new phone.
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.340]   Like, it would just be like, oh, I know what that's like.
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:43.420]   I don't know what you ought to be sort of horrified
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:44.020]   and interested.
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.860]   Suddenly, everybody wanted to hold my phone
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:48.140]   and stick it in their pocket and see how it worked.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.580]   So that was my favorite way to troll iPhone users.
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:53.860]   But so it's interesting to me to know, oh, you've never
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:56.300]   actually really lived with Android.
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:00.500]   Because if you did, this wouldn't be such a huge revelation.
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.060]   But now I'm being--
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.660]   I guess now I'm really introling.
[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:06.700]   But I'm the all about Android users, by the way.
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.860]   FYI.
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:11.540]   You, but you made this shift.
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:14.460]   We all have made the shift some sooner than later
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:15.540]   from iPhone.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:16.380]   Everybody who--
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:16.860]   That was.
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:20.380]   Anybody who had since bought an iPhone in 2007.
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:22.740]   There was nothing like it.
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:23.260]   Yup.
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:23.980]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.140]   And we stayed with it.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.380]   I got the first Android phone, tried it for a while.
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:28.220]   I thought, this isn't it.
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:29.060]   Wasn't it ready?
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:29.580]   Wasn't ready.
[00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:30.980]   The G1 was a disaster, right?
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.300]   G1, yeah.
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.580]   I was excited about but disappointed.
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:38.860]   And then at some point, differing points for each of us.
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:41.180]   But at some point, there was a crossover point
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:46.660]   where the Android phone actually started to beat the iPhone.
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:50.220]   In some respects that we cared about.
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:53.580]   For me, it was screen size and keyboard.
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:54.580]   Right.
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.020]   Yeah, it's a different perspective.
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:58.660]   It was living on the edge of--
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:02.060]   for me, it feels like I'm closer to the future with Android.
[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:04.060]   And you know, and Apple addressed this in their keynote.
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.580]   They did their whole thing about how they don't want to be first.
[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:07.780]   They want to be best.
[00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:08.140]   That's fine.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:08.980]   Even if that takes a long time.
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:09.820]   It's kind of BS.
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:10.340]   That's cool.
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:10.900]   That's why I'm kind of BS.
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:13.140]   I watched the Charlie Rose interview with Tim Cook yesterday.
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:17.060]   And it was very self-serving.
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:17.940]   They're patient.
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:18.820]   They're not behind.
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:19.820]   They're patient.
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.860]   But this is what-- this-- listen, this is his job, right?
[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:23.660]   I mean, this is his job is to position them
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:24.620]   as doing it the right way.
[00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:27.020]   And I'm going to tell you, the Apple Watch is-- it's cute.
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.340]   There's something compelling about it.
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:29.020]   Really?
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:30.700]   Something interestingly and compelling about it.
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:31.580]   Yeah, I would say so.
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.780]   I would say so, just from aesthetics-wise.
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:35.780]   I was like, oh, that looks hip to me.
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:36.300]   That looks pretty hip.
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.300]   I like the Melanie's bracelet.
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:43.900]   It's got the best bands of any watch on the market today.
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.180]   And I say that wearing in the ugliest white rubber band
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.580]   you've ever seen on my Android.
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.060]   So you both got Moto 360s.
[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:49.780]   Did you like it?
[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:50.500]   Do you like it?
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:51.380]   Do you know you first?
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:51.740]   Wait a minute.
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:52.420]   Stop.
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:52.940]   We'll do an ad.
[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:54.100]   Don't say anything.
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:54.940]   OK.
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:56.860]   There are reviews of the Moto 360 coming up,
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.620]   the first round smart watch.
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:01.380]   And in fact, surprise, Apple did not make one round.
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:03.660]   We thought, oh, well, Apple's going to make it round.
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:04.980]   Round's better.
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.300]   It really surprised me.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.580]   Yeah.
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:11.220]   Looks like a little square gold pillow on your wrist.
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:14.300]   Like a little Barbie pillow.
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:16.860]   Our show today brought to you by Personal Capital.
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:17.860]   Love these guys.
[00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:20.740]   In fact, I interviewed the CEO, the founder of Personal Capital,
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:24.460]   on triangulation.
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:26.060]   A couple of years ago, Bill Harris.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:30.580]   He was former CEO of PayPal and Intuit.
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:33.180]   Knew a lot about finance and the financial markets.
[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:35.300]   And he told me at the time he was starting this thing up.
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:35.740]   I joined it.
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:38.540]   And I'm so glad I did because it's fantastic.
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:45.180]   The idea is we all need to plan for our future.
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:47.060]   Our investments are going to--
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:48.500]   believe me, they're going to be Social Security.
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.220]   Our investments are going to keep us alive when we retire.
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:53.900]   It's so important to plan for that.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:56.500]   But depending on your age and interest,
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.900]   there are ways and ways to do this.
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.700]   And a lot of us, for instance, might
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:03.860]   hire a personal financial planner, a broker, who really
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:07.020]   often is just making himself rich, not you,
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:09.140]   because he gives commissions.
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:10.820]   Maybe we have that person, we don't trust them,
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.700]   or we trust them too much.
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:15.100]   Or maybe if you're a geek, I suspect this is the case.
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:15.740]   This is my case.
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.420]   Oh, I'm not going to take advice from a human.
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:20.540]   I'm going to do all the website research and all of that stuff.
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:22.540]   And I never get around to it.
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:26.500]   Personal capital is a very good solution for us.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.580]   It will automatically-- you put in all your stuff,
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:29.780]   it'll tell you where you stand.
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.020]   It'll tell you if your assets are allocated properly.
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:36.300]   It'll give you calculators that let you know how you're doing.
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:39.700]   It helps you make smarter financial decisions.
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:41.500]   You see everything in one place.
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.300]   If you want advice, they have a team of objective advisors
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:45.940]   who are not paid on commission.
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:50.260]   They're certified financial planners who will help you.
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:53.260]   But they also have all sorts of automated stuff
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:55.940]   so that you can see exactly what you're doing.
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.980]   One of the most important things I've found out
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.700]   is something called rebalancing your portfolio.
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.820]   As you make investments-- depending on your age,
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:07.780]   make investments in equities, bonds, international,
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:10.260]   national, in various proportions.
[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:12.740]   The problem is, if one sector does really well,
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:13.940]   then you're suddenly unbalanced.
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:16.060]   And you're supposed to, every quarter, go in
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:18.900]   and make sure that your investments are properly apportioned.
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:22.100]   And if one sector's growing a lot, reinvest that.
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.660]   It's a simple concept.
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.060]   Something very few people do.
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:27.180]   This will help you do it automatically.
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.060]   Little things like that.
[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:30.580]   There are now half a million people using personal capital.
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:32.660]   They're managing more than-- what was it?
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:37.020]   It was a huge number, a billion dollars in revenue.
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:39.020]   This is a great solution.
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.140]   A hundred billion dollars.
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.260]   Wow.
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:42.220]   They have it on Apple.
[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.260]   They have it on Android.
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.700]   They have it on Amazon tablets.
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:48.060]   They, of course, there's a web interface as well.
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:50.700]   And it's free.
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.220]   So there's no reason not to do it.
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:54.660]   Go to personalcapital.com/tweig.
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:58.660]   And at the very least, get your stuff in there and get an idea.
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:01.740]   They also have, which is really nice, an Android Wear app.
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:03.500]   Their Android app talks to Android Wear
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.740]   and will give you alerts.
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.100]   You can set alerts and say, I want
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:09.620]   to know how the market's doing if it does this much or whatever.
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:11.420]   Just a neat idea.
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:11.980]   I love it.
[00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:13.860]   Personalcapital.com.
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:15.100]   And we spend so much time talking
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:18.540]   about health things from our watches and health.
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:20.380]   What about your financial health?
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:22.100]   That deserves a little attention, too.
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:23.940]   If you do the right thing with your personal health,
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:24.940]   you might live long enough.
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:31.300]   You need something for your old age, personalcapital.com/tweig.
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:33.700]   And we thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:37.940]   So I borrowed Jason's Moto 360 for a few days.
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:39.260]   So I haven't experienced that, but I'd
[00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:42.420]   love to know you guys have had it for a week now.
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:44.940]   You like it?
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:47.380]   Yeah, well, speaking of disclosing biases,
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:50.220]   so the only other smart watch I've ever had is the LG GWatch.
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.860]   Yeah, everybody got this at Google I/O.
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.380]   Right, I've never had a pebble.
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:56.460]   I haven't had the Gear Live or anything.
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:57.740]   And I like the GWatch.
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.020]   I felt like the start of something.
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:00.940]   But this watch, I like a lot.
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:02.580]   It's a watch that I want to wear.
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:03.020]   It's pretty.
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:04.100]   It doesn't feel like a nerd watch.
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:05.620]   It's much better looking.
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.780]   Aesthetically, I think it's way better.
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:08.980]   It feels a lot more like a watch.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:11.620]   It doesn't draw as many weird looks.
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:14.740]   The charger is much, much better and easier.
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:17.460]   It's much more attractive and shows the time.
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:17.980]   It's wireless.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:18.820]   It's not pogo plugs.
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:21.540]   You just rest the watch sideways.
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:25.180]   And it becomes, if you wish, a bedside clock.
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:26.740]   Yeah, and it's actually quite nice.
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:27.420]   I like it.
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:30.940]   Yeah, I thought that the flat tire design was really going to bug me.
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:31.860]   I don't even see it.
[00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:33.180]   I don't even see it.
[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:35.180]   Maybe that means that I'm a terrible person.
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:36.860]   I don't have any aesthetic taste.
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.260]   It really doesn't bother me.
[00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:41.420]   I love the round face.
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:43.860]   This one's got a heart monitor, which the GWatch didn't have.
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:47.300]   And I was saying to Jason last night at all about Android,
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:51.220]   I think I don't know that it's working quite the way that it should.
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.780]   I had a speaking gauge when I spoke at a conference this weekend.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:55.020]   And I was really, really nervous.
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:58.180]   And by 11 AM, I got the like being like,
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:00.140]   you've reached your heart activity goal for the day.
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:00.460]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:01.620]   Is that a nice feeling?
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:02.060]   Yeah.
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:04.540]   Is that because I'm really nervous or because this thing is defective?
[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.460]   Like, am I defective?
[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:06.620]   Or is the watch defective?
[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:08.660]   Not sure yet.
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:10.420]   But I downloaded the Motorola Connect app.
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:12.740]   And I'm now using the Moto heart rate monitor.
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:13.340]   I guess this is--
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:13.980]   That's better.
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:14.820]   --the built in one.
[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:15.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:16.580]   Yeah.
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:18.420]   But yeah, I really, really like it.
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:20.980]   I mean, especially this weekend, like I said, I was traveling.
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:24.300]   And Google now, really, in my opinion, is at its best when you're traveling,
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:27.500]   because you get time at home and places of interest
[00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:31.020]   and where your photo spots nearby and time to check in.
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:32.540]   You better leave the airport now.
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:33.820]   And I loved all of that.
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:34.500]   And I used it.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:35.620]   And I got text messages.
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:36.660]   I wasn't looking at my phone.
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:37.460]   I was talking to people.
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:39.300]   I got text messages from home.
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.980]   Hey, the baby's going to bed an hour.
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:42.100]   You want to talk to her.
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:43.860]   And it buzzed on my wrist.
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:45.260]   And that's the whole point.
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:45.780]   Right?
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:47.140]   That's what these things are supposed to do.
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:50.540]   They're supposed to help you live your life more easily.
[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:51.780]   And definitely did that.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:52.540]   So I'm wearing it.
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:53.340]   I'm putting it on every day.
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.780]   And I'm charging it every night, which
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:56.060]   means that I really like it.
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:58:00.900]   Because normally, before this, I wasn't wearing a watch.
[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:01.900]   Jeff, what do you think?
[00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:02.420]   You agree?
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:06.140]   You're muted.
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:07.140]   You're muted.
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:12.460]   You can move your lips all you want.
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:13.340]   It's still not going to help.
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:14.980]   You got on mute.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:17.020]   Did you tap on in Skype?
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:18.940]   There we go.
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:19.300]   Hello.
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:19.780]   You hear me?
[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:20.020]   Yeah.
[00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:20.500]   There you go.
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:20.860]   Yep.
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:21.340]   OK.
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:22.580]   Cheers.
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:24.460]   So I agree with what much Regina said.
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.900]   But I have a few butts.
[00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:28.100]   I knew you wouldn't like it.
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:28.740]   I know it.
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:29.940]   No, no, I like it.
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:30.780]   I like it.
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:31.300]   I like it.
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.220]   But it's a very first generation point.
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:35.100]   I think that I'd agree with you on that.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:35.660]   That's what I mean.
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:36.460]   Yeah, I'll give you that.
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:38.140]   Here are my complaints.
[00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:40.500]   The primary one is that I don't like the fact
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:41.540]   that it's dark all the time.
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:43.300]   So I turned on the ambient.
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.860]   So I could just tell the time all the time.
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:48.020]   And it went out of power within, I think, 10 or 12 hours.
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:49.220]   No, sooner than that.
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.220]   Eight hours.
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:51.140]   Yeah, I was gone.
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:53.860]   So that's a ridiculous watch that doesn't know what time it is.
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:56.540]   It's just worthless, obviously.
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:57.020]   So--
[00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:59.860]   Well, when you raise it to look at it, it turns on.
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:01.420]   No, now I've got to go like this.
[00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:02.740]   I know it doesn't always do it.
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:04.140]   That's why they first stem on it.
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:04.940]   You know, like my law.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:05.460]   I agree.
[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:05.980]   That's the flaw.
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:08.220]   It doesn't have enough battery life to keep on all the time.
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:10.660]   It conspires with the light switch in my office,
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:12.100]   because it thinks I'm dead all the time.
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:13.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:14.700]   You know, I go like this.
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:16.260]   Move more, Jeff.
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:18.660]   And then I try to use the heartbeat thing,
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:21.700]   and it shows what many have suspected it can't find one.
[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:23.060]   You ain't got one, huh?
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.540]   Oh, man.
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:28.520]   I just go, jing, jing, jing, jing, jing, jing, jing, jing, jing,
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.100]   oh, you must be moving too much.
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:31.060]   Well, no, it's a contrary.
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:32.060]   I'm moving not at all.
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:33.740]   That's my problem with life.
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:34.940]   The processor is slow.
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:35.500]   It's slow.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.300]   There's a lot of spinning.
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:37.780]   I think--
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:40.980]   I think that the flat tire is a compromise
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:43.340]   that Steve Jobs would have never made.
[00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:44.420]   Never.
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:47.660]   And the LG round version uses the bezel around it,
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.940]   as we discussed last week, to solve that problem.
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:51.380]   Well, I think the flat tire is there.
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:55.740]   It's just-- they hide it behind a metal ring.
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:56.580]   Right, exactly.
[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:58.100]   So do something to hide it.
[00:59:58.100 --> 00:59:59.380]   Do something to do something.
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:03.540]   This is a design scar, what did I think?
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:07.500]   That's pretty much it.
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.020]   I think jing just right, it looks better.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:11.140]   I love having a--
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:14.380]   I go by windows and look at watch watches now,
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:15.380]   and I stop myself conveying.
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:15.900]   Well, why?
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.060]   I'm probably going to be wearing these for the rest of my life
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.460]   in some form or another.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.340]   I do love getting updates and alerts
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.940]   that I don't have to pull out my phone.
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:23.620]   I don't worry.
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.180]   When I get a text, I know I'm going to see it.
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:31.180]   When I get a priority box email, I know I'm going to see it.
[01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:33.100]   So I love all of that.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:34.860]   The power is to be a big issue.
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:36.380]   I looked up the LG watch.
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:45.980]   And this LG watch, as I think, 30% larger battery than the Moto.
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:50.100]   And the LG Round 1 has a similar battery, bigger battery.
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:54.140]   So they made a couple of really bad compromises on this thing.
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:57.580]   I think the battery is one, and the flat tires another one,
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.140]   but it's a first generation product.
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:00.380]   I still like wearing it.
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:01.740]   I'm still going to wear it.
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:04.100]   I'm still happy with it all in all,
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.860]   but I can't wait for generation 2.
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:06.380]   That's my take.
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:09.340]   I agree with both of you.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:11.620]   You're both right.
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:14.500]   And I was trying to decide-- because I already--
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:17.220]   I don't get any of this for free, because I didn't go to Google.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:22.380]   So I bought the LG Android Wear for 200 bucks.
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:24.620]   So I have an Android Wear watch.
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.540]   And I was really debating when the 360 went back on sale
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:31.900]   on Tuesday, whether I should buy it for $250.
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:35.460]   And I decided to, because it looks much better,
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:38.100]   functionality is pretty much the same.
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:41.300]   I agree it's annoying that you cannot have the ambient light on.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:45.620]   That is the watch face has to go off when it's not being used.
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.260]   I think that's dumb.
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:50.980]   And it really is a design choice that Motorola made that was dumb.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:56.540]   They use an old TIO map chip that is very poor battery life.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:58.020]   I'm not sure why they did it.
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:58.700]   Maybe it was cheaper.
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.660]   Maybe I don't know why they did it.
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:03.180]   The thing that's very obvious is this--
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.620]   as you said, the first generation.
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.420]   And in six months, there will be a better watch.
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:08.700]   There absolutely will be.
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:11.660]   So my calculus was, which is the best Android Wear watch
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:13.180]   right now?
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:16.540]   Am I willing to pay 250 bucks knowing that in six months,
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:19.740]   I'll have another one, because it'll be better?
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:22.620]   Is it worth it for those next six or so months?
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:23.500]   And I decided it was.
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.940]   But it was nipping tuck.
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:28.900]   And I did decide to buy it.
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:29.340]   What is that?
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:31.100]   I have a perfect watch face here.
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:34.540]   I think the black one is the prettiest.
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.300]   This is from the chair.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.060]   Oh, that's just a fix.
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:40.620]   Of what it would be like if you hid the bum.
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.020]   If it was just covered over.
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:42.540]   Right.
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:43.620]   Well, no, it wouldn't be like that,
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:47.140]   because you see how short the bar is on the bottom on the right.
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.780]   It would have to be that short on the left as well.
[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:53.460]   So I do think that the LG GWatch R, their round one,
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.020]   will be interesting and something to watch.
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.860]   I saw it in the flesh and liked it a lot.
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:57.380]   Did you?
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:57.880]   OK.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.700]   Round is right, which is why I was stunned that Apple
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:03.020]   decided to go with Square Pillow.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.580]   Well, there's a rumor.
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:06.980]   And I don't really don't put rumors on the rundown,
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:08.700]   because there's so many of them.
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:12.580]   But for this discussion, there's one that the Nexus 6--
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.380]   and then it's an implausible rumor.
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:15.460]   So I don't believe it for a second,
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:17.220]   but just for the sake of discussion,
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:21.180]   that the Nexus 6 is going to come bundled with the Google
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:24.140]   Gem Watch.
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:25.500]   Now, I don't really believe that,
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.940]   because I think it would end up costing too much--
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.420]   Why would they do that?
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:30.620]   Unless Google really wanted to foster
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:32.660]   the watch market, because somebody's got to start it.
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:36.940]   And if Google-- because the patent for the Gem Watch
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:41.740]   has things like a trackpad on the--
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:42.260]   what do you call it?
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.100]   Band.
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.300]   Don't get old, folks.
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:48.140]   And maybe other interesting features.
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:49.980]   And so it would be interesting if they
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:52.620]   one-upped Apple's watch.
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:53.060]   I don't know.
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.620]   We'll see.
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:55.500]   I like round.
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.860]   I think one of the things round does the Square doesn't do
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:59.820]   is it fits under the sleeve easier.
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.380]   So it's more like a regular watch.
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:04.500]   It just slides under your sleeve.
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.700]   That's not insignificant.
[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:11.860]   One thing that I read somewhere, some watch blog pointed out,
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:15.140]   is where the band joins the watch is important.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.660]   So this is LG, much like the Apple.
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:20.380]   The band joins the watch somewhere in the middle,
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:24.020]   which means there's a fairly big protuberance underneath the band.
[01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:26.820]   But look at yours, guys, that the watch band joins it
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:29.180]   at the very bottom of the watch.
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:31.020]   So that means all of the thickness of the watch
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:34.420]   is above your wrist, above the band.
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:39.180]   And that is subtle, but I think that's a huge difference.
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:40.900]   I think it's aesthetically gorgeous.
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:41.740]   I like the black--
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:44.300]   Well, the other thing is, does the watch-- does the band
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:47.820]   on the Moto go all the way through?
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:52.780]   Because here on the LG, it just connects the edges.
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:53.980]   No, the Moto is the same.
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.580]   I think they're both 22 millimeters standard pin watch
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.420]   bands.
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:58.340]   They can be replaced.
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:00.020]   Can't find a pin on the Moto.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:02.740]   Well, it's hidden in there.
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:06.540]   Well, then how would you get the pin?
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:07.980]   I do have-- somebody's pointing out, you know,
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:08.980]   there are square watch faces.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:11.860]   I do have a Cartier tank watch that has a rectangular face,
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:15.140]   but it's much thinner and smaller and elegant.
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.700]   It's not the shape square I don't like.
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.740]   It's the bulk of the square I don't like.
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:23.460]   I agree with you.
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:23.900]   Both.
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:24.820]   I think you're both right.
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:27.020]   It's not the perfect watch by any means,
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:30.260]   but it's the best one out there right now.
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.100]   Yeah, agreed.
[01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:31.580]   I agree.
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.940]   And I prepared this by saying that my only experience
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.740]   was the watch, because my expectations
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:36.940]   were sort of set there.
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:38.820]   Well, I've tried them all, Gina.
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:39.540]   Yeah, you have.
[01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:41.140]   I have had everyone.
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:41.940]   Yeah.
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:44.380]   And you weren't-- I remember when
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.820]   before these watches came out, you were like, yeah, you know,
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:48.020]   I don't know if I'm going to--
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:49.180]   I'm sure correctly.
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.420]   You said, are you a skeptical?
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:50.940]   I still am.
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:53.260]   I'm going to want to live with this every day.
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:55.180]   But for right now, you're living with it every day,
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:56.940]   and you like it.
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:59.820]   I am still skeptical.
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:02.580]   I don't think even Apple has solved the conundrum
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:04.140]   of how do you make the user interface on this
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:05.420]   something functional.
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:07.460]   In fact, I think Google's right to make it simpler.
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:10.380]   Apple's made it more complex.
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:12.780]   Yeah, which is an interesting turnaround, huh?
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:16.660]   And they've got not one, but two buttons on a little--
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:18.380]   Yeah, I don't want to--
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.420]   Gina, let me ask you this.
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:23.380]   Again, I'm an Android guy.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:27.580]   But I can't see wanting to manipulate apps on my watch.
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:30.340]   The watch is there as an add-on to my phone.
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:31.380]   Tell me what's going on.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:35.420]   I think the Google and Apple card is the perfect metaphor.
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.460]   This is the thing, right?
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.980]   I mean, when we covered-- we were talking about Tizen
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:39.940]   on all of it, Android.
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:42.380]   And it was just this grid of apps.
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:43.660]   And then I laughed.
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:46.620]   Because I was like, I don't want app icons on my watch.
[01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:47.940]   That's insane.
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:49.740]   So I agree.
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:50.940]   Listen, I'm not going to pass judgment
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.540]   as I haven't seen the Apple watch yet.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.900]   I think that the scroll wheel is interesting.
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:07:00.220]   It feels sort of akin to the first iPod click wheel.
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:02.860]   I was talking to my coworker, and he was saying, well,
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:06.380]   if you want to zoom in on images on your watch, how else
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:06.940]   you're going to do it.
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.060]   You can't pinch and zoom on a watch face.
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:09.860]   It's too small.
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:12.220]   And I was like, oh, that's an interesting point.
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:15.860]   You can't look at images, really, on Android Wear.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:17.300]   But I think that-- and this is, of course,
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:20.540]   a Google fan girl and an Android user, an enthusiast,
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:21.340]   talking.
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:25.340]   But I think that the key advantage that Google has right now
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.780]   with wearables is Google Now.
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:28.740]   This software is amazing.
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.060]   It's been around forever.
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:30.780]   They've developed it.
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.060]   And this is the card interface that
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:35.260]   extends to the glasses and to the watch.
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:37.180]   And everybody makes fun of Google Glass.
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:40.620]   But the reality is, is that Google's had a wearable out
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:43.060]   on real humans for a long time.
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:47.380]   And Android Wear and Glass, like this card interface,
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:49.740]   it just makes sense for this kind of device.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:56.300]   So Apple-- I don't know what the Apple experience is going to be.
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.020]   Apple is still a grid of icons, right?
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:58.980]   Like they're--
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:07:59.740]   Well, yeah.
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:02.300]   A weird honeycomb of icons, I guess.
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:03.780]   Yeah, honeycomb of icons.
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:04.660]   It's very nice.
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:05.820]   How's that going to work?
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.420]   I don't know.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:10.500]   I still don't think that apps should be the entry points
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:11.820]   into activities, right?
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:12.300]   Like I just--
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:13.300]   Well, we have apps.
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.060]   We have apps.
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:15.460]   It's just that you put the app on the phone,
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:17.420]   and then there is an Android Wear extension.
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:18.980]   But going to the app--
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:20.300]   I hardly ever do it.
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:20.780]   I don't either.
[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:22.900]   Yeah, it's cute that I can show a compass.
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:23.860]   No, I use the cards.
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:25.300]   That's what I use.
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:26.220]   Yeah, I use the cards.
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.980]   I don't think I should send Apple--
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:32.460]   so this software called HyperCard to remind them.
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:34.780]   I start the baby time app a lot, because my daughter just
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:35.740]   wants to play with this thing.
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:37.580]   So I lock it with this app called baby time,
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.780]   so she can swipe and whatever, do whatever
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:44.380]   without ordering food or calling China or whatever.
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:46.820]   But this is the really only app I take the time to really
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:47.340]   launch.
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:51.940]   As I just use my regular push notifications
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:54.140]   from my phone, which is great.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:57.300]   And then, yeah, I guess just voice search.
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:58.900]   I guess sometimes I say show me my steps
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:08:59.980]   or show me my heart rate.
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:02.140]   Who's the eye fix it, tear down of the--
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:03.580]   Oh, there's the way where there was a pin.
[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:04.100]   You're right.
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:04.900]   There's the pin.
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.140]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:08.860]   You need a little tool.
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:10.420]   See, I'm a watch guy.
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:14.140]   I have many watches, some very expensive watches.
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:16.500]   I love watches.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.460]   And so I don't even mind buying these watches.
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:24.300]   I think this is an interesting expression of what a watch is.
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:27.140]   I don't think we're anywhere near where they could be.
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:29.380]   And it may not even be the right form factor for whatever
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:32.740]   it is we're looking for.
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:35.060]   But of everything I've seen and used,
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:38.020]   the one that I would actually wear all the time
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:40.460]   is the Moto 360.
[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.980]   Because it's attractive.
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:47.100]   And I think Android Wear is pretty close.
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:50.180]   And in six months, it will be better.
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:52.460]   And there's a lot of evolution.
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:56.420]   We're talking the G1 of watches.
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:57.740]   Yeah, that was true.
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.220]   When you think of it that way, it's--
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.780]   Yeah.
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.300]   Android one phones are out.
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:03.380]   And we're going to get one.
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:04.020]   100 bucks.
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.620]   These are in India only right now.
[01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:07.980]   This is the cheap, cheap, cheap version.
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:09.580]   I'm eager to play with one too.
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:13.020]   The phone for the next 5 billion Google says.
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:15.020]   Cheap for Americans.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.060]   Yeah, actually 100 bucks is not cheap.
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:18.300]   Yeah, I mean that.
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:19.620]   So--
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:21.300]   Parentalize the rub.
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.780]   But this is a fantastic initiative.
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:24.740]   And I'm excited about it.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.860]   But I have to keep reminding myself that 100 bucks in India
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:29.420]   is a small fortune.
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:30.620]   Updates from Google.
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:34.580]   So you will be able to run the latest version of Android.
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:36.580]   There's enough power there.
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:39.940]   And they're subsidizing those download costs, aren't they?
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:43.380]   Yeah, up to 200 megs of new apps every month.
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:47.500]   That's a smart-- this is a probably a loss leader for Google
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:48.500]   to get into these markets.
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.180]   I think it's great.
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:54.420]   Seven local languages offline YouTube playback.
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:57.780]   I think that's kind of interesting.
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:01.340]   This is what Microsoft was going to do with its Lumia X
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.340]   series, which was also Android based.
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:05.820]   The idea being, look, you make something really cheap
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:10.900]   that people can dip a toe into your services water.
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:12.300]   So they get used to your services
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:14.180]   and start using them and eventually become full time
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:16.300]   customers.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:17.300]   So we're going to get one.
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:20.020]   I think Jason asked if we could get one on your show last night
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:21.060]   and probably get it--
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.540]   I'm going to get it responded.
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:24.620]   Somebody from India is going to send this one.
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:25.300]   Oh, great.
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:27.020]   Oh, that was from the call out on--
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:27.540]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:28.020]   Excellent.
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:28.020]   Awesome.
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:30.260]   Yeah, he said somebody responded.
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:30.980]   Right on.
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:31.980]   Yay.
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:36.220]   Whit magic.
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:38.300]   Yeah, well, that's how we got one plus ones.
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:41.900]   That's how we got the Firefox phone.
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:43.260]   He's got amazing audience.
[01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:43.900]   Great audience.
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:47.060]   And we really appreciate it because I think it's--
[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:50.500]   for a long time, I just really fled the notion
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.180]   of being the gadget guy.
[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:54.460]   I didn't want to be the gadget guy.
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:56.060]   I want to cover computing.
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:57.780]   But that's where computing is happening.
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:00.660]   This is the cutting edge of computing now is in your pocket.
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.060]   Easy.
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:04.780]   Now, laptops aren't even interesting anymore.
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:06.300]   The same old same old.
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.380]   Right, but legitimate to the show,
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:10.860]   it's happening because there is the cloud.
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:12.660]   Yes, the cloud is huge.
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:14.220]   That's where the computing is happening.
[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:15.300]   Absolutely.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.220]   Just a connection to that.
[01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:16.660]   That's it.
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:17.660]   Everything is in the cloud.
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:20.020]   That's where it is with all the good and bad
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:20.740]   that comes with that.
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:22.460]   The cloud was inevitable, I thought.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:23.700]   I've been thinking about it.
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:24.900]   And the cloud is inevitable.
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:27.660]   As soon as you have more than one device, you need the cloud.
[01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:28.300]   Exactly.
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:30.620]   The cloud has to exist.
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:32.780]   If there were not a cloud, we would have had to invent one.
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:39.460]   Black leather hint out of stock.
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:41.300]   Are you getting one?
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:42.540]   Wow.
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:46.260]   Bluetooth headset purchases during the twig.
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.100]   Wow.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:52.260]   I've been excited about the Moto X. You know,
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:53.980]   you can now wave your hand over it
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:56.820]   because it has infrared sensors.
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:58.300]   You always love that phone.
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:12:59.980]   I love that little Moto X.
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:00.820]   I thought that was great.
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:03.740]   And I think they've solved the two issues I had with it,
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:07.460]   which are screen size and resolution and camera.
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.220]   So I can't wait.
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:08.980]   That's great.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:12.060]   That's great.
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:13.860]   So for moving on, I have a--
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:16.380]   we are-- something that's actually kind of recent news
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:18.060]   for the last--
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.420]   let me look at my Moto X.
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:20.740]   Well, it comes back on.
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:24.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:26.660]   I said, Chad, I sent you an email, the document itself,
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.580]   where it's on slide share on Twitter.
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:30.340]   Robert Thompson, who is the president--
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:33.060]   Chief Executive of News Corp, which is a Murdoch company,
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:39.060]   just sent a-- or just released a scathingly cynical letter
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:42.060]   to the EU against Google.
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:45.500]   And if I can give you a few of the excerpts here.
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:48.060]   The company has evolved from a wonderfully feisty, creative,
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:51.260]   Silicon Valley startup to a vast, powerful, and often
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.540]   unaccountable bureaucracy, which is sometimes
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:55.980]   contemptuous of intellectual property
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:58.540]   and routinely configures its search results
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:02.300]   in a matter that is far from objective.
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.060]   This is News Corp talking.
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:04.580]   Wow.
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:05.580]   News Corp.
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:06.580]   Hey, let's just keep that much.
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:07.460]   New York friggin' posts.
[01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:10.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:16.980]   Where was the next one?
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:19.220]   Damn it, I look for all the quotes so I could read them out.
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:24.580]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:28.340]   While there are many honorable and thoroughly professional
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.780]   individuals working at Google, we
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.580]   have learned not to be naive about the company.
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:34.340]   The shining vision of Google's founders
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:37.620]   has been replaced by a cynical management, which offers
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:41.140]   advertisers impressively precise data about users and content
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:41.900]   usage.
[01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:44.060]   Yeah, you're jealous.
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:47.380]   But has been a platform for piracy.
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:47.580]   What?
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:49.740]   And the spread of malicious networks.
[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:50.100]   What?
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:53.420]   All the while driving more traffic and online advertising
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:55.140]   dollars to Google.
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:56.580]   This is insane.
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:57.700]   What is absolutely insane?
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:59.180]   Platform for piracy.
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:00.420]   What are they talking about?
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:04.020]   Because I've watched Murdoch, Murdoch, and his minions
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:06.220]   all scream that you can get his movies.
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:08.460]   Is it so this is Rupert talking, kind of?
[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:09.140]   Well, of course it is.
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:09.660]   Of course it is.
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:11.820]   It's through the mouthpiece of Robert Thompson.
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:15.860]   Um, uh, Google has been remarkably successful in its ability
[01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:18.060]   to monetize users, but has not shown the willingness,
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:20.660]   even though it clearly has the ability to respect
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:22.220]   fundamental property ways.
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:24.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:28.540]   Meanwhile, in recent months, Google
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:30.980]   has developed a quote, "certification process
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:32.780]   for Android-related products, which allows
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:35.260]   it to delay or deny content companies and other business
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:38.860]   to access to the mobile operating system."
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:39.860]   Huh?
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:40.860]   I don't think so.
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:42.140]   Yeah, what Apple does do?
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:43.140]   Apple's far worse.
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:44.500]   I think it's pretty straightforward if you
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.060]   want to make an app for Android.
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:49.620]   How long does that approval process take?
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:50.460]   Right.
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:52.060]   Virtually every newspaper in Europe
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:54.340]   is in the midst of upheaval, and some will surely not
[01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:57.020]   exist five years from now, in part because of their own flawed
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.260]   strategy and lack of leadership.
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.260]   Well, that's good.
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:01.540]   But also because the value of serious content
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:03.660]   has been commodified by Google.
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:04.980]   Not by Google, by the internet.
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:05.980]   You've got a few sites.
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:07.940]   Has been undermined by aggregation of content,
[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:11.620]   which transfers the front page to the Google homepage.
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.860]   Oh, please.
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.820]   Readers have been socialized into accepting
[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:18.300]   this egregious aggregation as the normal--
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:20.180]   No, it's what readers wanted.
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:21.180]   Right.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:22.180]   We didn't want to read your stupid front page.
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:24.220]   We wanted to go right to the article we cared about.
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:25.220]   Exactly.
[01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:26.220]   Google didn't make us do that.
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:27.220]   It just made it possible.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.220]   Exactly.
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:29.220]   The net made it possible.
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:30.220]   The web made it possible.
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:34.020]   It's called the internet.
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.820]   There will be no shortage of opinions.
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:37.700]   In fact, opinions will proliferate.
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:41.740]   But they will be based on ever flimsier foundations.
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:44.860]   The quality of discourse, mind you, this is the New York post.
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:46.780]   These are the people who started Fox News.
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:50.340]   The quality of discourse will inevitably deteriorate.
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:55.700]   And the intemperate trends we are already seen in much of your will proliferate.
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:58.460]   Proliferation of intemperate trends.
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:16:59.460]   Film 11.
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:05.140]   Of evil times is on it.
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:08.500]   So this comes from Robert Thompson, an otherwise smart guy I know.
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.500]   Is he an editor?
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.500]   What does he do there?
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.820]   He was the editor of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:17.780]   He's now Chief Executive of News Corp, which remember had to be split off from what is
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:24.660]   now 20th Century Fox because this is the company that hacked dead girls' phones.
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:26.980]   These are the schmucks who do this crap.
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:27.980]   And they dare come out.
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:31.560]   And of course, the BBC turns around and does a story immediately saying, "Oh, News Corp
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.560]   goes after Google."
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.660]   Do we remember people who these people are?
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:35.900]   This is deadly cynical.
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:40.380]   Also just like actual Springer in Germany, these are companies that pride themselves on
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:44.300]   being conservative, free market, anti-big government.
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:46.700]   What do they do when they get in trouble in their own business and have their own bad
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:47.700]   benefit?
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:48.700]   Yes, government to help them out.
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:53.140]   I'm getting lots of heartbeats on my watch right now.
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:54.140]   Can I?
[01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:56.140]   Our rate activity goal reads.
[01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:57.140]   Wow.
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:00.180]   That was a pretty great rant though, Jeff.
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:03.540]   I enjoyed that.
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:09.020]   I got this from Roberti and the BBC stories out.
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:13.100]   So it's been out for the last 20 minutes, but I haven't seen the full text anywhere else.
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.100]   This is the full text.
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:15.100]   I don't think you can get it.
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:19.220]   I have a link on my Twitter to a slide share that we can put them up as well.
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:23.540]   But I just find this is just, importantly, horribly cynical.
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:30.900]   The FT did a story this week about Europe going mad against tech companies, mainly Google.
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:32.420]   This trend is getting worse and worse.
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:38.500]   When I was at EFA last week, I gave a talk about techno-Euro panic and it's getting worse
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:40.460]   and worse and worse.
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:43.180]   And I think that Europe is going to get left behind because government is going to play
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:47.020]   with these big old legacy companies and who the hell is going to want to invest in Europe
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:48.820]   when this is what happens.
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:51.460]   So end of rant.
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:58.660]   So by the way, while I'm at it, one more, I lied about the internet.
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:04.740]   The FT reports that the German Justice Minister just said that Google should reveal its algorithms.
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:08.060]   Yeah, and coach Gavon, it's formula.
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.060]   Yeah.
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:10.460]   That's interesting.
[01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:13.340]   And what would you learn by reading Google's algorithms?
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:17.460]   Gina, why don't you recite what an algorithm looks like?
[01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:22.340]   Oh, it's really, it's just a couple of tweet-length explanations.
[01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:24.540]   I'm sure that Google's just holding it back.
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:27.340]   No trouble at all.
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:29.220]   Reveal your algorithms.
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:35.540]   They think that Google should be all inclusive and objective, even though they're not.
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:40.380]   And so the letter that I mentioned last week from German publishers about the same topic
[01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:44.660]   about the EU's, and they're trying to stop the EU's antitrust agreement with Google and
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:46.620]   the EU is already derailed.
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:51.060]   And now they're trying to stick more pins in the voodoo doll.
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:55.700]   But it's said that, well, Google dares to send readers, if you're looking for shoes,
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:56.700]   to their advertisers.
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:59.820]   Yes, they send it all kinds of other shoe places.
[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:02.500]   So I go to built, which is owned by actual Springer, and there's a little thing about
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:03.500]   the top of the page.
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:04.500]   It says shoes, shoe up.
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:05.820]   I go there and what do they do?
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:07.740]   They send to their own shoe advertisers.
[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:09.260]   They don't send anybody else.
[01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:12.260]   That's so funny.
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:13.260]   Anyway, so--
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:14.260]   No, good.
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:15.260]   Thank you.
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:16.260]   Great.
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:17.260]   Thank you.
[01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:18.260]   Thank you.
[01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:22.580]   What do you think, just completely tangent?
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:25.140]   What do you think Google's algorithm looks like, Gina?
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:27.860]   Is it a page, two pages, a hundred pages?
[01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:29.020]   Is it could it?
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:31.860]   I guess it's got to be encapsulated as code.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:39.340]   Oh, I mean, honestly, at the scale they're at right now, I mean, I can't even imagine
[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:40.340]   what it is.
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:46.340]   I mean, I think that it's a collection of signals and tweaks here and there.
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:50.660]   But I think it's more than just weights of measures, right?
[01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:51.660]   There's got to be--
[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:56.100]   I mean, it's got to be monstrous at this point in time, right?
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.980]   I mean, this is how many years are we into this now at this point?
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:01.300]   I mean, you're asking how technically is it represented?
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:03.300]   I mean, I think it's more than a config file.
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:05.300]   Let's just say that.
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:06.300]   Yeah.
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:09.740]   Well, I remember talking in the early days of Google when they were still young.
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:12.980]   I've mentioned this before, and they were still reaching out to journalists, and they
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:17.740]   had a little luncheon with Larry and Sergey and a few of us journalists to talk about
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:18.740]   it.
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:22.660]   And Larry said, well, you know, every day I go to the end of the search results, the
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:23.660]   bottom.
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:26.420]   I'm not sure I really understood what he was saying, so I'm probably translating this
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:27.420]   poorly.
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:29.940]   It was in English.
[01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:34.700]   And I look at the mainters, and I can tell from there where we're going wrong.
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:35.700]   So I tweak it.
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:39.860]   It sounded like he literally went in there and changed Bay drank daily.
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:46.500]   I would bet that they have made it in such a way that tweaking it is very easily, and
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:49.060]   I think that they probably tweak it daily, right?
[01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:54.580]   So it is encapsulated in some sort of way, and some sort of day to day before I object.
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:55.580]   Let's get Matt Cox on.
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:57.580]   I mean, I don't know if Matt can answer that.
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:58.580]   I bet that Matt probably has--
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.580]   He must know.
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:02.180]   I just saw him this weekend.
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:03.780]   I bet he would be able to tell us.
[01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:05.500]   I don't know that he would tell us, but--
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:06.500]   Is it in Python?
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:07.900]   Is it in C?
[01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:08.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:09.900]   Seriously.
[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:16.340]   I mean, it seems like it would be some sort of document that the software reads, right?
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:22.580]   Well, OK, so let's think about the raw material is the spider crawls, right?
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:28.540]   The index of everything, which is just somehow they're churning on every web page that they
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:32.900]   see, millions and millions a second, and they're making some representation of it,
[01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:34.860]   a hash or something, right?
[01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:35.860]   Right.
[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:37.540]   And then-- and it's probably fairly abstract.
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:39.300]   It includes keywords.
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:40.900]   I don't know what it includes.
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:43.900]   Knowledge graph objects, keywords, real-life relationships.
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:44.900]   It's pretty abstract.
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:45.900]   Yes.
[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:46.900]   Yeah.
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:47.900]   People, please--
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:48.900]   And it's probably a database, right?
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:51.100]   Yeah, it's represented as some sort of database.
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:52.100]   A database.
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:56.460]   A big-- I mean, it's hard to imagine the scale at which this operates.
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:57.980]   But so there's a database.
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:01.060]   And then something must be run over that database.
[01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:02.060]   I don't know.
[01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:03.140]   No, I don't know how it works.
[01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:04.620]   There's no way I can even imagine this.
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:10.380]   Because you do a query, you type in a something on Google.
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:11.380]   And then what?
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:14.900]   Then a machine goes and does this to that database?
[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:18.220]   Yeah, I mean, right.
[01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:22.260]   And it does it in the eighth of a second for billion people a minute.
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:24.820]   And it's personalized to you now.
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:29.140]   So it also is looking at your context.
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:32.740]   The signals that uses are not just the signals about content.
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:36.580]   Can we do a special with Mac cuts?
[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:37.620]   I mean, that'd be amazing.
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.820]   And didn't they just publish something recently that said
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:42.900]   that the amount of energy it takes to do one Google search
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:47.180]   is like the amount of time it takes your body to do like 10
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:48.100]   heartbeats.
[01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:50.620]   I don't know if I'm paraphrasing this incorrectly.
[01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:54.580]   But it's less than you would have thought, right?
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:56.540]   Like, this wasn't there that whole scare at some point,
[01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:59.620]   like, oh, all the CPU and energy that Google uses to run one
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:02.180]   search is equal to, like, they're killing the world.
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:03.340]   And actually, they're not.
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:07.180]   I mean, this stuff is super mature and very, very fast
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:11.300]   and super cached and just so responsive at this point.
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:16.740]   That's why this is at a scale that no one else is doing it.
[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:19.140]   No one other than the people who work on this at Google
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:20.540]   truly get how this is.
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:24.100]   I doubt any individual Google truly gets it.
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.300]   You're probably right.
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:26.820]   And it's even bigger than that.
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:28.940]   It's not that it waits for your query.
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:32.100]   It's giving you bad good results while you type it.
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:35.180]   It's one of your search on every keystroke.
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:36.180]   I'm having a bad--
[01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:37.300]   This is a dream.
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:38.300]   This isn't real.
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:41.020]   This is impossible.
[01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:43.540]   I'm in a vat somewhere connected to a bunch of tubes
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:46.740]   and I made this whole thing up.
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:49.540]   And we never even question it.
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:51.540]   It's impossible.
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:55.220]   Let's just rest assured that there's a lot of--
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:56.860]   there are a few people at Google, at least,
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:59.940]   laughing their rear ends off right now,
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:03.900]   listening to us trying to figure it out.
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:06.620]   I want to do a special, how Google works.
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:08.700]   You don't have to reveal any proprietary information.
[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:11.740]   I don't need to know the secret sauce.
[01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:12.660]   It's like a high level--
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:13.980]   Rod strokes.
[01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:15.580]   You could say how Alte Vista worked.
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:17.540]   I guess it's kind of like that only bigger.
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:23.420]   It's a scaling problem, but it's a scaling problem.
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:25.340]   It's hard to even imagine.
[01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:26.700]   Yeah, it is.
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:27.780]   It is.
[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:29.500]   There is a page.
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:33.940]   Somebody sent me how search works from algorithms
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:36.700]   to answers inside Google search.
[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:37.900]   Are you ready?
[01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:39.540]   Let's see how search works.
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:40.940]   When I was looking at this this morning.
[01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:46.180]   We take a giant pile of spaghetti, 60 trillion individual
[01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:47.820]   pages.
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:48.580]   Wunt.
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:49.740]   We saw them.
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:50.220]   OK.
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:52.420]   So far, this is kind of what we said.
[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:54.940]   Sort the pages by their content and other factors.
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:56.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:26:01.460]   Zenviki, track of it in an index, the index is 100 million
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.180]   gigabytes large.
[01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:04.540]   100 million gigabytes.
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:05.660]   That is unbelievable.
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.380]   That's just the index.
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:09.060]   That's unbelievable.
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:14.140]   And it's increasing every moment now.
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:16.140]   Because it has to be that fast, right?
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:17.140]   We are.
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:18.900]   This is like--
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:21.420]   This is where the spaghetti is hidden.
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:24.460]   We write programs and formulas to deliver the best results
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:25.500]   possible.
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:28.300]   They're all in black bodies.
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:32.060]   As you search, boop, boop, boop, algorithm,
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:33.220]   it's all about algorithms.
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:35.980]   Get to work looking for clues to better understand
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:38.660]   what you mean, spelling, autocomplete query,
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:42.420]   understanding Google Instant Search Method synonyms.
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:44.420]   Based on the clues, we pull relevant documents
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:45.580]   from the index.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:45.780]   Right.
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:48.580]   So the algo is exactly-- is how you pull things
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:49.420]   from the index.
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:49.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:50.380]   Right?
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:51.180]   That's what we're talking about.
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:53.260]   And they do talk a little bit about these modules
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:55.140]   that it might be, right?
[01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:56.300]   There's search methods.
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:57.340]   There's autocomplete.
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:27:00.220]   There's spelling.
[01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:00.820]   It even fits.
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:03.580]   It even spells better than I do.
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:06.580]   Then it processes site.
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:09.940]   We rank the results based on site and page quality,
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:12.060]   using over 200 factors.
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.420]   Freshness.
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:13.920]   Right.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.260]   So it's choosing and then ranking.
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:15.740]   Context.
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:17.740]   Context.
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:19.340]   Well, I mean, we knew this.
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:21.780]   This isn't very broad strokes.
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:26.260]   It's this algorithm part that I'm very interested in.
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:29.660]   You know, I understand it had to make a big database.
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:32.340]   And then it has to very rapidly search that database.
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:34.700]   But how does it know?
[01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:35.580]   Wow.
[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:36.100]   Fascinating.
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:38.100]   This is a nice page, though, I have to say.
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:38.900]   Yeah.
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:40.140]   So they've been asked this question.
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:42.140]   Yeah.
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:42.700]   Yeah.
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:43.940]   Algorithms.
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:45.540]   It's all about algorithms.
[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:49.180]   You want the answer, not trillions of web pages.
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:50.740]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:52.460]   The web should be objective.
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:54.380]   Everything should be equal.
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:56.900]   There should be no preference given to anything.
[01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:59.460]   That's how the web is supposed to work.
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:01.940]   That's what they say in Europe.
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:07.140]   I suppose you could take a college class in this stuff.
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:09.260]   They're mean, you know, you learn how to write a compiler.
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:12.140]   You probably should learn how to write a search engine.
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:13.540]   Nope.
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:14.220]   All right.
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:17.860]   Maybe it's just my ignorance, but I find it fascinating.
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:18.780]   Let's take a break.
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:21.100]   Get our picks of the week or number of the week.
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:23.700]   Have you got a tip yet?
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:25.300]   I'll do this head slowly.
[01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.300]   All right.
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:32.580]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.
[01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:33.780]   How do they do Squarespace?
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:35.140]   Here's the best web hosting ever.
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:38.660]   Never goes down with the greatest software ever.
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:42.660]   Tightly integrated so that you get a website like no other.
[01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:46.300]   And I know if you've got a store or you're an artist
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:48.380]   or a photographer, maybe just a blogger.
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:50.060]   And you want to have a website.
[01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:52.940]   You want it to be responsive, fast, easy to use.
[01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:55.380]   You want information about your users' metrics.
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:58.060]   Social media follows unique visitors.
[01:28:58.060 --> 01:28:59.900]   You want your code to look good.
[01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:00.860]   You want your site to look good.
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:02.940]   But you don't want to have to, in most cases,
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:04.420]   you don't have to spend a lot of energy thinking
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:06.420]   about the actual technology.
[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:07.500]   You just want to do it.
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:08.940]   Now, if you're a developer, you might
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:09.980]   want to get into the hood.
[01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:10.900]   Squarespace lets you do that, too.
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:12.940]   They've got a great developer platform.
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:18.380]   Squarespace has just these amazing engineers who
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:22.020]   are working constantly to create the best software, the best
[01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:23.940]   hosting.
[01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:25.580]   And it's so easy to use.
[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:27.460]   They have great help right from their office.
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:28.940]   They don't outsource it.
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:31.660]   24/7 email and chat support.
[01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:33.860]   A customer helps site with house-self-up articles
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:35.580]   and video workshops.
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:37.340]   They're just always adding features
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:39.740]   like they just put that logo design tool online, which
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.700]   is cool, lets you do a simple logo.
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:44.300]   If you're not just an individual, not a big company,
[01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:46.860]   and all of this $8 a month, plus you
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:50.300]   get a free domain name when you register for a year.
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:52.140]   Even the $8 a month, simple website
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:53.860]   has e-commerce built into it.
[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:57.220]   They all look good on a mobile, any size screen.
[01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:57.820]   Here's what you do.
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:29:59.580]   You could start this for free.
[01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:01.060]   You don't need to use our offer code or anything.
[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:02.540]   Just visit squarespace.com.
[01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:03.660]   Click the Get Started button.
[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:04.900]   Pick a template.
[01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:06.300]   Import your data if you want.
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:09.020]   So you have a big site right away.
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:12.100]   It has importance for all the major blog platform.
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:13.500]   And then play with it and change it.
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.900]   And you change the template, add social media stuff,
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:18.500]   add the plugins, all the things that it does.
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:19.580]   Customize it a little hard.
[01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.220]   You've got two weeks to play with it.
[01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:22.540]   And get a sense of what it'll do.
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:25.580]   If you decide to buy $8 a month, the starting point,
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:29.100]   if you want fully commerce, it goes up $24 a month.
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:30.540]   And that includes a lot of things
[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:32.540]   like shipping calculations and all sorts
[01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:35.020]   of really helpful tools.
[01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:37.540]   Now, all I ask is if you decide to sign up for Squarespace
[01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:39.940]   after your free two-week trial, you use our offer code.

[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:54.500]   A better web awaits.
[01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.980]   It all starts with your new Squarespace website.
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:57.500]   Really?
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:02.980]   I mean, I'm boggled by what Squarespace does.
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:05.420]   Very impressive stuff.
[01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:07.380]   Use the offer code Twig.
[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:09.580]   Time for the back of the book, as we call it.
[01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:11.740]   Gina Trippani has a tip of the week.
[01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:13.100]   Oh, no, you call that on Windows weekly.
[01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.500]   You've never called it that here.
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:15.660]   But it is the back of the book.
[01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:16.140]   You know when those--
[01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:16.700]   Well, it is.
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:18.700]   Remember when they were computer magazines?
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:20.100]   Remember those?
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.140]   One just died left with me.
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:22.620]   Back world.
[01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:24.700]   And we have many friends there.
[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.660]   Jason Stellitz, at longtime editor in chief,
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:29.700]   I think he was there 17 years.
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.500]   He saw the running on the wall.
[01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:32.420]   He had been planning to leave.
[01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:33.940]   But a lot of people out there--
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:35.500]   you had to write on the wall because there was no paper
[01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:36.820]   to write it anymore.
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:37.380]   Yeah.
[01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:38.500]   When he needs paper--
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:41.020]   The New York Times blamed me.
[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:43.260]   They said that Mac World Magazine went out of business
[01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:47.380]   because of sites like CNET and Twit.
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:49.940]   Jesus, you fool bastard, you.
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:52.260]   Well, I know what they're saying,
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:54.180]   which is how can a monthly magazine keep up
[01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:56.860]   with something that is covering the story 24/7?
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:58.500]   You can't.
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:01.980]   Jason launched his new thing, sixcolors.com.
[01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:03.060]   Oh, good.
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:04.900]   Yes, sixcolors.com.
[01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:06.540]   He spelled it out.
[01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:07.620]   He was ready.
[01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:08.940]   Oh, no, he knew.
[01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:10.660]   Yeah, he knew.
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:13.100]   But pretty great that he was able to--
[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:14.140]   He was the best.
[01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:17.140]   And we're going to have a lot more of Jason on this show.
[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:19.540]   I got to tell you.
[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:21.500]   A lot of the people who were there
[01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.540]   have found homes already in other spots.
[01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:26.220]   And they'll be hearing from them a lot
[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:28.580]   because this is part of his incomparable number.
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:28.980]   You're trusted.
[01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:29.860]   They know their stuff.
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:30.580]   They've been out there.
[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:31.220]   They have brought in.
[01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:32.700]   They're the best people.
[01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:35.780]   I've argued that media companies were stupid
[01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:38.660]   when journalism companies, when they did start
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:40.740]   laying off people, what they should have done is said,
[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:41.220]   you know what?
[01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:43.620]   Instead of severance, here's an investment
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:45.580]   in you starting your new company.
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:48.740]   And we will send you traffic, and we will sell ads for you.
[01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:50.940]   And we will have our right to use your content.
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:52.820]   And you're not on staff anymore,
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.820]   but you can build your own equity and your own value.
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:55.660]   And we can help you do that.
[01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:56.140]   I think that's actually--
[01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:58.100]   By the way, we're going to reduce our cost
[01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:00.180]   and give our readers the same value we always gave them
[01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:02.500]   and probably be able to increase the coverage we have.
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:03.500]   That's brilliant.
[01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:03.980]   No.
[01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:04.700]   That's not the way we think.
[01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:04.900]   Yeah.
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:06.900]   But I think that's what we're going to end up having
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:07.780]   to do at some point, right?
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:08.860]   Interesting.
[01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:09.580]   Really?
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:13.340]   Well, because we live in a world where the idea of Fed--
[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:16.260]   so it's kind of-- OK, so it's a little bit like the web where--
[01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:21.860]   it's kind of the old media notion
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:25.820]   that you have a company that has a bunch of people
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:29.700]   who work at that company creating editorial.
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:31.340]   What everybody wants their own thing now.
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:31.900]   It's what I did.
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:32.780]   I created my own thing.
[01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:35.380]   And so while what I'm building looks
[01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:36.900]   feels like an old school media empire,
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:38.660]   it's not going to-- in the long run, makes sense.
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:40.420]   Chad doesn't want to stay here forever.
[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:42.140]   He wants to, ideally, anybody--
[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:43.660]   But Chad, no, don't leave.
[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:46.060]   Anybody who works here wants to have his own thing.
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:48.580]   I'm not putting words in your mouth, Chad, but--
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:49.900]   employee XYZ.
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:50.740]   Yeah, you're a palter.
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:51.900]   Ultimately, he has his own thing.
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:53.740]   So somehow, we're going to have to figure that out,
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:57.820]   because I don't want to be a Mac world.
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:33:58.300]   Right.
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:33:59.460]   I mean, the way I put it is--
[01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:00.660]   Yeah, I mean, it's just in our industry
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:02.660]   and your own thing is so sort of heroic-sized.
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:03.460]   You know what I mean?
[01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:04.380]   I actually-- I think it's great for people
[01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:05.660]   to start their own companies.
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:07.500]   I just don't-- I don't think it's totally for everyone,
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.620]   but there is a sort of-- in our industry,
[01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:12.180]   there is a sort of-- there is a push for that.
[01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:12.820]   You know what I mean?
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:14.100]   There's an expectation.
[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:14.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:16.260]   And I think that's-- I don't think it's a bad thing.
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:18.420]   Well, in a way, that's what we do with you and Gina.
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:21.260]   I mean, you and Jeff, you guys are have your own thing.
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:22.940]   We're just a part-- one thing that you
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:25.500]   do in your own thing.
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:26.020]   Yeah.
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:29.940]   So that's how we solve that with contributors.
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:32.580]   One of the ways we've solved that.
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:34.020]   No, you're a platform.
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:38.180]   And I think that what I argue is that vertical corporations
[01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:39.940]   and industries get replaced by ecosystems.
[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:42.540]   And ecosystems are made up of three layers-- platforms,
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:44.420]   entrepreneurial effort, and then networks
[01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:45.540]   to bring them to critical mass.
[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:46.500]   Well, we're a platform then.
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:47.940]   I'll choose platform.
[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:50.460]   You're a platform for 600 and that's--
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:53.220]   Once-- once-- you know, if I make my own-- you know,
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.380]   my own show and Chad makes his own show
[01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:56.900]   and Gina makes five shows because she's
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:59.020]   got so much more energy than the rest of us.
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:01.380]   And they appear on the network.
[01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:02.340]   And so what do you do?
[01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:04.260]   As a network, you can bring traffic to them.
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:05.420]   You can sell ads for them.
[01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:06.420]   Right.
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:09.620]   You're both on the platform layer
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:11.740]   and on the network layer, I think.
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:13.740]   I need to consult with you, Jeff, because that's
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:15.260]   what we're trying to figure out right now.
[01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:16.700]   I would love to talk about that.
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:17.820]   I think that is the model.
[01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:22.540]   And my work in New Jersey and what we now call the New Jersey
[01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:28.100]   model is we have 50 sites large, gigantic, and tiny,
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:32.020]   profit and not-for-profit, all kinds of different focuses.
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:36.620]   And they now share content with embeddable content.
[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:37.420]   And they work together.
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:39.340]   And I'm about to try to get some ad networks together.
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:41.980]   And that's where I think media go.
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:44.780]   I think that the ecosystem model--
[01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:47.380]   I'll be writing about that in my new, incredibly boring,
[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:49.180]   but I had to do it for my work.
[01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:50.820]   I'm a metastasized white paper called
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:52.940]   "These very gifts" out November 6th.
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:54.700]   Publish your Paris, Jeff.
[01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:56.620]   On the web, because when I attack paywall, people say,
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:59.060]   "Yeah, you sell it, no, put it free on the web, too."
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:35:59.780]   Get on media.
[01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:01.380]   And people will say, "Oh, you've had a lot of media,
[01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:03.220]   and I'll put it somewhere else, too."
[01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:05.100]   I'll deal with both the places.
[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:08.700]   But anyway, we'll talk.
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:09.820]   What was your-- I'm sorry.
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:11.420]   Gina's tip of the week.
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:12.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:14.220]   And just to be clear, I really don't have that much energy.
[01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:14.700]   But thank you.
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:15.700]   Thank you, Dr. Mom.
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:17.220]   That's a good idea.
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:18.260]   She's a mother now.
[01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:19.820]   She's like the rest of us, yeah.
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:21.860]   I was-- I was dead asleep by 8 o'clock.
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:22.420]   Oh, yeah, right.
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:23.380]   Oh, that feels good, though.
[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:23.700]   Doesn't it?
[01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:25.700]   I put the baby down, and then I put myself down.
[01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:27.220]   That's the best thing in the world could have been to date.
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:27.740]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:29.340]   You just got to have that night, right?
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:30.940]   And the next day, I felt like superwoman.
[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:31.380]   Yep.
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:34.220]   That only happens every couple months, though.
[01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:36.580]   So all right, so my tip this week is--
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:37.260]   this is pretty cool.
[01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:40.300]   A new Chrome for Android search feature.
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:41.500]   Answers questions as you type.
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.620]   This kind of dovetails nicely from our discussion
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:46.780]   about how searches work and how fast they are.
[01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:49.620]   So this is in the beta build of Chrome for Android.
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:50.420]   And it's a flag.
[01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:52.340]   I didn't even realize that Chrome for Android, of course,
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:53.940]   has that flags.
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:57.020]   You do the Chrome colon slash slash flags.
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:37:01.620]   And you can enable-- it's called answers on suggest.
[01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:02.500]   Answers in suggest.
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:05.220]   And when you do, as you start to type
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:10.020]   a query in Chrome for Android, it answers the questions.
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:12.060]   So here in this screen, you see some of this typing,
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:13.580]   what year did Amazon start?
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:17.340]   And it's actually showing the answer July 5, 1994.
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:21.580]   That makes me feel old right there in the--
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:23.060]   you know, suggest.
[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:24.580]   That's kind of what you want on mobile, though.
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:27.180]   You don't want to type any more than you absolutely have to.
[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:28.060]   And you absolutely have to.
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:28.660]   That's right.
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:29.540]   That's right.
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:30.580]   So yeah, pretty neat.
[01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:31.620]   This is an experimental feature.
[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:32.380]   You have to turn it on.
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:33.500]   It's disabled by default.
[01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:36.260]   It's only in Chrome beta for Android.
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:37.220]   But pretty neat.
[01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:37.940]   You want to try it out.
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:40.300]   Why not in the desktop, too?
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:41.580]   Yeah, it should be in the desktop, right?
[01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:44.060]   It seems like this is-- we're going to be all seeing this.
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:45.580]   This stable channel someday.
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:46.340]   I bet.
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:47.620]   I like it.
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:49.260]   Yeah.
[01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:51.260]   Jeff, we do you have a number?
[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:52.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:53.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:54.260]   I had a few.
[01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:56.260]   Well, I'm getting numbers.
[01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:57.980]   This is actually last week's story we didn't talk about.
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:37:59.060]   But I'm so amused by it.
[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:00.020]   I thought I'd bring it up this week,
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:02.180]   because I didn't know how long the guy stayed in there.
[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:07.660]   But a Google worker lived in a camper on campus for 54 weeks.
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:08.860]   I love this story.
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:09.860]   I think it's the greatest thing.
[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:10.980]   Because he can get food.
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:12.700]   He gets showers.
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:13.260]   Gets everything he can--
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:14.660]   Why do you even buy every camper?
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:17.580]   Couldn't he sleep under his desk?
[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:19.620]   No, he lived in a camper.
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:21.580]   But then another guy-- this would be amateur.
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:24.020]   Last week, but it's rewritten by Fox News.
[01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:25.940]   Fox News, the people who were going after Google
[01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:27.100]   writing about Google, huh?
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:28.620]   And so the funny thing about the camper,
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:30.740]   they must have known he was there.
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:31.580]   But again, they did.
[01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:34.260]   The guards came by kind of once and then said, I don't care.
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:34.900]   And they said, OK.
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:35.700]   And they were--
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:36.460]   I don't care.
[01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:39.620]   There's another guy who lived there for two to three years
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:41.340]   said he had a resource for staff for Google.
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:44.780]   And the point-- I think he divorced or something like that.
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:46.820]   And so at the end of those two to three years,
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:47.780]   was able to buy a house.
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:50.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:52.620]   I saved so much, I bought a house.
[01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:55.300]   But it's also a commentary on the ridiculous cost of living
[01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:56.340]   in that part of the world.
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:58.020]   It's just-- it's just terrible.
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:00.300]   I was talking to somebody who was going to move to California,
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:01.780]   and I said, go to Petaluma.
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:02.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:03.300]   What are you going to do?
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:05.660]   Although it's kind of expensive even here now.
[01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:07.940]   I think we speculated once--
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:08.900]   I still like this idea.
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:11.740]   I imagine because it's that Google ought to build a Google
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:14.180]   dorm.
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:15.860]   Yeah.
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:18.060]   Seems like the aughts.
[01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:20.180]   Can you imagine what that would be like?
[01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:22.220]   Is it Google dorm?
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:24.620]   Not as bad as a Facebook.
[01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:27.940]   How would you deal with human resources?
[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:28.540]   What do you mean?
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:29.040]   I don't know.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:29.540]   Google dorms?
[01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:31.340]   It just seems like there's too many parties there.
[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:32.940]   Like the sex, is that what you're saying?
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:34.700]   They're basically--
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:40.900]   you will be mingling people in unusual ways.
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:41.740]   Yeah.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:45.740]   I think that's what happens in college.
[01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:50.300]   And we pay money for that.
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:50.860]   Yep.
[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:52.260]   Yep.
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:55.580]   I want to talk about Road Riot.
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:58.380]   This is a new app.
[01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:01.380]   It's a free app, but I think it's in-game purchase.
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:07.020]   Combat Racing on your Android by a company called Tango.
[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:10.820]   You know, it reminds me a lot of Spy Hunter.
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:11.820]   Did you ever play that?
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:16.180]   Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, I can upgrade my main weapon.
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:17.380]   Thank you.
[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:18.740]   By the way, I'm sorry about that.
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:23.100]   I don't like to see scandily clad young women in any of the games I play,
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:25.940]   but I didn't choose this for that.
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:28.380]   I chose it because I can play.
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:29.260]   It's kind of like Spy Hunter.
[01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:30.860]   Remember Spy Hunter?
[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:31.660]   And you--
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:32.660]   Yeah?
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:33.660]   All right.
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:36.460]   You sound underwhelmed.
[01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:37.860]   No, I love driving games.
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:39.140]   It's not exactly driving game.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:42.340]   I don't like to drive because I drive enough in real life.
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:43.540]   Right, but it's like--
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:46.700]   This is a ride behind people when you blow them up game.
[01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:47.980]   The one with the caterpillar.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:48.980]   Yeah.
[01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:54.980]   I guess Google now decided I shouldn't be gaming right now.
[01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:55.580]   Just popped up.
[01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:57.060]   I'm gonna go home and have the show.
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:58.780]   I guess we're going to just end that one right there.
[01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:03.460]   It's free in-app purchases, lots of fun, action shooter.
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:05.620]   I'll tell you why I like it is--
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:10.380]   I'm always looking for games that controls fit the touch
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:12.460]   interface, and there's so few of them.
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:13.260]   This one is easy.
[01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:16.100]   You're sliding your finger.
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:18.060]   So everyone in the chat room is saying--
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:19.860]   this is-- you know, a chat room, I think this would be--
[01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:21.260]   give me unfair advantage in the arena.
[01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:23.580]   So I'm going to wait.
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:26.340]   They're telling me I should promote my app that I had in the arena
[01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:26.780]   last night.
[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:27.820]   Oh.
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:28.780]   But I don't think that's fair.
[01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:29.140]   Is it a game?
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:30.060]   It's like a co-host.
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:34.020]   It is a speed racing-- is a game similar to that?
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:35.140]   Really?
[01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:35.980]   Yes.
[01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:36.940]   Oh, I should--
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:38.540]   Oh, I feel bad.
[01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:40.660]   No, no, no, don't feel bad.
[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:42.180]   It's very similar.
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:43.780]   No, I'm not going to do it, because I don't want to--
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:44.780]   No, she's not going to do it.
[01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:46.100]   I don't want to use my unfairly used my platform
[01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:46.900]   to get more votes.
[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:49.180]   I'll have to watch all about Android.
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:50.820]   Yeah, you should watch all about Android,
[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:54.340]   and you should vote on the current arena that's going on,
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:56.340]   because I think I have a really good shot.
[01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:57.300]   Let's just say that.
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:41:58.540]   It's fun, isn't it?
[01:41:58.540 --> 01:41:59.540]   Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:00.140]   I love the arena.
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:01.500]   I love those kinds of games.
[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:03.340]   It's a similar game where you start driving down the street
[01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:04.860]   and shooting and fucking coins.
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:05.860]   Yeah.
[01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:08.340]   It's a game you could play for five seconds or five minutes,
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:10.580]   and that's what you want on a mobile device, something
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:12.060]   you just kind of--
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:13.780]   it's a throwaway thing.
[01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:16.900]   Hey, I hope you've enjoyed this edition of This Week in Google.
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:18.060]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:19.980]   He's from the City University of New York
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:23.100]   where he teaches journalism to some very lucky young people.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:26.900]   You can also read his stuff at buzzmachine.com on Medium
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:29.220]   and his books and his new white paper do soon,
[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:31.620]   Geeks Bearing Gifts.
[01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:34.620]   Where will we get that?
[01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:38.460]   The wonderful guys at OR Press will have ways to get up online.
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:40.460]   We're publishing it in the CUNY journalism press.
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:41.460]   I'm not even telling you.
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:43.900]   It's for journal walks, but it's about new relationships,
[01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:45.300]   new forms, and new models for news.
[01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:48.300]   I'll plug it again when it's out.
[01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:50.820]   And I'll put it all up for free on Medium as well.
[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:51.820]   All right.
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:52.820]   All right.
[01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:59.260]   And Gina Trappani, who is a great host on--
[01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:01.940]   you didn't mention that your road game had kitties in it.
[01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:03.780]   There's-- oh, there's kittens.
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:07.020]   There's kittens, cars, and guns.
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:07.520]   OK?
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:08.020]   And some more.
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:08.860]   Oh, never-great.
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:09.380]   I don't swear.
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:10.020]   No, that's it.
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:10.740]   I put it out there.
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:11.500]   See, everybody's chatting.
[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:13.020]   I think some spinelos they said I should have--
[01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:14.260]   I didn't say the name.
[01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:15.100]   We didn't say the name.
[01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:15.300]   I didn't say the name.
[01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:17.540]   I'm not going to say the name, but there are kittens.
[01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:19.420]   That's all I'm going to say.
[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:22.220]   You can watch her every Tuesday, 5 PM Pacific, 8 PM Eastern,
[01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:22.900]   all about Andrew.
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:24.460]   Great show if you're an Android user.
[01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:27.620]   You must watch with Jason Hall, Ron Richards, and Gina Trappani.

[01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:37.340]   in Google and her business and her paid job is ThinkUp.com,
[01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:40.060]   where you can analytics for humans,

[01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:47.580]   by going to ThinkUp.com.
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:48.540]   Yes, thank you.
[01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:51.580]   And I spoke at XOXO this weekend at my talk.
[01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:52.080]   You did?
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:52.580]   I did.
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:53.080]   I did.
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:54.140]   And the talk is going to go on YouTube.
[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:56.260]   It's not up yet when it is up.
[01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:58.900]   Well, certainly let you know.
[01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:00.140]   It was very personal talk.
[01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:03.060]   It was actually-- it was about 9/11 and about my career
[01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:05.300]   and about being afraid to die.
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:06.300]   It was very, very personal.
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:08.140]   And I really was nervous about it.
[01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:09.660]   And I think it went really well.
[01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:11.580]   But it was fit that audience.
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:12.740]   That's a great, great event.
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:13.220]   That's awesome.
[01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:14.020]   I had a recommend.
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:16.180]   So I'll let you know when that's up on YouTube.
