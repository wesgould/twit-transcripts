[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.520]   and everything else under the sun.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.240]   Hello, Stacy again, bathroom.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.360]   Stacy on IOT.com, gigastacey on the Twitter.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.800]   Hello.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.600]   Hello.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.280]   Good to see you.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.840]   I'm so happy to be here today.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.760]   You probably were thrilled to see the Matter logo on the WWDC keynote.

[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.480]   I did a panel yesterday with all kinds of crazy people.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.640]   So we can talk about that.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.160]   Oh, good.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.960]   Yeah, there's lots of stuff to talk about
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.240]   with the Apple support for HomeKit and so forth.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.520]   But before we do that, let's say hello to Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.960]   You know what he is?
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.400]   He is the Leonard Towne Professor for journalistic innovation
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.520]   at the--
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.040]   [MUSIC - JEFF JARVIS, "GRADUKE"]
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040]   [MUSIC - JEFF JARVIS, "GRADUKE"]
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.040]   [MUSIC - JEFF JARVIS, "GRADUKE"]
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.040]   [MUSIC - JEFF JARVIS, "GRADUKE"]
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.880]   [MUSIC - JEFF JARVIS, "GRADUKE"]
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.640]   journalism at the City University of New York. He's also
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.960]   member of- after last week Craig said that indeed, when you're
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.960]   in New York, we can consolidate him. Oh, yummy, yummy, that'll be
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.220]   fun, that'll be fun. Also, we should, we should maybe we could
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.040]   even maybe do a show from Craig's house volunteering that I
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.500]   don't know but but he might enjoy that. I don't know that might
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.580]   be something Craig kitchen cool. Yeah, make it so does he
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.080]   have a nice kitchen, a particular nice kitchen? Oh, yeah,
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.300]   yeah. We say that as if oh, yeah, of course he does. Well, what
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.540]   do you expect? He's gonna have a crappy kitchen? Oh, yeah, I
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.040]   don't know. Might. Might. Might. He sounded Craigslist. I
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.680]   don't know what you find on Craigslist. I think it's
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.220]   unchanged since the icebox. Yeah. Craig Newmark doesn't eat
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.820]   in much. If I heard Craig Newmark, I'd be living at Cirque and
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.380]   well, Eileen Newmark has has tastes. Ah, oh, there we go.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.680]   There is a lady of the house. Well, there you go. And then
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.400]   there's a pair of hands on photography fame to a TV slash
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.120]   hop hop. And you don't want to be on this show. It's good to see
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.280]   you. I'm wonderful. So I you this morning, sneaking out of the
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.720]   building. It's nice. We're slowly getting people to come in,
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.760]   come back. I'm very happy about that. Had a good floss
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.040]   weekly this morning. Who was on this? And I don't mean floss in
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.360]   my teeth talking about our show. Floss weekly. Who was on
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.720]   that is the first place my brain goes. Well, that's kind of the
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.640]   pun. That's why I named it floss weekly. I thought, Oh, get
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.240]   it. So now this was a guestless show. So it was just the three
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.240]   news. Just the news. Quite a spirited conversation between
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.280]   the three of them. Aaron Newcomb, who's wonderful. Sean Powers,
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.560]   Doc Serals, talking about lots of stuff, including higher
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.240]   education and an arm. An arm. An arm. Which is the name of the
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.080]   encrypted messenger program that was actually being run as a as
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.320]   a honeypot by the FBI and the Australian federal police. And
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.920]   they busted a lot of people, although get ready, because it's
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.840]   been such a success. That the federal government in Australia
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.000]   is already saying, Hey, this really worked well, we should
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.120]   really have a backdoor into all encrypted.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.960]   Oh, it was Australia for you. It was only a matter of time. I
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.320]   expect the same things from the from the FBI. So it's a it's a
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.960]   clever idea. And it basically plays on the idea that crooks are
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.880]   dumb. I remember a service agent told me that some years ago,
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.040]   we're talking about, you know, how do you how do you get the
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.280]   passwords? How do you get them to give you the passwords? And
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.480]   he says, me and most of these guys just give it to you.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.080]   They don't you know, it's you hear about that. It's not
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.840]   crazy. You hear at the handful of cases where people are hold
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.040]   ads and stuff and they go to jail for years, because they're
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.960]   not cooperating or whatever. You know, most of the time, they
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.880]   just say, yeah, it's yeah, the monkey 123 go ahead to have
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.720]   have added. Wow. Yeah. Law enforcement officials said users
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   had flocked to the app. After other encrypted messaging
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.320]   services like encroach at which was widely used by all kinds of
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.700]   criminals. In fact, that's the one we showed you with the
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.840]   stilton cheese and the fingerprints. Oh, yeah, that was
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.160]   shut down by authorities and on comes pre installed on phones.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.960]   This is why it worked. With you know, phones you buy in the
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.880]   black market, you know, kind of burner phones. There were what's
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.440]   interesting is the FBI was charging for this six months
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.920]   contracts up to $2,000. Lots of money. Maybe that made people
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.120]   feel better. Like honest, hey, Joey, we're going to use this
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.320]   encrypted app. It's got to be good. It costs $4,000 a year.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:11.280]   There were 12,000 anomaly enabled devices. In fact, the way
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.680]   you got it, you had to have an existing user invite you in
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.080]   very smart, right? Oh, this is so I love it that brought
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.720]   widens the net network effects for law enforcement. Joey
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.320]   Cannonball's graph at all. He said it's good. So I'm I'm in I
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.080]   got it. There was cooked up in 2018 by US officials and
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.640]   Australian officials. They're weird. They actually were
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:38.440]   encrypted. But there was a master key a backdoor. So that the
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.680]   FBI in Australia, what made them just because of the
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.960]   indictments they had the jig was up on the app and they keep
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.560]   you in it. I guess. Well, it's funny because they just arrested
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.800]   everybody in a big bunch. Well, 800 people. Why is this
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.880]   entrapment? It's not entrapment because they didn't know I
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.920]   said why it's not because they okay why because they didn't
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.840]   in solicit anything. They just gave them a Oh, okay. So
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.400]   entrapment. Okay, I got you. It wasn't it's the cops going to
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:13.880]   him saying I left $1,000 in my sector. If you want to steal
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.080]   it, it was here. You know, they didn't even say you know, no,
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.360]   I don't think it's entrapment in any way. It's just it wasn't
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.160]   free either. Okay, right. It's like you open a bar and and
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.520]   riffraff come in and you listen to them. Welcome riffraff.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:35.800]   The place for riffraff. Anon was available at first in a
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.240]   limited number of countries eventually though in 90
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.120]   countries, most users in Germany where they're very right,
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:47.360]   Jeff, very focused on shuts. Yeah, crazed crazed the
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.880]   Netherlands, Spain, Australia and Serbia, an international
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:58.560]   coalition all at once arrested 800 people, everything from
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.680]   triad the triads in Asia to South American drug cartels in one
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.320]   of the largest operations operation iron side in Australia.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.640]   224 people were arrested on 525 charges they shut down six
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:18.000]   clandestine drug labs acted on 21 threats to kill, including one
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.480]   that saved a family of five. So it and look at that marijuana.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.480]   I'm so glad they're still arresting people for for smoking
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.720]   the wacky weed. You know, you must you really it's got to feel
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.360]   bad if you get busted for pot in New Zealand. I was like, but
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.200]   wait, it's legal in the US.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.960]   Officials from Europe, all the European police agencies said
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.560]   eight tons of cocaine were SCC's 22 tons of cannabis and
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.120]   cannabis resins, two tons of amphetamine and methamphetamine,
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.720]   six tons. You get 18 tons. What do you get? Synthetic drug
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:05.200]   precursors and firearms to 55 luxury vehicles and 48 million
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.040]   worldwide currencies.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.000]   So wow, they got a McLaren sports car, handguns rifles with
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.040]   scopes, all sorts of stuff. So
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:22.520]   all that is in the bad boy handbook. Yes, bad boys, bad
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.440]   boys don't use a nom.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:29.920]   Apparently, what the biggest catch was a guy who's been on
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.440]   the lamb for 10 years, suspected of being a high level drug
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.400]   trafficker who controls the flow of imports from Turkey, Hakan
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.960]   Ayik. He has not been arrested, but they were able to do
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.400]   piment to becoming an early adopter of the app and promoting
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.800]   it to others in his network.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:54.000]   Hakan says this is the greatest. He essentially set up his own
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.320]   colleagues. By the way, even though they haven't arrested him
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.960]   yet, he's living a lavish lifestyle in Istanbul where and
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.840]   he got plastic surgery so they can't recognize him. But they're
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.840]   telling him, you know, all those people you told you should use
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.600]   an arm, they're coming for you. So they're urging him turn
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:22.040]   yourself in before you could become a target. So that
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.720]   that don't be holding up any pictures of Stilton blue cheese.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.920]   No, whatever he is doing. So anyway, I thought I actually did not
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.240]   plan to start with that. But it is it is a big story. It's a
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.720]   fun story. Yeah.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:38.000]   Yeah. We have found out that the president is former president.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.120]   Well, might be president again in August, I'm not sure. But
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:47.320]   anyway, the former president, former until August, will be
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.240]   suspended from Facebook now for two years Facebook responding to
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.200]   the oversight board, which said, Okay, the suspension is okay,
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.520]   but you really should have had a term, a limitation on it. So
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.280]   they've decided two years tonight. Do we do this last week?
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.520]   No, we didn't because last week you have the decision
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.200]   that he was already up. Ah, fact checked while we were on the
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.920]   air. Thank you. And it happened the next day, I think the next
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.160]   day they they said. So it seemed like it was I don't know as
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.800]   related. I don't know. Anyway, so he will two years. So the
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.280]   initial suspension was January 7th, the day after the
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:25.040]   insurrection this year. So January 7th, 2023.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.560]   Right. Just just in time to rest in time. He will he will be
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:35.240]   back. Maybe. And maybe they say unless they have to judge his
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.480]   behavior. Yeah. Two things about this one, Facebook has always
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.280]   said we don't judge behavior off platform, but because he's off
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.760]   the platform and they have to do also get back. They can only
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.400]   judge his behavior off platform. It's very interesting. Yeah,
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.280]   second, you know, this is a case where I think the original
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.880]   decision was better. I thought indefinite was much better. Let's
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.080]   see how you behave. And it's up to us. Well, you come back or
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.000]   not. But it was the oversight board that insisted that was
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.840]   lawful. And so now there's a date sat where they'll have to
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.880]   judge it. And it's just going to string it out, I think in
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.680]   another way. But
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.720]   Jocktorsey glad there's no Twitter oversight board because he
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.760]   did in fact say he's never coming back. Yeah, Facebook at the
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.840]   same time announced that politician this was a stunner.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:23.280]   Apparently politicians posts were exempt from Facebook rules
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.800]   preventing users from engaging in harmful speech. You're a
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.960]   politician. Go ahead. Well, it was the news.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.920]   Where the argument is, it's a new and the same argument was
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.080]   was debated in all the platforms. The newsworthy argument
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.560]   says the public has a right to know their miscreant ways. Yes.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:44.160]   And I kind of understand that. Yeah, but it's a very too
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.000]   insight. That's different. So if it's there's you're gonna you're
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.040]   inciting people to do bad things. Clearly, there's a
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.440]   responsibility on the platform's part to keep you from doing
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.040]   that. But if you're like the Nigerian president who said,
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.920]   you know, you should kill all the people in the south of the
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.760]   country. I guess that's exciting to Twitter. In fact, pull
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.840]   down the his that tweet, not the account, but pull down that
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:15.520]   tweet and is now banned in Nigeria as a result. So I think
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.280]   incitement is a good reason if people are going to get hurt
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.840]   because of what you say, that's a good reason. So let me ask
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.720]   a question. Anyway, Facebook's reverse that policy. They say
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.840]   politicians will no longer be exempt. But as you know,
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.680]   everything's spongy and soft with. Oh, absolutely. This was
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:36.760]   gives them room. What about a garden party standard that you
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.360]   don't have to incite people to imminent disability. But yeah,
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.160]   just to say, no, then my this is no, I don't want that here.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.080]   Here's the example I'd give you. If you're if you're a
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.720]   politician and you're an elected politician and you're in
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:57.680]   office and you say a bunch of dumb hateful stuff, I think the
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.480]   electorate needs to know you're saying that. So you you
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.360]   agree with the newsworthy in a stutter? In the sense that as
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:09.200]   long as you're not telling people go do don't hurt somebody or go
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.320]   you know, tell your spreading lies about hydroxychloroquine.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.800]   Yeah, well, I don't mind a warning on it. That's different.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.400]   But what if you say, I think you're saying black people are
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.560]   dumb? I think the electorate has the right to hear you say that
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.760]   out loud. Don't you think? But then again, I agree with you on
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.800]   the host, you would want to know that, right? Right. I want to
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.000]   know who I'm voting for who I'm not voting for, not just based
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.640]   on what those ads show and promote all of the warm and fuzzy
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.240]   stuff. I like to know some of the other things that you know,
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.360]   who Louie Gomer is stuff that comes out. You know, Louie, you
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.080]   know, who Louie Gomer is. We're going to send him an
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.120]   orbit circuit. We can convey those. Can you stay off the
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.240]   rocket? Just send him up, please. Not back one way. You lived in
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.200]   Austin was was Louie well respected in the Texas politics
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.680]   representative from Texas. Oh, no, all of our politicians are
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.720]   sorry, I can't say that word. So this is an example. No, this
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.960]   is an example. Here he's in the House of Representatives. He
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.920]   this is an example. He's this is during a house house natural
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:20.480]   resources hearing. Listen to representative Gomer. And so is
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.920]   there anything that the National Forest Service or BLM can do to
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:31.680]   change the course of the moon's orbit or the Earth's orbit
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.560]   around the Sun? Obviously, that would have profound effect on
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.280]   our climate.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:42.080]   Wait, what I would have to follow up with you on that one, Mr
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:51.640]   President. She's laughing. This is like this is the face that
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.040]   they made when Trump was like, could we just like inject bleached
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.600]   people? This is crazier. Yeah, you like change the orbit of the
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:03.200]   Earth or the moon. You're kind of equally crazy. But yes, I'm
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.760]   not I'm not saying I can't evaluate those crazy events. I
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.880]   think that this is not harmful. It's not like there's a coalition
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.400]   to move your example. But I think people who elected Louis
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.480]   Gomer should know that this guy they elected to the Congress
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.960]   thinks you can change the orbit of the moon in some way that would
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.440]   be beneficial. When I first read that tweet, I thought he was
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.120]   saying for sure. Black lives matter was trying to do that. Yeah,
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.520]   Bureau of management. But I will say there are people in Texas
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.520]   and there are plots of movies and science fiction shows where
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.320]   you throw a nuclear bomb at like a comet or something and it
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.880]   evades the Earth. So I can see people thinking that is
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:50.680]   not fiction. You're being far too nice. No, I literally just
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.640]   had a conversation with someone who kept talking. We were
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.600]   talking about the M1 chips. They were like, now that Apple's
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.080]   building their own silicone. And I'm like, and I didn't want to
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.120]   correct them because I'm not cone. It's not it's not a hill. I'm
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.320]   ready to die on. Yeah. I would say, Oh, yeah, I would say
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:13.160]   one of three. But he just kept going. He was he was really
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:18.800]   into silicone. I know it's okay. I just I just say bless his
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.760]   heart. There you go.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:30.520]   Bless his heart. You've learned is for breasts. Silicon is for
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:36.400]   computers. That's it's very simple. Don't confuse the two. I'm
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.680]   sorry. I said that I really am. And you could just say bless his
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:45.360]   heart. He just clueless. That's like the people who say I don't
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:51.240]   want the vaccine because then you can follow me around. Well,
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.760]   they carry a cell phone and a computer. Right. It's like,
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.080]   Oh, okay. Yeah. And they post everywhere that they are. Yeah.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.800]   Yeah. But I don't want you to follow me around having coffee at
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:10.680]   Starbucks right now. Twitter blue is official. We we thought it
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.240]   was just a rumor, but it is it's already happening in Canada
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.840]   and Australia. Okay. Yeah, I was like, it's not here yet. Now I'm
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.720]   really curious, like, even with the tips and things like that.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.680]   And I actually just saw my first instance of, Hey, if you want to
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.520]   see this person's tweet, it was part of the replies that I would
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.120]   have to pay that super follow. That's another thing. Oh,
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:37.480]   something else. So Twitter blue is a two 99 a month. Well, we
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:42.200]   don't know it'll be in the US is 349 in Canada, 449 in Australia.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.080]   We don't know what it'll be in the US, but the rumor was 299. It
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:52.040]   is gives you three three four things. A bookmark folder. No,
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.400]   the stupidest thing ever. A bookmark folder so you can organize
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.640]   the tweets you save, like a little wallet. Maybe I'll give you a
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.760]   little like I say my books behind me. I can have a shelf. Yeah,
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.320]   for my tweets. Now this might be useful reader mode that makes
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:10.240]   it easier to read those silly long grids. Okay. Yeah. You can
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.240]   customize the Twitter app icon on your phone. No, make it green
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.480]   if you want. Access to color themes for the Twitter app. No,
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.720]   and if it forbids dark mode only, sir, and dark mode only, no
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:31.320]   dark mode and dedicated customers customer support. Plus, I
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.920]   thought the undo tweet, the under tweet, under tweet, undo
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.080]   tweet, which is basically the way tweet. Yeah, it's just like on
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.800]   Gmail, you get a timer up to 30 seconds. It's like, it's like
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.400]   a nanny like, okay, count to 10 before you tweet. It's not a
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.440]   bad idea, actually. It is a great idea, though. Would you pay
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.360]   them? Especially on the weekends. Yeah. Or you know, because I
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.040]   well, I don't if I'm drinking, I don't tweet. And I don't
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.240]   ever have a problem. No drunk tweets. Or if you're I don't
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.320]   follow that rule. No meat sweat tweets either. Jeff, I don't
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.040]   think you're I don't think you're drinking is going to change
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.960]   from the irascible treated tweets that might come out when
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.160]   you're upset. Hey, who you call it? Erasible? Huh? Oh, you are
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.440]   charmingly irascible. I love it.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:26.280]   Erasible is such a good way. I once got someone mad for calling
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.400]   him a rasible. And then he was very arrestable. It was
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:34.440]   really, you know, the you know, so when years ago, when when we
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.280]   started Epicurious, we were thinking about trying to create
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.440]   some premium products. I remember the brilliant editorial
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.040]   head, Joan Feeney, was thinking about all these features and
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.440]   all these features and all these features and all these
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.640]   features. And finally, she just realized the thing that's
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.680]   valuable is the recipes. Either we charge for that or we don't.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.440]   That's a good point. Good point. So it is says I sense that
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.240]   Twitter is trying to say what else could could be of any
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.280]   value value. Yeah, what's the other thing is that, you know,
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.800]   a better layout for for conversations. Why would you charge
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.840]   for that? Everybody should have it. So I'm fine to imagine I
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.880]   value Twitter greatly. I can imagine paying for Twitter and
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.000]   being happy to do so. I don't want a premium Twitter for
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.040]   everybody. I don't want to pay wall around Twitter. That'd be
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.400]   ridiculous. But I don't know that this catalog of goodies is
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:28.320]   itself. Motivate. I liken it to our club to it where really the
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.240]   whole point of club to it was support to it $7 a month and it
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.240]   helps us out. But we thought you throw it. You got to give
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.840]   people something so they get your pitch is supported. Yeah.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.520]   And then you get a free version. I mean, there's something
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.920]   for everybody that discord. But I got to tell you, sir, we're
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.360]   offering more club twit than what this is proposing. No, you
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.360]   offer for $3 a month. Yeah, but we cost twice as much.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.320]   And we offer a lot more.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.600]   And I have it. I have a little support. It's making a
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:04.320]   case for $10 club Twitch. I don't I value Twitter, but $3 a
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.560]   month is just that's not doing it. But how about just to support
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.840]   them? Because you think it's a good thing. And if you don't
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.080]   support them, they're you're gonna do business or something.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.960]   Or aren't they getting support from me based off of my behavior
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.000]   activity? This is a really good point. So I made this point on
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.320]   Twitter on Sunday is but wait a minute. That's one thing, you
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.920]   know, if sub stack or whatever charges for this. But the
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:32.480]   Twitter's whole business their their recipes are my tweets.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.240]   Exactly. They're selling my content really. So you're asking
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.280]   me to pay so I can post my content on your site is a little
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.160]   backwards maybe. Well, here's the other the other thing that
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.920]   Twitter's gonna do, which is called superfollow. And this is
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.360]   what you were thinking of offer your followers something extra
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.040]   and earn money every month. They get access to a more
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.280]   personalized experience with bonus content. And you get paid
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.880]   for what you create. It's a win win situation. Basically, it's
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.640]   it's a, you know, like Patreon or anything else.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.000]   Special labels on the profiles and tweets of your paying fans.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.680]   So you can see that and you you may answer them more readily, it'll
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.000]   highlight in your answers. Bonus content that you can say, Oh, you
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.560]   only you will get my exclusive tweets and newsletters. Notice we
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.720]   we knew that Twitter was looking at this because they acquired a
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:26.000]   newsletter company. And further options are coming according to
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.200]   Twitter profile badges, perhaps other connection options, you
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:36.840]   know, other ways to to DM. Twitter will also display an earnings
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.320]   estimate to lure creators with a slider showing how many of your
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.040]   followers you'll need to sign up turn a certain amount of money.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:48.960]   It also shows how much money out of this that Apple takes. So
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.800]   just if you read any question about how much of that's going to
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.520]   Apple, there are you choose a category. By the way, there are
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.120]   adult content categories.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.360]   Because that's what makes money on the internet. Yep. Yeah. So
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.400]   basically, it's Twitter going after only fans, I think. There are
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.480]   a lot of people on I heard I've heard people have told me there
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:16.000]   are a lot of people on Twitter who post post nudes of themselves
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.560]   or semi nudes saying for more follow me and only. Oh, yeah,
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.640]   that's a that's totally a thing. And there's a whole class.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.400]   Yeah, there's a whole class of a they're not really startups,
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.960]   they're features that offer you a bio page where you consent
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.640]   because like on you can't stick URLs and things in your
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.320]   Instagram, right? Yep. Things people use Instagram, TikTok
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.320]   and Twitter basically promote their their nudes on only fans.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.280]   I think that's I see a lot of that on TikTok. Yeah, a lot of
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:49.120]   it. Yeah. I don't see anything. Man, my TikTok for you page is so
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:55.040]   wacky. That's because TikTok knows you Stacy. No seriously,
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.720]   I'm talking no, it knows because it's very much watching what
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.680]   you're watching and how long you watch it. It pays attention. Oh,
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.840]   no, I know. But it thinks I am the sea. I get a lot of and I
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.040]   don't mind this, but I get a lot of content for gay women. I get a
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.240]   lot of content related to animal cyber room. No, well, I live in
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.920]   the Pacific Northwest. So that is my next. That's actually
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:22.280]   really interesting. The TikTok thinks you're a gay woman,
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.760]   maybe. That's so that's not what I understood TikTok's algorithm
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:31.400]   to do, which is is base it on what you look at. But maybe it's
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.840]   collecting information. Maybe I mean, it shouldn't be
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:39.280]   location. That's silly. I mean, I do follow people who are gay,
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.320]   but mostly because they're hilarious and they're not okay.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.760]   Well, they don't know why you're following somebody. So that
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.680]   could be you're sending a lot of dogs and a lot of language
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:54.920]   content. They don't make it a decision. Sorry, it's it's it's
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.840]   still hit or miss on me for us. What my likings are. I don't
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.800]   care for all of the what is it to do it and stuff like that that
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:09.040]   people do. I care for the lip sync. You would be that to me.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.840]   I feel like I paid them to that's that's pretty. I need to come
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:19.000]   and I pay them. Yes. Yes. See, Shandy. There you go. Now
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.680]   that's a business model. And he's see Shandy. I think
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.560]   unfortunately, and in fact, I took TikTok off my phone because
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:31.120]   and I'm going to this is a confession here. So don't mock me.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.200]   All right. Oh, yeah. Oh, is that a rassable or
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.880]   cantagoras? Which is that? Oh, Tankerous. By the way,
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.760]   about honoree.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.000]   Ornery. We're going to start a drinker drinking game whenever
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.920]   Jeff says years ago, please have at it. Go drink. All right. So
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:54.400]   years ago, you'll be a cantagoras. Some time ago, when I
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:00.680]   was working when I was. Oh, geez. Oh, man. Oh, boy. It's
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.440]   coming out today. You're the way I started saying I'm going to
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:09.000]   give you a personal confession. You went up. So you just said you
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.680]   took it down. Well, I had to because okay, I'm scrolling
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.480]   through TikTok and it pays attention to what you stop and
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.440]   look at. And I'm sorry. But if there's somebody scantily clad
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.080]   on there, I go right by I can't. Yeah, right. Oh, I didn't see
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.120]   that. I do is I don't want it. I don't want it. I don't
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.040]   that is the opposite of me. Yeah, whenever I'm like, I'm like,
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.000]   Oh, big a lot of it. Oh, see, but I can't it too. I'm a guy. And
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.960]   so look, even if you hesitate for a second, it goes, Oh,
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.960]   apparently I'm a gay woman. And they're still, you know, I'm
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.640]   like, I'm going, I'm going up with the boobs. No boobs.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.280]   They are they still don't know what you like, I guess. I get a
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.800]   lot of that too. But they think I really like people in
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.920]   bikinis because that's not what I know. But I don't
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.480]   well, even the runner.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:04.720]   Well, I'm not saying the wrong. I'm just saying, I don't in my
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:08.440]   mind. I don't want my TikTok feed to be lots of people in
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:13.080]   bikinis. So that's why I got rid of TikTok because so what am I
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.600]   supposed to do? You're supposed to as soon as you see it, you have
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.120]   the discipline to do that, Jeff, you go, no, no, why don't you do
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.600]   that? I know I don't want it to do that. Let's do that. It's
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.360]   I'm afraid it's somebody who may be underage or something. I know
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.280]   I don't want to see it. Yucky. You can't hide your eyes. I have
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.160]   I have a really cute dog running into leaves. I have another cute
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:37.120]   dog singing. I have a guy brushing a bull's chin to make him
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:40.120]   pretty. So you like it? Apparently you stop for all the
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:45.240]   animals. Yeah, because I'm a nice break for animals. I may be
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.120]   irascible, but I'm very good. First thing I do first thing I do.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.920]   I open TikTok page. What do I get? The very first thing. All
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.560]   right, let's see what let's see what the second one is. I don't
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:02.200]   want to hear the music. Somebody playing the violin. Oh, this is
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.280]   the latest, like dance thingy handsome dance. Maybe not least
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.120]   it's a guy. No, no, no, no, it's it's it's a it's a duet dance
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.840]   thing in real life. Oh, like a dance battle like a
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:17.960]   song is all over TikTok. Somebody else. Yep. See, so I didn't
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.440]   see how fast I scroll by that. See, see, you just scroll past
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:26.840]   the cute dog. Oh, God. Oh, geez. Oh, I know. You hesitate it.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:32.280]   It's a lie. You can't win. So I'm just gonna tell you all I'm
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:37.680]   gonna do now is look at my son's. My son's TikTok that's I want
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.680]   to look at him. This is space potato. This is apparently a
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.160]   thing. Another thing. It's adorable. It's a trend is it's a
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.400]   trend. Yeah. This has to do with the adult swim somehow.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:53.120]   So no potatoes in the pool. He's doing a garlic fries today. So
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.560]   he and I worked out together and he said, I can't have breakfast
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.320]   with you today. I have to go home and make garlic fries.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:05.920]   Mind me of Hank's handle salt underscore Hank. That's right.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.880]   And I'm very proud of it. But it's Hank. Yeah, he's got a
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.960]   quarter million likes 29,000 followers. One of his one of his
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:18.960]   videos has has close to a million views, 725,000 views. So,
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.400]   you know, he he really wants to make this work.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:28.680]   What is that? That's what I get on TikTok. Oh, Lord. But if
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.360]   you look who I follow on TikTok, I don't follow anybody in
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:37.600]   bikinis on TikTok. I follow, you know, interesting stuff. So
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.840]   Jackson Brown, you know, I mean, so Roger, Roger Waters is my
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.520]   husband. You would get your feed from this. More people like
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.920]   the ones that you follow. But that but I have to tell you, TikTok,
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.520]   it's not who you follow. Maybe it's somewhat is. It's really what
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.880]   you do when you're they know that your true self comes out when
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.640]   you're scrolling at night and three. I think what happens to me
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.960]   is sometimes I get caught up watching a train wreck. So they'll
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:03.640]   exactly.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.520]   Exactly. And so what they're playing on is the natural
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:13.120]   sad but natural human rubber knicker instinct, right? If you
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.080]   know, if you're looking for an accident. And so I don't.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.040]   Anyway, that's why I took it off because my train wreck sorry
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:24.000]   do tend to have clothes. Rick, Rick, I just set us a train
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.040]   right. Yeah, he said here. He says, this is this. I can't if I
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:33.040]   see this, I can't stop watching. I have to just have to see it.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:37.600]   Yeah, by the way, he is very good on he's very quick on the
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.880]   animated gifs. He's like, I'm impressed. Yeah, if
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.160]   service gifts, and I'm on that hill. Yes, gift really you
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:50.120]   think? Yeah, I'm pro gifts. Yeah. Here's Stacey and I
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:56.800]   just a peanut butter for peace of the world. Otherwise,
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.440]   something may explode and change the orbit of the earth and we
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.280]   can't have that.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.360]   You know, okay, there's a couple of problems with this. I don't
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.520]   first of all think we can change the orbit of the earth or the
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.360]   moon. I don't think we have the ability. But even if we could,
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.080]   would it be good for climate change or bad? Maybe it'd be
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.960]   bad. Maybe you'd send the earth out away from the sun. Yes,
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.800]   we wouldn't have global warming. I have global cooling. I'm just
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:26.840]   saying it's tricky. I mean, it is. Yes, this is it's tricky.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.360]   You gotta be very careful if you're going to change the earth's
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.080]   orbit, you could be very tricky. And where does astrophage
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:33.720]   come into play?
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:38.000]   Astrophage. Secret. Secret. That's a secret word. What is
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.440]   astrophage? That's a secret word. Spoiler. We can't tell you
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.880]   where it's from. We can't tell you why it's from. I can tell
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:56.160]   you that I am from AT&T Watch. This podcast is supported by AT&T

[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:45.280]   reverse time so we can go back to the dinosaurs? Is that possible?
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.600]   I'd like to know. I'll have to get back to you on that. And see
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.640]   you look at the injuries.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:59.200]   Look into that for you, sir. Oh, Lord. What a shock. So, Stacey,
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:04.040]   I'm sure you had some thoughts about Apple's WWDC. We, you
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.040]   know, we were all excited. Maybe they're gonna announce new
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.160]   hardware and stuff. And the fact they didn't, they just talked
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:12.120]   about Mac OS Monterey, their new version of the operating system.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:16.600]   Do you think ever launch hardware at WDC? 65% of WWDCs they
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:21.400]   watch new hardware. More than... Wow, okay. Sorry. I was like,
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.280]   no, frequently, there was a social network on the fall that
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:30.120]   laptops and stuff. Yeah. But I do. I think actually, in hindsight,
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.520]   it's pretty obvious. They only did that because, you know,
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.040]   will they have a few events? But now they can do events
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.560]   whenever they want. They had, you know, very head of event this
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.680]   year that like for last fall. So I think doing quite well, and
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.560]   they're doing fine. So I think that they realize, you know, what
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.560]   we don't have to do this now even because it's not going to be
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.600]   ready to the fall. So we'll just, I suspect new hardware won't
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.040]   come now to the fall. But they did announce some very
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.680]   interesting home kit changes. They talked about matter, which is
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.000]   this former chip alliance. Were you impressed? Did you feel
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.040]   Stacey that they kind of were being all in on home automation
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.520]   and cooperative with the other players?
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.160]   They actually did more than I thought they would do. And they
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:19.600]   were the first person to say a big thing, which is that any
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.560]   matter supported device will work with home kit. It doesn't
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.240]   actually need to be home kit certified, which is a big deal.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.840]   Google hasn't even said that. They've just said that certain of
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:33.160]   their devices will work as matter compliant devices. So that
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.280]   was a big announcement. They actually also made another really
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:40.160]   big announcement for the smart home, which is in access
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.280]   control and locks. They said they were going to use NFC
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:48.720]   on locks, which is a big deal. Because if you can do NFC and
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.680]   your locks, you can actually have secure opening capabilities
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.080]   with your phone. And you don't have to have all this like
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.040]   Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and all this that that goes by the wayside
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.640]   and you can just use your phone to unlock your door. Well, and
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:05.640]   now they're using a UWB as well, the Ultra Wideband, which is a
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:11.040]   allows you to see in space where these things are. So I guess
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.360]   that's proximity of us. Oh, I thought they were using UWB for
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.320]   locks. They might be so they might be using UWB. It's
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.200]   unclear. They're definitely using NFC. Okay. And that's
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.320]   interesting. I don't think they said NFC. They said,
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.880]   Oh, you did a story. That's interesting. Okay. I feel like
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.600]   doesn't NFC with a negative connotation, though? Maybe not
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.360]   the only drawback to NFC is it's very short range. You almost
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.080]   have to touch the device with it. Yes. So maybe that's how
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.880]   they're using UWB. And maybe there's Bluetooth in there. But
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:48.160]   is it as a default NFC? Because the problem is not every
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:53.200]   phone has UWB already in there. Well, Apple doesn't care about
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:57.800]   that. Apple Apple says late model iPhones in the Apple Watch
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.480]   support UWB. So for instance, Hyatt Hotels is going to support
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:05.360]   UWB keys. They said it's 1000 properties to start. That's
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:10.120]   UWB, not NFC. So that means as you approach the door, it'll unlock
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:14.280]   for you. Right. And that's a little bit different. They say
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:21.480]   Schlaine, Asa, Abloy, latch, atrium evergreen all support UWB
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:25.000]   specifically. They will support their okay, that is big.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.920]   Yeah, this is the this is the graphic that they put up for
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:32.160]   the UWB. Oh, yeah, yeah, I did see that. Yes. Okay. Yeah.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.080]   So I don't know if I want that I just approached the door and it
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.680]   opens. It makes me a little nervous. You know that we see
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.720]   I there's you there's Bluetooth now right Stacey, there are
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.880]   Bluetooth locks. There is blue and it makes me a little
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.920]   nervous like you could be hacked. So I will tell you that
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.200]   everybody who researches Bluetooth locks, they research it for
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.400]   the standpoint of because here you and I might be nervous
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.480]   coming outside the door to unlock it. But the big fear is if I'm
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.320]   on the other side of the door, I can't get out. I can't get
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:05.000]   out. No, no, no, if I'm coming close to it on the other side
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.480]   of the door, it will unlock just a guy on the outside. But
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.560]   that's they've all even Bluetooth doesn't do that. So that's
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.320]   something that they figured it has to be you have to open the
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:19.000]   phone and explicitly. You just have to be they they figured out
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.400]   how to tell if you're on the quote unquote right or wrong
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.840]   side of the Oh, that's interesting. Oh, okay. Yeah,
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.240]   that's been that's been something that if well, that's one
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.720]   reason you might want to use UWB because it's very much location
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:33.560]   aware that's what you're using your air test. Yeah, yeah. And I
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.960]   was thinking about this. So as a woman who wanders through
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:40.000]   hotel rooms or through hotel, wait a minute, what hallways?
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.960]   What did you just say? What I travel as a woman who wanders
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.480]   through hotel hallways. Oh, okay. I'm thinking about how I want
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:52.560]   just you know, doors to open as you walk. Well, so let me I do I
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.000]   do pay attention. Like if I get off the elevator and there's
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.200]   a single guy behind me, you know, when he's walking out the
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.800]   hallway to and I'm walking down the hall with the package and
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.680]   I'm like, right. So turn don't turn left. Not right. In other
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.400]   words, don't head towards your room because the door right
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.080]   I don't I will I will bypass my room. But if my room
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.760]   automatically unlocks, that's not good. Yeah. Right. That's a
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:17.240]   very good point. Maybe. Maybe it won't like I have to experience
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.840]   this in action. I know that's a really the same thing. If let's
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.760]   say you're running, you're running from a bad guy and you run
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:27.240]   home and want to go in real quick, I guess, unless he's right.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.400]   And I would want that to work. You would want it to work. Yeah.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.480]   So it's that's a tough thing.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:36.200]   This and by the way, what's interesting is that these
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.720]   credentials will be stored in your apple wallet. Apple's really
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:43.120]   trying to make the apple wallet do a lot. They say the TSA is
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.080]   going to use apple wallet so that you can show up at TSA
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.040]   checkpoint at an airport and the TSA can say what information it
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:54.640]   needs. Your phone can automatically share that. They say
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.680]   that some states they didn't say which some states will allow you
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:02.440]   to put your ID your state ID your driver's license in the apple
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.080]   wallet. So you don't need to carry a physical card with you. I
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.440]   think that's great. What are the negative consequences? What
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:11.960]   are the what's the dangers of something like that? Anything
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.200]   danger is if someone steals your phone, but then they can't
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.760]   really use his face ID. I would imagine to unlock it. I mean,
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.640]   yeah, that's I'm trying to think I'm just thinking out loud, you
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:25.120]   know, like, if someone takes your phone, they have access to
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:30.960]   your ID. The question is if can I just walk up to a TSA
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:34.240]   checkpoint and it'll see I have an iPhone and a wallet with the
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.600]   proper credentials and just kind of automatically walk through
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:41.680]   it. That would be incredible. That would be nice. Yeah. I guess
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.400]   you'd have to pause so they could at least look at the
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.560]   picture and make sure it's they have to look at your picture
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.640]   and write something on your your circle. Yeah, circle
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:52.800]   and something on your ticket. Right. By the way, if they ever
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:58.520]   write SSA on your ticket, do not just go home. No, I'm just
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.160]   kidding. But that's where you get the special search. I thought
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.320]   it was just SS. Maybe it's SS. Yeah. Yeah. That's where you
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.840]   get special search. Secondary security screening
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:15.240]   selection. You don't want to be an SS SS. They go through your
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:19.080]   bag. You're at the gate. You think your home is for us.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.760]   You don't want to be your home free. No, no, no, no, no.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.960]   You go over there. They search you at the gate. People are
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:30.360]   yeah, the gate and people are loading and you lost the good
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.920]   overhead rack and you're getting on the road. I used to be
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:39.240]   and you might be interested in this. Not every wire. This was
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:44.120]   leaked by WikiLeaks. CIA assessment on surviving secondary
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:51.840]   screening at airports while maintaining cover. This document
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.000]   was created for distribution within the organization and other
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.200]   officials who hold appropriate clearances.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:03.960]   Look, they have a beautiful picture. Surviving secondary
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:07.200]   and identity threat assessment of secondary screening procedures.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.840]   Wow. This is our tax dollars at work, children. Well, no, no,
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.720]   this is this is you're an agent and you're a spy. Yeah, yeah,
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.800]   yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, well, you should read this
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.240]   before you go through Jeff just just in case I'm just I'm just
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.560]   protect can check.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:28.040]   Cover cover cover is cover is professor. That's by the way,
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.920]   widely overused. You should really get a better cover. Yeah. Oh,
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.960]   yes, I'm a journalist. How about how about that? No, nobody
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:41.160]   knows what the hell you go. Yeah. Trust me. I used to try to
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.280]   get into Canada saying I'm a podcaster. I'm a netcaster. They
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:49.040]   go, well, what do you really do? What's your what are you? Are
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.200]   you are you undercover? I thought you were a comedian. Yeah. Oh,
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.840]   yeah, you're a comedian. I get it.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:59.080]   By the way, I do I forgot to mention this when we were talking
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.280]   about TikTok. The president of the United States of America has
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.520]   revoked the TikTok ban, which was never enforced. You might
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.960]   remember the president Trump signed a number of executive
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:15.040]   orders banning TikTok saying nobody could invest money in
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.080]   TikTok, etc, etc. The courts prevented it from being
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:24.640]   implemented. And now the Biden administration has revoked it.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:31.520]   However, however, it does say that we want to invest have the
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:35.080]   Commerce Department investigate any threats, any security risks
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:39.520]   from Chinese and other foreign owned apps. But because the
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.880]   executive orders of the previous president were effectively
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:46.760]   unenforceable because of the court rulings. They still want to
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:52.120]   say to China, you know, Josh Hawley, you might wonder what he
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:56.000]   thinks about this. Does he want to change the orbit of Mars?
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.200]   No, he tweeted, this is a major mistake shows alarming
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.360]   complacency regarding hashtag China's access to American
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.440]   personal information, as well as hashtag China's growing
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.760]   corporate influence. Why do you need to hashtag China? I guess
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.160]   so you can find out what else people think about China. I don't
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:18.800]   know. Okay. Hmm. So, you know, meanwhile, the
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.120]   international point of view, the president also says that he
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:27.720]   regrets not having followed what the Nigerian president did and
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:32.840]   just ban some services outright. Yeah. Yeah, wow, could you know,
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.880]   you can't though, in the United States, we have this thing
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.240]   called the First Amendment. You can't say your band Twitter,
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:43.080]   your band also have a constitution, but that yeah. Okay. Oh,
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:46.240]   yeah. This is the word. This is conversation is for you, Bob.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:53.320]   Oh boy, Bob's already gone long gone. Hi, Bob. Just just for
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:57.160]   the record. I went through my TikTok and I have the first three
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:00.680]   videos were animals, red panda, golden retriever, flamingo.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:04.200]   So that's winning. And then my second video or my my second
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.280]   set of videos were dancers. And there's this I will say there's
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:12.760]   this one dude. He like dances on ice and he is awesome.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:18.400]   Ice dancing. Now that you know, he's like an ice skater. And he
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:24.080]   he like does some serious dance. So okay, back to home. If
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.160]   there's one thing worse than TikTok, it's something to
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.880]   describe their TikTok. Yeah, I know.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:39.320]   Years ago, when I started TikTok, let me out of here. I have a
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.200]   podcast. What is that? What is it? What is it? What is it?
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.880]   That show? I'm a celebrity. Get me out of here. Get me out of
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:49.800]   here. I'm a podcast. Get me out of here. The final thing I was
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.760]   going to say about Apple. Oh, yeah, we weren't done. I actually
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.800]   wanted to know more. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cut that off.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:57.800]   No, no, no, no. That's okay. Is I love what they're doing with
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:03.440]   using UWB, the watch and your phone to understand context clues
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.240]   for things like how things will respond in your house and even
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.280]   things like grouping devices in your home. So when they showed
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.920]   that like your Apple TV is going to be able to show like work
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:17.240]   with devices that were proximal to the TV in that room, I was
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:20.440]   like, baller, that is that is excellent. That is one of the
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:25.320]   best uses of context. I think I've seen. And I think Apple
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.400]   has took them a while to get here, but they're really I think
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.400]   of the next two to three years, you're going to be like, Holy
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:36.560]   cow, they have defined the smart home for us. Somebody had to
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:40.720]   right. And it's interesting because Apple makes no smart home
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.600]   products except for maybe the Siri, the HomePod mini and
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.840]   they don't really want they don't really care about it. But
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.800]   they are supporting things like they didn't ask, they're going
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:54.840]   to support unlimited storage of home kit camera videos on iCloud.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.560]   They don't make a camera. So they're going to support other
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:00.320]   companies camera videos, which I thought was very interesting.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:04.800]   Google charges a pretty penny to store Nest camera footage. But
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.600]   Apple says, no, I pretty penny for Nest cameras too. Yeah, no
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:12.360]   kidding. You look at what wise charges for what probably is the
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:15.920]   same camera. It's like, Oh, so there's a little bit of profit
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:21.120]   in there. They also said that Siri voice was going to be in some
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.440]   devices. But I think I misunderstood that when they said
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.920]   it's not it's not like you can get some devices now that have
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.200]   Amazon's echo in it. It's not like that. It's going to still
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.440]   connect to your phone. The phone's going to do this Siri stuff.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.880]   And then I thought it was local now. I thought it's local
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:41.880]   processing on the phone and some devices. Oh, the capacity
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:47.080]   they showed an ecobi thermostat. Oh, she's gone. That she
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.920]   doesn't need to hold on. She has a dog. Yeah. So we'll I'm on a
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.000]   wait. She gets the dog fixed to be to talk listens and knows
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.880]   that she has it likes animals and that's why it gives
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:00.640]   all that's why she hear they hear the barking. Oh, yeah. Oh,
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:04.800]   that's probably what it is. I need more barking. So so
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:07.960]   barking until they come in. So I feel bad. Oh, I don't know. I
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:13.600]   like barking. So on. So the ecobi does have Siri built in.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:18.000]   So what's ecobi is going to actually put out a press release
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.440]   to about this or blog post. EkoB is going to if you have the
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.400]   ecobi hardware that speaks with Madam A right now because it
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:29.920]   has the existing microphone and speaker in it, it will add
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.800]   Siri. So that's what they're saying. So these are two
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.800]   announcements. The Siri local is one announcement. Siri being
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:41.200]   on other devices that have the capability to do other home
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:46.320]   kit devices that have the capability of using that can use
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.720]   a voice assistant. They will also get Siri. So makes sense.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:53.160]   Yeah, but you will need it apparently at least it's unclear
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:55.560]   but it looks like you will need a home pod or a home pod mini on
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:00.640]   your network to route those voice commands. Oh, yeah, I don't
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.760]   think it will act as like you're saying it will act as series
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:07.960]   brains. Yeah, my ecobi could become the brains for no more
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:12.840]   like the input to the Siri. So like the ecobi will hear you
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:16.800]   take what you say, send it over to home pod mini which process
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.720]   that sends it back to the ecobi which speaks. That's what
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:24.840]   it looks. That's what the SDK does, I think. Oh, okay. That's
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.960]   for it's not 100% clear because if you look at ecobi's
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.840]   announcement, it looks like they're saying, in fact, they say
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:37.320]   the words built in support for Siri. So that sounds like Siri
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:41.120]   would Siri would actually do well today, even the built in
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:44.680]   support for Madam A on the ecobi does go to the cloud. So not
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:48.200]   all devices that support Siri will do local processing. So it
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.560]   may support Siri but not support local processing. They're
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:57.840]   going to have it so here's here. So ecobi says, if you have a
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:01.680]   smart thermostat with voice control, as you said, but you
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:10.040]   also have to have a home pod or home pod mini. So that's kind
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:15.520]   of weird. Yeah, so it's a gateway to the home pod. But the
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:19.680]   home pod is the, you know, remember that Apple TVs, iPads,
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:25.440]   and home pods can be our home kit base stations in effect. It's
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:29.800]   very confusing. Gateways. They're gonna so they're on
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:32.600]   Thursday, they're having a session all about their smart
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:34.600]   home stuff and matter and that sort of thing. And you'll be
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:37.200]   watching that, I'm sure. Yeah. I'm like, I will be paying
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.160]   attention then, but I have more I don't know for you. Right,
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:44.840]   right. It's really interesting because Apple who which is really
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:48.480]   in many ways thrown up more walls in their walled garden. I
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.760]   mean, really a lot of what Apple showed is a message to
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.160]   people just use all Apple stuff for getting anybody else
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.400]   come into our ecosystem and stay here. It's great. It's
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:59.960]   beautiful. But in some ways, they also broke down some of
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.520]   those walls, things like allowing third party devices access to
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:09.560]   Siri. FaceTime will also be now on Android and Windows.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:14.640]   It will work on the web if you're on one of those devices.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:20.200]   Yeah, some sort of web art. That is not. I'm like, well,
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.200]   but that's more than it did before. You know, if you had an
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.440]   iPhone and you wanted to make a FaceTime call, you could only
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:29.680]   call other people with that response to antitrust concerns
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.800]   than anything else. Well, and the success of zoom, because they
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.360]   basically are turning FaceTime into a zoom clone, you can send
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.560]   out invites to a FaceTime meeting. So you don't want to have to
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.120]   say, well, I'd like to send an invite, but does she have an
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:45.080]   Apple device? I don't know. Right. Well, and I think that's
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:49.680]   part they realize that they are. I mean, I will say the people
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.360]   who aren't in Apple's ecosystem today are probably people who
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:55.240]   are just never going to want to be an Apple's ecosystem. Right. I
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.400]   don't know if you can sweeten the pot enough to get us over
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:01.920]   there. And so I think is that Jeff saying, Oh, over there.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:06.680]   Oh, there are like here, here are the minimal bridges. They're
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.160]   not going to be like super nice bridges, but we're going to
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:12.440]   build a couple bridges because even our own customers are kind
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:16.040]   of like, you know, Jeff is always telling us he can't join our
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.960]   FaceTimes because blah, blah, blah, rasable Jeff, you know,
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.800]   and they're like, okay, here's a bridge to Jeff.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:27.280]   Jeff doesn't like bridges. I just want to warn you he's
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.640]   Oh, that is true. Sorry.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.960]   Very rasable. Very rasable. All right. One more Apple thing.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.760]   And then we're going to move on. But I wondered what you
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:39.480]   saw about Apple mail eliminating the hidden pixels. In fact, I
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:43.040]   saw you tweeting about it. It has a zone. Don't go away from
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:46.480]   that because I wanted to get her her thoughts on this with news
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:50.160]   on a real sad Brandon and marketing 101. You get email
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.520]   addresses. Check. I got it. I'm good to go. And then you find
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:57.240]   out just how many people actually open those emails and you
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:00.760]   take that number and you can use that to talk to sponsors and
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:04.920]   things like that. And how do how are you? What are you thinking
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:08.520]   about this and how you feel it may affect say your newsletter?
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:13.520]   I am. Yeah, I was like, well, there go my newsletter stats
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.320]   which we are your initial tweets. You were very disappointed.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:21.280]   Yeah, I was like, bummer. Now, I will say when I first dug into
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:24.760]   my newsletter stats, I was appalled at what I could see like
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:29.920]   I could see. I mean, I was I was like, who do you use? Mailchimp.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:33.840]   Okay. Yeah. So if I was a contact Mailchimp, sub stack,
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.520]   everybody does this. Yeah, they all do this. That's how you
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:41.760]   get stats on open open rate. Yeah, you could tell which articles
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:46.040]   people read to. Oh, yeah, I can tell so I can tell you I can
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:49.800]   tell you at an individual email level, what articles you
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:53.160]   individually read. Right. I can tell you what adds you
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.720]   individually clicked on. I don't look at that personally,
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:00.560]   because I don't I don't need to. My sponsors, if I did that deal
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.360]   with them, which I don't, I could do a deal and they would pay me
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:08.160]   a lot to give me to give you their emails from that particular
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:13.160]   campaign and they they've asked. But what I am saying, so I feel
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:16.080]   like, man, could we do it like at a less granular level? Because
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:20.000]   what I look at is what percentage of people open by emails? I
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.360]   look at their IP address information, which Apple was like,
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.840]   and we hide your IP address. Like it's nefarious, but I do. I
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:31.000]   look and see things like 30% of my audiences outside of the US.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.080]   Sometimes it's up as much as 40%. So I look like when I'm
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:40.360]   scheduling things. And then I can also see like, I can see who
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:43.320]   specifically read articles, but usually what I'm looking for is
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:47.600]   like, how many people clicked on this particular article, you
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:52.960]   know, that sort of thing. So just so I can say, Oh, people
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:57.200]   really don't care about my obsession with, I don't know,
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.400]   machine learning at the edge. Nobody's clicking on it. Let's
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:04.560]   let's dial back that coverage. Right. Yeah. I would be sad if
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:06.400]   that goes away. Yeah.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:13.240]   So Casey Newton has a big thread about this on his platformer
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:17.560]   because of course, Casey Newton just got into the newsletter
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:25.120]   business business. And you know, so a couple of points, he says
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:29.960]   93.5% of all email opens on phones come in Apple mail and
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.880]   iPhones or iPad. So those you've lost stats about them
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:39.000]   completely 93.5%. On desktop, Apple Mail on Mac is 58% of all
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.080]   email opens. So it's more than half of his newsletter. No, no,
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.000]   this is market share numbers from litmus from May 2021.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:51.360]   Oh, okay. I was like, I know my newsletters are not quite so
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:54.800]   high, but yes. Yeah. Well, yes, so it's everybody, not just you.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:57:00.400]   Now he then quotes Alex Cantor, which who is also a newsletter
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.960]   guy, he left to create big technology. He's been on our
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.680]   Twitter podcast many times. I used to work at ad age so in
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:10.320]   her stands the ad business. And this is what Cantor would
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:13.720]   says the advertising industry has addicted itself to tracking
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.680]   prioritizing bottom of the funnel metrics at the expense of
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:21.880]   great content and creative. It's tragic. And it's why people hate
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:29.680]   advertising and ad companies. Both Casey and Cantor, it's say at
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:33.000]   what somebody said on Twitter on Sunday, you know, yeah, you're
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.080]   gonna lose this. But there are other ways to judge your audience.
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:43.760]   Casey uses surveys as does Cantor with us. It's it's
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.840]   we're gonna have to give it up. Because once Apple does it, it's
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.120]   you know, others have done this. I mean, I use I've used email
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:52.200]   clients that block those pixels for years. But it was always, you
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:56.120]   know, we're only a percentage when Apple does it. It's a big deal.
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:59.080]   deal. Can I ask you a question here? When you've done?
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:02.480]   Yeah, he said I'll just I'll play right into your wheelhouse
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:05.360]   because he says the media business changes so quickly. I don't
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:07.800]   find it at all irrational to read about a move like the one
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:11.760]   Apple made this week and assume it will be bad for journalism.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:15.040]   But Newton says in this case, it mostly strikes me as a false
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:19.760]   alarm. There are many or any number of changes that major email
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.000]   providers, including Apple Google and Microsoft could make
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.520]   that would make life more difficult for newsletter based
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:27.520]   businesses in the end, though, I don't think blocking spy
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.480]   pixels is one of them. Now your turn.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:35.960]   So if we could, oh, I don't know, move the moon and go back a
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:39.800]   few years. Superman has to spin the earth backwards, I believe
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:42.680]   it's not. Okay, right. All right, that's what it is. And and
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:47.080]   forget all the kudos that pixels and tracking and surveillance
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:50.960]   and everything have, right, early, early days of podcasts. If you
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:55.280]   could do it all over again, and if there were a tracking bit in
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:59.960]   a podcast, let you just know for sure that somebody listened to
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.920]   her listen to the end or whatever. Would you wish for that?
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:08.640]   No. In fact, I wish fervently that these ad tracking stuff had
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:13.520]   not come to podcasting, because it's my opinion that what we
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:18.080]   offer advertisers is a very specific niche. Now I admit, if
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.320]   you're a, you know, if you're Will Ferrell doing, you know, the
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:24.240]   Anchorman podcast, you don't have a specific niche. So you might
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:28.360]   have a stronger reason to try to understand your audience. But I
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.240]   don't need to understand my audience. I know exactly. Yeah.
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:34.440]   The people listening this show and all our shows are very much
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:38.640]   tech enthusiasts. That's why this network is very, very focused
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:41.560]   on tech enthusiasts. And I know that that makes it a good
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:45.720]   avenue for a certain kind of advertiser. And then the only
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:49.840]   thing I really think an advertiser should look at is return on
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:55.080]   investment. Did did the sales increase justify the ad spend
[00:59:55.080 --> 01:00:00.000]   period? But advertisers from day one, and this is classic in
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.720]   in all sorts of new media where they want to do direct
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:05.920]   response. They want to get some idea. So when you first, you
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.800]   know, new cable channels like tech TV when it started, you see
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:13.400]   all these use the offer code tech TV 20. You still see that on a
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:17.720]   lot of cable channels. That that's called direct response
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.360]   advertising. And that's how advertisers have in the past
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.960]   responded to this. It's a very imperfect method. It's
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:26.960]   particularly bad on our network because most of our users are
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:31.040]   smart technology wise. This is the disadvantage of this
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:34.160]   audience. And so that's just they go, Oh, I heard an ad for
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:37.480]   Casper. I'll just go to Casper.com. They don't right, they
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:40.520]   don't go to the special URL. They don't remember the offer
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.200]   code. They don't care about the offer code. And if they do an
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.960]   offer code, nine times out of 10, it's just Twitch. We already
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.600]   know this. We surveyed it. We've found out they just use
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:52.000]   Twitch. In fact, we try to tell advertisers don't use twig. In
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.480]   fact, you'll see a lot of our advertisers now just use Twitters
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.800]   as the URL or the offer code. We tell them don't try to figure
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:01.520]   out which shows working for you. You can't. They're going to
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.560]   almost nine times out of 10 people are just going to say,
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.700]   Well, I heard it on Twitter, the Twitter network, it's
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:09.520]   Twitter, and use that offer code. So but even then I know I
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.320]   don't want tracking. I know our audience hates it. And I don't
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.440]   think you need it as an advertiser. You should just be
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.680]   looking at the ad work. And if your business went, yeah,
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.280]   bottom line, it'll work your business went up. Good. Keep
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.360]   advertising. But but no advertiser works that way.
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.120]   Yeah, that's the problem. They want there. Nobody wants to
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.760]   nobody wants to re educate the person who has the checkbook.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.180]   Right. Well, we try. I mean, my
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:37.680]   educating people all the time. And Andrew, I mean, Andrew
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.360]   does have and we have we have the benefit of you have the same
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.840]   thing. Andrew, a targeted. Yeah, Andrew explains things to
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:49.480]   people. And and I also have an audience that spends like not
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:52.640]   not a thousand dollars on a mattress. They spend $100,000
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.640]   or $1 million buying a service product. So it's a little
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.160]   different. A lot of our ads are moving towards enterprise for
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:02.760]   that exact reason. Right. Exact and they should. I mean, you
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.720]   I mean, you've got an educated audience that people want to get
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.640]   a hold of like remember spice works. Right. I think they're
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.640]   still around. Yeah, they were a great company because they
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:15.720]   created these forums for crazy IT people who like wanted to talk
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.840]   to each other about problems. And all of a sudden they were
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.640]   like, we are sitting on an enterprise ad network gold mine.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.960]   And it was a brilliant business model. What happened was all of
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:32.000]   those freebie magazines like PC week and you know, info world,
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.640]   which were given away to executives in companies went away.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.640]   And that was how enterprise reached those people. And now
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.240]   they're desperate to find ways. So they so your newsletter
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.520]   benefits are podcast benefit. Yeah, we I used to read them too.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:49.720]   And they were give you give you give me but the remember how
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:53.120]   you got PC week you had a fellow big questionnaire to prove
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.200]   that you were you know, some of your big decisions about
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:00.640]   yes, yes. Yeah, it was worth it. You could lie, but it was
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.040]   worth it because it was a great magazine to work was in the
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.400]   backspence order was Spencer the cat in four world was to work.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:11.080]   Anyway, the world has changed a lot. And the problem is
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:15.560]   advertisers are like crack addicts. Once you give them the
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:19.760]   first taste of metrics of analytics. But what I don't
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.840]   understand is stuff. I want that one more of that. If we all
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:27.960]   know the world is changing, why the doesn't why don't the ad
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:32.960]   agencies see it the same way TV today is not the same as TV 20
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:35.880]   years ago. So I'm sure they're not selling this because they
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:40.040]   don't have to yet. The pain hasn't gotten bad enough for them
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.920]   to change their business models just and their will and their
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:47.680]   clients. Yeah, by placing ads. So they're getting the
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:51.480]   put there getting the piece of the buy and making the buy more
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:55.520]   efficient is a good for them. You know, I think about what
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.160]   Mr. LaPort said a few minutes ago of saying, don't use those
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:04.320]   those don't suggest using these codes because you're not going to
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:08.400]   see it right out the gate. People listen to podcasts regularly,
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:12.200]   but that doesn't mean they listen to them on a regular
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.680]   schedule. Like today's show is probably not going to be listened
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.200]   to. Oh boy, for a lot of we have to explain that all the time
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.880]   because agencies call and they go, you're at ran yesterday and I
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.760]   didn't see any pub. It's like, no, it's not. It's not right. You're
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:31.120]   not buying CNBC. You're not television. You're buying a
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.280]   podcast. Give it's it's we literally tell them six weeks
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:38.360]   before you'll know whether they add a result. But we but
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:42.800]   unfortunately, Lisa tells me we cannot sell ads anymore without
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:47.480]   having chart beat or pod sites or one of the analytics companies
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:52.400]   doing essentially what those invisible pixels do. It's
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.560]   basically invisible pixel. They even call it a tracking pixel,
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.840]   even though it's not. And and so you know, and but when we did
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:04.400]   that, we tried really hard to make sure that information did not
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:10.080]   go to the advertiser. It doesn't. And there are places that do
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:13.480]   like I've got tracks for like events or other things. They
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:18.040]   will just give that email address up and I've explained it
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.840]   before. It's kind of complicated, but we send them our logs in
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.120]   effect. They see the IP addresses that downloaded the show
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.960]   and then the advertiser puts a tracking pixel on their web
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.120]   page. They send them the logs of the people who went to the
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:35.480]   landing page and then pod sites or chart beat matches it up. And
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:38.920]   they said 43% of the people who heard this show went to your
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.080]   landing page. And that's the they don't get any info other
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.800]   information than that just you know, how how successful is
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:48.800]   that campaign? I feel like that's a very minor. It's not an
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.680]   intrusion at all. And we of course have to ask these
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:55.200]   companies just two of them pod sites and chart chartable. We
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:58.240]   have to say, you know, you're never you got to preserve this. We
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:01.600]   you know, this is this is private information. You can never
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.160]   send this information anybody else. They say yes. And plus
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:08.600]   advertisers do not share their information back with us. So we
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:13.240]   really try to keep it isolated. But still people don't like it. And
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.680]   as a result, by the way, one of the downsides of it is a lot of
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:21.600]   ad blockers now block the downloads of our podcasts. So we
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.440]   I have to explain to people all the time. Oh, you have to unblock
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:30.040]   chartable and pod sites and megaphone in your ad blocker or
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:33.120]   your or your on your router or whatever it is you're using your
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:36.360]   pie hole. Because pie holes will block us you can't down all of
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.040]   a sudden you can't download our shows anymore. So it's very
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.560]   frustrating. That's why we created club twit, frankly. So we
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:45.040]   can say you want a tracker free experience. No ads. Seven bucks.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:49.840]   That's it. That's exactly why we did it. But it makes me so
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.160]   your to answer your this a long answer your question, Jeff. No, I
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:56.880]   hate it. I don't want to do it. I don't I would never accept
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:01.560]   that. In fact, my attitude has always been and Lisa says I'm a
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:06.720]   fool. My attitude has always been tell them no, sorry, we're not
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.640]   gonna do it. We give you great results. Trust me, you're gonna
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:15.320]   get great results if you don't know harm, no foul. But I'm not
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.240]   gonna give you any information about our audience.
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.800]   So back to your question. I have you saved conversations. Of
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:24.880]   course you do. Yeah. Oh, yeah. To the line hold the line. But you
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.760]   know what it's a I don't know about newsletters and a rooting
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:31.360]   sure my podcast is in a road because of Spotify and all these
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.360]   other companies. There's no way we can win this. All the ad
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.640]   dollars will go to companies that give the advertisers that
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:44.560]   information period. And some years ago, not too long ago, I
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:51.680]   good job. I'm really wasting now. I'm hurt. I'm actually quite
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.680]   hurt. But no, no, we love your stories. I was teasing you.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.720]   No, you don't know you don't know I do know I want to cry
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.040]   about the sleep. I really want to know what happened in there
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:06.080]   10 22 years ago. I need to know that a few a few.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:13.440]   If you ever work for a just out of curiosity. No, no,
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.040]   because we're trying to find out was this on this show? How you
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:21.000]   pronounce Gannett? Good. Good. Oh, no, that I didn't work for
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.880]   them. I can know that you can just ask me the question. I do
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.320]   that. Was it this show? Or was it? No, it was on Twitter. Yeah,
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:30.400]   we were going back and forth because both Florence Ion and
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:34.520]   had worked for them. And so had Robert O Baldwin. And he said
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.360]   Gannett I say Gannett and she said Gannett I worked for him. She
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:42.280]   said, I don't think it was a guy. Sorry, flow. Sorry.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:46.880]   So anyway, tell me what happened years ago. No, I'm not
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:47.920]   going to that. And
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:54.440]   Sir, don't get all sensitive on me, Jeff. I am sensitive. Oh, I'm
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:59.200]   sorry. I'm not I'm not mad at you. I'm not I love you. I know.
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:04.000]   Please don't get sensitive on me. Sorry. So one of the one of
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.240]   the founding parents of programmatic advertising scolded a
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:11.840]   whole bunch of media properties in my space. And so why are you
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.280]   using this? It commodifies you. You shouldn't be doing this, you
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:17.120]   know, tell the agency tell this and that. And a chief revenue
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.860]   officer from the media properties online digital pure
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:23.440]   place said, I got to go to where the dollars are on the ad
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.480]   agencies are all putting their dollars into programmatic. That's
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.040]   where I have to be. And nobody changes their path. And you have
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.120]   a bunch of media people in the ad agencies, when they're buying
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:36.760]   big buys, they're just going for the data. That's all they've
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.320]   ever done is gone for the data. And and so that's the way it is
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.600]   and and and it's very hard to change that. The question is, I
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.800]   think we need advertising forever in media media will never be
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.080]   self supported without advertising. We need to sell these
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.800]   eyeballs. Sorry, folks, we got to do it. It's the only way to
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.720]   support you give you the things you want for free. But we got to
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:59.560]   reinvent advertising. We got to rethink that too. Because it's
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:00.040]   port.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:05.160]   surveillance is over. I would I mean, if if I could wave a magic
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.760]   wand, I'd say club to it just drunk club to it. We don't have
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:13.640]   advertising anymore. But yeah, that's I mean, that's I will say
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:16.440]   it limits your audience. Like we get a lot of questions from
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:20.160]   people who are, you know, high schoolers who are interested in
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:23.360]   I agree, which is with you. And I need those people to be
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:26.680]   there. They're my they're my audience coming in. It's hard to
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:31.280]   that's free is democratic. I completely agree with you.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.840]   Anyway, okay, but we could do like a Tom's model where you buy one
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:41.400]   give one. And then you're just like subsidizing the next
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:45.360]   generation 10% of our audience paid the other 90% could free
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.360]   load. It would be fine.
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:49.920]   For the road is like the Guardian. We only need 10%. We
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.880]   don't 6 to 12% of public radio. Yeah, for public radio. In
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.480]   addition to the
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.120]   industry,
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:54.120]   the
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.600]   I was going to say, but there's also sponsors and government
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.320]   funding for
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:03.360]   yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And by the way,
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.960]   Jeff Day and by the way, calendar, I just want to say,
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:11.360]   public radio has more ads than we do. Way more. Oh, yeah. Oh,
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:15.800]   yeah. It's really bugging a pronunciation. Ready? Yeah,
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:21.720]   Carnegie. Yeah, Carnegie. Carnegie. Oh, which is it? Jeff,
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:26.720]   you're the arbiter. I've always said Carnegie. But you're
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:30.080]   right. You hear it. You're an announcement. It's Carnegie.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:34.600]   Well, it might be like Pulitzer. Like there's the Pulitzer
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:38.560]   there. It's Pulitzer prize. But you know, it's Pulitzer prize.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:41.560]   It's Pulitzer prize. But the Pulitzer family likes Pulitzer.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:46.320]   So it might be like that. Oh, so it's like, if in gift,
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.240]   gift, it's not the noble prize. So I'll tell you that right
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.840]   now. That's a really interesting. So it might be the
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.800]   Carnegie found Carnegie Foundation is different than
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.480]   Carnegie Carnegie, right? Or Carnegie Mellon. Because I know
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.000]   it's Carnegie Mellon, not Carnegie Mellon. Right. But his
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.160]   family found it all of them, right? Yeah. So it's confusing.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:12.720]   Okay, sorry. That total non sequitur. Yeah. But you know
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:16.080]   what? If they're saying Carnegie on NPR, I feel like they
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.800]   would know, right? They're paying for NPR to pronounce it
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:24.120]   correctly. Exactly. And the money came from the
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.320]   Carnegie's Carnegie.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:30.920]   Switch to the British pronunciation on top there. You
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:33.600]   think it's British? I don't know. I'm just curious what it says
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.020]   it's got a
[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:34.400]   vicious
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:34.560]   new
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.340]   Carnegie
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:36.440]   Carnegie.
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.160]   Carnegie. But you know what? Scottish might be Carnegie
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:43.440]   Carnegie. I play golf. And I hate
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.480]   good. Who started on going?
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:52.760]   You did I want some whiskey. It's pronounced is kebab.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.440]   It's done. No, you don't know. Wait a minute. Here it is.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:02.320]   English with Julian had a pronounced Carnegie correctly.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.240]   Let's see.
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:10.400]   We are looking at how to pronounce his name as well as how to say
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:13.920]   more interesting names in English. So make sure to stay tuned
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:17.000]   and consider subscribing language. This guy's speech. You say
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.840]   Carnegie, Carnegie, pretty straightforward. Once you know
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:27.320]   Carnegie. So he sounds like he's from somewhere. Right. And now
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.040]   you know
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.040]   it's happening with him.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:36.560]   He's been in the bottle. He's if his if his pronounce kind of
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:39.600]   you. What else? What else does he tell you to pronounce? What is
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.680]   he have a whole site? Yeah, so yeah, Julian McEd is his whole
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:44.840]   site. It's all
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:49.320]   by the Lord. Yeah. It's probably telling you how to pronounce
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:54.880]   boy and shed all. Here we go. It'd be a French. Oh, yes.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:58.320]   I'm sure we can hear of social video. Oh, he's trying.
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:03.080]   This is how to pronounce what and Chandon and more importantly,
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:06.960]   why you shouldn't pronounce it any other way. There is an
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.600]   eternal debate on whether you should. It's what a chandon
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:13.960]   chandon or what was in chanway. So let's clear things up
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:17.160]   at once and for all. Here's the one I want to watch.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.440]   That's the one I want to be looking at how to pronounce the
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:22.880]   name of newborn baby of Canadian singer Grimes and Tesla's
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:28.080]   CEO Elon Musk spelt X, A12. It isn't clear at this point if
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.040]   this is the actual name of the baby and how the parents will
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.240]   want it to be pronounced if it turns out to be congrats to
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:37.600]   Grimes and Elon in any case. So I'm specially did it might be
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:41.600]   a code tweeted by Elon to say the name is Xavier others wonder
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:44.560]   if it might be a joke for what we know or can speculate upon
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:47.560]   these name could be pronounced as X. You want to know how many
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.320]   views this video has just out of curiosity you want to know
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.600]   1.19 million views.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:59.280]   Clickbait. We were discussing this earlier. The thing is that
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:02.440]   the AE is pronounced ash and I think that's the name. I didn't
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.360]   know that. Yeah.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:04.760]   Did you know that?
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:11.520]   No, the X and A12 is just extra crap. Ash. I think there's
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:15.560]   a crash. Anyway, wait a minute. Wait a minute. New York
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:19.160]   Times weighing in Michael Pollock in the New York Times
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:24.000]   FYI. I always thought the concert hall on 57th Street was
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.600]   pronounced Carnegie Hall. Now I hear announcers on national
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.400]   public radio refer to the Carnegie Corporation. What did
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:34.760]   Mr. Carnegie himself prefer the definitive New York
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:38.440]   Mr. Carnegie was of course Burns Scottish and the
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:43.640]   Karnek pronunciation of his name is Carnegie says Susan King
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:47.120]   as spokesperson for the Carnegie Corporation of New York.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:51.400]   Oh, and it was seconded by Carnegie Mellon. That
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:55.920]   pronunciation was second by a spokesperson for Carnegie
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:02.960]   Mellon University Angus McTavish Mcgee who's who checked in
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:07.920]   with a linguist on the facility. So he was born and done
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.680]   for malign Scotland, which I'm sure I'm saying. I think I
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.640]   think you didn't pronounce that right. Done. Firmline.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:18.480]   Done. Firmline. Ladi. Say it right. I don't get no scab.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:23.680]   Um, King is the dean at UNC's School of Journalism who's been
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:29.160]   trying to give tenure to the Cole Hannah Jones. Oh, heat of
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.360]   all that story. You know, interesting. No, I don't know
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:34.840]   about that story. Oh, you don't know. This is really gonna
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:38.160]   be a step step off. Who's the Cole Hannah Jones? Between them
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:42.680]   is your time. The University of Maryland has now jumped in and
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:47.600]   tried to back up this professor because of her lack of
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:51.320]   getting tenure. Is that right? Mr. Jarvis? Yeah, a lot. So I
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.880]   started a letter actually with 300 journals and professors who
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:00.120]   cited in protest to the Board of Trustees at the university.
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.040]   And I then had a conversation with the head of the Board of
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:05.640]   Trustees, which was interesting. So she's an African, a black
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:09.400]   African American investigative journalist. She's been the 1619
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:12.680]   project of the New York Times. Oh, I love the 1619 project.
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:16.760]   Well, Bob's not gonna like you for that. I'm telling you. Bob's
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:21.080]   gonna be very mad at you for that. And as I said, Bob stopped
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:25.280]   listening. As we now know, before we were on the air,
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:28.360]   folks, although, you know, there is our show title Bob is
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:33.400]   unimpressed. Bob is unimpressed. So because so the the
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:37.920]   premise of this is because the 1619 project was in some way,
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:42.400]   not historically accurate, which it was, but was some people
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:45.400]   feel it wasn't. Actually, the argument isn't really about
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:51.120]   the facts. The argument is, would it be better not to dwell on
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:55.880]   the fact that this nation was born in slavery? And to have not
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:59.240]   been dwelling on for a while, and we have not gotten very far.
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.160]   So I think it's time to actually know. I don't think it makes
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:05.440]   the fact that slavery existed. And you know, that George
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.120]   Washington and Thomas Jefferson was an at Madison were
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:12.160]   slaveholders and all of that. But to say, but the people don't
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.480]   like 1619 projects that well, you shouldn't be saying the
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.920]   founding fathers are pro slavery. You know, they didn't want to
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:21.960]   be a funder to the husband school of journalism who runs a
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:24.760]   paper in Arkansas and gave the money on the condition of
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:27.840]   the law. They would chisel his words on the school literally.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.400]   So husband sent letters of complaint to the deans who's in
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:34.080]   king and to the administration and board of the school, which
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:37.480]   is not a cool thing for a funder to do. Let us be clear in
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.960]   which he said, well, she didn't give enough credit to white
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.040]   people. There were a lot of white people who helped out. She
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.960]   said that black people had to do this alone. That's just that's
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.720]   just not true. There were some Jews who helped too. We
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:49.600]   others can't said that. And that's that's kind of one of
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:53.800]   that any Scott Smith helped. That's what I'd like to know.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:19:00.040]   Oh, man. So husband is a husband owns newspapers. And
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:05.240]   anyway, yeah, you're right. A funder shouldn't get to say, you
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.440]   know, with no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:13.520]   universities ethics are so so and you're right. I know nor
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:19.400]   should advertisers but that's pronounced Carnegie dammit.
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:25.280]   Sorry, that was hilarious. I know. What did they say? I missed
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:29.200]   it. I missed it because I was saying what I was saying. Lots
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:33.320]   of lots and lots of posts in the show now. reported the
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:36.680]   call on Jones. And there's a list of like 30 petitions and
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:41.520]   letters from universities from the students at the school from
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.640]   faculty at the school there and raged that the board of trustees
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:49.120]   is not offered her tenure. So yes, yeah. So,
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:52.360]   one of the stars of the field. Yeah, by the way, if you get a
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:56.000]   chance to listen to 1619, you really should. I think it's
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.960]   important part of every Americans education. Not, you know,
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:05.040]   not to say we're a bad country and we're bad people and and all
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:09.760]   that but you got to know our history and it's a shameful
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:13.440]   history in many respects history and evolve and so that we can
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:17.400]   go be better off so that we can do better. Yeah. And you can
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:21.160]   never I mean, unless you review your mistakes, we look at error
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:23.960]   reports and engineering unless you review your mistakes, you're
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.840]   never going to be able to fix it. I think that's fair. I'm sorry,
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:29.080]   Bob, but it's the truth. I had a colleague try to argue that,
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:32.120]   you know, objective journalism and we just told people how a
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.200]   bill passes. I said, we're going to tell them how bill passes,
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:37.080]   then you better talk about the filibuster and its racist
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:42.240]   roots. Yeah. You know, it's funny that I think for years,
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:45.160]   people didn't really can think about that or the electoral
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:50.720]   college or the Senate and the real reasons why there's a north
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:54.640]   and south Dakota and a West Virginia and a Virginia. And I
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:58.040]   think that that history needs to be explained because otherwise,
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.520]   you say, well, no, we've always had the filibuster. We have it.
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:05.400]   Oh, we have it. And and we certainly have not always had the
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:09.320]   email filibuster, which really is kind of appalling. You don't
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:12.680]   even have to at least Jimmy Stewart had to go out there at the
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:16.680]   floor of the Congress and get a horse talking and talking and
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:20.360]   talking. I would think honestly, probably that movie, what is
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:24.920]   it? Mr. Smith goes to Washington. That movie single
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:29.600]   handedly made the filibuster part of the American mythos. Right?
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:32.280]   Because he filibustered, but he actually had to speak. Now you
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:35.320]   can send an email. Mine was when Leslie no PED to filibuster.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:45.960]   On roller skates, no less. That I want to see. Was that at the
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:49.680]   town, the city council meeting? Yes, it was the city council
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:54.560]   meeting. I didn't know they had the filibuster. Mr Smith goes
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:22:00.160]   to Washington. He very famously. I was to ask my distinguished
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:00.920]   colleagues, he,
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:04.480]   crap, I've evidence that now to the defense, he did not give and
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.160]   could not give that same here. I have no defense against Ford's
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.560]   paper. Come in here. Otherwise. So towards the end of the
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.080]   filibuster, he's really tired. He's been, he's been talking for
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:17.920]   hours and hours. It's a Frank Capra movie. Let me see if I can
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:21.680]   find the end of the filibuster because Jimmy Stewart sprayed his
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:25.000]   throat with something that would make him horse so that, you
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.640]   know, oh, wow, you know, I don't know if I can find that clip.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:33.560]   Everything's, here he is, everything's on YouTube, which is
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:39.560]   pretty cool. And sometimes that was caused by the floor of the
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.080]   Senate, filibuster.
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:48.560]   All you people don't know, it's been hours. This is why we
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:48.560]   think,
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:54.080]   Leslie Nopes, filibuster was about voting rights. There you go.
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:58.920]   There you go. But I swear to God, this is, this is really where
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:03.240]   our sense of history comes from the movies. Narratives are so
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:08.400]   powerful. I mean, nobody's in that room in real life. Yeah. He's
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:12.200]   speaking to, yeah, no, look at their thing. There's standing
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:17.440]   room only in the Senate in the movie. You know, anyway, great
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:22.400]   movie. But maybe not the best argument for a filibuster.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:27.120]   Let's take a little break. We will come back with more. Actually,
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:31.280]   one more. There is one more story because we're talking about
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:34.160]   advertising. I should probably mention the Google. This from the
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:38.080]   Financial Times boosts Android privacy protections in an attempt
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:41.160]   to rival Apple. Remember, Apple got a lot of heat from Facebook
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:48.000]   for having, allowing you to turn off tracking. Android users can
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.240]   do that in the settings, but developers have been able to
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:55.080]   circumvent those settings by relying on alternative device
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:58.480]   identifiers. Google is now cracking down on that. They announced
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:02.640]   yesterday or today in an email to place to our developers that
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:05.400]   they wanted to provide users with more control over their data.
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:10.640]   And so following the overall developers who try to access access,
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:15.240]   the advertising IDs of people who have opted out, actually, this
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:18.080]   was last week, have people who have opted out will receive a
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:22.040]   string of zeros instead of the identifier. So Google said, we
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.280]   can do that. We do that. We do that. It's the same thing,
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:29.800]   though. We've said this before. Google, Apple, Facebook, they're
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.640]   all first party. And all that you're blocking is third party at
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:38.640]   this point. And I've been saying that for years. Yeah. Yeah. I
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.800]   can tell you the first time I started saying it for all the
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:45.160]   years. I caught you, Jeff. I was like, Oh, no. Was it a board
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:45.640]   meeting?
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:52.920]   Night Ritter Foundation. Jeff, please, I'm so sorry. I don't
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:57.880]   mean to hurt your feelings. I love you. I love your anecdotes. I
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:03.400]   think you're the greatest. Oh, feel bad now. I feel bad. Let's
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:08.560]   take note. No, I seriously do. I was joking. I can't tell if you
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:11.640]   guys are like being real or not. It tried. It hurts my hair.
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.760]   It's a little heart. I am sincere. Never. No, no, I am
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:17.840]   being completely sincere. Well, I know you're being sincere, but
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.480]   I'm like, is Jeff sincere? Does it really hurt? Oh my God. What
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:23.000]   have we heard? Jeff's feelings. I hope we didn't hurt your
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.560]   feelings, Jeff. Look at that face. It's still pink. But he
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:33.960]   does seem sad. You actually do that really well, Jeff. Yeah, I'm
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:40.480]   impressed. My acting career is the well, apparently your Scottish
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:43.280]   accents better than mine, according to the chat room. I
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:46.560]   was wrong. Probably somebody from Scotland. I was I was
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.200]   Carnegie Carnegie is correct. You know, I'm glad we found that
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.520]   article because that's actually a really interesting question.
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:58.800]   That was by the way, the New York Times in 2004. So it has been
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.520]   resolved for some time. NPR is doing it right. If none of us
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:05.320]   are going to change our way. This is going to be the gift gift.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:08.640]   No, no, we're going to sound like like we're NPR snobs. We I go
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:13.880]   to the corner. You know, Jeff, Jeff, we already sound like NPR
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:19.120]   snobs. No, I have no reason to say Carnegie or Carnegie hardly
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:24.200]   ever so long. But but aunt, you now live in Petaluma where there
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:28.280]   is a Carnegie free library. Did you know that? You got to have
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.960]   seen that. Yeah, it's a beautiful building. That's that's an
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.840]   important part of history, which I would go into. But I don't
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:38.160]   dare. No, no, no, no, no, I remember when steel baton Andrew
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:42.920]   Carnegie decided to anyway, that is
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:47.360]   imported libraries across free libraries everywhere literacy
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.160]   in America, because he felt so guilty about his rapacious
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:54.080]   career as the creator of US steel. And he felt he should do
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:57.160]   something to make it up for it. And he did just like Bill Gates,
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:02.360]   he did. Our free library is beautiful. It still says free
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.600]   public library in the face. But is now it's really too small to
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.640]   be a decent library. It's tiny. But it's now the Petaluma History
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.880]   Museum, which is perfectly sized for so.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.320]   Or show they brought so much history. There is only there's
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:16.040]   not a whole lot.
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:20.240]   Look at the chickens. They don't even know. I was meant to say
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:23.560]   are there chickens at the museum? Definitely. Undoubtedly.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:26.080]   They don't even know where the name Petaluma came from. They
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:29.080]   have no idea. Yeah, they don't know. They think it might be an
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:32.760]   Indian word, but they don't know. That's how that's sad,
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:36.360]   isn't it? You go to you know, it was like 100 years ago, 150
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:41.440]   years ago, and they don't know. Nobody wrote it down. Our
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:44.200]   show today brought to you by Oh, I'll tell you something. This
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:49.280]   advertiser, this advertiser loves us because this it no not Jeff
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:53.160]   Jarvis. This advertiser loves us because do you have it?
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:59.040]   Nareva because we send people to Nareva in droves. But you
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:03.400]   know what? This is an example of yes, we're a good network
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:06.560]   with good ads. And I do a good job. But honestly, if you don't
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:10.520]   have a great product, nobody, it doesn't matter. Nareva has not
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:13.440]   only a great product, but a product whose time is right.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:16.520]   People are going back to the office, right? But we know that
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:19.280]   the way we meet is going to change. Distancing can have big
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:23.240]   implications for meeting remote. You know, you're going to
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:26.400]   probably have to change your room configuration, assure social
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.760]   distancing. But you still want good mic coverage when people
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:32.600]   are distancing in a meeting space. And that's why you need a
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:37.800]   Nareva microphone. Nareva audio is amazing. It's not a beam
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:40.440]   forming system. That's complicated. You need to get a
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.040]   technician in there. Plus, you're gonna have to put marks on
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.360]   the table because people are going to have to sit where the
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:49.600]   beam forms tabletop systems, you could have lots of mics, but
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.760]   then they have to be sanitized between meetings. And again,
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:54.600]   they're going to require people change your behavior. You're
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:56.240]   going to have to sit and pre determine spots are going to
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:59.040]   have to face a certain way. Wouldn't it be awesome if you could
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:03.840]   get clear, reliable audio, but your team could act naturally,
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:08.080]   feel safe, be separated appropriately. One analyst called
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:11.760]   Nareva audio, the first socially distanced mic system is
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.160]   super cool. Four patents on this technology, they call it
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:19.840]   microphone mist technology is designed specifically for
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:25.640]   distancing. The Nareva is a sound bar. It's a it's a speaker
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:30.560]   plus microphones, you can mount it yourself on the wall. But it
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:33.800]   fills the room computationally with thousands of virtual
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:37.440]   microphones. And the audio will automatically adapt to any
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:39.920]   configuration. It doesn't matter where people are sitting,
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:45.720]   standing, facing. Every one of them is on mic. The HTL 300
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:48.400]   system. This is their big system becomes it's the first
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:51.560]   microphone and speaker bar to be certified for meetings, large
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:55.280]   meeting spaces up to 15 feet by 28 feet. You could have an all
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.360]   hands meeting with this thing. There it is, by the way, on the
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:01.200]   wall. Look how good it looks. If you'll get full room coverage,
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.160]   people can be heard from anywhere in the room. You don't
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:06.520]   need to bring in technicians, you can install it yourself. It's
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:10.800]   easy to do. Nareva console comes with every Nareva system, you
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:13.560]   puts device management into your hands and on your terms, you
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:16.600]   can adjust settings, install firmware updates, check device
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:20.520]   status and more offer a secure cloud based platform. The
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.160]   console, by the way, comes with every Nareva audio system. And
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:26.400]   by the way, when you enroll your system, you're going to get an
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:29.840]   extra year of warranty, absolutely free. Nareva audio
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:35.960]   products, they won awards, the HTL 200, the medium size system,
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:40.320]   got the top new technology award at ISE 2020. But they have a
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:42.960]   full line of systems for small, medium and large spaces. They
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:45.840]   use it at HubSpot. Jimmy Yan, whose HubSpot's principal
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:48.520]   collaboration engineer said, we were so impressed with the
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:51.360]   sound quality, the ease of installing the ease of use of the
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:55.080]   HTL 300. They got the big boy. It was a no brainer for us to
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:59.440]   adopt it. I think, you know, it's exciting. We're getting to
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:01.640]   come back to work, but you still have to protect your
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:04.920]   employees to learn more about how Nareva audio is the simple
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:08.560]   cost effective way to let your teams distance in meetings and
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:12.840]   still act and converse naturally visit nareva.com and you are
[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:19.760]   eva nareva.com/twit. Nareva. So when you have the right
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:24.480]   product for the right time, you're in the right place Nareva.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:30.520]   N-U-R-E-V-A.com/twit. We thank Nareva for their support of this
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:32.840]   weekend. Google, notice, see they're smart. They're using the
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:36.640]   slash twit. But I hope you will use it too so that they know you
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:38.960]   saw it here. That's important to them. It's important to us.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:49.480]   Noreva.com/twit. And now back to the waffles. Oh, oh, oh,
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:57.520]   coder. I can see everything. Stacey. I know what's going on.
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:01.760]   That looks really good. Is that an ego or is that homemade?
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:07.280]   Um, I think it's an ego. Yeah. We found that the Safeway
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:10.520]   signature brand is different, but also good. This is an ego
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:14.560]   with sweeter, I think. Yeah. Yeah. I have one of those Belgian
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:17.880]   wafflers that you flip over. Of course you do. Oh, yeah. I
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:21.480]   have one of those two. I have a waffle maker. We use it.
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:25.120]   So great. I love waffles. Can't eat them, but I love them. I like
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:28.200]   doing that in hotels and the breakfast bar of the hotel. It
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:30.960]   feels like it's on vacation. They get their big. I remember
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:34.160]   when some time ago, are you? Are you gonna remember?
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:37.880]   No. Yes. You're gonna go back and every back like that. I
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:39.840]   think I've already told this story. So I'm gonna tell it
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:43.840]   again. Because not everybody listens to every show. We know
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:48.440]   that. I was in Tasmania in Australia, traveling with a
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:52.200]   group of photographers about 2009. Did I mention this the
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:55.800]   hotel? I did mention this had a bread maker in the room. And
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:58.160]   when they made up the room, they would replenish the bread
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:01.320]   maker with flour and water. And then you'd set the timer and
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:05.160]   seven a.m. instead of an alarm, the scent of fresh bread.
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:09.680]   It's the only thing about this. I want to go there. I know.
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:12.640]   Isn't that awesome? Yes. I don't know why more places don't
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:17.400]   do that. That's the best alarm ever. Please and thank you.
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:19.680]   And this like, and then when they're making up the room, they
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:23.040]   just read, you know, they take out the old bread and they put
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:26.920]   it fresh ingredients. All right, I don't know. I'm sorry. Many
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:27.640]   years ago,
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:33.920]   about years ago, you and I, you and I were peas in a pod. That's
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:38.280]   the problem. That's really the problem. German more like
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:45.560]   oil and water German. But with oil and water, you know what you
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:49.400]   get a delicious salad dressing salad dressing. Yeah. Yeah,
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.320]   people love salad dressing. Let me tell you.
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:58.840]   Oil and vinegar. Anyway, Google News Showcase targeted by
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:06.080]   Germany, anti-trust chief Andreas Moot. That's a great name.
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:11.400]   What are they? What are they mad about this time? Google
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:15.120]   requires people to do things to be in the like have fast pages
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:18.160]   to be in the showcase of. Oh, you have to be amped or something
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:21.280]   like that. No, no, not anymore. You don't. But you know, it's
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:23.880]   fair though that the page should load quickly and shouldn't be
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:27.120]   paid. So and so, you know, if you imagine if you're Google, you
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:30.280]   just say, okay, fine, fine. Let's be Australian. Let's just get
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:33.680]   rid of the news. You guys are too much trouble. You're not
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:37.120]   worth it. Fine. We'll just get rid of it. And it's what's going
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:40.680]   to happen at some point. They're well, they haven't they're
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:45.440]   just going to check to see if Google offers unreasonable
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:48.320]   conditions to publishers involved and whether they hamper
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:52.760]   them using extra copyright introduced under a law passed
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:54.920]   last month. Well, that's that's the other thing is you have the
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:59.520]   ready for it. Lijstern schütztrecht. Lijstern schütztrecht.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:05.280]   Is that moral panic in German? It's pronounced carnege.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:09.760]   Is there a penancer for Lijstern schütztrecht? Oh, sure
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:17.240]   there is. Yeah. L E I C H T Z U N G R E C H T. Am I right?
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:20.080]   It's not like every time I try to say it and I have to wipe my
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.040]   mouth afterwards.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:27.360]   Beard is it's T is like ST.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:34.680]   I stonks L E I S T U N G S. Lijstern schütz S C H U T Z.
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:39.600]   Correct. R E C H T. You you would think that Google would
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:43.800]   automatically correct me if I got even close. Don't you just say
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:46.440]   pronounce if you had the word pronounce? Yeah, I just but I
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:50.080]   have to type that lights and chukery thing. Oh, I first
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:56.480]   vice dorms L E I S T U N G S. Isn't this exciting radio people?
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:57.880]   This is great.
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:02.440]   Pro nouns, belling time. Oh, yeah. Look, look, look, there is
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:04.760]   such a thing. No, there isn't such a thing.
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:07.240]   There isn't. Okay, never mind. Yeah. So yeah, this is this is
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:10.080]   that they were saying that, you know, if you if you so much
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:13.880]   as take a picture of of me, you've stolen my soul and my value,
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:17.880]   and you owe me money. And it's the ancillary copyright regime,
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:21.080]   which existed in Germany. Oh, it's an additional copyright.
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:22.560]   That's that that's interesting.
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:28.600]   Oh, boy. Yeah, isn't that funny? There is no
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:33.000]   pronounceer for that. I don't think that maybe no German
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.880]   wanted Google to suck out their soul or their privacy by
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:37.960]   pronounced. By the way, that's the problem is I'm using Google
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:42.600]   to find it. Yeah. Chris Ray, the wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.440]   I got here.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:49.840]   Hold on. Hold on.
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:57.160]   Liestungs, right. Liestungs.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:59.040]   That's just exactly what you say.
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:03.920]   Nice. Yeah. I was not assuming you were saying it wrong. I
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:06.720]   might have, I might have. You just try to be nice now.
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:10.640]   That's all. Should we do a Google change?
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:14.240]   Let's do it. Bring it. Bring it.
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:17.640]   The Google change log.
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:22.880]   Hello, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:27.800]   there is a new Google undersea cable.
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:31.520]   Does that count for a change log? No, no, Jason.
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:34.040]   Sorry. Nah. No, I know.
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:34.720]   I love it.
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:37.800]   Jason did not put it in there.
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:41.200]   I was thinking if he did not specifically put it in there,
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:42.640]   he put it in the regular news.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:45.080]   But I was thinking this should be in the change log.
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:46.240]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:51.680]   This is to handle a data surge between the US, Brazil and Argentina.
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:54.440]   It's a possibly interesting story, but it's not a change.
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:55.800]   It's totally an interesting story.
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:59.880]   What affects your life on Google in La Vida Google?
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:01.800]   This is a corporate story.
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:03.120]   I've originally.
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:07.440]   It's actually, I would say it's a trend story because think about data
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:10.160]   cables as the opening of a new shipping lane.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:14.640]   So you're being able to see where goods and products are flowing.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:17.360]   These are just digital goods and products.
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:18.320]   And there's the data.
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:21.920]   So we go with underwater a mud landslide.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:24.320]   You see that story this week? No.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:28.600]   So it turns out there was a huge underwater mud landslide.
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:31.360]   And they only knew about it because it cut off a whole bunch of cables.
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:32.880]   Oh, that's bad.
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:35.560]   Cable's actually getting cut off it.
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:36.960]   Yes.
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:40.080]   Be cash collie is the vice president of global networking.
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.480]   VP of global.
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:44.960]   I have a telegeography submarine cable map.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:46.600]   I know I want that map.
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:47.760]   I love that map.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:48.360]   I had one.
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:49.280]   Changes every year.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:50.160]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:51.360]   I mind's out of date.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.040]   Vice President Global Networking at Google says, and this is a great quote.
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.440]   Internet infrastructure is not in the cloud.
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:59.560]   It's under the ocean.
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:00.720]   Oh, that is a good quote.
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:01.960]   And it makes sense.
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:03.560]   Times out on that all the time.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:05.600]   Well, we always think of it as a cloud.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:08.480]   But honestly, there's no wires in the cloud.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:12.240]   Those all those interconnects are either underground or under the ocean.
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:17.040]   Or they're in a giant data center somewhere near you.
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:17.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.440]   But if they get somewhere, it's yeah, right.
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:24.800]   98% of international data travels on submarine cables draped across the bottom
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.040]   of the oceans and the seas.
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:34.800]   Actually, as it does with the Google doodles, according to CNET,
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:38.360]   Google plays homage to notable figures with its submarine cable names.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.840]   This cable named for Mina.
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:43.240]   They named the cables?
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:45.400]   This is for Mina.
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:47.200]   That's Josie, the cable?
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:51.480]   Well, I don't think I want him Josie, but maybe the pussycats.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:52.160]   I don't know.
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:55.840]   The fiber optic line is named after a Brazilian abolitionist.
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:02.000]   Her full name, which I will find out in a moment because it's
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:07.160]   in this article is Maria Fermina dos Reis.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:12.800]   A mixed race author wrote about the lives of Afro-Brazilian slaves in her 1859
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:13.840]   novel Ursula.
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:19.120]   Google had a Google doodle about her in 2019 on her birthday.
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:22.200]   There's a subsea cable called Grace Hopper.
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.040]   Yep.
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:25.160]   They're in alphabetical order.
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:29.320]   So Fermina will be followed by Grace Hopper.
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:34.040]   Earlier, Google cables are named Curie after Marie Curie.
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:35.960]   Do not do not.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:37.400]   I don't know who do not is.
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:39.880]   That's the table table.
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:42.120]   They do not do not do not.
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:44.480]   No, that was done.
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:45.480]   It's cousin to the car.
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:46.240]   Do not.
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:55.080]   In the 1858, Queen Victoria sent the first transatlantic telegram to James Buchanan,
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:58.080]   president of the United States, Morse code.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:06.280]   And New York Times at the time said that it was New York went cable mad.
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:07.080]   Oh, wow.
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:11.040]   People took off of work, that there were fireworks set off, that there were parades
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:11.880]   down Broadway.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.080]   Honestly, that's bullet.
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:14.600]   Can you imagine what a shift?
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:17.960]   Because then you'd have to put it on a boat and it would be days.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:18.800]   Yes.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:22.760]   And then about, I don't know, a week or two later, the cable broke, as
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.480]   Stacy was saying.
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:25.760]   Oh, it was kind of like, oh, never mind.
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.320]   They didn't get it back for ages.
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:31.800]   It was the rate of that 1858 cable was one word per minute.
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:40.680]   The the Dunal undersea cable connects the US and France and transmits, get this 250
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:42.680]   terabits per second.
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:48.600]   Enough to transmit the entire library of Congress three times a second, 250 terabits.
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:52.200]   It is a record breaking cable.
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.080]   So that was D.
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:58.600]   Then there was Equiano, a subsea cable from Portugal to South Africa.
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:02.200]   These are all these are all Googles putting these in.
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:05.160]   Those are all the Google cables.
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:05.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:10.040]   So what happened is about 10 years ago, all of these big Facebook, Google,
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:13.720]   all the big cloud companies, they were like, oh crap.
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:16.120]   You know, we need to own this infrastructure.
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:20.120]   So they started investing and building and going in on their own subsea cables with
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:23.320]   like NTT Dokomo and other companies who are doing them.
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:28.040]   And now they're they're doing so much traffic that they can actually afford.
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:28.680]   I don't know how many.
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:29.320]   Do they charge?
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:30.520]   Is Google doing this on their own?
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.560]   Are they going to buy?
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:31.560]   Yeah.
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:32.920]   This is 100% funded by Google.
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:34.280]   So that's new.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:37.880]   Interconnects or I mean, they must, right?
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:39.160]   They must make money on it.
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:42.520]   So here's the map of 14 undersea cables from Google.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:50.840]   Dunal, Equiano, Monet, Curie, Hunyar, Tanat, Indigo, SJC.
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:43:02.200]   So Equiano, which is interesting, is named after Olauda, Equiano, a Nigerian-born writer
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.280]   and abolitionist who was enslaved as a boy.
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:06.840]   So another, yet another abolitionist.
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:10.920]   So that's really amazing.
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:13.320]   That's got to be a huge expenditure.
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.520]   It is.
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:16.040]   They're multi-billion dollar things.
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:16.680]   Are they really?
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:17.160]   Yeah.
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:17.480]   Wow.
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:21.720]   Well, you got to get a boat to go and lay it and then you have to keep it up.
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:22.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:25.800]   No, it's not a rowboat.
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:35.640]   So this new undersea cable Fermina, they didn't say the capacity,
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:39.880]   but it carries data on 12 pairs of fiber optic lines.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:40.920]   That's not very much.
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:47.000]   I mean, it's a lot of data, but it's not a huge thick bundle, 12 pairs.
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.080]   No, the undersea cables, if you look at pictures of them and you can Google that and find them,
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.840]   they're fat cables, but they're not like-
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:55.800]   Most of it's not like a culvert, like a giant culvert.
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:57.080]   Most of it is the sheathing?
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:58.280]   Yeah, I bet.
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:43:59.880]   There's the sheathing and they're not there.
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:04.200]   Sheathed actually in flexible stuff and they get cut all the time, right?
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:04.200]   Right.
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:07.560]   Where, because they all come up on land in like,
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:11.720]   huts on beaches, they're getting more secure now because there was a whole,
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:16.360]   I don't know if y'all remember, there was a spate of internet outages where people were attacking
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:18.440]   these huts basically.
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:19.880]   Oh, probably saw it.
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:21.160]   It caused COVID, right?
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:27.320]   No, but they did think that it would actually change the orbit of the Earth.
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:35.240]   So they contracted this after a company called Subcon that designs and manufactures the cable
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:36.840]   in Newington, New Hampshire.
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:38.280]   They'll install it next summer.
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:43.800]   One unusual aspect of the cable according to CNET is it can be powered from either end,
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:49.160]   increasing reliability on more common designs that rely on power from both ends
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:49.960]   all the time.
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:59.240]   So the single end feed power, 18 kilovolts, which is a lot more than conventional designs.
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:01.960]   It'll be the longest cable to use that technology.
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:03.480]   So there you go.
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:07.240]   That's not even part of the changelog, but that was a very long
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:09.400]   bit on the cable.
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:11.000]   Yeah, it's why it didn't fit the changelog.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.040]   It was a story.
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:13.000]   It's more a story.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:13.640]   No, I changed.
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:16.600]   The changelog is a little thing you might want to know about your life with people changing this
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:16.840]   week.
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:18.280]   Everything you say is a representation.
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:20.680]   Neither of you thought this was interesting a few minutes ago.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:22.200]   No, no, no, no, I said it was interesting.
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:23.800]   It wasn't changelog.
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:25.640]   It was above changelog's name.
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:25.720]   I did not say it was interesting.
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:26.680]   I just said it was new.
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:28.600]   Do you say it's interesting now?
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:30.280]   And after all that, do you think it was interesting?
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:32.040]   I just said it was new.
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.240]   I didn't say it was interesting.
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:36.040]   Android 12 Beta 2 comes out today.
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:41.560]   Finally, you're going to get the wallpaper-based material U-color themes.
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:44.200]   It didn't come with the first Beta, public Beta.
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:50.440]   So if you're in the public Beta update, so you can get that material U-color themes,
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:55.480]   I am sad because my Pixel 4 phone, I have a Pixel 4 XL.
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:58.040]   I didn't upgrade to the 5, is delaminating.
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:45:58.920]   The back is coming off.
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:01.800]   And I'm worried that it might be the battery swelling, but I don't see any swelling.
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:03.320]   But it is starting to fall.
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:04.920]   Oh, I didn't think it thought the battery.
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:05.480]   Yeah.
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:06.520]   I saw it Sunday.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:08.200]   Yeah, I was shocked.
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:08.920]   It didn't look good.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:09.240]   No.
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:13.640]   But I want to keep it because I want to keep playing with Android 12.
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:14.760]   All right.
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:19.640]   Google has unveiled a $99 Pixel Bud A series.
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:24.840]   Upgraded connectivity doesn't have the volume swipe gesture, but it is inexpensive.
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:25.880]   You want to try it again?
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:27.160]   Jeff?
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:28.200]   This is my question show.
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:29.000]   So here's the...
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.240]   Do I order before the show's over?
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:33.000]   Do you have a reverse deal on me?
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:33.400]   No, it does.
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:33.400]   No.
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:33.480]   Oh.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.840]   If they were 79, yes.
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:38.840]   Do you need them to be wireless?
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:46.200]   Actually, now that it's getting really hot, I'm wearing my headphones and it's a little sweaty
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:46.920]   out there walking.
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:48.440]   Not that you're walking.
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:51.640]   So you do or don't want wireless?
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:53.640]   Do you want wireless?
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:54.040]   Yes, I do.
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:55.320]   You got to try it.
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:56.600]   We all want them to have wireless.
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:00.040]   So there are some really good, but they're more expensive than $99.
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:01.960]   You don't want them to have so many years.
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:03.800]   Wireless headphones.
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:07.080]   Sony just came out with a pair that's getting very good reviews.
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:08.840]   Like, with just like $208.
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:09.880]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:12.360]   Decent headphones are going to cost you more than $99.
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:13.800]   I'm listening to the book.
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:14.760]   My job is...
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:15.480]   So...
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:15.960]   I agree.
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.000]   The job is great.
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.920]   The Jabra 65 tees are the old ones that I have had forever
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:24.680]   and ran through the washing machine and the dryer twice.
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:25.560]   They sound good.
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:29.080]   You can buy those now because they're like three years old,
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:32.520]   but they sound good on calls and they play very well.
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:34.520]   They're like 200 I think, right?
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:35.720]   No, no, no, no.
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:37.240]   The 65 tees now are late.
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:37.880]   Oh, because they're old.
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:39.000]   How much are they just?
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:39.560]   Yeah.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:40.840]   Yeah, that's what I have.
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:41.880]   Oh.
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:42.360]   Oh.
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:43.880]   Yeah, they're good.
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:44.760]   They're okay.
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:45.240]   I just...
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:48.200]   I really liked the design and the sound of the buds.
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:50.600]   I just got so mad at them because they didn't work.
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:52.680]   And I think they've said there was a story somewhere.
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:53.560]   I think they went down saying,
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:54.440]   "This is how we fixed it."
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:54.680]   I don't know.
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:58.280]   Yes, supposedly they don't have the disconnect problems
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:00.520]   going through people with meaty heads.
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.120]   Hey.
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:04.040]   Now you're calling me...
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.480]   My head is meaty.
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:05.960]   Yeah.
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:07.720]   I'm irascible and I'm an old-farting...
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:09.720]   I'm a little irascible.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:10.760]   I'm an old-farting.
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:11.400]   I'm an old-farting.
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:12.840]   I'm an old-farting.
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:15.000]   This is what makes me irascible people.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.400]   His lower third continues to grow, folks.
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:18.040]   Yeah.
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:19.000]   I have ordered...
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.640]   I have ordered a pair of...
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:25.000]   Scott Wilkinson recommended Sennheiser,
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.320]   but they're wired headphones.
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:28.760]   The IE 300 earbuds.
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:29.080]   And they're...
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:29.720]   How much were those?
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:30.280]   Oh, they were three.
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.720]   Man, I love Sennheiser.
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:33.800]   But they sound so good.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:34.600]   I've ordered these.
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:35.720]   They're the new wireless.
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:36.680]   They're 250, though.
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:37.720]   The Momentum 2s.
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:40.120]   And I hear very good things.
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:43.000]   But way like get them and I'll let you know.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.920]   Because it's a big investment.
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:45.640]   It's expensive.
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:46.840]   But...
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:49.160]   But if you think about how much...
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:51.160]   This is my argument for paying a lot for a mattress.
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:53.400]   But if you think about how much you're on the phone
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:55.080]   and you have the calls or listening...
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:55.640]   Absolutely.
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:00.840]   But I have to say twice-spitting, third-time shy.
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.600]   I'm not going to buy the Pixel Buds.
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:08.360]   The Samsung Galaxy Buds are great.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:09.640]   Florence Ion still uses them.
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:10.520]   I still use mine.
[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:11.880]   Those are pretty old, too.
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:12.920]   I bet you can get those cheap.
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:18.600]   According to Google, they fixed the audio cutouts,
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:20.120]   which is the thing the butt of your right.
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:20.600]   How they do this?
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:21.880]   Yeah, ho ho, boy-jush.
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:22.200]   Yeah.
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:24.280]   Is this something about how?
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:24.680]   Yes.
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:26.200]   They...
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:29.400]   So, they say the Pixel Buds...
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:31.400]   The new ones, the A-series, don't do it.
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:36.680]   They try to fix it in software, but the problem is clearly hardware.
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:39.560]   So, 9 to 5, Google asked them.
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:44.360]   Google said one key change was made to avoid the problem,
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:47.640]   where the original Pixel Buds would connect one earbud to the phone
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:50.680]   and then relay the signal from the first earbud to the other
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:51.880]   through your meaty head.
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:55.640]   The A-series connects both to the phone.
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:57.480]   Doi.
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:00.440]   So, the problem was this transmission through your head wasn't working.
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:02.840]   Why was it worse when I was outside and walking?
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:04.040]   That's why it never made any sense to me.
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:05.240]   Maybe your breathing?
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:05.800]   We're more?
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:06.200]   I don't know.
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:06.680]   Maybe your...
[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:07.160]   I don't know.
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:13.000]   Anyway, because each pairs separately,
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.320]   I think everybody else does it this way by the way.
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:16.120]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:17.800]   You don't have that problem.
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:21.000]   I remember Google was kind of making a big deal about the fact that,
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:21.640]   "Oh yeah, we can...
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:22.840]   We'd send it through your head."
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:24.760]   Okay.
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:26.440]   It's a bad idea, Google.
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:27.480]   That idea, Google.
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:30.040]   Stadia is coming to Chromecast with Google TV,
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:33.640]   the newest Chromecast, and select Android TV devices,
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:35.880]   June 23rd.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:39.560]   So, it originally was for one particular Chromecast,
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:41.000]   but now you can do it with a new...
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.720]   And it was weird because they released a new Chromecast,
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:45.480]   the one with Google TV, and they said,
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:47.320]   "Yeah, but Stadia doesn't work on it."
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:48.360]   Well, good news.
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:50.600]   It does or will soon.
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:51.240]   So, you can...
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:51.960]   And I have that.
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:52.760]   It's actually...
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:53.480]   It's really great.
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:54.520]   It's like 25 bucks.
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:56.200]   I mean, it's nothing or 30 bucks.
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:57.560]   I really like it.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:01.640]   Stadia will also become available on a handful of Android TV
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:03.240]   and Google TV devices,
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:07.720]   devices including Walmart's $25 ONN dongle,
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:10.840]   the high-sense Android smart TVs,
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:12.840]   Nvidia Shield TV.
[01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:13.720]   Yes.
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:14.760]   Shield TV Pro.
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:16.120]   That's the one I have.
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:19.720]   Philips, a number of Philips OLEDs,
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:21.400]   and the regular TVs,
[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:24.840]   if you've got Android TV in the Xiaomi Mi Box 3 and 4.
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:26.200]   Stadia is...
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:26.680]   That's good.
[01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:27.880]   I like Stadia a lot.
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:31.960]   I think you still need to get the Stadia controller really,
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:37.640]   but now at least you can maybe do it on the device you already have.
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:40.680]   If you need a Stadia controller,
[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:41.560]   give me a holler.
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:41.960]   Really?
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:42.920]   I have one that I'm not using.
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:43.560]   You never use it?
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:46.520]   It's still sitting down there in front of the tub.
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:47.560]   Oh, that's a problem.
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:53.960]   By the way, that's not the only update to the Google Chromecast with Google TV.
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:56.040]   They're improving Bluetooth latency.
[01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:58.520]   In fact, the update is big.
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:51:59.960]   It's 83 megabytes.
[01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:02.120]   It's a minor software update,
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:04.040]   but that sounds pretty major to me.
[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:05.880]   This is coming out in June 23rd.
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:09.400]   Improvements on Bluetooth latency for speakers and headphones.
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:14.600]   Apparently, there was some stuttering and latency,
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:16.760]   of course, terrible and something like that,
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:19.240]   because the lip sync is so important.
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:27.160]   So advanced video settings don't reset after reboots on some TVs
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:29.320]   and additional bug fixes and performance improvements.
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:33.000]   Download the update on your Chromecast with Google TV.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.960]   Every month, Pixel does not only a security update,
[01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:40.600]   but a feature drop, the June feature drop includes,
[01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:44.680]   you'll like this, an astrophotography video,
[01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:50.360]   and that photos lock folder that Google talked about at Google I/O.
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:53.960]   I didn't have much to say about the photos lock folder,
[01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:57.640]   but the astro, this is actually compelling to me
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:00.680]   compared to the photograph that it creates,
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:04.120]   because the photograph is more of a simulation.
[01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:09.160]   But from a video standpoint, I think it would look pretty cool.
[01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:10.120]   It's going to be a time lapse.
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:13.160]   So if you wanted to get an eclipse or sunrise,
[01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:15.960]   or sunset to sunrise or something like that,
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:19.960]   you'll be able to do a time loss, which is really, really cool.
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:21.160]   These pixel drops are free.
[01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:24.760]   They just, you know, that's basically adding to the features of your phone.
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:30.120]   Astrophotography will now include night sight, time lapse video.
[01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:34.840]   You'll obviously need a tripod or something steady to put the phone on.
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:42.040]   And you'll need a Pixel 4 or newer with a night sight clip automatically generated.
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:46.920]   Three new pride wallpapers, pride-themed ringtones.
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:53.400]   I'm proud, I'm proud, a notification sound from LGBTQ+ artists and YouTube creators.
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:57.880]   And the new Google Assistant can now pick up or decline calls
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:01.560]   when your phone is ringing, but you can't reach it.
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:04.440]   You can answer or reject a call with Assistant.
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:09.400]   You say, "Hey, you know who answer call or hey, you know who reject call."
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:10.520]   You can shout at the phone.
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:13.960]   Take that.
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:15.240]   Yeah, love that.
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:16.760]   Reject.
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:21.480]   After copying text, Gboard, the Google keyboard will surface key snippets,
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:26.040]   phone numbers, email addresses and URLs with custom icons or pills in the suggestion strip.
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:27.480]   So that's kind of neat.
[01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:30.760]   If you copy the text, you could kind of see it.
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:34.200]   It's a little bit of a small screenshot, but you can kind of see it here in this nine
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:35.560]   to five Google article.
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:37.960]   See these little pills right above the keyboard?
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:40.760]   It said, you know, you should copy that or you got that message.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:43.960]   Oh, this was a phone number or, oh, this was an email address.
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:45.240]   So that's kind of neat.
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:45.880]   I like that.
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:51.480]   There is now car crash detection, the personal safety app.
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:53.240]   I'm sorry, there has been.
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:58.440]   It's already been in the UK, Australia and the US.
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:00.600]   It's now coming to Spain, Ireland, Singapore.
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:09.800]   Somebody spent some time at Google and coded a new feature to digital well-being to detect
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:13.080]   when you're walking and looking at your phone.
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:17.880]   The phone will it's called heads up surveillance.
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:22.600]   The phone will periodically remind you, hey, hey, look what you're, look where you're going.
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:24.600]   Pretend it's a city.
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:26.600]   I love that idea.
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:28.840]   I love that.
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:30.040]   Love that.
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:31.320]   It's called it's part of the heads up.
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:32.840]   It's case here on mute.
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:33.880]   I know.
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:34.600]   I just asked.
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:39.320]   I asked, does it do it in Fran Lee, but what's this voice?
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:40.520]   Pretend it's a city.
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:42.680]   That'd be great.
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:43.880]   That'd be so great.
[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:45.800]   I love that.
[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:51.480]   Weirdly, this is really not, this is a change log in the sense that something that's going away.
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:57.640]   Google, which has already given up on cardboard and the dream, whatever that was,
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:00.520]   3D viewer and all that stuff.
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:02.680]   It's now daydream.
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:03.480]   That's it.
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:06.120]   It's now pulling the plug on the measure app.
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:09.000]   I've used it twice.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.280]   Yeah, but ever.
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:11.880]   You could just leave it.
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:13.720]   I think a couple times, but it's useful.
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:16.600]   It was useful when I needed it.
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:19.080]   Most of the time, I just grabbed the tape measure just right there.
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:22.600]   So, yeah.
[01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:26.840]   But this way, you could be looking at a banana on your desk and point the phone at it and know
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:28.040]   that it's seven and a half inches.
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:30.040]   I think that's useful.
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:30.760]   Yeah.
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:35.720]   I think it's so, so we talked about this a little in the show.
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:41.640]   I think it's weird because Google's backing off AR when everybody else is really investing in it.
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:42.920]   Yes, it's so strange.
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.640]   We talked about that on Windows Weekly today.
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:48.040]   Apple's like all in on AR all of a sudden.
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:53.880]   And both Microsoft and Google are just kind of, yeah, it was fun, but we don't need to do it anymore.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:56.120]   Microsoft is actually investing in AR.
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:57.080]   HoloLens, yeah.
[01:56:57.080 --> 01:57:00.120]   But what we were talking about is, and you may not remember this,
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:02.440]   you'd have to be following Windows very closely.
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:06.440]   But one of the Windows updates about two years ago was called the Creator's Update.
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:09.480]   And they showed how you get this 3D object.
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:11.080]   It was easy to capture them.
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:15.080]   And you could put it in a 3D paint and they killed 3D paint a couple months ago.
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:17.400]   A lot of those features have disappeared.
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:21.720]   And yeah, I think Microsoft thought everybody be using 3D.
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:26.760]   And no, I mean, the HoloLens is real and it's being used in a variety of applications,
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:29.080]   but it's not like a whole thing.
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:33.800]   But Apple focuses more on the Creator than Microsoft does.
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:36.120]   And it seems like it's always been that way.
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:39.800]   So they're going to continue to push this, especially on the video standpoint with
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:44.760]   the way they handle XDR displays and stuff like that.
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:51.800]   I think the difference is between an industrial use and a consumer use.
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:57.880]   And Microsoft's very much gone to the industrial uses of HoloLens.
[01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:00.280]   Google seems to have given up completely.
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:02.520]   Well, that's because there are buyers.
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:06.040]   Well, Google's got bigger fish to fry with other revenue.
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:07.400]   Yeah.
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:12.440]   And then Apple's very much all in on it, but they see they have a phone.
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:14.520]   So Microsoft doesn't have a phone.
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:19.400]   It's kind of hard to do consumer grade AAR without some sort of mobile device.
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:22.120]   You know, HoloLens is what thousands of dollars.
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:22.840]   Wait, no, they're Patokia.
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:26.680]   Say that with a straight face.
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:27.880]   You even said that with a lot.
[01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:28.760]   I couldn't get it.
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:29.640]   I couldn't do it.
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:32.200]   Yeah, whatever happened to that.
[01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:32.760]   That's so hard.
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:35.480]   We're thinking that where there was a phone or something.
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:36.920]   Wasn't there whatever happened to that?
[01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:39.080]   And they had the Lumiya line.
[01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:43.080]   And I know of one person shooting that still uses that Lumiya.
[01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:44.440]   It was a great camera.
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:49.720]   It was superseded by the iPhone and the Pixel, but it was for its time, the best camera.
[01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:51.080]   Yeah, for its time, it was pretty high.
[01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:53.560]   It's like 40, I think it's 40 pixels.
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:59.400]   The Nest Hub browser.
[01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:03.160]   There's three words that don't go together.
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:05.480]   I've never used the browser on my Nest Hub,
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:07.640]   but apparently it's gotten better.
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:11.960]   I've never used a browser on my Nest Hub.
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:12.200]   No.
[01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:13.880]   I know.
[01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:16.840]   Is it just like when you asked me for something and it shows it to you?
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:20.200]   No, there's actually a keyboard pops up and you could type in searches and...
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:20.920]   What?
[01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:22.200]   No.
[01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:24.520]   Actually, who is that targeted for?
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:26.120]   Is it targeted for the grandkids?
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:29.160]   Why would the grandkids use it?
[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:31.080]   Probably a font.
[01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:32.600]   I think about my mom.
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:35.240]   She has one of these devices.
[01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:36.360]   I don't know which one it is.
[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:39.880]   And there's every now and then not our kids,
[01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:44.040]   but little kids are over there visiting her and they like to talk to Google.
[01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:48.600]   And I don't know, maybe they get a kick out of being over there to
[01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:52.040]   tap the screen and pull some stuff up that they're looking for based on some weird...
[01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:57.640]   I've put the keyboard to search for YouTube videos when Google just would not give me what I was
[01:59:57.640 --> 01:59:58.200]   asking for.
[01:59:58.200 --> 01:59:58.760]   I've done that.
[01:59:58.760 --> 01:59:59.400]   Right.
[01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:00.680]   Yeah, I've done that.
[02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:03.000]   But apparently you can also, there was a browser.
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.560]   Now it's a little bit better and maybe that'll make it more usable.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:08.520]   Okay.
[02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:11.000]   You know that room you never go in?
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.120]   We painted it.
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:13.240]   It's really nice now.
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:15.480]   It's really nice now.
[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:18.920]   And that's the Google change.
[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:27.240]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:28.200]   There's a rule here.
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:31.560]   I'm sorry, Leo. Are you done?
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:33.960]   Are you experiencing the Stacey Hunger Pains?
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:38.600]   I just got tired all of a sudden.
[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:39.240]   No, he just...
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:40.440]   That's exactly how I feel.
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:46.120]   Well, no, I'm actually looking at stories to see which one...
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:50.280]   The more stories there are in the rundown, the fewer we do.
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:51.640]   It's an inverse proportion.
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:53.560]   It's a direct inverse proportion.
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:59.160]   So I have left behind many a story and I probably should go through all of these.
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:01.160]   Oh my God, there's page after page.
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:03.400]   Thank you, Jason.
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:04.360]   I appreciate it, Jason.
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:05.160]   How old are you doing?
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:09.400]   Oh, Yomans job of putting stuff together.
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:15.240]   Ohio is suing Google wants to declare it a public utility.
[02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:16.920]   This is a dumb let's not talk about it.
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:19.480]   No, a commentary that doesn't apply to Google.
[02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:20.920]   You saved me, thank you, God.
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:22.680]   This is a stupid story.
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:23.160]   Let's not...
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:24.120]   Well, it's not...
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:26.520]   I mean, it's a stupid idea, but they're doing it.
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:32.520]   It's your assertion that the courts will laugh them out of the building.
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:33.480]   Well, but on what basis?
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:33.960]   We can't even...
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:37.000]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.680]   No, I was questioning on what basis...
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:43.080]   We haven't even been able to establish in the court system
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:45.960]   that broadband companies are common carriers.
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:46.520]   No.
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:52.440]   So I don't see how you could say that Google isn't anything except an information service.
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:52.760]   I know.
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:53.800]   It's pretty hard to believe.
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:02:01.160]   Google's response, Ohioans simply don't want the government to run Google like a gas or electric
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:01.960]   company.
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:07.400]   This lawsuit has no basis in fact or law and will defend ourselves against it in court.
[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:12.200]   I would love it if they hired the same lawyers that AT&T and Verizon hired
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:14.440]   or actually it was Verizon that sued for...
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:19.000]   Because they did, in fact, go through this, didn't they?
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:19.640]   Yes.
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:19.880]   Yeah.
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:21.240]   Well, Verizon did.
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:27.080]   Verizon and I think it was TMO sued over the first neutrality order that Google called for.
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:28.240]   And Google's talking points are the exact same talking points that AT&T and T
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:31.400]   and T and T and T and T are...
[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:34.040]   TMO, I like it how you have a pet day for them.
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:34.760]   I like that.
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:35.560]   Well, I have a pet answer.
[02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:35.960]   Everybody.
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:37.320]   This is a bizarre story.
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:38.920]   We talked about this on Windows Weekly.
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:47.320]   All the major browsers are joining forces to make extensions compatible across browser.
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:50.840]   I use extensions, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:54.360]   All will be able to use the same...
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:56.360]   Well, if this is...
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:03.640]   We'll see, but this is a W3C consortium with the goal of making it easier developers to
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:09.480]   write extensions because they'll be a shared standard, a common browser extension standard.
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:11.880]   That would be very interesting.
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:15.000]   I think it's a great idea.
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.360]   Yeah, I like it.
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:16.840]   Yeah.
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:25.080]   So if you were an Amazon shareholder, would you be upset at the idea that Jeff Bezos is going up in the space?
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:25.560]   Yes!
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:28.360]   I think this must be why he retired.
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:30.200]   Yeah, otherwise the board...
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:31.080]   Oh, oh.
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:33.480]   The board would say, "I'm sorry, you're running the company.
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:35.160]   You're ain't gone up in a spaceship."
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:36.520]   Have you lost your idea?
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:36.920]   You don't have a space for us.
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:38.440]   Yeah.
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:43.000]   So Bezos announced he's going to be a passenger in the...
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.160]   The thing is, it's not the 50th flight.
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:47.000]   It's the very first manned flight.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.600]   It's like getting the first pixel buds.
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:49.480]   You know, it's a mistake.
[02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:50.120]   You want to wait?
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:52.200]   He and his brother, right?
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:52.760]   Yeah.
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:58.280]   Their first manned flight, I don't know how risky this is.
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:05.560]   You know, there's always a risk when you strap a million tons of high-explosive to your
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:07.480]   butt and launch yourself into space.
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:09.320]   And then land with a parachute?
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:14.120]   This is scheduled for July 20th at a West Texas,
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:17.240]   because East Texas was busy suing them.
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:19.960]   No, joke.
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:21.560]   Joke.
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:23.400]   He posted this on Instagram.
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:29.880]   He said he'll be one of the inaugural passengers on the new Shepherd spacecraft.
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:32.760]   He and his brother, Mark, will be on board.
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:39.000]   I guess, you know, it's a good move if he makes it, because, you know, it shows it asserts his
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.320]   you know, belief in the safety of what they're doing.
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:45.640]   He, on his Instagram post, he says, "Ever..."
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:47.400]   Well, maybe we could play the audio here.
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:49.560]   Let's play, let's play Mr. Basses.
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:53.080]   Because it's a thing I wanted to do all my life.
[02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:54.840]   That's an adventure.
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:57.000]   It's a big deal for me.
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:00.440]   I invited my brother to come on this first flight, because we're...
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:01.480]   You were drunk.
[02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:02.440]   And...
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:03.640]   We want you to come with me.
[02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:04.200]   Would you?
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:05.160]   Are you serious?
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:06.440]   Yeah, I think it would be meaningful.
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:08.440]   How about brother there?
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:12.040]   Only if you're looking off the stump of hands to say that he was going to be on the first flight.
[02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:13.160]   And then when he...
[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:14.680]   Oh, his brother's a fire fighter.
[02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:15.240]   That's cool.
[02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:16.760]   Lost truck.
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:17.320]   You're serious?
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:18.760]   If you're willing, if you want to.
[02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:19.320]   Yeah.
[02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:19.560]   Yeah.
[02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:24.440]   What a remarkable opportunity not only to have this adventure, but to be able to do it.
[02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:25.160]   I'd say yes.
[02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:26.120]   Yeah, my best friend.
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:26.360]   Yeah.
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:27.160]   You're what?
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:27.800]   I'd be too.
[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:29.480]   Oh, that's really sweet.
[02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:32.440]   What would Lisa say if you said you wanted to go on?
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:33.320]   Ah, she would let me.
[02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:36.360]   But she'd make sure my will was completed before I was able to say this.
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:39.480]   She would have all the derriative score here and go, "Wait!"
[02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:43.960]   She'd make sure I made sure all the insurance was in her name and so forth.
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:46.360]   But it is risky.
[02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:49.400]   And I think if he were still CEO, the board would say no.
[02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:49.800]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:50.680]   No, absolutely not.
[02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:51.560]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:53.240]   That is definitely beyond...
[02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:54.360]   They would have to.
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:55.400]   You can't send your CEO in.
[02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:56.760]   No bungee jumping.
[02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:57.080]   Yeah.
[02:05:57.080 --> 02:05:57.400]   For...
[02:05:57.400 --> 02:05:57.560]   Yeah.
[02:05:57.560 --> 02:06:00.920]   I'm sure most contracts have provisions like that.
[02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:04.520]   Yeah, they have prohibitions against certain skydiving, that sort of thing.
[02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:08.840]   New Shepherd has made 15 uncrewed test flights.
[02:06:08.840 --> 02:06:11.720]   So it survived all 15.
[02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:18.040]   Of course, as the Wall Street Journal points out, most commercial aircraft don't carry
[02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:22.840]   passengers before undergoing an intensive series of hundreds of piloted flights.
[02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:26.280]   Okay.
[02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:28.440]   Yeah, it's a little scary, but you know what?
[02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:29.000]   Good for him.
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:29.720]   He's gutsy.
[02:06:29.720 --> 02:06:31.960]   Well, something equally scary.
[02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:33.000]   I'm putting the rundown here.
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:34.280]   Yes.
[02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:35.640]   Banana Peel Bacon.
[02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:36.680]   Ooh.
[02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:39.800]   The new thing on TikTok.
[02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:41.560]   Oh, of course it's on TikTok.
[02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:42.760]   Of course it is.
[02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:48.680]   Hey, watch it and there's a new musical called In The Hate Sound.
[02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:51.000]   I could be pulling up things from that.
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:51.640]   That's a great musical.
[02:06:51.640 --> 02:06:52.520]   That's an old musical, Jeff.
[02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:53.240]   That is an old musical.
[02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:54.280]   It's an old musical, but it's now a movie.
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:55.400]   Yes, but it's now a movie.
[02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:56.040]   That's what's new.
[02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:58.600]   Banana Peel Bacon.
[02:06:58.600 --> 02:06:59.960]   So this is the Washington Post.
[02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:03.080]   We made it and we're not convinced.
[02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:03.400]   Ooh.
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:05.800]   Yeah, I say "Ooh."
[02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:09.480]   Ooh, the rubbery casings of long-wind used in cooking in India,
[02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:10.520]   sometimes in curries.
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:13.880]   There's a south Indian stir fry called Toran.
[02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:16.440]   All right.
[02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:17.400]   I'm willing to try it.
[02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:18.520]   You're going to try it?
[02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:19.560]   I'm willing to try it.
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:21.400]   So how does it work?
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:25.400]   It's the origins of the dish.
[02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:27.240]   Right's the post or murky.
[02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:31.400]   A 2019 recipe for a "faken" like a steak 'em,
[02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:35.320]   but a "faken" posted on Life Hacker calls for frying the peels first,
[02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:36.520]   then glazing them.
[02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:42.120]   But a popular and much-cited iteration making the rounds now comes from
[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:46.920]   Charles Hunter III, a personal chef and food blogger at the Salted Table.
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:52.600]   He took his inspiration from a video posted by vegan TikTok star Tabitha Brown,
[02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:53.560]   her carrot bacon.
[02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:54.520]   I see carrot bacon.
[02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:55.160]   I could dig.
[02:07:55.160 --> 02:07:57.080]   That makes sense.
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:58.040]   It was a viral hit.
[02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:00.120]   She didn't like the banana version she attempted.
[02:08:00.120 --> 02:08:04.840]   Her verdict, quote, "It ain't right in my spirit," end quote.
[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:06.920]   Okay.
[02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:12.440]   He ditched her air frying method, experimented a bit.
[02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:14.040]   Here's how he does it.
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:18.680]   "You marinate the peels in a mixture that mimics the flavor of bacon with liquid smoke
[02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:22.680]   and smoked paprika, and then you crisp them in the pan."
[02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:24.840]   Why not just have bacon?
[02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:26.440]   Well--
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:27.000]   Thank you.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.640]   Because it's vegan, I guess.
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:30.440]   It's vegan, I guess.
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:30.920]   Yeah.
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:31.560]   Maybe that.
[02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:31.960]   All right.
[02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:32.440]   Maybe that.
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:32.840]   All right.
[02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:33.400]   Never mind.
[02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:33.960]   Yeah.
[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:37.240]   Stacy, Stacy, would you ever try it?
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:39.720]   I don't think I want to eat a banana peel.
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:41.240]   Yeah, I'll just eat it.
[02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:41.240]   Yeah.
[02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:43.400]   Honey is my birthday.
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:47.000]   My birthday is my birthday.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.400]   My birthday is my birthday.
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:50.360]   Oh.
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:52.440]   I certainly wouldn't eat banana peel on my birthday.
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:52.920]   I'm going to order it.
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:57.400]   Inhoo, because it's my birthday.
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:01.240]   I said to myself, "Sell, she said girl, what is going on on this day?"
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:03.000]   I said, "Girl's my birthday.
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.080]   I want to try something that I had seen, but I want to try it my way.
[02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:10.120]   I want a good old BLT."
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:11.960]   Y'all know I'm a big fan of the TTLA,
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:15.800]   but I've been trying not to eat as much processed food lately.
[02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:16.280]   Oh, there we go.
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:17.080]   The processed.
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:17.560]   I'm going to process.
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:18.040]   I've had the appeals.
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:18.840]   Oh, no.
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:22.920]   So y'all been seeing the folk making bacon out of a banana peel.
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:25.560]   Now, when I had first seen it, I got the first--
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:25.720]   All right.
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:26.200]   I had enough.
[02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:26.680]   I'm sorry.
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:27.480]   I don't have you had enough.
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:28.120]   You want to--
[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:28.360]   Yep.
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:29.240]   This is one that I thought--
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:30.760]   Thank you, Son of a TikTok length thing.
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:32.440]   Yeah, but it's 22 minutes.
[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:33.560]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:36.360]   This is like those recipe blogs where you're like,
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:38.760]   "And here's the story of how we came by the recipe.
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:39.800]   Oh, God, it's too much.
[02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:40.280]   It's too much.
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:41.400]   Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.
[02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:43.080]   And ingredients here.
[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:44.600]   This is why TikTok's great.
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:45.480]   It's a minute, right?
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:46.120]   You can't be long.
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:46.760]   Right.
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:47.400]   That's great.
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:48.040]   It shouldn't be long.
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:49.400]   Nothing should be longer than a minute.
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:50.840]   Do you get two minutes?
[02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:51.720]   Even so much.
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:52.280]   I don't know.
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:54.760]   I feel like Son would feel a little bit longer than a minute.
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:55.560]   Okay.
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:56.360]   Then they just--
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:09:56.600]   Maybe they had.
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:09:57.240]   They're just bad.
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:00.120]   We got a whole bunch of TikTok stories.
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:01.000]   I'm just going to skip them.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:04.360]   I'm just going to skip right through them.
[02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:09.880]   The feds got the money for the colonial ransomware attack.
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:11.560]   We're not sure how.
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:14.520]   There is a warrant.
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:17.800]   It looks like I'm guessing either one of two things.
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:22.280]   They convinced somebody who knew the password of the Bitcoin wallet
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:23.880]   to give it to them or--
[02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:25.640]   And I suspect this is what really happened.
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:28.920]   The ransomware people had set up a--
[02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:31.080]   what's called a custodial wallet with an exchange
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:33.560]   so they could buy money with the Bitcoin
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:37.160]   and the exchange got the subpoena and handed over the ransomware.
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:40.360]   But anyway, the feds recovered $2 million.
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:41.720]   Bet they keep it though.
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:43.640]   Don't you think they don't give it back to colonial?
[02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:45.480]   They just go, "Yeah.
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:46.760]   Yeah, we confiscated it."
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:51.080]   Colonial CEO said that the password was very complicated.
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:54.360]   No word about it.
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:54.920]   That's funny.
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:55.160]   Yeah.
[02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:57.960]   I don't know what he thinks is complicated.
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:11:00.040]   You know when all of that went down?
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:05.000]   He says it was not a colonial 123 type password.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.920]   Okay, that's a big difference from that to very complicated.
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:09.480]   Okay, complicated.
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:09.720]   Yeah.
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:12.680]   All of this stuff went down.
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:17.320]   I was on vacation and I'm sorry the garbage truck shows up right now.
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:18.680]   I thought you were cleaning the house.
[02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:21.240]   There was a little vacuum going on there.
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:24.200]   It's all right.
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:25.000]   It's a new day now.
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:25.480]   No.
[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:26.040]   Yeah, that's all right.
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:26.760]   We like to hear it.
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:28.120]   It's life.
[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:32.520]   But yeah, this happened during my vacation.
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:35.720]   And when I was back in South Carolina, I visited my mother.
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:41.320]   And I really wasn't paying too much attention to the news other than the show.
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:46.440]   And went to go somewhere to go take some pictures and I stopped to get some gasoline.
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:47.880]   It was just long line.
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:49.560]   I'm like, "What the heck is happening?"
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:54.120]   And there was no gas anywhere in my mom's place.
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:55.160]   And it took me...
[02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:56.360]   Oh, because I'm only a pipeline.
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:57.560]   It took about three days.
[02:11:57.560 --> 02:11:57.880]   Yeah.
[02:11:57.880 --> 02:11:59.400]   Yeah.
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:00.840]   Three days to get gasoline.
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:01.320]   Wow.
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:03.400]   No gas.
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:05.320]   So I pretty much cut on the couch.
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:06.360]   Yeah, that's a little scary.
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:08.920]   You forget how reliant we are.
[02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:09.400]   Oh.
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:09.720]   Yeah.
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:11.800]   Final story.
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:15.720]   Then we're going to take a break and get your picks of the week.
[02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:19.400]   But because Stacy's very excited about our pick of the week this week.
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:20.200]   Mm-hmm.
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:20.760]   Look at it.
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:22.200]   How did we say that?
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:25.400]   For those of you on audio.
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:26.600]   It looked like an empty chair.
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:27.160]   Yeah.
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:29.240]   She's getting it.
[02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:29.800]   She's getting it.
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:30.680]   It's on the box.
[02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:31.240]   She's getting it.
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:31.560]   All right.
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:31.720]   Okay.
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:32.520]   But last story.
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:33.640]   My pick of the week came.
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:34.040]   Yeah.
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:35.960]   Oh, see, that's what I've been delaying for.
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:37.880]   El Salvador.
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:42.120]   Which used to have its currency, the US dollar.
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:44.280]   This seems like lazy.
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:45.560]   We don't want to make up a currency.
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:46.840]   We'll just use yours if that's all right.
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:53.960]   They have now become the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.
[02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:55.480]   Good for them.
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:12:56.440]   That.
[02:12:56.440 --> 02:12:58.280]   What could possibly go wrong there?
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:02.760]   They voted by a super majority in favor of the Bitcoin law.
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:06.520]   The price of Bitcoin went up as a result.
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:07.320]   Oh, rats.
[02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:12.120]   It was only about a 5% uptick.
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:13.240]   So not that price.
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:15.000]   Prices can now be shown in Bitcoin.
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.160]   Taxes can be paid with Bitcoin.
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:21.800]   And exchanges in Bitcoin will not be subject to capital gains tax.
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:23.880]   Speaking of which, did you see how much tax?
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:26.680]   The top billionaires.
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:29.080]   Don't get me started on this story.
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:31.400]   No, no, I have a new toy.
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:32.520]   I want to show everyone.
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:32.680]   Okay.
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:33.080]   Okay.
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:33.080]   Okay.
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:36.280]   It's not a text story except it's a lot of tech.
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:38.680]   That story is clickbait of the worst.
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:39.160]   Oh, is it?
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:41.000]   Oh, they paid more tax than that.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:42.680]   Okay.
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:43.800]   No, I have a new toy.
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:46.200]   It was paid a billion dollars in taxes.
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:48.040]   It paid a billion dollars in taxes.
[02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:48.680]   And they're completely there.
[02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:50.280]   But it wasn't his income tax.
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:50.600]   It was.
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:53.400]   No, he paid a billion dollars in personal taxes.
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:54.040]   So it's wrong.
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:55.400]   He just found a year or two when he didn't.
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:55.720]   Oh.
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:56.920]   And no, they're just trying to argue.
[02:13:56.920 --> 02:13:59.640]   They come up with a whole new structure for taxes saying that
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:02.120]   these guys should be taxed on the growth and wealth.
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:03.080]   Well, that's ridiculous.
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:05.400]   Because what happens when it goes down the next year.
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:05.560]   Right.
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:06.840]   And what if you own a farm?
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:11.720]   Well, that's, you know, if you're rich, usually your tax bill is not your income.
[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:14.680]   It's, you know, your income tax is like anybody else's.
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:16.600]   But the capital gains tax is much lower.
[02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:23.320]   And a lot of what rich people make is capital gains, not income, not straight income.
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:23.640]   So.
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:26.120]   And yeah, I mean, I don't want to get in that.
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:30.440]   So let's take a break and when we come back, it's time for Stacy.
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:34.280]   We're going to torture Stacy and get as long as we can to get to it.
[02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:35.640]   Well, this ad is going to be long.
[02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:36.200]   You know why?
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:39.160]   Because it's for my favorite sponsor, Audible.
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:40.120]   Well, I love them all.
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:42.440]   Oh, but I am a big Audible fan.
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:46.200]   I've been an Audible member since 2000, 21 years.
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:48.440]   Forget about last summer.
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:51.000]   We kind of missed last summer, but this summer,
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:53.320]   we're going to get some beach towels.
[02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:54.440]   We're going to stock the cooler.
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:55.800]   We're going to escape.
[02:14:55.800 --> 02:14:59.720]   We're going to the beach celebrate the best season of the year, like never before,
[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:03.480]   with great stories and programs from Audible.
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:06.680]   Now is the absolute best time to do it because prime members,
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:12.040]   if you're an Amazon prime member, you can save 53% off your first four months.
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:19.400]   I was a Audible member for prime existed, for Amazon existed.
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:27.000]   But if you, for some reason, after all my exhortations have not yet started to listen to audio content
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.080]   from Audible, you better get doing.
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:30.200]   You better go.
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:31.560]   There's Andy Weir's Hail Mary.
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:33.800]   I love that that's right in the front, right in the middle.
[02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:36.280]   That is such a great audiobook from Audible.
[02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:39.240]   Audible has it all, not just an unbeatable selection of audiobooks,
[02:15:39.240 --> 02:15:45.080]   a tons of binge-worthy podcasts, exclusive originals, all available download or stream.
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:47.320]   As an Audible member, you get to choose a title a month,

[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:51.960]   It's yours to keep forever.
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:57.320]   But here's the best part, you also get full access to Audible's streaming library.
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:15:58.840]   That's the plus catalog.
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:02.440]   So you never run out of great audio content.
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:04.520]   Discover your next podcast obsession.
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:06.760]   Check that audiobook off your bucket list.
[02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:11.000]   Get lost in a world of original content from celebrity creators,
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:14.040]   best-selling authors, leading experts.
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:17.160]   There's Matthew McConaughey's new audiobook.
[02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:19.960]   I just finished the Barack Obama audiobook.
[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:22.680]   Covers his first term in office in his early life.
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:24.600]   And it's amazing.
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:28.200]   Oh my gosh, I love that audiobook.
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:29.000]   So good.
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:30.280]   But that's the problem.
[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:33.400]   There's so many wonderful audiobooks.
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:35.480]   By the way, Barack reads his audiobook.
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:38.360]   So it really feels like you're there in the Oval Office with him.
[02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:39.160]   It's really neat.
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:45.080]   What's great is with Audible Plus, you can stream all you want as much as you want.
[02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:49.320]   So even if you've finished your audiobook, your title of months,
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:51.160]   you've got plenty more to listen to.
[02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:54.760]   Audible's the perfect companion for summer because no matter where you're going,
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:58.920]   no matter what you're doing, you'll always have just the right thing to listen to at your fingertips.
[02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:07.000]   Perfect for road trips, lazy days, beach days, long bike rides, barbecuing in the backyard.
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:14.040]   I honestly listen to Audible while I'm gaming because I want to make sure that that's not completely
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:15.000]   wasted time.
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:21.560]   I got through an entire 26-hour audiobook just the other day playing it while I'm listening,
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:25.960]   playing Valheim while I'm listening to The Wheel of Time.
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:32.680]   The first somebody in the Discord recommended said, "You've never listened to The Wheel of Time."
[02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:33.880]   Series from Robert Jordan.
[02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:34.440]   I said, "No."
[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:37.560]   So this is a 28 hour--
[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:39.560]   29 hours and 57 minutes.
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:40.920]   Let's call it 30 hours.
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:45.720]   But that's the thing. I did it listening to playing Valheim, so it was great.
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:49.480]   And by the way, there's 15 of them, so I'm just getting started.
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:51.320]   It's great. I've just started the new one.
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:52.680]   Some of them are longer.
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:53.720]   Most of them are longer.
[02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:56.440]   They're long. I know. But I love it because you're it's immersive.
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:58.120]   So this is an interesting thing.
[02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:02.840]   Some people like longer audiobooks because you get immersed and you become a part of it.
[02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:04.680]   Sometimes people like short stories.
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:07.320]   I mix it up. I'll listen to nonfiction and fiction.
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:09.160]   I also like the great courses.
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:11.800]   I love the music stuff they do.
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:13.640]   There's so much great stuff on Audible.
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:17.000]   Broadway shows. It's just fantastic.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.800]   Look, I don't know how to convince you.
[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:20.920]   Become an Audible member.

[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:01.000]   You'll get a link. You can put it on your phone.
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.480]   The app is great. I live in the Audible app.
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:06.120]   In fact, I love it because I have CarPlay in my car.
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:10.040]   I get in the car. My book starts up as the minute I'm in the car driving home.
[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:13.080]   I listen all the time to Audible.
[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:19.400]   Audible.com, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/twig.
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:25.800]   Thank you, Audible, for more than two decades of fantastic content and for supporting Twig.
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:33.400]   I'm about to finish what I really call a part four of five parts of my German and boy,
[02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:34.840]   I'm all right, how stupid I am.
[02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:37.240]   Which German, are you doing the Pimsler? Which one are you doing?
[02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:39.480]   Pimsler. That was your tip.
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:43.960]   It's a great way to get Pimsler for a lot less.
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:49.480]   It's too audible. I've got to learn Spanish. We're going to Mexico in October and I've just
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:53.240]   got to learn Spanish. Pimsler is great because Pimsler also is about the pronunciation.
[02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:55.160]   So you're going to sound better.
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:20:02.120]   Think of the answer to the question asked. You need to speak the answer out loud to set up a
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:04.840]   circuit of the language you are learning to speak. That's good.
[02:20:04.840 --> 02:20:05.880]   Yeah, yeah. It's the key.
[02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:10.040]   So you listen, but you speak along with it or something.
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:13.880]   The car made me so walking, I kind of mumble it.
[02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:17.480]   All right, I have two credits from Audible. I'm going to do it.
[02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:19.960]   The Pimsler Spanish is very good. I'm just too dumb.
[02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:25.160]   Well, I really enjoyed the visual of Jeff running around with his sweaty earbuds,
[02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:33.320]   or sweaty. Light feeling, German. That would be funny. That would be funny.
[02:20:33.320 --> 02:20:35.800]   Yeah, you know what? That's a good deal. I've got the credits.
[02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:39.400]   I'm going to do it. Put them both in my cart. That gets me through 15 lessons.
[02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:42.680]   You do half an hour a day. That's the deal. And they would say, don't,
[02:20:42.680 --> 02:20:49.160]   don't do more. And probably, no mass. So lamente, oh man.
[02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:53.720]   I can't. Who know what I know? No, no, Demiora. No, no, Demiora.
[02:20:53.720 --> 02:20:59.240]   Demiora. No, no, no, no, no. Stay here. Thing of the week.
[02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:03.160]   Okay. Ready? Yes.
[02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:10.040]   He's just glowing with the excitement. Oh, nanos.
[02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:13.640]   He's present is the Nanoleaf Elements.
[02:21:13.640 --> 02:21:14.680]   It's made out of wood.
[02:21:14.680 --> 02:21:18.040]   Hold up. I was thinking I didn't open this part.
[02:21:18.040 --> 02:21:20.040]   All right. So here, hold on.
[02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:24.440]   So we know the Nanoleaf we've talked about before. Micah has them.
[02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:29.720]   Mr. Sartre. In his house. What is that? Octagonal? What's the shape of that one?
[02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:35.800]   This is a hexagon. It is a hexagon and it is made of faux wood.
[02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:38.520]   And it looks really nice. And when it's lit up and...
[02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:43.640]   This is great. Because you don't look like you've got plastic things on your wall.
[02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:49.640]   Exactly. You've got these pretty things on your wall. And they glow very nicely. They only glow in
[02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:54.680]   the whites and they are very expensive. So the seven, the starter packs comes with seven and
[02:21:54.680 --> 02:22:00.040]   the controller. And I... Let me grab it. See, this is why I never had the Nanoleafs because I don't
[02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:05.640]   want plastic pieces on my wall. But if it's wood, that might be kind of nice. And you make it,
[02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:10.520]   you can make a shape with them, right? What do you do? What shape you come stick?
[02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:14.200]   Where are you going? You said like Fiver McGee's closet. What are you doing? There you go.
[02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:18.440]   All right. So here's the controller that you plug in. I'm going to show you everything.
[02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:24.280]   Oh, it looks like another tile. Yeah, it's got the faux wood too. I just turned it on.
[02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:27.480]   I can't... My light is too bright for you to see this. Yeah, yeah, you can't see it.
[02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:33.000]   So it's not a bright light. It's a glow. So each panel gives out 22 lumens,
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:39.160]   which is not really enough to give you... You could read by it. But it's good for watching TV.
[02:22:39.160 --> 02:22:46.920]   Yeah. I'll be on... I'm using it for art. I have a giant wall. It's 11 feet long by
[02:22:48.280 --> 02:22:58.120]   that tall. And so what I've got is the starter pack, which is $300. So $2.99.
[02:22:58.120 --> 02:23:05.720]   $2.99. This is not cheap. And that's seven panels, which is a good size. But
[02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:12.040]   I have 15 of the older panels. And that's a really good size that gives you a lot of variety.
[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:17.160]   Each expansion pack is going to be 99. Oh, that's not bad. Oh, which only gets three.
[02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:22.120]   Leo's like, "That's fun." Oh. Oh.
[02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:30.600]   So what they did is they've got these Wil... Work with Sound like the other Nanileafs.
[02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:35.400]   Oh, so like pulses to your music? Your music, clapping, your voice.
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:40.840]   Once I get these up, I'll show you a demo in a couple weeks.
[02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:45.720]   How big is that? About 80 inches, something like that?
[02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:53.480]   This is 8x9. 8x9. Let me give you a... 8x9 hexagon. Oh, here it is glowing. It is. You can see it.
[02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:59.080]   Yeah, it's a nice warm glow. It's nice. And the color temperature ranges from 400,
[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:04.120]   which is pretty cool all the way to like this really warm, amber thing. This is the cool light.
[02:24:04.120 --> 02:24:11.000]   Okay. So in the back mount, it mounts on your wall using... Oops. Oh, it's still plastic,
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:14.440]   isn't it? It's just wood grain. Yeah, it's faux wood. Yeah.
[02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:19.400]   So you mount it on your wall. This is the command tape from 3N.
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:24.200]   What's nice about this is you... Yeah, that angle is over. You want to take it off your wall.
[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:28.520]   You just pull this off. Oh, nice. And then you can pull your tape off this way. Right.
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:33.480]   So it used to be that you had the tape kind of around the edges here. Yeah. And that was kind of
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:38.600]   give-be-looking. And it does peel off your wallpaper or your... Nobody has wallpaper.
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:44.600]   Irritically, I have... When I have taken these off before, not these particular ones, but
[02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:49.880]   they have taken some of my wall texture with them. Okay. I just scared my dog.
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:57.800]   So I purchased these and then I purchased an additional five expansion packs. And I'm going to
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:03.000]   make a 21 because that is the maximum number I can stick on the power supply that they sent you.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:12.360]   So 21's the max? Well, you can buy a bigger power supply if you want more panels. So if you
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:16.680]   want, you can spend thousands of dollars. Yes, they will take your money.
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:23.640]   And it works with HomeKit. Oh, yes. This is a good part.
[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:31.640]   Y'all, I forgot about this. Okay. Works with HomeKit, Google, Amazon, and it will act as a
[02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:38.120]   thread border router when matter comes out. No. Yeah. Okay. You're being sarcastic.
[02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:44.040]   No, I'm... No, I'm... That's very cool. That's very cool. No, no, I'm sure that's wonderful.
[02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:50.200]   If I knew what it meant, I'd be really excited. So when you have matter,
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:54.600]   what used to be Project Connected Home Over IP, Project Ship,
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:59.480]   Matter is going to support Wi-Fi and Thread. And so Thread is for all of your sensor nodes,
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:03.560]   because its low power goes directly to the internet, its mesh network. But you're going to
[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:08.360]   have some things that control those Thread devices that also speak Wi-Fi. Right now,
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:13.560]   you've got like a HomeKit, a HomePod Mini. We don't know if the Google stuff is actually going to be
[02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:19.640]   act as that bridge, basically, between Wi-Fi and Thread. So right now, we don't know what
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:24.120]   devices will act as that, but these definitely will. So that's why it's exciting.
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:33.240]   Do you feel it's lovely? It's like a really beautiful thing that you have on your wall there.
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:38.520]   Okay, so I do. These are way prettier than the other ones. I liked the other ones and we use
[02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:44.680]   them as art. The reason I'm buying this is because I can spend $800 on these and build something that
[02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:50.040]   is pretty, that is not a gallery wall and is not fancy expensive paintings, which cost me way more.
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:54.600]   Right. Yeah, I mean, it's certainly less expensive than paintings. And yeah, okay.
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:27:02.680]   So, but it's like abstract shape just on the wall. Yeah. Yeah. The glows and it gets light
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:10.520]   patterns. Like you can set it close. It glows. It's really like it's varied. I'll just, okay,
[02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:15.160]   I'll show you later. Yeah, we've seen, no, we saw your old nanoleafs. I remember you took a
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:20.520]   stand stairs to look at those. Yeah. So, so I'll show you this when I get this up. I'm just not
[02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:26.920]   hip enough for this, I think. That looks good. Look at that. See, I mean, think how nice that is.
[02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:33.320]   It's flickering with a fire. Yeah. And they have, they have this, I like the cool flickers,
[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:37.160]   actually, like this, this is one of my favorite patterns right here. Not that one.
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:40.920]   It's kind of the future. I feel like I'd be living in the future if I had these.
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:46.680]   It feels like if Ikea married a Phillips hue, this is what they were making.
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:52.200]   Oh, it looks just like a firefly.
[02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:58.920]   I mind that kind of woods now. Cicadas. Oh, are you getting the cicadas now?
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:03.080]   I was in Princeton yesterday. They were thick. I'm 25 miles north. Nothing.
[02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:09.400]   So it's a, is it a mating season? This is the season when they, well, not season. It's
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:14.120]   every 17 years. Yeah, that's what I mean. Yeah, it's like very, it's like only, wow.
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:20.600]   So this is it. This is the year they breed. Is that true all over the world or just in New Jersey?
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:24.840]   Well, if there are some 13 years cicadas, there are some 17 years cicadas.
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:28.280]   So weird. Yeah. That's just a weird thing.
[02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:32.520]   They're just, they're just thick. Yeah. Of course, somebody said, actually,
[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:37.880]   it's professors come out to finish their books and have sex once every 17 years also.
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:44.360]   But they don't make that annoying sound. So, or maybe they do. I know.
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:49.000]   That's all they do. Actually, we drone on. Nano leaf element, nano leaf dot me.
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:55.720]   If you want to find out more now in wood graze, is it all the same kind of wood or can you get
[02:28:55.720 --> 02:29:00.600]   birch, cherry and it is all the same. This is why I feel like it's Ikea because it's a very
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:06.040]   Scandinavian choice, a bird cheek kind of color. Yeah. It's yeah, it's a blonde wood.
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:10.520]   And the starter pack has seven and the expansion packs have three. Yes.
[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:16.200]   Thank you, Stacey. Mr. Jeff Jarvis, your number of the.
[02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:21.400]   All right. I'm going to do two real quick. One is to mention very quickly the year 1478.
[02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:30.120]   When when Oxford University, I was I remember 1478. A few centuries ago.
[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:36.840]   It was the beginnings of printing at Oxford University. Wow.
[02:29:36.840 --> 02:29:41.960]   They just announced they are shutting off their presses. Oh, no, the Oxford University press.
[02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:46.120]   Well, the press stays alive, but they're not going to print. Oh, the themselves, they're
[02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:50.600]   going to job it out. Oh, so they were actually printing their own books. Wow.
[02:29:50.600 --> 02:29:55.160]   Or some good portion of them. Yes. Yeah. I had quite a few Oxford University press books.
[02:29:55.160 --> 02:29:59.800]   So why? Yeah, fortunately. Yeah, they're beautiful. Yeah. Speaking of printing then,
[02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:07.960]   we have very much excitement. The Lego typewriter line 196 there. What is a Lego typewriter?
[02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:13.400]   It's a typewriter you can make. It doesn't really work. It's two thousand 79 pieces. This is supposed
[02:30:13.400 --> 02:30:19.160]   to be a number here. Oh, Lord, this cookie, this cookie boy. That was a big cookie banner.
[02:30:19.160 --> 02:30:27.080]   This is made out of Lego. Yeah. Two hundred seventy nine pieces. All the custom Lego pieces.
[02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:33.080]   That's crazy. I would just love to have the key top Lego pieces. That's pretty cool looking.
[02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:38.360]   That's a classic manual typewriter. Oh, yeah, there's the letters. That's neat.
[02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:44.200]   Quarry. I don't think this is cool. Oh, it's so tidy. Look at it.
[02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:51.160]   That's cute. Oh, it's so cute. It's sitting. Jeff, you want me to say you like any type of
[02:30:51.160 --> 02:30:59.000]   Lego? Oh, here's building it. That's cute. Oh, you have a tiny typewriter? Oh, look, it actually
[02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:07.480]   the keys move. Oh, my God. And if there was paper in here, it. Oh, it's it works.
[02:31:07.480 --> 02:31:15.320]   Wow. I don't think you can really type. You'd think you'd break it if you really typed, but
[02:31:15.320 --> 02:31:22.360]   still that's cool. That that is a hipster right there right there. Look at that.
[02:31:22.360 --> 02:31:25.720]   I have a a typewriter planter.
[02:31:25.720 --> 02:31:33.000]   How is that? Is there a place?
[02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:44.440]   That's that's like something bad happened. It really does. It looks like one of those old
[02:31:44.440 --> 02:31:49.960]   adding machines, is it? You may want to know that the same person was the inspiration
[02:31:49.960 --> 02:31:56.280]   for the first successful typewriter and for the London type. I've been researching this. James O'Cliffing
[02:31:56.280 --> 02:32:02.840]   was a stenographer to Abraham Lincoln, and he wanted a typewriter and a guy who invented it,
[02:32:02.840 --> 02:32:08.440]   Scholes, agreed to send him one, and he taught, try it out, and he banged the hell out of them,
[02:32:08.440 --> 02:32:12.360]   and send back and say, here's all the problems with it. He did that seven times, drove the
[02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:18.120]   in better and sane, but that was the first syllable typewriter with Remington, and then he met
[02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:25.240]   Audemar Mergenthaler, and he was the buddy who kept that process going and leading to the
[02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:31.640]   line of type. So you can thank for the typewriter James O'Cliffing. Wake up. Wake up.
[02:32:31.640 --> 02:32:34.040]   Come on. Yes. We say, what are you?
[02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:44.040]   Wow. I'm sad about Oxford University Press. That's sad. Let's do an ant thing. Ant-Pruett. What do you
[02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:51.400]   got? You know, selfies are pretty dad-gum popular, even though I can't stand them. I'm
[02:32:51.400 --> 02:32:57.880]   much rather you have a self-portrait. I have a story over on Reddit of what could possibly be the
[02:32:57.880 --> 02:33:06.840]   first selfie from back in 1950, Tuish. Gentlemen was out in Korea with this camera. He's trying to
[02:33:06.840 --> 02:33:13.640]   figure out, okay, I need to go ahead and use this film up and decide it to just snap a cool photograph.
[02:33:13.640 --> 02:33:17.640]   Then he wrote on the back. There was no one around to take the last shot on the camera,
[02:33:17.640 --> 02:33:24.200]   so I held it up in front of me, outstretched arms, and snapped the shutter on.
[02:33:24.200 --> 02:33:24.680]   Shutter. Shutter.
[02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:32.360]   Wow. But it's a pretty cool shot, though. It's a selfie. There's no doubt about it.
[02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:36.520]   I would love to do this. It was pretty good. Old school, cool for sure.
[02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:43.320]   Yeah. There was on Reddit, and I want to say somebody else wrote about it. Hit topics.com.
[02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:46.920]   They actually wrote a little bit more about it. I just thought it was pretty cool.
[02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:48.600]   That's really interesting. And then lastly,
[02:33:48.600 --> 02:33:56.120]   well, no, not lastly. Another one is, this is for our editor, Mr. Kevin. Not the editor of
[02:33:56.120 --> 02:34:01.080]   this show, but Mr. Kevin edits a lot of shows. He's like, "No, I love sharks." He loves the shark.
[02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:05.160]   He is shark-weak. You can't even get him out of bed. He's just love.
[02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:06.200]   Nope, you can't.
[02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:12.360]   He loves the shark. Well, baby shark, I found out about this through one of my friends.
[02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:19.240]   He's been working with this team of developers, and they've come up with their own cryptocurrency.
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:27.400]   Baby shark toked. It's pretty funny. I laughed at him, but I've been talking to him more,
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:32.760]   and they've actually been doing some pretty nice work and trying to actually raise money
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:38.840]   to help do some conservation stuff. They raised, I want to say about three grand at one point,
[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:45.080]   and gave it to the University of Miami for some of their quieted stuff down there,
[02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:52.120]   and shark conservation. And then they raised another 10 grand for the ghillie shark preserve,
[02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:57.160]   I believe it's what it's called. And it's fully documented, and they sent them the money,
[02:34:57.160 --> 02:35:01.800]   and they just want to continue to keep doing stuff like that to help preserve our oceans and
[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:07.880]   actually help tell people to, "Hey, start cleaning up the land, too, because there's a lot of parks
[02:35:07.880 --> 02:35:13.640]   out here that are just flat-out filthy, and it's because of us humans, so just continuing to leave
[02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:19.560]   a bunch of trash out, and so they're just trying to raise some money to help get that stuff
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:23.400]   cleaned up around a world." And I just want to give them a shout. It's pretty good stuff.
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:24.040]   Pretty good stuff. Pretty good stuff.
[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:25.040]   Pretty good stuff.
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:29.320]   Pretty good stuff for cryptocurrency. The baby shark token at babysharktoken.com helped
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:30.120]   clean that.
[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:34.760]   What's funny is I want to say Elon Musk tweeted about them not too long ago, too.
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:38.520]   Oh, better watch out. That's going to go through the roof to the moon.
[02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:44.680]   You can buy baby shark tokens there if you want. A community-driven cryptocurrency focused on
[02:35:44.680 --> 02:35:49.480]   cleaning up the environment, and they'll sell to you on the cake swap.
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:54.520]   Yeah, but I thought that was cool. And then lastly, I want to give a shout-out because
[02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:58.600]   the queen had a nice little day over at the farm.
[02:35:58.600 --> 02:35:59.800]   Oh, that's nice.
[02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:02.040]   Look at all those behind you. I wanted to ask about them.
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:04.760]   She saw the Rainbow Eyeball one.
[02:36:04.760 --> 02:36:10.760]   And this is Ron that she created here recently in honor of Pride Moth, and this is just another
[02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:14.520]   one of her little, fantastic pot heads. And I'm just so proud of her. She's just
[02:36:14.520 --> 02:36:19.880]   turning this into a fun little hobby for, and it just keeps her busy.
[02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:23.880]   And I said, I want to give you a shout-out. And there's a couple more behind me.
[02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:28.600]   So, and they're neat.
[02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:30.280]   We're going to get our website up.
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:34.440]   I did get our website up and running, finally.
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:34.920]   Oh, good.
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:38.360]   Just haven't done the Commerce page yet. But if people are interested,
[02:36:38.360 --> 02:36:40.760]   just give me a holler on social.
[02:36:40.760 --> 02:36:42.600]   Oh, tell us the address. Come on.
[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:46.280]   This is fantasticpotheads.com.
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:50.280]   Plantasticpotheads.com.
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:50.920]   I love it.
[02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:51.960]   Yeah.
[02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:57.640]   Like I said, the site is up. I don't have the Commerce site ready just yet.
[02:36:57.640 --> 02:36:59.560]   But if you're interested, just give me a shout-out.
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:02.440]   I think this one in my hand is like 40 bucks.
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:03.480]   They're really cool.
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:05.080]   They're really cool.
[02:37:05.080 --> 02:37:05.400]   It's a good job.
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:07.160]   Oh, I just love them.
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:08.680]   I love the little planners.
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:10.920]   Because we wanted to get the big ones for our deck,
[02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:13.880]   but now you've got the little ones too. Those are great.
[02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:16.920]   Yeah, I think the smaller ones are like 40 bucks.
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:18.040]   Yeah, really cute.
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:22.600]   Yeah, she went to the farmers market today and comes back just all smiles.
[02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:24.040]   I'm like, what are you so happy about?
[02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:25.160]   She's like, I sold some.
[02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:26.040]   Oh, good for him.
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:26.520]   Thank you.
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:29.720]   I love the ones behind you. That's great.
[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:30.280]   That's really.
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:32.200]   Thank you, Ant.
[02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:34.440]   And prove it. Thank you.
[02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:36.200]   That TV/hands on photography.
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:36.440]   Hop.
[02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:37.960]   That's right.
[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:38.520]   Every week.
[02:37:38.520 --> 02:37:43.640]   Get some inspiration, get some photos, take some pictures, enjoy.
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:46.200]   You know, our fun stuff coming up, y'all.
[02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:47.800]   This is not...
[02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:49.240]   Keep checking our hands on photography.
[02:37:49.240 --> 02:37:50.600]   I got some fun stuff coming up.
[02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:50.680]   I will.
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:55.560]   Interesting conversations and some tutorials in this week's episode is...
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:37:58.840]   I'll just say it's based on this season.
[02:37:58.840 --> 02:37:59.720]   We'll just say that.
[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:00.280]   Nice.
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:00.760]   Tune in.
[02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:03.960]   And I also want to throw people to our photography.
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:06.360]   What would you call that?
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:08.520]   Channel, I guess?
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:10.120]   Yeah, in our Discord server.
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:11.080]   In our Discord?
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:11.640]   Yep.
[02:38:11.640 --> 02:38:13.000]   Lots of great pictures in there.
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:14.680]   Conversations, you're in there, I know.
[02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:15.880]   And...
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:19.240]   One of our members, Mr. MJ Rider, has suggested some...
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:22.200]   a little bit of a show, if you will.
[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:23.880]   And I think I'm going to do it.
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:26.600]   And I'm probably just going to do it for members only.
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:28.360]   Get in the club.
[02:38:28.360 --> 02:38:29.400]   Club, twit.
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:31.240]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:34.040]   One of the cool things about this,
[02:38:34.040 --> 02:38:36.200]   they've created their own Club Twit Flickr group.
[02:38:36.200 --> 02:38:37.160]   Yep.
[02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:40.120]   So you can use that as well to share photos.
[02:38:40.120 --> 02:38:43.480]   It's just one of the many reasons I'm really loving Club Twit.
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:45.000]   Our Discord server is...
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:45.640]   Oh, my...
[02:38:45.640 --> 02:38:46.840]   It's fun.
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:48.120]   It's so busy.
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:50.200]   There's always somebody in there.
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:52.520]   Yeah, you're never alone when you're in the club.
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:53.400]   Let me tell you that.
[02:38:53.400 --> 02:38:56.680]   Seven bucks a month, you get access to the Discord server,
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:39:00.120]   you get ad-free versions of all our show, audio and video.
[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:03.560]   You also get the Twit+ feed.
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:08.200]   We're going to put a show up on the Twit+ feed this week, Sunday.
[02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:11.240]   Microsoft's having a big gaming event.
[02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:14.440]   And we're going to let members of the club join me.
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:16.760]   You know how we do that commentary during keynotes?
[02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:18.280]   I thought, "Hey, why is everybody?"
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:22.520]   So we're going to have the first 25 people who go into the video chat.
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:26.840]   10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern on Sunday.
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:31.640]   We'll join me as we comment on Microsoft's keynote.
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:33.560]   And then that'll go out on the Twit+ feed.
[02:39:33.560 --> 02:39:35.640]   We're working on some other things for the Twit+ feed.
[02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:39.240]   It's a special feed of content that doesn't make it to the podcast.
[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:43.560]   So all of that for seven bucks, just go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:45.880]   It's helps support the network.
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:48.280]   And I have to say it's a great community.
[02:39:48.280 --> 02:39:51.080]   It's people who are wonderful in every way.
[02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:51.960]   I concur.
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:52.200]   Yes.
[02:39:52.200 --> 02:39:56.440]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis, former TV guide,
[02:39:56.440 --> 02:39:58.200]   critic Frank Sinatra called him a bum,
[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:00.840]   but more importantly, the director of the town.
[02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:02.520]   You hear about them called me a rassable.
[02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:02.760]   So...
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:03.560]   Irrassable.
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:06.840]   The Irrassable Rascal, Jeff Jarvis,
[02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:09.960]   director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the...
[02:40:09.960 --> 02:40:12.120]   Great.
[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:13.480]   Great.
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:14.520]   Great.
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:15.880]   Newmark.
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:19.160]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:21.240]   Jeff, we love you.
[02:40:21.240 --> 02:40:22.440]   You're wonderful.
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:27.000]   Go have some kachoy pepe or something delicious, maybe a taco.
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.560]   Pizza tonight.
[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:30.520]   Nice.
[02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:30.920]   Nice.
[02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:34.920]   And of course, mother of dragons, Stacy Higginbotham.
[02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:41.880]   Stacy on IOT.com, that's where her newsletter lives.
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:44.840]   She's also got a good podcast.
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:45.640]   Yes?
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:47.160]   Oh, I'm going to pitch the podcast.
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:48.680]   So this Thursday's podcast,
[02:40:49.400 --> 02:40:53.320]   Paulus, I can't ever say it, Shogson, was the...
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:53.960]   Is the guest.
[02:40:53.960 --> 02:40:55.720]   He's the creator of Home Assistant.
[02:40:55.720 --> 02:40:55.960]   So...
[02:40:55.960 --> 02:40:57.080]   Oh, wow.
[02:40:57.080 --> 02:40:57.800]   Yeah.
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:40:58.520]   Must listen.
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:40:59.880]   He's good.
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:02.840]   I figured there's a big overlap in the Home Assistant to wake crowds.
[02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:03.240]   You bet.
[02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:03.880]   I think Joel would want to know.
[02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:04.280]   You bet.
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:08.440]   You could find the podcast on Stacy on IOT.com,
[02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:10.040]   that she does it with Kevin.
[02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:12.760]   Toeful's the Internet of Things podcast.
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:14.600]   And Thursday, that one will be great.
[02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:15.400]   Can't wait.
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:16.360]   Subscribe.
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:17.880]   Subscribe to our podcast too.
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:18.840]   Why not?
[02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:20.920]   There's a couple of ways you can participate.
[02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:23.320]   We do the show every Wednesday afternoon,
[02:41:23.320 --> 02:41:27.080]   about 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2,100 UTC.
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:28.280]   So if you're around at that time,
[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:32.760]   you can stream live audio and video from twit.tv/live.
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:37.960]   People who are streaming live often join the chatroom at irc.twit.tv
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:39.080]   or the Discord chat.
[02:41:39.080 --> 02:41:42.680]   You can also go in there and converse in the background.
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:47.480]   Of course, I watch the chats and make sure we get all the content from there into the show.
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:53.160]   We also, let's see, have on-demand versions of our website,
[02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:55.800]   which is twit.tv/twig.
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:42:00.440]   In fact, when you're there, you'll see a link on the web page to our YouTube channel.
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:03.160]   That's also got every show up there.
[02:42:03.160 --> 02:42:06.120]   And a couple of well-known podcast clients.
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:08.040]   We also have the RSS link too,
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:10.680]   so you can add that to whichever podcast client you like.
[02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:13.080]   And that's a good way to listen,
[02:42:13.080 --> 02:42:15.320]   because it'll be available the minute it's done.
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:20.840]   In its polished form, if you do subscribe at a podcast client
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:22.200]   and they allow you to leave reviews,
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:24.440]   a five-star review would be much appreciated.
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:27.400]   Thank you very much for people who don't listen in real time,
[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:28.680]   but still want to chat.
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:30.920]   Of course, there's lots of ways to do that.
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:35.080]   Yes, there's the Discord, but there's also the free twit.community, our forums.
[02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:37.560]   There's also twit.social, our mastodon instance.
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:41.960]   It's kind of like a Twitter for the open source Fediverse.
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:44.520]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:48.840]   Have a wonderful weekend, and we'll see you next week on Twig.
[02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:52.520]   Hey, if you like tech news,
[02:42:52.520 --> 02:42:57.080]   but you also like hearing about it from the people who are actually writing the stories,
[02:42:57.080 --> 02:42:58.120]   well, I've got a show for you.
[02:42:58.120 --> 02:42:59.720]   It's called Tech News Weekly,
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:03.240]   and it's me, Jason Howell, along with my co-host, Micah Sargent.
[02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:07.720]   Every week, we invite the people making and breaking the biggest tech news stories
[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:11.800]   from around the web onto this show to talk to us about it.
[02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:17.000]   It's a lot of fun. You should check it out. Tech News Weekly can be found at twit.tv/tnw
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:23.960]   every Thursday. We'll see you there.
[02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:29.480]   [Music]
