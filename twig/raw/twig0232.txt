[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.760]   Think up is up actually is now down because everybody's just gone because everyone just found out about it
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.800]   Yeah, because I've announced it here on the show. Yeah, thank you. I'm very very excited
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.440]   It's been a long particularly this past week has been very long days. So I'm very excited
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.840]   Congratulations. Thank you. That's exciting. That's Jeff Jarvis. He's a professor of journalism city University of Newark also a regular
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.040]   Not in Davos yet
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.040]   No, no next week. All right, and Jeff Jarvis dot think up dot com. Yeah
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.880]   Or plus Jeff Starves or budge machine calm. That's right. We can now start using our think up URLs
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.720]   Yes, also here from gig. Oh Matthew Ingram and by the way Matthew. I owe you a great debt of gratitude
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.920]   You sure do you did a
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:41.000]   Fabulous roll-up page of everything there you need to know about the FCC decision yesterday. Oh, thanks priceless
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.760]   Is that something new because that's a great idea?
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.880]   No, we do that periodically when when there's a big story that's complicated and it's developing. So I
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.280]   Enjoy them because I enjoy reading them. So I try and make them, you know as to pick out all the good stuff
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.280]   So you you can just read one thing
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.280]   But that's exactly what I did and it's very useful for me because of course we have to talk about this thing and
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.120]   You know the initial media coverage just for people who haven't read about this
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.520]   the federal appeals court
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:24.120]   Over essentially some say overturned the notion of net neutrality by telling the FCC that it did not have
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:32.000]   jurisdiction in a case against Verizon Verizon had sued saying exactly that in the court said you're right now the
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.040]   FCC may appeal
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.600]   But there are other interpretations of this one interpretation is it's merely that the FCC
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.880]   Attempted jurisdiction in a way that perhaps was inappropriate because in the in the decision the judge
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.500]   Who wrote the decision was pretty clear that net neutrality did need to be protected
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.400]   Ah
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   Am I right?
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:03.920]   They basically did it the wrong way. Yeah, so they instead of they they tried to treat the ISPs like common carriers without calling them common carriers
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.560]   Is it why you know that's an interesting point because
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.520]   Common carrier if they had said you are a broadband service providers are like telephone companies
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:23.840]   FCC regulates radio television telephone companies among others if you were a common carrier then we could regulate the internet the same way
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.680]   Why is the FCC reluctant to do that?
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.440]   Well, it's not just the FCC
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.080]   I think there's a lot of people who are reluctant to have it do that because if you recall they there was a big fuss when they were
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.840]   Talking about maybe regulating the internet people said no you shouldn't do that
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.480]   Right, so we kind of you know people kind of want them to so that we have net neutrality
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.120]   But don't want them to screw it up and so the risk is the FCC being what it is
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.080]   It tries to help and manages to screw everything up
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.160]   In fact, I remember talking with John Perry Barlow
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:09.360]   Who's on the board of the EFF one of its founding members and even within the board of the electronic frontier foundation
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.800]   There's this debate over well does a government protect the internet or is that the worst possible solution?
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:25.680]   right, right and I think you know even if you agree a group that agrees that the open internet unfettered net neutrality is something that needs
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.440]   protecting who does it
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.960]   Who makes that happen? Well the argument the argument that that Corey doctoral makes is that we're not trying to regulate the internet
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.720]   We're trying to not break the internet that the internet has always been
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.760]   Open in this way and the phone companies are the ones who are trying to
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.720]   Go to a new direction and you're trying to stop them from doing that
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.600]   And that's a good point and in fact if you see the internet as a sort of evolution of
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.120]   You know phone lines and phone service then then that sort of common carrier principles should
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.200]   Continue so all the court said was you need to make that explicit
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.920]   Mike was outside of the court of the FCC scene
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.480]   telcos as
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:18.880]   Common carriers in the internet context. So I actually there was a fascinating Twitter discussion last night that Mark Andreessen was involved in
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.800]   That that ohm started and I did a sort of pull together all of Mark Andreessen's tweets about it
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.920]   And his point was that he he very much wants an open internet and is very much in favor of net neutrality
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.080]   But he's afraid that the investments that are required in new networking technology won't occur
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.000]   If carriers and ISPs are treated like common carriers that they won't
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.560]   Invest the money because they're not going to be able to get the return Mark Andreessen
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.560]   That's where I'm attempting to square the circle. You can't you know how do you how do you encourage investment and
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.080]   Preserve net neutrality. Yeah, but but the problem with that is number one. They've invested so far
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.800]   This is how we got the internet. We have so far as my investment
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:06.120]   And and and neutrality so far they haven't had the balls to to go against it though AT&T just is just starting to try
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:13.600]   And and second a lot of these people are our phone companies that are losing their entire phone business and a lot of them are cable companies
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.200]   That are starting to lose their cable business. So having a decent internet service for consumers
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.680]   There's no question. There's market demand for that
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:29.560]   Double charging on both ends of it if you have a monopoly and you get away with it and if you're you know phone companies
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.080]   That's the way you treat people as prisoners. Yeah
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:39.000]   So the real solution in the long run isn't regulation the real solution in the long run has to be competition and
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.560]   Has to be consumers going to a to a decent choice. The problem is we don't have that competition. We don't have that choice
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:51.720]   The judge the judge specifically mentioned that yeah, you know he said even though I'm making this
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.000]   Ruling the risk is that that these companies will take advantage of the fact that there's very little choice
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.120]   So does the FCC appeal or does the FCC rewrite its regulations?
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:07.120]   There's also some concern because Tom wheel wheeler the chairman of the FCC is a former cable company lobbyist
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:15.160]   But he it seems he's saying the right words at least now maybe not in the past about net neutrality
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.400]   What is the FCC's next step there are gonna be a steady is going to upset he has not
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:27.840]   And in fact Mike Masnick at tector pointed out in his piece that even if it goes to the Supreme Court
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.760]   There there's no real indication that sort of in the law that
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:39.200]   The Supreme Court would find any you know any other way than then the appeals court did no
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.080]   In fact, I think that's why the decision was written so narrowly. It's very clear that the FCC does not have the jurisdiction
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:51.160]   If you don't declare broadband providers common carriers, and that's been the issue all along
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:09:00.240]   Who has jurisdiction and it's I don't I think I think Mike's right that Supreme Court now Mike is worried because he thinks that the outcome is going to increase government
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.960]   regulation
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.160]   Yeah, and then that is the risk I mean the the you know
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:11.000]   Mark Andreessen mentioned that as well the if you look at virtually any other example
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.200]   If you if you give a regulatory body like the FCC an inch they will take a mile and that's and the risk is that they just wind up
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.880]   you know
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:27.120]   Cluttering everything up and slowing it down instead of making it better for years. It was a hypothetical discussion that the
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:33.440]   AT&T and Verizon and Sprint said oh we would never do that. It's not hypothetical AT&T with this sponsored
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.200]   Content proposal is doing exactly
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:47.160]   The wrong thing they're saying sponsored data. They're saying if you are a company like oh, I don't know Netflix and you want to give us a little extra
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.720]   will
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.840]   We will make sure that it does not come out against the can't the bandwidth caps that our customers have
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.120]   But if you're a company like Twitter and you don't give us a little extra well
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.920]   I'm sorry, but every bit they download goes against their bandwidth caps that is
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.280]   very clearly
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:10.760]   The kind of discrimination we don't want and unfortunately, it's also really attractive if you have huge customers
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.520]   You know bills. Yeah, customers are gonna like it, but but it implements this toll road
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:22.640]   mentality Fred Wilson had a great post where he looked at you know imagine a startup going looking for VC funding
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:29.320]   They've got this great communications tool or this great feature photo sharing or whatever and and the VC says well
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.680]   Why would I?
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:36.780]   Subsidize you or fund you your competitor has paid money to the carriers so they get preferential treatment
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.840]   Hmm there's no upside
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.480]   Yep
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.720]   Yeah customers and we need to be educated I think
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.360]   Frankly that
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.360]   Yeah, this sounds like a good idea
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.960]   Netflix won't cost you anything
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:11:01.000]   YouTube won't cost you anything, but what it is it's fundamentally on democratic because and this is the power of the Internet
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.840]   It's this democratizing force and this is why you have to do this because these come I don't think there isn't there is a conflict between
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:14.320]   Innovation on the Internet and limiting what these companies can do because as you pointed out Jeff these companies are the incumbents
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.400]   Protecting old business models exactly and I think the two questions
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.080]   Go ahead, Matthew
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:22.560]   Yeah
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:30.120]   I mean the risk is if if we do get that model we're certain things like YouTube or Netflix or given preferential treatment and you get a
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.080]   Discount you're you're not even gonna know what you're missing because it won't be there
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:39.800]   You literally won't realize what you have seen yeah, and nobody would start something like twit you'd be nuts
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.360]   Yeah, yeah, I
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.000]   So so I'll get to that question in a second, but before I get there
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.520]   Is there a chance that the FCC is gonna declare them common carriers?
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:56.720]   You're anybody speculate to that end no one appeals decision instead we'll do what the court says and we'll go
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.720]   It seems like the right thing to do it
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:04.280]   I mean Wheeler seems to be hinting that he wants to do that there was another commissioner who
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:10.560]   But there everybody's dancing around it. I just don't think they've you know even though it's two small words
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.760]   It's it's it would be quite a huge step
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.880]   Tim Wu wrote would be something for the New Yorker
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:21.760]   Saying that you know effectively that's that's all they have to do. It's not that difficult
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.560]   But it's gonna have tremendous implications
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:30.240]   Second question so we we mobilized so put in people what's to mobilize here?
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.960]   Well, there's gonna be free presses trying to do that yeah online petition
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.680]   And freedom of the press who sound similar but are different
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.800]   organizations, but you know they're trying to get
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:51.680]   Sort of grounds while going I think it's a complicated issue for people understand and so it's hard to sort of rally behind
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:13:01.520]   And then third question Leo, how does this affect you well right now it doesn't these are this is all somewhat speculative right yes
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:09.000]   It presumes two things one that most viewers will start watching on mobile because this is all about mobile right now
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.480]   although it could easily extend to
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.400]   You know home internet service providers. There's no reason Comcast would watch
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:23.480]   AT&T sponsored data and say hey, that's not a bad idea. We ought to do that right of rise and may have agreed with Google some time ago
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:31.600]   That was in proposed FCC regulations that are now thrown out anyway, so right rise and says well what the way with Google who's that yeah?
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.440]   Yeah, you could see Comcast saying you know you if you if there's this deal
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:42.600]   You don't have a bandwidth cap and if there isn't this deal you do have a bandwidth cap so so a it doesn't disadvantage us
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.600]   It changes it not at all right now because right now everybody's charged
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:52.400]   Everything counts against your bandwidth cap so it wouldn't change anything for us right now
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:59.320]   but it would raise a barrier to entry to somebody coming in later and it could could affect us if we don't get the
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:05.440]   And I do think by the way most viewings gonna go mobile if all of a sudden we don't get the mobile viewing because people say well
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.720]   I don't see why I should watch Twitter because it's gonna cost me when when Netflix and YouTube do not
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:16.960]   Do you see have you seen a spike in mobile viewing is it is it is it relative to the kind of spike we're seeing in general internet?
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:22.440]   Usage a twit that's a good question. I haven't looked at those numbers. I don't know
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.200]   I mean I imagine that people should dream
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:29.320]   I don't know I'm sure that most of your listeners download the mp3's and listen
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:36.360]   That's changing rapidly and that is changing imagine. Yeah, so more streaming a lot more streaming streaming is coming on strong
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:41.480]   And everybody I think everybody agrees streaming is the future for content. Yeah. Yeah, so
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:48.680]   I just saw a number for somebody big like NBC or something like that flash by on Twitter and they
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.040]   Mobile was a huge proportion. I have to think it's gonna. I thought it would be yeah
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:59.020]   I have to think it's gonna be and it will all computing is moving to mobile all computing is related tablets and smartphones
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.680]   That's computing not just content consumption. That's computing
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:08.720]   so I'm you know, I mean people watch us on our on their Roku box is much to my surprise, but I
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.060]   Just feel like mobile is the future and
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:16.160]   You know anything that makes I'm not so much worried about to it
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:22.200]   I just I hate to see anything that makes it less democratic the power power the internet the reason the internet has wrought such change
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:27.060]   And we'll continue to write to rewrite the rules and change everything is it's a fundamentally democratic
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.380]   That's so much more important
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.880]   Isn't it?
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.040]   Then they yes, that's where yeah, and there's plenty of money to be made I
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:40.880]   Mean if there were rules made to protect Barnes and Noble against Amazon calm that would be bad
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:48.120]   We'd all agree on that well, but that's exactly what happens in in Europe. We know where in Germany. You cannot discount books, right?
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.640]   Not allowed to yeah, I don't I don't know whether allowed to give free shipping or not
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:59.260]   But but the bookstores are absolutely protected and and institutions protect institutions
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.500]   They don't protect their disruptors, right?
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:10.000]   Well anyway, I highly recommend if you want to and I so it looks like you're continuing to keep this up to date Matthew
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.620]   Which is cool? Yeah, I've been trying to add stuff as much as I can
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:20.840]   So go to giga home and look at Matthew Ingram's article that is continuing a continuing story
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.980]   What you need to know about the court decision that just struck down net neutrality
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:29.240]   And I you know I the only thing I'd quibble with is I don't know
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.480]   I don't know if it's clear that it struck down net neutrality
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:37.960]   It just told the FCC that it could not do it this way. Well, the only well, it's certainly on hiatus
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:42.740]   That neutrality takes a vacation. Yeah, the only
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.820]   Government statement of net neutrality was the FCC's ruling and that is now
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.580]   Boided there go there is no protection from that in trial. Yes, if you're a conspiracy theorist
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:56.900]   You could say the FCC didn't fan that. I think this is what ours technically said didn't fact screw it up intentionally
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:03.020]   Maybe you know that like well, we don't want to because I mean everybody saw this coming
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.180]   They did. Yeah. Yes. This is not a surprise
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:13.880]   Not a surprise and the FCC surely has intelligent lawyers who would know that the courts gonna say well you can't do it this way
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:22.600]   Yeah, and I know Tim Tim Wu who wrote he's he's the law professor who coined the term net neutrality
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.860]   he he wrote up quite a
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.060]   sort of rant about the FCC and how they
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.760]   Deliberately instead of using their big guns. They use the little guns or the pea shooter
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:40.800]   And it makes you wonder why why was it just arrogance or was it were they hoping it would somehow they could slide it through or?
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.080]   You know, or was it just it does seem strange
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.640]   I feel like Tim has a little bit of a bias here because his book
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.140]   the master switch the premise of it was
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:57.000]   Like every other innovative new technology. It's only free for a little while than the big guys come in
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.020]   He well expects this to happen
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:05.060]   Right, although his tip to be fair his his view is that it goes in cycles, right?
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:09.660]   So it's open then it closes because large players want to make money
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:15.240]   They influence policy then eventually it gets disrupted and open things
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.080]   It becomes more open and then closed and then open alright
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:23.360]   He starts off in the beginning of his we've tried to get him on by the way, and he now consults for somebody
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.260]   I can't remember who that makes an impossible for him to do interviews
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.320]   really
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.920]   Really? Yeah, he did one with the Washington Post. Yeah, maybe that's changed. I should I should inquire again
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.940]   Cuz I think it's I think he's very smart. He was teaches at Columbia. He's very smart. Yep
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:45.580]   Yeah, extremely smart. He actually worked or I think he worked at Google or consulted with Google for a while way back
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:52.820]   I actually was on a TV program with him up here in Toronto and we were talking about I think the master switch had just come out and
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.420]   and he was looking at sort of the
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.780]   You know from the earliest days of the net and and phones
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:07.640]   You know the cycle that that tends to come closed open closed open. I hate it. I mean yeah
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.520]   It's it's a good observation and he uses the radio TV newspapers
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:18.740]   And long distance starts with long distance service telephone service and says you know this all started open and
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:23.720]   freewheeling and innovative and then yeah the money came in and everything is shut down
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:30.460]   Yeah, but I think I think you'd also make the case the Internet is not like anything else we've ever seen before yes
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.440]   Yes in many many ways. I mean, it's truly global for one thing
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.020]   Agreed agreed although you you know the telegraph was global
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:46.280]   Yeah, I don't know what it didn't have animated gifts. It did not have cats
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:50.720]   And you couldn't deploy balloons and get telegraphs. Yeah
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.080]   That's where they really messed up yeah
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:58.540]   Balloon telegraphs let's take a break when we come back. We still have the change log
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.900]   I'm gonna get Gina to do that before she has to run off and save the servers at think up
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.580]   And then and then I would like to talk about a little thing called nest

[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:12.080]   And the change you're in chief ginger penny
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.600]   I'm actually gonna help ask you guys help with the change log this week
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.440]   I'm less prepared than usual since I've been in launch mode a little busy are we?
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.240]   I'm gonna give it a little shot
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.760]   I'm honored that you took my website down Leo. You're the first it makes me happy that you're the first person to take down
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.680]   My app that it feels like a like I leveled as a human unlocked. It's a rite of passage
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.360]   Don't blame me blame the Twitter army my friends
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.800]   And it's running just fine
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.640]   I have great people so but thank you for doing that
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.080]   All right the change log
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:55.080]   Chrome 32 launches with my favorite feature ever in a browser in a really long time noisy tab indicators a new windows 8 look and
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:59.600]   Better malware blocking and supervised users. I just I man
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.920]   I just love this noisy tab indicator basically
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:08.320]   It's just a little icon on your tab that shows you which one of your tabs is playing a video streaming
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:16.280]   a sound music whatever or using your webcam or casting to your TV if you're using Chromecast so
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:22.960]   Really really helpful. I've always got you know dozens of tabs open and when you can't find the one that's playing that gosh darn music
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.480]   It's kind of a pain and that's chrome 32. What else do we have here?
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:32.220]   I'll try before you move on to mention we talked a lot about the new UI the new
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:38.540]   Chrome in chrome 32 on windows 8 and Paul Therat and Mary Jofoli on our windows weekly show were
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:44.080]   Pissed off. They felt it was an anti-competitive move the Google was trying to you know
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.240]   Get people to embrace the chrome UI because they want everybody to a chrome you OS
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.120]   I disagree strongly. I don't think Google's out to screw it
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.200]   I think Google wants people to use Chrome on windows
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:02.960]   But a lot of people are saying that the scroll bars to narrow the UI is not native. So it's not native. It's not native
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:08.040]   Yeah, that's that's interesting. It's a bold move. That's like you're gonna use our UI
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.680]   We see that all the time they say well in fact Microsoft does it all the time they did it with Windows
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.480]   Internet Explorer 11
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.480]   So it's not unusual
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.000]   In fact, that's what the chromium team pointed out. They said we have a new graphic engine
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.720]   We wanted to unify the controls across the board not just Chrome OS and Mac OS and windows
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   but everywhere and
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.920]   it because of this new engine and
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.760]   They say hey Microsoft does it all the time
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.160]   But I have to say it's always a mistake to go non-native. Don't you think Gina as a programmer?
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:43.400]   Didn't to not go native. Yeah, you got to use native controls. Yeah, I mean it just yeah
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.400]   It feels better. It's just it's a jarring experience
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:50.880]   I think for the user when that the in app doesn't feel native look at Microsoft's Android apps
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:57.040]   Says Jimbo logic in the chat room good point. I mean they do it not to Android
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:03.160]   I don't say that I'm running it. Do you think Google and Microsoft hate each other so much that Google would do this just to piss off Microsoft?
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.160]   I don't think so
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:11.720]   Yes, you do Matthew Ingram says yes Paul and Mary Joe thought I was a naive innocent to think otherwise I
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:18.200]   Don't see why they wouldn't why not they they do not like each other. I think that's obvious. I'm your muscles
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.200]   I think I think Google is just
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:28.440]   Standardizing on a particular look and feel across all their projects allah allah Larry and this is the one manifestation of that
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:34.960]   Yeah, you know, we're seeing hamburger menus. We're seeing some particular UI bits, you know and everywhere and it just kind of
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:40.040]   Went to went to Windows. I actually haven't seen it on Windows. So I don't know how sort of jarring it is
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.840]   Looks just like the Chromebook
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:47.000]   Right looks just like the Chromebook. Yeah, I see there's a screenshot here on the on the next web
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   I would say the
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.240]   noisy tab
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.880]   Is one of those little things like it's a huge it's not that big a deal
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:01.920]   But it is so annoying like if it's just when you have 55 tabs open and something starts auto playing
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.960]   Which of course all websites do even though it's a big metal finger to your users?
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:12.000]   It's it's just so annoying to be able to see that happening. So I'm I bow down to Google for that
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.840]   Yeah, that's that's a really nice thing and there are plenty of extensions that do this kind of thing
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:22.560]   But it's a nice implementation and hey, it's a nice way to promote or show off the Chromecast as well
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.360]   That they got in the cool cast icon as well
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:32.820]   What else we got a YouTube launches a new comments management tool and chat? I was gonna ask you a little bit about this
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.600]   I haven't had a chance to take a look. It's a new tool for managing comments on its site
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:41.640]   It gives video creators a central inbox for all the comments that their videos receive
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:47.240]   Yeah, and so what happened was is when they did the big switch to Google Plus
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:53.520]   They removed a way for you to look at one big inbox and see all your comments
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:59.600]   And so now this is these is my comments. I have a way just go to a central location. You moderate
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:06.400]   Yeah, and so and so I could you know thumbs up trash it flag it and so I don't have to go into every individual
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.360]   Place to find my most recent comments
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.960]   That's nice because anybody produces a lot of comment on content on YouTube
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:19.240]   All sorts of comments. Yeah, and as you can see it tells you which which video
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:26.120]   You know it's been you know, I just uploaded this one today. This one's been out for a while now
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.240]   and so
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.200]   It's good to have it all in one one locations that I don't have to
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:39.000]   Jump from video to video to check out all my comments. So much much needed and very happy that we have it now
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.960]   Yeah, very cool very cool
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:51.960]   Google Plus is now showing up in your gmail. This is a new feature that allows anyone to email you and vice versa
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.960]   Not anyone not just anyone in your circles anyone
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:03.360]   Any unless you said it otherwise. Yeah, unless you opt out. So it's so it by
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.800]   You can set it. You can set it right. Yeah, but default is turned on
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:13.600]   But and you cannot doubt but you know defaults are powerful things. So I said Leo. I wouldn't hear
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:19.520]   You don't sound too happy about this. You know, I I don't read much email anyway, so I could be bad
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.840]   I don't know. Oh, is that why you don't respond?
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.360]   How many circles are you in?
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.720]   Almost half a million fewer than these guys
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:36.040]   So supposedly if you're in more than what is it 10 or 20 thousand you get the special treatment you get some special treatment
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.160]   Yeah, so I don't I tried to look at the the ops out opt out so I wasn't there
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.000]   So am I am I have to approve at the first time though, right?
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.880]   I know my default and I haven't ever looked at this before says that only people in my circles can email me
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:58.400]   Okay, that's from where it's in your settings of gmail. Yeah, it's in your way. That's via your Google Plus profile. That's different
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.700]   Or is it? No, that's what it says on this article. It's
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:10.600]   My email is not my Google Plus because my main gmail is apps are
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:14.920]   So so in mind by default, I didn't change it
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:19.000]   Currently it says circles, so I must be in that vaunted
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.080]   Celebrity yeah, mine did to mine did mine did to anybody with more than a few thousand followers
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:31.000]   But the other choices are any and this is the default anyone on Google Plus. I actually changed it to anyone
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.360]   Which maybe makes me a mental case
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.360]   Wide open Matthew
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:42.720]   You know email addresses are not that difficult to find you know
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:47.200]   It's an interesting debate about like our email addresses really private like is somebody sending you an email?
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.800]   I mean, I guess people feel differently about this
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.320]   Gina is true that no one gets your email
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:59.640]   I mean the oh no another privacy fear is I understand nobody gets your email and they don't need your email
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.960]   They just route through just rouse through so I don't think it matters that much
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.720]   They don't get your email. They can still email you until you turn off and you can say don't email
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.200]   Don't let this person do this again. You can block this and you want on a per individual basis
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.760]   You can do that's good. Yeah, right. I Jeff's point is a good one. You could argue that it's actually a
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.840]   Privacy setting it's making your email address more private
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:29.520]   Yeah, cuz I could set it to no one like unlike Matthew Ingram and then nobody can email me via my Google Plus profile
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.340]   It's so I can communicate with you without you giving them your email address
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:36.000]   And then you can block them right you can't once but it has your email address. You really can't block
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.920]   Oh, that's a good boy. I mean I see what you're saying. I see yeah
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.960]   So I actually like that feature so people will email me using the Google Plus
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:50.800]   Connection and then I decide do I want to give them my real email address to know what I mean
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:57.480]   So you it's a filter in a way. Do you want to extend that connection or do you want to just keep it at you can Google Plus?
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.680]   Me and that's it.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.680]   Right thing
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.020]   It's like the level of policy how far do you want to go second base?
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.320]   Yeah, right like you can have my Twitter handle right if I like you can have my email
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:11.880]   Right if I really like you can have my phone number text me and then if I'm in love with you can call me or
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:16.280]   Or you can have like a push a push button restraining order, which is great
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:21.480]   Like here for my DNA sample
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:36.000]   Another Google Plus related change to Gmail is that you can start you can not star your contacts in
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.320]   Gmail much like you can start messages, but when you start contacts in your contacts if you're using Android your
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:48.240]   Start contact sync with your Android favorites. So it shows up that those people show up in your favorites on Android
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.720]   So starting a contact on the desktop will start that same person who Android contacts
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:57.720]   So you can kind of keep that in sync and have your have your favorite people
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.000]   Huge deal, but you know I do like that favorites feature
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.720]   I do use it I do too and there's a lot of nice tie-ins for instance my Motorola X
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:11.520]   Assist program says nobody can ring you during do not disturb ours unless they're in your favorites
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.720]   So amending your favorites is very handy. So that way people I want to call me can
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.560]   Right, right and finally thank you for this one Jeff
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:27.480]   You can find creative commons creative commons images in Google image search a little bit easier now
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.640]   You have to open up the advanced search page to restrict the results
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:36.440]   But now you can click on the search tools button to the right if you search for an image
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:41.040]   So click on search tools and then you can filter by by usage rights
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.160]   So label for reuse labeled for commercial use label for use of money
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:51.120]   All the time great anyone who publishes and writes and needs needs art for their work
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:55.000]   This is this is huge all of our art is creative commons
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   And so I've used other search engines that do that, but it's so much easier to use Google images. Yeah
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.440]   Yeah, you could always do it before you just had to go to the advanced. Yes. No, you don't have to right rice is easier
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:13.160]   Which I really like because it encourages people to be aware of you know credit
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.000]   You know not just pulling pulling photos and they can do it and they could do it, you know
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.320]   Right right there on the front page that having to know all the tricks
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.320]   That was Larry Lessig's idea
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:28.360]   Really? Yeah, well, he's the creative creative commons. So that makes sense
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:33.440]   And that my friends is the Google change log
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.560]   You didn't need our help at all you send bagger you
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.840]   Thanks for the assist
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:45.360]   Let's check out real quickly. I'm going to go to so it's Leo because okay
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.680]   So I got an email as a as one of the sponsor, you know
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.040]   You originally asked people to go out and we did a crowdfunding campaign
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.520]   Right, you're one of our early backers
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:59.440]   So I got an email saying grab your name which I did Leo LaPorte dot think up calm and you've been importing
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.440]   Tweets
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:06.840]   Oh and data. Yep, 32 tweets so far. I don't know what the total number of tweets is so that's is that
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.040]   200 that's the API is rate limited by the API
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:16.640]   It is it is that's as far as the API will page back, but now that you have think up running
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:23.000]   It's running 24/7 ready new tweet you tweet or mention or link or anything that a favorite that you do from here on in think up
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   We'll capture awesome
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.960]   And I and and in those I spent 13 hours doing those tweets
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:37.880]   So but I have a total I'm just looking on Twitter of 6,861 tweets Twitter just does not allow you to go any farther than 3,200
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.240]   Right, that's right, but we're gonna have a feature where you can import you can do it
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.040]   It's a takeout you know you can export your tweets and import them to think up so you'll be able to fill in your archives
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.760]   Oh, yeah, right. I'd like to do that. Yeah, that's yeah
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.680]   Yeah
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:58.760]   So and then you get lots of insights, so this is just the front page it tells me that I'm on 40 lists and that people think I am a
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.880]   techie
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.880]   tech people twit an
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.440]   Artist producer actor
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:10.040]   It shows you on this day my most popular tweet on this day last year and
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:16.280]   This is great stuff. I love this. It's just the beginning you've only got you only got a few insights here
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:23.360]   But it's just the beginning it'll show you it'll show you a lot a lot of cool information like as the system gets your data and as you you know
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.320]   As you participate on the network and you'll also be able to connect to your Facebook account once once you we get you
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.320]   Logged in you would have a cat Facebook and see it as well
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:35.240]   But if you if you look at Jeff's Jeff, I think has a lot more insights and I think I think Matthew does too
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.240]   Why why do they have more than me?
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:42.280]   Well, it depends on what kind of activity there is like it looks like. Oh, yeah, look at Jeff
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:46.960]   Yeah, did you see that's really Daniel follow Jeff Jarvis?
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:52.880]   Wow one person in New York follows you Wendy Kaufman
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.600]   This is cool. Yeah, you got a lot more insights so because he's a more active tweeter
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:03.800]   Yeah, I mean it depends you know depends on what yeah, like so so Wendy looks like us from New York's little match like local followers
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:10.360]   When people local will follow you and if you retweet a lot if you favorited things in years past it will surface that
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.760]   Never favored anything so yeah, so it depends on how you
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:19.440]   Purpose I favor the people who this had nice things my book so we could quote it look
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.960]   81,000 people saw Matthew Ingram's tweet thanks to Jeff Jarvis
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:28.760]   Yeah, cuz Jeff retweets a lot you're welcome Matthew. You can't say thank you
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:33.560]   You should charge a cent per
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.280]   Do it and what was that you were showing a chat you're you have it too. I guess huh?
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:42.400]   Here's what oh yeah, this had favored in I was he's talking about favoriting
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:49.200]   So I favorited this yet last in the in the years past seems like I should tweet favorite retweet do more stuff
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:54.880]   Yeah, this is you should yeah, this you definitely you get you get more insights and you and get more sort of positive feedback
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.200]   The more you sort of promote other people stuff and favorite their stuff and and like I said this is just the beginning
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.320]   We've got a ton more insights coming out and and and it's it's kind of like
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:07.440]   They're kind of like insights show up over time
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.120]   You know like they're not all here
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:15.160]   But as you use the system and as the system evolves they'll show up so it's gonna be fun. What's the basis of it's nice to be nice
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.000]   Yeah at the bottom that sounds like a gena ism doesn't you know?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.600]   It's funny it was actually it was a nihilism making fun of G not making fun of me
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.320]   But he it was it was one of a really early mockups a Neil dropped out of the footer
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:32.760]   And I loved it because you know we always joke about hot, you know, I'm the nice like people know people associate nice with me
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.520]   Yeah, so so and Neil said, you know, it's nice to be nice and he dropped in the footer
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.360]   And we just never we just always kept it
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.120]   It's sort of a little little inner inner joke and you know the
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.200]   The point of the app is to be sort of
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.360]   You know positive and show you kind of like the good part the good part to the network the thing
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.320]   You know pat you on the back for the things you're doing well suggest things that that could be better
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:58.240]   I mean the whole the whole idea is to sort of make your interactions on these networks like as meaningful as possible
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:06.200]   And to kind of you know like we have superpowers with social networks and think up's goal is to kind of show you how to use the powers for good
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.720]   So it's sort of sort of jabs with our with our mission and Matthew
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:17.040]   What are you using as your think-up handle Matthew engram or it's Matthew. I Matthew. I I try to one I
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.360]   It's it's one tea. Oh, that's one. Sorry about that
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.720]   Is that your mother we should parent or should apologize see Matthew just
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.000]   Look at all this Wow
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:35.120]   Retweet this is a new seven-day record for you Matthew 17 people retweeted you three retweeted this one
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.960]   Forg I can okay. I can play that game. I can say stuff people retweet
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:45.000]   It's interesting to see the ones that because it's not always the ones I thought you know
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.200]   I when I was using the think-up plug-in for WordPress
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:54.600]   I would just go and check now and then and some things would get retweeted that I didn't even realize
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:00.360]   Do you know what I mean? It's hard. It's just interesting to see what people choose and what they don't yeah, yeah
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:07.520]   Okay, I'm learning from this actually this is teaching me what I need to do to get more retweets
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:12.880]   Do not say please retweet at the end of your that's a bad. Please aren't you know, please aren't you?
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:17.520]   Please aren't you that's like oh, that's actually that would be really good insight like hey stop begging for retweets
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.080]   Yeah
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:26.680]   We have a me tweet insight so if you if you retweet tweets that mention yourself we think of
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:33.920]   Yeah, we really wrestled with the copy on that one because we're like well, we don't want to scold people
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.920]   But we do want to bring it up
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:46.760]   This is good so it's so how can people get get this it's a start well right now
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.040]   We're only open in limited preview to our crowdfunding backers
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:55.760]   We're gonna be we're not accepting new signups for another couple weeks because we're just gonna look at this data and improve it and
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.120]   Listen to our sort of early backers
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:02.520]   We wanted to give all our early backers kind of first dibs on you know checking out the data and giving us feedback
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.120]   So you should go to think up calm right now
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:10.720]   If you're interested in getting one of these yourself and just drop your name into the on-premailing list and we will let you know
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.720]   When it's open to the public yay
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:19.160]   Congratulations, thank you to all of you for being so supportive and for back in the campaign and thank you for bringing us apart
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.160]   I've been dying for this
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:26.560]   Great, that's great. I'm going to be I'll be emailing each one of you asking you what you think about
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:31.320]   About your stream and what what else you'd like to see in your stream now that you can kind of get an idea
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.760]   What what kind of analytics we can do now what when I signed in it said?
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:38.240]   I'm not really signing in yet because it just says you reserved your name
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:43.480]   Yeah, are there other other foot when I sign in other other functions and things that we don't see on this page?
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.280]   Yeah, when you sign in you'll be able to connect another account
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:50.200]   So if you're a pro user you'll be able to connect up to ten accounts or if you're just a member
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:54.520]   You can connect the Facebook accounts. You'll be able to see Facebook and Twitter insights in the same stream and
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:41:00.800]   We have not yet, but we have an Instagram plugin a YouTube plugin
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:05.400]   Bitly plug in Google Maps plugin all good that they're all gonna launch as well
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.760]   So you'll be able to see those and you'll be able to add your Instagram account for example
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:13.240]   Later on so you just be able to manage your account when you're logged in and eventually and you'll be able to turn
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.240]   Set your stream to private if you'd like as well
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:19.480]   So a little just administrative functions once you are able to log in
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:25.960]   I'm the one of the features. I really liked was seeing your followers or people you follow
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:32.360]   based on you know, are they noisy are they you know, are they sort of communicators?
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:37.440]   Do they it's interesting to see you know those especially if you're trying to filter out
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.360]   People what I'm trying to do now because I'm following way too many
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:47.000]   That's right. You know what Matthew you're right. We used to have that in the old dashboard and I don't think that we've we've converted that over to an insight
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.400]   That's a really good idea. I like that one a lot. No, it's true. Like show me my chatty as followers or show me
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.120]   You know my most quiet. Yep. Yep. I like that a lot
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.480]   I might make me use Twitter more
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:04.340]   Good for Twitter. That's what this is good for Twitter. What are your what's your social net with Google+?
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:08.200]   We also have a Google+ plugin. We haven't we haven't gone live without the hosted version, but well
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:12.440]   Really wherever the goal is to give you these kind of insights wherever you are
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:18.360]   Into a single stream. So now that is it hard to do with Google+ because of the limited API?
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.320]   It is the Google+'s API is pretty limited
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:25.400]   It's really only but you know we get posts and we get comments so we can we can tell a lot about the conversations
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.800]   You're having and the connections that you have based on on that on just on your posts and comments
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:33.560]   So you don't care about right access. You're only reading anyway. We're only reading
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.560]   Yeah, think of doesn't post on your behalf in any way
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:40.120]   We don't ask for right privileges. All we all all it does is observe for now
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.480]   It's the NSA
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.600]   It's very much you know, it's very much not a Twitter client
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:51.240]   We we made a very we're not I think that's smart. Yeah, yeah
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:54.840]   Twitter's pretty much sent a signal. They don't want you to do that. Yeah, exactly
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:59.160]   All right, let's take a break when we come back. I do want to talk about that nest acquisition
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.160]   There's lots more to talk about too
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:06.360]   Uh, we could go on for hours, but I promise we won't because uh, we got to let Gina go in about half an hour
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.960]   So she can go send out that email to all of you who supported
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.960]   Think up
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.680]   in the crowdsourcing campaign crowd funding campaign
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:20.360]   Gina at chirpani here from think up dot com a matthew engra from giga home from buzz machine dot com
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:29.800]   Jeff jarfis. This is this week in google our show today brought to you by uh our friends at uh squarespace.com the place to make your website
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.840]   Never goes down. Gina
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:37.480]   Never goes down just think about you actually have appreciation of how hard that is to do
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:42.680]   Oh, yes, imagine if you weren't just hosting think up, but you were hosting hundreds of thousands of websites
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:48.520]   Uh, any one of which could go viral at any time. That's a truly amazing thing
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:52.680]   And uh, I think you have to really credit the squarespace folks for making that
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:58.680]   A fundamental kind of tenet of what they're doing. We want to be reliable
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:04.760]   Unendable web hosting and then on top of that the best content management system. You can get anywhere
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:10.280]   Uh, you'll start with 20 beautiful designer templates that maybe you say why it's not enough
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:15.320]   But believe me it's it's plenty because every one of them can be highly customized
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.560]   That all you have to do is pick a template
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:22.200]   I'm looking at forte here and then look at the different ways people have used it
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:26.600]   One thing you'll notice about squarespace sites that tend to be very visual a lot of photographers artists
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.160]   designers use squarespace because
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:33.320]   You know, you it's a really good example. You may be a great photographer
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.120]   But web design is a different discipline
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:41.960]   Wouldn't it be nice if you had a place where you could put your website where you could use your innate aesthetic abilities
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:48.120]   But you didn't have to know css or javascript that's squarespace drag and drop point and click you could take that template
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.680]   Make it your own make it reflect your sense your style who you are
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:57.960]   If you are a programmer, they got a great developer platform including as you know color coded syntax
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:02.440]   Uh editor and uh and for javascript and css and all that stuff
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:07.000]   It's really the sky is the limit with squarespace you can add social media via plugins
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.760]   You can import into your squarespace blog from almost all the existing blogs. That's a nice feature
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:16.600]   Uh and export to so you're never trapped of course at squarespace
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:20.280]   What i'd like you to do is visit squarespace.com click the get started button

[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:31.160]   Import your data. You you can try each of the 20 templates if you want because of course as with any good site design
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.960]   Content and design are completely separate
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:39.880]   Um, it's kind of like css zengard and you can press a button and all of a sudden everything looks different but the content remains
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.200]   You also uh with squarespace have

[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:31.640]   Uh google spends 3.2 billion dollars
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.680]   5.8 percent of its total cash position
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:37.480]   for tony fidel's nest
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:42.840]   a company that makes two things a very pretty very expensive thermostat
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:47.480]   And a very pretty very expensive smoke detector carbon monoxide detector
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.080]   Why
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:54.360]   Because the connected home is the future
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:58.280]   Signals signals signals
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:07.720]   Google is in the signal business and this is a signal to serve you better. Oh gosh. Beo. You're a word 3.2 billion dollars
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.920]   Well, is it a high price? It's a nice fun one
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:14.040]   Uh, that's a lot of money dude. Oh wow
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:17.960]   I understand why i understand why tony and matt did it because dude dude, dude

[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.840]   You're too old you're over dude a dude
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.400]   non-california
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.800]   No, in fact
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.040]   It's gonna be us
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:36.440]   Baby boomers who are gonna continue to say man dude far out well into our 90s
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.320]   Far out
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:43.960]   I'm growing a ponytail
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:47.560]   Get over it dude
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:51.160]   Um, okay my friend. Sorry
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.880]   3.2 billion is not a lot to google
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.920]   But it is i beg your differ, but it's a lot for nest
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:01.080]   It's uh, it's a lot for google even if you're talking 5.8 percent of their cash position
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.600]   Yeah, that's a lot of money
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.520]   Okay, but they'll have that much like by the end of the week, right? Don't they? Yeah, I don't
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.800]   I mean
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:15.000]   I think produce like 40 billion dollars in cash like I don't know I just
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.960]   When you talk about it in percentage, it's non-trivial
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:21.000]   Yeah, I know you're absolutely right. I've got a lot of money
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.120]   There's two developments and there's patents and there's talent
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:29.080]   I think part of it is the design they picked up a whole team
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.440]   Of of really leading apple designers, right?
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.520]   I mean, yeah, this is nothing that they have. I mean, they do google does some hardware, but uh
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.800]   Uh, they're not that good at it. They're not that good at it. Let's be
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.040]   Let's just let's be honest, right?
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:48.040]   Google promised android at home to google ios ago and they never shipped nest shipped android at home
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.800]   So google wanted them period like that's they couldn't do it and nest did
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:57.400]   Uh, so you know so or you know that that was the android at home was the first thing I thought of when when I heard about this
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.920]   News the other thing I thought of was my friend uh, my good friend paul Ford
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:05.560]   Wrote a piece on his website in 2002. I don't know if you guys have seen this piece
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:10.440]   It's called robot exclusion protocol. You should google it. It's really funny. It's really good. It was 2002
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:15.640]   So it was you know a long time ago 12 years ago and it's about how google
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:19.800]   It's it's just kind of a short story about how google sent these little bots
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:22.040]   I imagined it to be kind of rumba-ish
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.640]   Into his apartment
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:29.800]   To index all his space and he has this conversation with this little google bot about it's you know indexing his space and so
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:35.960]   Hi, i'm from google. I'm a google bot. I will not kill you. I know what you are. I'm indexing your apartment
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:41.000]   I don't want you here who let you in. I am google. I find many good things
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.120]   I find that pair of underwear with little dice printed all over them
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.480]   And I watch the tape of you with the life-size stallman puppet
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:53.320]   These are good unique things many keywords many links my master will say much good job little robot
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:57.720]   Wow, I put the robot exclusion protocol on my door. That's my favorite
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.800]   Didn't you see it? I put robot.txt on my door, please
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:05.800]   You understand google person I index many things and if I am very good
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:09.720]   I get to go to bot park and have more processes and an oil job
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:13.480]   Thank you google must come inside apartment and index must
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:16.200]   I know my rights. I'm giving you 10 seconds to leave
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:21.160]   Yes, I will leave first I index everything everything. I am google
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:24.840]   I like it and that was 2002
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.480]   With a folding chair
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:33.960]   We also have that German thing we showed once where where google street view had google home view and they went into your home and took pictures
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.280]   Remember that yeah, um, yeah
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.520]   I don't really first of all I had a nest
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:45.000]   I installed the nest I got rid of the nest I have two nests and when we moved I didn't install it
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.800]   Because it kept turning on the heat at in-opportun moments
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:54.360]   Really? It's well, it's supposed to know it learns, right? What the what the hell does it learn?
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.680]   Well on Fridays at 3 p.m. Leo turned up the heat
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.960]   I'm not apparently consistent enough for it to deduce anything
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:09.240]   So it was randomly turning on the heat and I'd come upstairs to be 80 degrees and I turned off the heat say bad google bot
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:15.640]   Bad nest it didn't it didn't you know what this was a solution to a problem that frankly didn't exist
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:23.880]   I don't know. I think that those I mean, I maybe not the nest. I haven't used one. Oh, though. I do know trust me
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:28.680]   You know that no they don't they think it's a love it
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:31.160]   It's an in first of all requires a Wi-Fi connection
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:34.760]   And does not work without Wi-Fi period
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:40.600]   It checks the weather outside and says in doing some kind it's not the promise. It's not smart enough
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:45.080]   And maybe that is the problem. Maybe it needs more controllability
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.960]   I I personally think
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:53.880]   That it doesn't do as well as my thermostat that is stupid that I say at 6 a.m
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:59.160]   Turn on at 8 a.m. Turn off at 5 p.m. Turn on at 9 p.m. Turn off
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:01.800]   That's what it should do
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:06.600]   Right. Although I think the potential of the nest is that if it if you do have regular habits
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:10.680]   And it learns it can actually help you save money. Yes
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:15.160]   By reducing your your heating record and I got an email every month from that
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:19.720]   I personally think nest is a really classic example of
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:22.200]   A brilliant marketing
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.240]   That people go oh, this has got to be good. It's Wi-Fi enabled
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.480]   It's got a color led
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:31.240]   Expicture on the front and it's smart
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:35.000]   And I get an email every month telling me how much money I've saved
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.760]   And and none of this really is meaningful. It's just magical
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.560]   So maybe it's just not smart enough like you said
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:47.400]   Yeah, the money I mean the money saving thing is the so
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:51.560]   This is interesting. I mean you live in California Leo. I don't know how regular your hours are
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.440]   They seem to be pretty regular. I mean is it possible that it's
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:57.800]   I don't know. I mean I haven't tried it either. Here's the problem
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.360]   It can't be smart enough unless
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.720]   So, okay, maybe I'm really if you're really rigid then the nest could learn ever
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.800]   He comes home every night at five o'clock
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.360]   But what if you don't the nest there's nothing for the nest to learn
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:15.000]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. All right. All right. So you tie the nest to your android device
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:21.320]   And that really knows what it doesn't do away home. Yes. Yes, but it could be better. It will it could be better
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:25.720]   Yeah, I mean my friend me heaven has a thermostat he can control remotely
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:29.960]   He was telling me a story about how he accidentally was showing off the app to someone
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:33.000]   And he was thousands of miles away and he turned the heat up
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.480]   To you know 150 or something and his wife phoned him and said why did you why did you turn the heat up or roast me here?
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:41.480]   Right and he had forgotten to turn it down
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:46.440]   That's actually one the only thing I found very useful in this is I could turn my thermostat up and down when i'm not there
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:52.920]   That is useful, especially if you know if you have pets or something or so maybe maybe version two
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:56.680]   Well, actually we've already had I had version two any version three
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:00.680]   We'll get smarter. It's also refreshing to hear critique
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:05.720]   From someone who used it not liked it because I feel like i've just heard everybody's talk about how great it is
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:08.920]   I've heard people and whatever the whole thing so that's i'm glad i mean
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:12.680]   It's good to hear like this that doesn't work for everybody. Yeah, I heard it
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:16.360]   I got what I have installed I got it for my life for christmas kind of because
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:23.480]   Something but but uh but yeah read read the uh read the article in the economist called the folly of solutionism
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:27.000]   Oh, no, no, no, no
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   Yeah, if guinea mora
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.560]   It's just phoning us safe for god
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:38.440]   Come on, but he's not wrong that the notion that somehow technology is going to magically
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.080]   solve our problems because it's Wi-Fi enabled is is is
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:45.480]   Is not wrong. I mean there is
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:51.640]   You said it was a lot of red freaking hair. All right. All right. All right. All right. Oh, I said it solved everything
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.960]   Well a lot of people they're buying no, no, no
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:58.760]   It's very germane people are spending 250 dollars for this thermostat
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:03.480]   And because they spent 250 dollars and they get a full color chart every month in the email
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:06.440]   They've decided this is solving a problem that it isn't
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:10.840]   Well, if you have a family with if you do has geniuses have a regular schedule
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:13.160]   There are things that you can do that will make it
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:17.640]   Will move along and and maybe be worth it for you or maybe not be worth it for you
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:23.080]   I'm not sure either. It's worth playing. I don't get the the one that I don't understand is a smoke alarm
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:28.440]   Don't call me call the freaking fire department. Well, I do like to smoke. Okay. Here's where the smoke alarm might be and I don't own it
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:32.120]   So I mean this might be all supposition. It does say where it is
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:38.840]   So there's a fire in the living room or more more to the point my the battery is dead in the living room
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:42.040]   Because that battle that alone is worth it
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:46.280]   That is worth money by the way. They're being sued by both honeywell and first alert
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:51.000]   Who also make three billion dollars. Yeah, I also make talking smoke alarms
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:56.600]   I wasn't gonna say that I heard the next version your google plus contacts will be able to turn
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:05.000]   What I don't I did see a lot of coverage worried about the privacy implications of the nest acquisition
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:10.120]   I don't really see that well, but maybe but just think a little bit further think about you've got a thermostat
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:15.000]   You've got your smoke alarm. You've got who knows window blinds that go up and down
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:20.360]   You've got your toast or your your home phone all of that stuff is connected to things your fridge your stove
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.920]   Um, there are privacy issues there
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:27.880]   Depending on where that information goes and there were a lot of people concerned about nest
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:30.440]   Was it gonna share the information with google right?
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:36.760]   Gonna google gonna add that to this sort of you know corpus of information that that it has about you and all your browsing habits
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:39.160]   At this time nest
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:43.000]   Sittoni said and the nest blog said we're gonna continue to honor our privacy agreement
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.320]   Which is that we will only use information from your nest to make nest a better product
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.160]   We're not gonna share it with third parties or good
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:55.000]   But at some point you're gonna put a voluntarily choose to share it because you're gonna get value out of it because when you connect it with your
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.640]   Travel plans or something like that. So so you know
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:02.600]   If it knows you're going you're leaving town and it asks you do you want me to turn the heat down for the week?
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.000]   Right, you know that kind of stuff
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.160]   Uh could make it more valuable and I think people will choose to connect them
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:13.000]   And I do know i've gone away on trips and forgotten to turn the heat down
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.040]   I'm sure other people have and this is nice because if even if you do you go online and turn it down later. Yeah
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:20.200]   So
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.720]   I'm saying that they're not gonna share data with google
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:30.520]   But they're being acquired by google and google like expressly change their privacy policy to say that products could share data between them
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:31.640]   Can nest
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:33.800]   Did mojorro i mean that's interesting
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.880]   That doesn't
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:37.400]   They said it's interesting
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:43.000]   Google says they're gonna run it like uh, you know, like mojorro as a separate unit like mojorro. Yeah
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:48.520]   Um, I I you know what I here's okay. I'll say what I actually think now
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:56.360]   Which is that you're absolutely right that the connected home that google had that promise of the connected home never delivered
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:59.160]   Uh, if you're looking every company
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:04.040]   Any big company and even small in this space is trying to figure out what's the next big thing?
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:08.120]   What is the what is one area that really has not been well addressed is connected home
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:11.160]   Everybody's talking about the internet of things wearables
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:12.760]   uh the
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.480]   Removing of cpu power to the periphery
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:22.840]   Better way to get into this than a company that is two successful products and a lot of smart people
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:26.040]   Including programmers
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:31.720]   Um, I think this is this is google's announcement that the connected home is the next big thing
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:35.960]   And think about even just having those designers whether they're worth three billion or not
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:40.680]   I don't know but it's one thing they come up with ideas like that and you could there's probably
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:46.840]   People already coming up with humorous versions of what google's version of that thermostat would look like but
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:52.680]   People who can design those things in a way that makes them appealing makes them simple
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:55.560]   Easy to use that is not
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:59.960]   You know that is a hard problem in many cases and so to be able to have that
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:06.520]   Right something google hasn't typically been that good at we have a diversity of standards. Uh, you know, it's a tower of bable
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:14.200]   Um, nobody's figured this out. Uh, you know, we've all seen the video of the guy using his android phone to unlock the door and set everything
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:18.440]   That was somebody who spent hours and hours cobbling this together
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.360]   What if google could just offer this as this is a full solution? That'd be fabulous
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:30.840]   So I think it's actually I mean, I don't know if it's worth 3.2 billion, but I understand what I think you've got a point there
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:35.400]   Absolutely. I understand why google acquired. I mean I think it's a very clear signal from google
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:39.880]   It's a shot across the bow. We're gonna do this connected home is big
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:46.600]   And microsoft has been talking about connected home for a while doesn't I've actually I did a tour through microsoft's like home of the feature
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:51.400]   Which is one of the kind of thing that they have set up. You know and redman and it was amazing
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:56.200]   Uh, that was years ago and i've never seen i haven't seen anything actually come out of it. Yeah
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:01.240]   No, everybody knows it's the thing apple does too. Everybody knows it's the next big thing
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.520]   But it's all about shipping right not very few people have shipped in that
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.720]   Somebody's ship
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:12.600]   Those are the guys ships listen it may not be the next big thing right the paperless office was the next big thing and it still is
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:17.800]   Um, you know, maybe we get drubs and drabs and it stops. I have now finally for the first time
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:23.400]   We make we used to make the joke the paper. Yeah the paperless office. That'll be here as soon as you get the paperless
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.920]   Bathroom that's right. Yeah, I have now a paperless bathroom
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:30.040]   Do I want to know this
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:33.080]   I have really want to know this the japanese toilet
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.800]   Get out of here it works
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:41.960]   So maybe it is time for the paperless office visuals. Oh, I know I shouldn't bring it up. Okay, can we
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:48.520]   Changing the subject changing the subject somebody in the chat room said I next thing google buys if this than that
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:52.520]   Yeah, we can see that
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.280]   Totally right and then
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.320]   connecting things
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.320]   hue lights
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.000]   and then
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.760]   Hue lights I don't get it all. Oh, I love the hue lights better than my nest
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:06.600]   Hughes are pretty cool. Okay. So here's an application Jeff
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:11.000]   There's an application on the ipad and iphone called exoplanet that
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.680]   Notifies you whenever another planet outside our solar system is discovered
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:19.400]   You set it up it has a little button that the hue light then changes to the color
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:24.360]   That it looks like on the surface of that planet depending on the sun that the planet's in the solar system. Oh man
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.400]   That that's off the
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.400]   Nerd
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:33.640]   Sorry Matthew. Yeah, no, that's
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:36.920]   That's the geekiest thing i've ever heard
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:41.480]   Off their nerd
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.040]   Herdometer needle is like spiking in the red
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:48.440]   Hue hue lights are very nerdometer very very big on the
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.320]   Nometer i don't think i've heard of these these are just smart lights
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.800]   Phillips Phillips makes them they're not that expensive huge amount of money out of you
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:58.840]   That one's big smart about them is that they rip you off for how much money?
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.080]   60 bucks in a bulb
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:06.520]   Well, what no way they're led lights now admittedly leds have gone down you can get them it for 10 bucks now
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:11.880]   But and i'm sure these will go down at the same time. Phillips is is rapidly reducing the price of leds
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:16.200]   But leds are expensive, but they're 10,000 on our bulbs. These are RGB leds
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.080]   Which means they can make any color at all
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.960]   From this light so much so that you could take a picture with your smartphone
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:30.040]   Put it in the hue app. Click a part of that picture and say light bulb you go to that color
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:33.400]   It can literally wait a second. What is it?
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.240]   All right, maybe you'll see me for one thing can it stop me from looking pink? Yes
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.920]   I guarantee you
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.440]   For instance, for instance, I have a picture of a moonlit night
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.240]   I I put it in my hue thing and I said, okay bulbs
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:49.800]   I want to be a moonlit night and you feel like you're literally
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.960]   in the moonlit night
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:56.760]   Um, you can also use if this and that with it you can set alarms you can say for instance
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.840]   I want to slowly wake up. I want the bulbs to ramp up starting at 6 a.m
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:04.440]   To give me a sunset or a sunrise in my bedroom
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:11.800]   Uh, you can have daylight you can have nightlight now admittedly there's no this isn't that practical
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:15.400]   And there are some strong negatives for instance as I discovered
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.560]   If the power goes out and then comes back on the hue lights turn on full bright
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.760]   And so in the middle of the night, I'm lying in bed and suddenly
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:28.120]   Good morning
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.520]   Because I have a lot of them
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:33.560]   And i'm
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.680]   Nine
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.280]   and then um
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:41.160]   Uh, I reached for my phone because I know what's happened all the god damn it the hue lights came on
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:45.400]   And i'm and i'm starting to open the app at least it just reaches over flips the switch
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.400]   Which was actually the right thing to do
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.600]   I feel like you live in the kingdom of modern marvels
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.640]   Between your toilet and the light
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:58.040]   Okay, so okay the toilet now don't listen cover your ears. Yes
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:02.680]   You gotta do it cover your ears. So you you get up you go in the bathroom
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.080]   The toilet the toilet goes
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.080]   to welcome you
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.800]   Does it play a song or no? This one does not there's the creepy line
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:15.000]   We have found the creepy line
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.160]   And then and then it's the seed is warm. It's heated warm very nice never sit on a quote called toilet seat again
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.960]   And there also the water is heated
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:30.440]   Stop there what I said on the warm toilet seat is because somebody I know I know this is clean was on this is a clean warm
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:33.320]   A clean warm
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:41.000]   59 years of a visceral response to sit down the fan goes on because it has a carbon filtered
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.440]   exhaust fan in the bowl so that
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.720]   Everything is exhausted out and then
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.320]   When you're done
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:56.440]   There's front and back washers they oscillator pulse or any combination thereof. It's warm. You set the temperature
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:02.680]   It's a wiper blade of any kind. No, there's no it's a bidet. There's no touch no touch
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.160]   And then it has a nice little blow dryer
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:08.040]   So after you're done washing you press the blow dryer goes
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:14.760]   And it dries you off and then you stand up and then you walk out because the seat automatically the toilet automatically flushes
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:18.200]   The seat automatically goes down it sanitizes and it's ready for the next person
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:21.640]   All right, all right, we're gonna have a Howard Stern moment here
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:28.600]   No, uh, oh no, it's okay. It's okay. Does it does it deal with dingleberries? Yes
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:33.320]   All right, it's a very it's a very powerful the thruster
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.920]   Oh
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:41.320]   I don't want to go too far. So tight. All right. It's very pleasure. It's very pleasant
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.680]   So on the
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:51.080]   There's no brushes though, right? No, there's no physical
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.960]   So I realized what it is. I realized I suddenly understood this after doing this see you have to use the nest
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.960]   You have to use these things to get it right and to get the pros and the cons
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:04.040]   And one of the things and you I mean you can't just and this is why reviewers sometimes miss the boat
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.560]   They try it for a week. Okay. I get it and then go you gotta live with it
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:14.760]   So what I realized is the japanese don't care so much about butt cleanliness as they do about not touching anything
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:20.200]   So what this really is is a toilet where you could you could walk in like this and not touch anything
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:24.280]   Right, that's the point of it. Well, because we've gotten the point you know, you don't touch
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:28.760]   In public restrooms, you don't longer touch the water floss. You don't longer touch the paper
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.280]   Prowels, that's what this is but of course you use your hand on the damn door
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:37.320]   Right. So the idea and I think that they're probably right is it doesn't really matter how clean your butt is it matters
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.080]   How clean your hands are
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:44.280]   Is the blower like the ones in the airport where it's like 8000, you know, no, no, it's not a dyson
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:50.440]   You know what I want. I want a dyson in my shower. I just want to go
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:57.320]   To run me dry. Yeah, I hate get now and being cold while I dry off good idea actually they have those actually
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:01.560]   I don't think I can stand the side of the flapping flash though. Like I always freaks me out
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:05.000]   Yeah, I think it's gonna come off
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.800]   So
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:12.920]   Yes or no, this is an acceptable level of cleanliness for you when you're done. Yeah. Yes. It's acceptable
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.920]   You don't while you don't go god. I wish I
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:20.760]   And of course while we're while we're on separate technologies to from the hard stern show one is
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:26.280]   Poopory, would you I have poopery. It's oh really?
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:29.000]   Do not buy
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.400]   Okay, how about how about the school? This is sounding like I am so
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.280]   Anally fixated. I am not
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:41.160]   What about the squatty? Oh, no, you're just describing a normal. I am normal
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:46.840]   Japanese toilet. Yeah, it's squatty potty. Yeah, I've heard about that. No poopery doesn't work
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:52.920]   So the whole theory is that it creates a barrier in the surface of the way
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:56.040]   It's just fragrance very very very strong fragrance
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:01.320]   And I it does not have any magical properties. I've been quibber. So she carries it with her
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:04.120]   Yeah, because she smells like flowers everywhere she goes
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:10.600]   All right, so that's that one. I did the theory of it sealing out the the order
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.640]   That's me
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:17.800]   But it does it's a very strong deodorant because it smells like whatever flavor you got and it's very very strong
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:24.840]   So there's the squatty potty which Howard now swears by oh I so this is an image. I don't want
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.280]   I reviewed it on gizwiz
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:33.720]   I reviewed the squatty potty on gizwiz. Oh, is that the one that were your so it's not that your leg
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.080]   It's not a uh, it's not a hole in the ground that you squat over no
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.680]   Now raises your legs up so your angle is better, right?
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.680]   Stepstool for the can
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.840]   Which is supposed when you're sitting
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.560]   Which is ridiculous because
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:53.160]   All it's doing is bringing your knees to your chest to make your organs all fit together
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:56.920]   Yeah, all you have to do instead of spinning 30 bucks on a plastic
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:04.120]   Staying toilet seat. No lean forward. Oh if you put your chest towards your knees it works
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.920]   Just lean forward. Don't buy a squatty potty
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.640]   What have we done?
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.600]   I really got a
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:17.080]   I did say at the beginning of the show. It's that we talked about google and whatever the hell else we wanted to talk about
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:23.800]   That's a workover. We're talking about a cloud of of poop odor. Oh god
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:28.600]   This is smart homes. Smart homes got to smell good. Yeah, anyway nests. Thank you very much
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.920]   Um, maybe they'll do toilets. Yeah
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:37.480]   Is there any might well, yes
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.000]   Would you like a connected toilet? Here's a story the mojo g
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.480]   Play edition is now out 179 bucks unlocked
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:48.360]   Google edition nice
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:52.360]   Yeah, nice. That's what a place highly recommended
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:57.960]   Oh, they're so little I mean I just need really little difference between the play edition and the right
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.080]   The version is unlocked and contract free
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:02.040]   I
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:07.640]   Would prefer to get that one because the moto assist stuff this the few little things mo to roll at the camera and the moto assist
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:11.880]   Puts on there are good. I would get them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:15.320]   Motorola just announced a few new things that you can you can
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:20.040]   Um respond to yes, I dictated my first text this morning
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:24.440]   That may be go over the edge on wishing I had the moto that was so awesome deal
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:27.080]   So it says
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:32.120]   The the moto x so this moto assist knows you're driving and by the way they improved it now
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.040]   So it uses bluetooth as well as gps
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:38.760]   So it really does know you're in the car and it tells you you are and it when a phone call comes in
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:44.600]   It will handle it as you tell it to including saying sending a text that saying I can't drive it
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.600]   I can't talk to you, which is great
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:51.720]   Um, if a text comes in it will offer to read it to you. Hello in this nice female voice
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.840]   You have a text from lisa would you like me to read it for you?
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:57.320]   And I said yes, and then it read the text
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:02.280]   Which was rather humorous in a robot voice and then it says would you like to respond?
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.720]   And I said yes
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.440]   And then went and I and I dictated as a response
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:09.160]   It said okay reads the response back
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:14.120]   Would you like me to send this I said yes and it worked it was great got it right got it right?
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:19.800]   Anything wrong? Well, I've gotten good with dictating to uh google now, you know, I mean I I know pretty much know how to do it
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:21.960]   So it's good
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.960]   Yeah, that's a handy feature
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:28.360]   I I think the motto, you know, I you know me I change phones every five minutes
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:31.960]   This is I've stayed with this one a few months. It's really good. I love the motto
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:35.160]   Well, and it seems like the x is really becoming sort of google's
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:42.200]   Maybe jina has thoughts about this, but it's becoming google's kind of test platform for new stuff things that can be sort of
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:46.520]   You know baked into the thing and and take advantage of all that
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:49.160]   Kind of google now stuff and the phone and whatnot
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:52.680]   So it's like the leading edge of what you'll see later in other products
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.080]   I don't know. Do you think it's crossing over?
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:13:01.080]   Like becoming the new nexus basically. Oh, I don't know. I don't I think we can be very careful to firewall mode or roll off. I don't know
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.560]   Yeah
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.560]   Yeah, so how so how is that different? How's that voice? How's it different than voice actions?
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:10.600]   Doesn't android have built in like a way to respond?
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.800]   It sounds like it sounds a little better than voice actions
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:19.160]   Yes, the answering that being smart about the fact that you're driving and answering and asking yeah
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.400]   Yeah, it seems like it just took it took it an extra
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:24.600]   It doesn't do it if I'm just sitting here. It only does it when I'm driving for instance, right?
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.560]   That's really smart. Yeah, that is really smart when I'm in a meeting
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:32.120]   We've tried to we talked about this before when I'm in a meeting it says it'll send out a text unless it's a favorite
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.960]   There's a lot of I think that these are a little Motorola things. Maybe they are
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:39.800]   Trials kind of yeah, maybe they're trialing things. They're using Motorola's a test bed
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:42.360]   That's actually not a bad at the google experience launcher was
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.840]   Was that modo x?
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.800]   Only it was right think so. Oh
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.560]   Yeah, so two so we got a trend
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:56.360]   Two makes a trend because they have been taking great pains at first
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.880]   To not scare off the oem's like samson htc
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:04.840]   LG right by saying no, they're not getting any special treatment look they didn't get kick cat
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:08.760]   Maybe that's not so much
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:13.720]   Moto had the hat with the I love the hat too, right? Yeah
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.680]   I love that
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.040]   I'm telling you jeff you blew it
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:28.440]   I'm like on my phone. I would have felt I would have felt a little bad paying 600 dollars for where I can get it for 340
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:31.320]   Well, that's true. I think that that was a little bit of a rip off
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.880]   Even you know even at the time we thought this shouldn't be this expensive. Yeah
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:40.200]   Uh, so how do you how's your nexus seven working on Verizon now?
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:50.360]   You know, I should have been keeping going more letters in the new year to the FCC. I just got so tired of it
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:54.200]   Uh, so it's it's working on t-mobile. Thank you very much
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:59.960]   And I had a slight problem and tweeted and somebody said well you should go to the president indeed the ceo of t-mobile
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:06.120]   Responding to me and I solved my slight problem like that. So t-mobile hats off
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:10.760]   The rumor there's a rumor that
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:14.360]   From what's his name? What's their name? Um that that
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:17.400]   Verizon is finally going to add the nexus seven
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:25.000]   Without branding to its sales lineup, but that's just a rumor don't know anything yet. We don't traffic in rumors here at twig
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.160]   No, sorry, let me call them the Jarvis option
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:33.480]   So um yeah
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:38.600]   Yeah, I don't have it on I still have it on t-mobile and it's working fine and i'm thinking now
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:43.880]   I'm going to use my nexus seven as my hot spot and get rid of my fries and
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:49.240]   Um my fine. Does it make sense is t-mobile as good as verizon where you are
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:55.400]   Uh, no where I live. Verizon's a little bit better, but you know unless we have sand the super storm standy
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.480]   I should be out sandy sandy. We should be okay
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:02.120]   Uh, it's in new york verizon is awful t-mobiles better
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.680]   T-mobile is great. I got it here. Yeah
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.800]   Yeah, it's it's great for me in Manhattan and Brooklyn
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:13.400]   And here's the here's the real question. So I thought I went out and I bought I don't think I can return them now
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:14.600]   I bought you know
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.520]   $60 worth of refill cards and the sim for my old phone
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:25.800]   So when I go to europe I can take advantage of that wonderful new no-roaming charge thing. Well first mistake wrong size sim idiot
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:30.680]   Second mistake while the nice lady who called me from t-mobile. I said by the way while I got you
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:36.360]   How does this thing work with the foreign the the no-roaming charges only works if you have a post build
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.000]   regular account
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:43.960]   And so a prepay doesn't work for that. So I did all this stuff for prepay
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.960]   And the reason to do that was because anyway, it's my fault. I should have looked into it
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.640]   um
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:54.040]   But yeah, I'm keep on questioning. Do I go ahead and make the shift and the only real difference is that
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:17:02.360]   To use we only have one landline now and home, which is for old farts. We still have one and uh, yeah, we still got one
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.680]   Uh, it's like a core thing everything
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:07.080]   Yeah
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:15.480]   Whoa, well, you know, oh now that we have a whole house generator installed. We may not be very fancy
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:20.680]   That's why we have it because we're emergency. Yes. Same reason. Yep. How are we now? No phone
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:23.480]   You know, well no phone for after after
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:29.320]   90 minutes or something the bat that we have our firehouse has a battery to keep the phone alive for a while but that's that
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.040]   um, so anyway
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:35.640]   Um trying to use t-mobile out and i'm in the boonies
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:40.040]   I you know, i'm wearing the boonies so until they get up here. I may not but at some point just for the case of
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.680]   Of ethics. I should switch to t-mobile
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:47.320]   Uh, I like t-mobile I have to say but uh
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:51.080]   It really is specific to your region obviously
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:55.240]   Yeah, all right. We're gonna lose jina. So let us get from jina tripani
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:58.040]   Uh oh a tip
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.440]   She doesn't have one because she knew she'd be off by that
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:04.360]   I don't know how to sign up for think up because i'm busy
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.920]   That's my tip. That's my tip. I'm a for think up
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:13.160]   I uh, i'm gonna go launch this uh this app. Thank you for letting me talk to you guys about it and show it to you
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:16.120]   Early and i'm sorry i gotta take off early, but i'll be back next week
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:22.360]   We love you jina and even if it's just for five minutes, it's worth it. So thank you and congratulations
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:26.200]   Nice
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.680]   Right start up pretty baby
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.560]   Take care. Bye. Bye
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.120]   How about you jeff you got a number
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:40.600]   Yeah, I do I do I do let me come up here right here. So, uh, let's do this one. Um, there was a story of business insider
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:47.560]   Five days ago that a google dev a start-up tried to hire a google developer and the developer allegedly blew off a
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:52.200]   $500,000 salary because he's already making three million dollars at google
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:59.400]   So there's that and then and then it world came along and and asked man or myth
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:02.840]   uh based on this 500 thousand
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:07.720]   3 million number and then and went to um class door
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:11.320]   And looked up the numbers for compensation self-reported compensation
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:15.720]   So just self-reported you figure in the guy who makes three million dollars and go in a class door and put it in there
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:21.560]   He's not pissed. He doesn't want anybody to know. Yeah, you guys are slow, but uh average total compensation
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:28.760]   From google software engineers is 144,000 dollars ranging from 78k to 550k
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:37.000]   Uh plus cash bonus that's total compensation average stock bonus ranges from 125 to 200k
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.720]   That's that's more what I'd expect frankly. Yes senior software engineers average 210
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.120]   A range from 80 to 630
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:49.960]   Uh, all right 630 k all right
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:55.560]   So that's still a lot. So you know is it could could there be a couple three million dollar people at at google?
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:20:01.480]   Yeah, it's I think it's possible. I think you get to the three million by being poached and by saying to your supervisor
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:04.840]   Facebook wants me. Okay. What was it gonna take to keep you?
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:09.960]   Yeah, and then they give you three million. They're gonna say you never kind of have that conversation again because nobody's giving you that
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:13.720]   Right, right and you have to be pretty darn good, right?
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:17.000]   But we've heard we've heard of that happening
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.520]   Yeah, uh, that's that's not unusual. Yeah
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.560]   Three million
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:27.240]   No, but we've heard no, I'm not saying the numbers not unusual. I'm saying we've heard of people
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:30.040]   Oh, uh being protected at google
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:34.600]   That google coming to them and saying what is it gonna take to keep you? We do not want to lose you
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:39.400]   Of course it could be three million in stock options too, right? It doesn't have is it cash
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:45.880]   Uh, you got all sorts of use which are the restricted stock units which you know is as good as cash
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:50.600]   Right in a sense. So yeah, I think it's I think it's possible. I don't think there's many of them
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.320]   uh
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:56.760]   Matthew you got a tip or tool that you'd like to share with us
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:03.000]   I didn't have one prepared no need think up is great though
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.880]   I'm with jina
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:09.320]   So, uh, this was actually in the news this uh, and that's how I found out about it
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:15.160]   There's a really cool website code combat calm that is designed to teach
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:20.520]   Mostly, I would say high school kids, but anybody who you know is interested in learning how to program
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:21.960]   JavaScript
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:27.080]   Uh, it's they say the largest coffee script app out there and they've just went open source
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:31.320]   And uh, I immediately signed up and I told my son who wants to learn how to program about it
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:35.480]   It's very cool. You're playing a game in this case. We're attacking ogres
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:41.480]   Using javascript as the programming language, but they also have an arena where you can compete against other people
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:47.320]   Um, this is free is very cool. They just open sourced it which makes it even more cool cool cool
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:53.800]   Um, I highly recommended a great little tutorial a lot of fun. It's called code combat
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:58.760]   Dot calm there are a lot of things out there now to teach kids to code
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:05.080]   And I you know remember the hour of code just a couple of weeks ago and so forth and code academy is great
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.640]   But this is really fun. This is you know, it's the kind of thing
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:14.440]   You know, you start off. I'm giving commands. I don't know how well you can read the text here move up move down move left right
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:17.000]   attack nearby enemy
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.800]   Um, and now i've got to get him out of the dead end
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.960]   Okay
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:25.080]   So let's let's continue on here rescue mission complete
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:32.360]   You've learned how to control your troops cast simple spells moving attacking using the play button. Let's continue with your training
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:39.480]   Are you getting audio out of this because there's there's fun little audio and so forth. Yeah, you have spells my blade
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.920]   So if you know somebody who's you know probably like
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:59.400]   11 or 12 through 16 or 17. This is pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah code combat dot calm
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:05.160]   Well, what a good time we've had today talking about all sorts of subjects
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:09.880]   The party show
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.080]   The connected toilet next that's something I don't know if I want google no much about
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.880]   News keep that to myself
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:21.800]   And of course this is true. The horse you should be you should be increasing the fiber
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.360]   Yeah
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:29.640]   Well, you know to for echo always brings this up. He says I said nobody who nobody wants to know anything like that
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.960]   And he says the insurance companies do
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:39.400]   He always brings that up like the insurance companies are going to deny people insurance based on knowing all that's the only example you can give
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:45.320]   I don't care. Let them let them raise my insurance. You need more fiber leo
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.960]   They already ask you do you smoke?
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:51.560]   You know they come and check your blood pressure and stuff like that
