[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300]   It's time for Twig. This week at Google, Jeff Jarvis is here. Mike Elgin joins us.
[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:10.000]   We're gonna finally lay to rest the Apple versus DOJ story. I think we've got all the details now.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.500]   We'll talk about the launch of Google App and yes.
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.000]   Is it a good idea or a bad idea to beat up robots?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.500]   We'll find out next on Twig.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000]   Netcast, you love.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   This is Twig.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Hi everybody, it's time for our annual audience survey. We'd really like to hear from you.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   It helps us understand our audience better, know what you like and don't like how you listen to the show.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   It also helps us tell advertisers what kind of people listen.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   But I promise you, your feedback is always kept personally anonymous.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   All you have to do is visit twit.tv/survey and let us know what you think.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   It'll just take a few minutes and it'll help us make Twig even better.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   We really appreciate your support and any help you can give us twit.tv/survey.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   This is Twig. This week in Google, episode 341 recorded Wednesday, February 24th, 2016.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   I'm really feeling lucky.

[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It's time for Twig! This week in Google, the show where we talk about the latest news from...
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Well, you know what? Whatever we don't want to talk about.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Because Jeff Jarvis is such a brainiac that wherever his wide ranging intellect decides to light, that's where we're going to be.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York, he also was an op-up, well said published author.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   That would be like a backhanded compliment. Not only has he been an author, but he's actually been published.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   He's published author. His works hang in many museums. Also here, Mike Algin, great to see you once again.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Thank you very much. Thank you so much.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   In the saddle again. That's right.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Although your chair is much less saddle like that.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   It's not saddle like that, but that's okay. I think that the Dr. Evil chair is...
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   It's bad luck for anybody else to sit in it. It's just my opinion.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I think you're right. I don't think our team does not let anybody else sit in it.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I think when I see somebody sitting in my chair, I almost like...
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I've seen Padre sit in it. He can sit.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Now that he's out of town, I'm going to say that.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   He is out of town, but he's doing a great job in Barcelona covering mobile world congress. You were there last year.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   That is becoming each year more and more like CES. That is this year. Everything was going on there.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It's like CES, but it's in Europe and so people wear nice clothes.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And they come on.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   They come on and they hit it.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Late.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   So much we've seen from Mobile World Congress and we'll talk about a lot of that.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I guess what we should do is a little bit... I don't want to go deep into the Department of Justice versus Apple.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Probably we will be talking about it yet again because in two days, Apple's responses have come out.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   So I guess we'll be doing more of this.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I think, Jeff, since we talked last week, and I think a very valuable debate you, me and Matt Ingram.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Matthew and Steve.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And Steve Gibson, who came in.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Very important.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   But what's interesting is how this story has developed.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   As the facts became better known, it's changed.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   First of all, we haven't talked with you, Mike. It's fresh for you.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   But I'm also curious if people's opinions might have changed based on what we've learned.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   So here's the problem. And it's also the thing about this whole story that's so interesting, which is that it's ultimately a political battle.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Apple is not on one side of that battle necessarily.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Apple is the battlefield. It's one of the battlefields.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   The battle is between people like the FBI who want the advantages of being able to get information on phones.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   As Steve Gibson said today, the details are one thing.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   The overall intent is what's really important.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   There are a bazillion ways to get data off a phone.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   So the people on one side like the FBI and the people on the other side like the NSA, which understands that strong encryption is in the national interest.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And there are people in the community among the citizenry who understand encryption and are on the side of the NSA, ironically.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And then there are people who don't really understand encryption who just think, "Well, let's go get the terrorists."
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   That's about by the way, more than half of the population in the United States.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   This is the scary thing about it. And the grandstanders will drive it home.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   The Donald Trump's... Well, not just Donald Trump, but John McCain. Lots of people in government are going to be...
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I feel like though, but wait, I feel like also the tech industry is a little knee jerk on this as well.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   You know, defend encryption at all costs. I also want to point out it's not really about encryption.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I mean, encryption is done. That's not even debatable.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I mean, there is this notion we should put this golden key backdoor in encryption.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And they may try to do that, but it can't even be done successfully.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   It can only be done with US companies by US Congress, but there's so many other places you can get strong encryption
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   that debate's over. The math is out there.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And I thought Denise Howell had kind of encapsulated it very well yesterday on TNT.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   When she said, "Really, the public debate we should be having is whether you should have the right to privacy
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   about what's on your iPhone or not, or your smartphone." I shouldn't say iPhone, but your smartphone or not.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Whether these devices should be somehow specially protected.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And Steve Gibson mentioned that one of the things that's happened is technology has given us the ability
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   to make these things impermeable, to make them completely private.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   And so, of course, there's now this balance between law enforcement that would love to be able --
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   man, if you think about it, this is the best thing that ever happened to law enforcement, the smartphone,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   because it's a GPS, it's a microphone, it's a camera, it's got everything we do.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   The whole lives are on it. This is like a little treasure chest of evidence for law enforcement
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   that never existed before, by the way. Never existed one place where they could go and find out
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   everywhere I've been, everything I've done, every thought I've had, it's all in here.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So, naturally, they want the key to that treasure chest.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   So, really, the body politic and we, the people, should be debating not this particular incident
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   as much as the whole notion of, well, what kind of protection do we want to give this device?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And that's why I think that's the definition of privacy.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Yeah. And I think that's why the FBI chose this particular case because the perps are dead, the phone belongs --
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   It's a very clean case.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   To the county. Yeah, it's a --
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   The government owns the phone, the government's given permission to look at it.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   There's no right to privacy once you're dead.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   But I agree with you. I think that they pick this case to make Apple look like a douchebag if they resist it.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Because this is really bad politics for Apple, but I'll take the strongest case.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Sure. And this is Washington's game. This is not Silicon Valley's game.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   So, Apple's at a disadvantage here because they don't understand what's coming in terms of the public wrath at Apple.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   But I'll take Denise's point a step further.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   The issue is not about whether our phones are encrypted.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   The issue is whether our phones are encrypted by default, whether the average novice user who doesn't think about encryption
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   still gets encryption because, of course, ISIS and all these other people are afraid of --
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   They know what about.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   They will have strong encryption.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   And the geeks who are into encryption will have encryption.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   The question is whether -- to me, I think there are lots of things that we need to protect ourselves from.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Terrorism is one of them.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Industrial espionage is another.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   So, if there's any way for --
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Government spying is --
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Yeah, whatever the solution is for the FBI to get access to our phones,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   also invites in the Chinese state sponsor hackers and even ISIS.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   So, what will happen inevitably if there is this mythical backdoor, if it's crackable, if phones are crackable,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   the messaging is crackable, someone will crack it, they'll make it available on the open market, and ISIS will buy it.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   So, one of the -- if you want to be scared about ISIS and do fear-mongering around ISIS,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   we are at risk at having a situation where ISIS can hack everybody in the U.S.,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   and we can't hack them because they'll have strong security because they are motivated, right?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   So, how do you -- so, this is the fundamental question. Are the unmotivated people, the untechnical people --
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   The rest of us -- should we have privacy?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   -- or not. That's the only question.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   I agree with you. And dumb crooks.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Because one of you think is the main new thing that we've learned, Leo.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Here's the thing that really is huge, and actually what I'd like to do, and then we'll move on,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   is pose this question to you and everybody else in light of what I think we now know.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   So, let me -- and this comes from Steve Gibson yesterday.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And let me kind of just summarize this, which is that the Department of Justice is not asking Apple
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   to decrypt the phone, but there is a weakness in iPhones to encryption.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   It's strong encryption, but the weakness is the passcode.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   It does, in fact, decrypt the phone.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   So, what the Department of Justice is asking Apple to do is make it possible for them to brute force the phone
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   and get what's on it.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   There -- thereby unlocking the encryption gets what's on it.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   What Steve said --
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   So, it might as well not be encrypted in the first place.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Well, whatever. I mean, they're asking Apple to help them get the password.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Okay.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   The thing that is -- really, I think, if that's true, then the salient question is,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   will this tool that Apple generates be useful in more than this one instance?
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And the exam -- we -- the metaphor we use came from Bill Gates of all people.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   He said -- Bill Gates came down in favor of the Department of Justice,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   although he's since kind of recant it a little bit, so I'm not sure.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Yeah, he stepped back a bit.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   But what he said was very good.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   He said this to the Financial Times in an interview.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   He said, "It's as if a bank tied a ribbon around a vault and said,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   'We won't cut the ribbon.'
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And the FBI says, 'Well, you need to cut the ribbon so we get into the vault.'
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And they say, 'We won't cut the ribbon.'
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   The question is that -- with that metaphor involved, the question is,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   is Apple cutting this one ribbon or giving the FBI a ribbon cutter
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   that can be used to cut all ribbons?
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Are they giving the FBI a tool the FBI could then use to brute force other phones?
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   The answer is no, but that's what Steve Gibson has said very clearly,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   technologically, this is a one-off because of the way it works.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   This could not be used for other phones.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Right.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Now, does that change?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Explain that to me again.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   So, Apple would not be -- so one of the arguments people say is,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   'Well, once you give this to the FBI, then it leaks out from the FBI,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   and then everybody's got it, as you just said.'
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   No, that's not actually the case.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   What would happen here is Apple would give the FBI firmware
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   that would turn off these protections for this phone only.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   In fact, every update that Apple does is individual to each and every phone.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   To each phone, that's right.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   And so, technologically, they could do it easily without any risk of creating
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   any kind of backdoor.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Politically, that's a different question, whether that's a precedent,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   which now actually says that's not --
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   They're not being asked for a backdoor.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   They're not being asked for a tool.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Exactly.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   They're being asked for -- now, I understand why Apple's finding this
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   because it does open this precedent that there's --
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   The Varnie said, Cyrus Vance Jr., the Attorney General of New York,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   has said, 'Oh, I got 10 more phones.'
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   The Department of Justice has other phones.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Exactly.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Lots of people have phones.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   And once Apple says, 'Well, we'll do it for this phone,'
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   and now, Apple's going to argue, 'I think, we'll find out on Friday.'
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   That's an undue burden for them.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   They don't want the burden.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   It's not about privacy.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   It's just an undue burden.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   They're suddenly in this business of unlocking phones.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   They don't want to be in it.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   That's not -- it's a little bit more scary than that.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   The burden is for them -- they can do one of three things policy-wise
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   as a company.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   They can say yes to every request.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   They can say no to every request.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Or they can be in the position to decide whether the request is valid or not.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Well, I think what they say --
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   What they will do is say, 'We are going to do it unless there's a court order.'
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   The court will decide.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   That's in the U.S.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   But what about China?
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   What about Turkey?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   What about Pakistan?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Right.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   That's the issue.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   There's two issues here.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   One is that remains -- it's the precedent -- you're right.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   It's a precedent matter of precedent.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Where once this capability is known, then every bad guy in the world --
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   every bad government in the world will demand it for every phone.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   In fact, the Chinese government said, 'We haven't done it yet.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   We haven't asked Apple yet because the U.S. hadn't.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   We were waiting for you guys.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   What a great idea.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Thank you, Safiya.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   The second thing is -- I forget who said this, but in essence,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Apple's being forced to enslaved, to write something.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   It doesn't want to write.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   It's not just a case of saying, 'We'll --'
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Right.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Okay, now we'll tell you the secret.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Now we'll tell you the secret number.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   No, no, no.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And that's absolutely right.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   That's absolutely right.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   And that's the all-rich part of this.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   And the defense against that is very clear.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And the judge even said this in the order.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Apple can argue that it's a burden on them, which I think they will argue.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Because that's the only way out, by the way.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   They can't argue the Constitution.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   They can't argue encryption.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   They can only say, 'Well, this would be a lot to ask of us.'
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   And then once you start, we're going to be in the suddenly in the --
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   There was another argument.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   We don't want to be in that.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   For every local police department, every --
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   And what it does is an individual -- you know, it's like,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   'I don't want to serve on a jury where I'd have to do the death penalty.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   I won't do it, I refuse to.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   You can't make me do it.'
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   There's something you can't --
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Well, you might go to jail for contempt of a recorder.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   What if every coder said -- told Apple, 'No, I don't want to do that.'
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Yeah, but then you might go to jail for contempt of a court.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Well, then Apple --
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   So the individual coder?
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Well, Apple says, 'Oh, we asked -- we'd like to, but nobody would do it.'
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Well, somebody's going to jail.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Somebody's going to be fined.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   The other guy -- I read that I didn't -- I don't know if this was true or not.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   I don't know if I buy it, but one speculation was, at least,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Apple was going to make a First Amendment argument.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   It's hard for me to get my head around that.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   I really think people are going to be disappointed at Apple's defense
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   because a lot of people want Apple to stand up and wave the flag
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   of strong encryption and privacy.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   And I don't think they -- I think their lawyers will rightly say,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   'There's no argument there.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   That's not where you have to argue.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   You have to argue on the burden.'
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   It's not fair.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   I'm not a lawyer, but I suspect that's what's going to happen.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   But Denise's point is very well taken.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   She is a lawyer.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   What we really, as a nation, need to be debating is,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   'Do we want to have our smartphones be private?'
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Period.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   And I say, 'Yes, exclamation-able.'
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   I say, 'Yes.'
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   And I'm not an expert on this either, but I do watch the TV show
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   'Billions.'
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   And so --
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   I love that show.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Oh, is that a great show?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   But I think that Apple can't win this one.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   They're going to have to settle.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   They're going to lose.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   I watch The Good Wife, so I know about law.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Exactly.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   And no, they'll go all the way to Supreme Court, probably.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   If the Supreme Court reviews it, if not, then Apple will have to do it.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   They'll be destroyed.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   This is an election.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   They're going to be killed in the Court of Public Opinion.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   It's bad.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Yeah, because everybody says, 'Well, that's not fair.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Everybody says, 'Well, that's a terrorist phone.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Why wouldn't you help them?'
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.640]   I think Apple isn't even saying we won't help them.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.840]   I think Tim Cook's saying, 'We need to have this conversation.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.160]   This is what's been happening.'
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.600]   I think Apple's going to say it would be undue burden.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.600]   Not that we won't help them, but Bakash you really.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.600]   We're a business.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.960]   We can't be spending all our time helping you crack phones.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.880]   You want to talk about a burden?
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.960]   This is this week in Google.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:47.520]   What about the Android world where presumably every single OEM, and there are a thousand
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.960]   companies doing this, are going to have to do this.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.160]   You do what Apple is being asked to do to a certain extent, because if you want to crack
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.360]   the encryption on some Android phone, well, where do you go?
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.360]   You don't go to Google.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.360]   You go to Samsung.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.360]   You go to Samsung.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.320]   Although most Android phones are not encrypted by default, only the Nexus phones right now
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.680]   are encrypted by default.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.240]   I imagine all of them can be.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.800]   I imagine Samsung is as well.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.640]   The interesting thing is when you encrypt a phone, and I suspect Google kind of thought
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.920]   ahead, when you encrypt a phone, a non-Nexus phone, when you turn on that encryption, you
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.160]   know, and every case I've done it, it requires you to enter not a pin, not a passcode, not
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.720]   a gesture, but a long password.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.760]   And then that means, and I suspect, by the way, going forward that this is what Apple
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.480]   will do to avoid this.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.760]   The only reason Apple can be forced to do this is because it's fairly weak to have a
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:43.160]   four or even six digit numeric code.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.080]   But if Apple says, and by the way, it's an option, and everybody who wants to be private
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.920]   can do this, and it will be private, there's nothing Apple can do about it.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:58.840]   If you use instead of the pin code, it's in pain in the butt, but a long, strong password,
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.720]   then there's nothing Apple can do.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:07.280]   And in fact, on my Linux box, you have the option when you first install most versions
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.960]   of Linux to encrypt the disk, and you give it a passphrase, and you can't even boot into
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.600]   it unless you give it that passphrase.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:19.240]   If that's a good passphrase, no government in the world can compel any manufacturer to
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.240]   unlock it.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.240]   It's not possible.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.840]   And I think Apple will be happy to do that because really it's going to happen.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.720]   Because of the fingerprint ID, because all the phones are, and all the high end phones
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.760]   have fingerprint, then the burden on the user of a long password is not so great, because
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.440]   most of the time you unlock it just with...
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:42.240]   Well, but since you have a fingerprint, then they can compel the suspect to unlock it because
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.560]   you're not protected against users.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.560]   That would have been easy in this case, because he's in the morgue.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.800]   They just go, "I don't know if it works if you're dead."
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.080]   I don't think it does.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.600]   I think the fingerprint requires flesh and blood, live flesh and blood.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.800]   But for people who are watching, you don't have to wait for Congress or other courts
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:03.640]   or Apple or any manufacturer to decide because they've built in strong encryption unless they
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.280]   backdoor it.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:10.280]   Use a strong password, not a pin or a swipe, and your stuff is protected.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.840]   And that, by the way, is also true for any terrorist.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.080]   That means that every single time you use the phone, you have to use the strong password.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.920]   That's the disadvantage.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.960]   And you know, so Denise's question is interesting.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.040]   So we need to decide, do we want these to be private?
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.040]   Guess what?
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.040]   We know how.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.720]   Do we want it to be private, even if you had to enter a 10-letter password every time you
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.720]   started the phone?
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.000]   No, probably not.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.800]   It's too much trouble.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.680]   It's too much trouble.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.600]   The good news is, strong encryption exists.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.920]   The math exists.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.840]   If you're worried about a backdoor using an open source strong encryption technology,
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:53.600]   there are many of them available from non-US companies.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.240]   I think that that's been solved.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.480]   And the real issue here is because Apple kind of opened the door to this because they wanted
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.680]   to be convenient.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:08.600]   And they said, well, you could use four digit numeric code or six digit numeric code.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.800]   If you had a strong password, by the way, you can use a password on your iPhone.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:21.240]   If this shooter had used a password, nothing Apple could do.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.680]   I also would predict that once they do get into this phone, there's not going to be any
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.840]   data there.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.840]   They know that.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.840]   They don't think it has anything to do with that.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.280]   In way, it's a little cynical of them.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.520]   I think to go to the families of the people killed by the terrorist and say, what do you
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.200]   think and bring their, you know, they're going to file a court opinion.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.840]   It's cynical because it's not going to have to be investigation, I don't think.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.840]   But we don't know.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.840]   I mean, that's their job.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:47.120]   Anytime this has become, this has become not just political, as Mike said, it's become
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.120]   religious.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.800]   It's also becoming a kind of a left-right issue.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.800]   Is it?
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.800]   I think it is.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.800]   I think that's what's interesting.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.160]   Even in government, the NSA supports strong, unbroken, unbacked or encryption.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.160]   But nobody understands.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.160]   And the FBI does it.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.640]   That's two branches of the government.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.040]   So there's not even agreement within the national security infrastructure?
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.200]   Well, I don't think there ever is.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.000]   I mean, everybody wants their own job to go the way they want.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.200]   I mean, imagine how much more effective policing could be from the...
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   Right.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.960]   ...policements perspective if they didn't have Miranda rights and they didn't have all
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.960]   that stuff.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.960]   Well, as I said, they see this treasure chest and they go, God, if we could only get in
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.960]   there.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.960]   We'd know everything.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.960]   We needed to know all the evidences in there.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.640]   It's just like any sort of political issue.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.760]   There's certain people that want something and they want it for whatever the reason is
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.760]   that they want it.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.920]   And they wait for an event to take place where they can say, "Now this is why we want it."
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.920]   See?
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.920]   But they always think about it.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.920]   Think of the children.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.920]   Right.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.920]   So this is the...
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.840]   And I hate to sound this cynical, but this is why terrorism is convenient.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.840]   It actually applies.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.840]   It changes minds.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.720]   It scares people into agreeing with...
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.720]   Because they've got...
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.720]   Let's be honest.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.680]   Number one, these were not organized terrorists.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.680]   These were two complete dorks.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   They're bad guys in any...
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.240]   They're bad guys like any other bad guys.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.240]   But are they organized across...
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.960]   Are we going to hold on to a network of 100 terrorists?
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.960]   No.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.920]   Number two, to convict the guy who helped get in the weapons, if that's what they do, they
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.320]   got everything they need.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.320]   So you're right, Mike.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.880]   This is not about this case at all.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.880]   There's absolutely nothing.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.080]   I have to believe they really want here.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.640]   This is the ideal case to use to shame Apple into it.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:33.760]   To establish a precedent that Apple is very reluctant to have established.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:39.360]   And that's said, I think the best case scenario for the FBI and the people in government who
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:46.800]   want the back doors and access and for their not to be easy encryption on phones by default
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.000]   is for Apple to fight this and fight it and fight it and fight it until public opinion
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.040]   is so overwhelming that they cave.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:23:00.640]   Then everybody will be scared into just laying down for these types of requests and they
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.720]   will have won the political battle.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.960]   That's the ideal thing.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.680]   That's why I think Apple should immediately just say, "Okay, yeah, sure.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.040]   We'll cooperate in every way."
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.400]   Just to take the wind out of this particular one.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.840]   Because once they're publicly shamed, once the mighty Apple, the world's most valuable
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:21.080]   company, is publicly shamed into cracking under the pressure based on the fear of terrorism,
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.160]   then everybody else will just do it automatically.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:28.240]   There's proof of what you say because Apple wanted this to be sealed in private all along.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.400]   Had they not made a big deal about it, Apple probably would have complied silently and
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.720]   nobody would have known and they would have gone away.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:40.040]   But the FBI and the Department of Justice did not want this to be private because they
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.040]   wanted a precedent.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.400]   And I don't blame them.
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:47.120]   I think they want to do the best job they can, capturing bad guys and preventing us from
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.120]   terrorist attack.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.120]   I don't blame them.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.360]   Again, it's a treasure trove.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.360]   You've got a treasure chest.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.080]   You're waving in front of me.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.160]   I want in.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:03.080]   The truth though is we should be having the national debate of how private these should
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.680]   be or even the larger national debate of whether encryption should exist.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.240]   Actually, that's the biggest debate.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.240]   The big debate really.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:13.920]   I wrote a column before all this hit talking about McCain's Bloomberg view piece where McCain
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.880]   argued for back doors and things like back doors.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.320]   The politicians are viewing it right now is like, "Oh, we can always solve these problems
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.320]   later.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.560]   We'll figure out exactly how we get access to phones."
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.000]   But we'll do that later.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:36.080]   But he was basically using a different case that the failed terrorist attack in Texas as
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:40.280]   the reason why all phones need to be insecure.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.840]   And my view is like, there are other bad guys out there.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:48.240]   For example, China just recently unveiled their new bomber, which is identical to the
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.240]   US bomber.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.920]   They literally stole all the technology.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.200]   And you've got to think that the lack of encryption helped that effort over the last
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.480]   decade and a half or whatever it took them to steal it.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480]   That's the real point.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.000]   It needs to be made to John McCain and everybody.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Yes.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   That we're safer with encryption.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:12.400]   We are such a porous society that it's so easy to steal technology and so on that universal
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.560]   easy encryption would help us a lot.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.920]   We uniquely need it, I think, to a certain extent.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.920]   That's great.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.920]   All right.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.920]   That's enough of that.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:29.280]   I think that what's interesting and I guess this is a case study for your journalism class.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:34.320]   It's very hard to report on a story like this in the first 24 hours in report, accurately
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.320]   on it.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.600]   And this has been a story where as we've learned more, as we as reporters have learned
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:45.800]   more, not merely facts, but understood better what we're talking about, the story has changed
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.320]   considerably and refined considerably.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:55.680]   And I think we did a pretty good job that first, I mean, we just learned a story on Wednesday.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:01.800]   But now what we know, knowing what we know now, I think we can make a more nuanced case.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.600]   I've been saying for a couple of years now that the key skill for journalism is really
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.200]   to say what you don't know.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.600]   That what's known as known by everybody.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.480]   It's out there for all to say.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.480]   It's good.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   What don't we know?
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.360]   And to know the difference between your beliefs and what you know, and because a lot of times
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:24.480]   it seems so obvious, you know, because journalists are human, most of us.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:30.600]   And not now Watson just the right way to answer journalism is writing headlines.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.080]   Oh, please.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.160]   Actually we're in a lot.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.640]   We're in an interesting position here because I don't think we break stories or we tell facts
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:45.160]   so much as we try to give people an understanding of the underlying technology and what it means
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.480]   for them and that kind of thing.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.440]   I think that this discussion is a perfect example.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:55.920]   And we can do a better job once all the reporting is done of explaining what it means.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.560]   That's really what Twits about.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.560]   Let's take a break.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.960]   When we come back, we'll talk about walking robots and how they've been bullied.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.960]   You know what?
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.520]   New to new hashtag, no robot bullying.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.120]   Or maybe we need a new hashtag more robot bullying.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.120]   You can't make them angry.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.120]   Don't make them angry.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:18.120]   Don't make them angry.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.120]   We'll talk about AMP.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.400]   It's about to be here in Google's now shown that it is evil.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.240]   And we'll let you let you respond.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.160]   No, I've got to be surprised.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.080]   You might be surprised.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.600]   And what's happening at Yahoo.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.680]   All that and more coming up.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.320]   It's so nice to have Mike Elgin back.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.720]   What do you want to plug, Mike?
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.720]   Are you still doing?
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.720]   I hate to say this.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.720]   Are you still doing the Google+,?
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.720]   Yeah, I'm still in Google+, yeah.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.720]   How long?
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.640]   I'm not, I haven't been exclusive to it.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.480]   This is not your fault, by the way.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.480]   Thank you.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:53.560]   I love Google+, and I think Google mismanaged it, dropped the ball, but I do feel like it's
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:58.440]   kind of-- To me, the biggest event in the world of Google+, was that Sundar Pichai in
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.280]   his weak defensive apple over this whole thing that we talked about.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.280]   Didn't use Google+, he used Twitter.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.520]   And I thought, oh my god, he can't, you know, I mean, everybody would have followed his commentary
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.000]   wherever it was.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.560]   So he could have done a post on Google+, so the link from Twitter, but he thought, oh,
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.560]   why should anybody use Google+, right?
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:23.040]   He had to do it like four different posts and I mean, so it's like, come on, sorry.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.480]   It's sad.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.080]   I had high hopes, but that's life.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.040]   So where else can we catch in computer world?
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.440]   You're writing a lot now, which is great.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.640]   I'm writing a lot on Twitter, Mike Elgin, I'm on Facebook.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.800]   I'm even on Pinterest, so I'm exploring my feminine side.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.600]   You know, if you ever want to do a thing on man bags, I'll be, I'll be there right there.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.600]   It's not a purse Leo.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.600]   It's a manopion.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.600]   It's a European carry-off.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   It's a purse.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.320]   I love my MERS.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.720]   Seriously, every geek that I used to do, I used to do Patrick Norton, I used to carry
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.080]   around like I looked like an 800 pound pack.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:01.960]   Because you want to have, you know, your firewall and your chargers and your stuff.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.520]   It occurs to me frequently.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:07.040]   I have this, I have this over the one shoulder kind of a messenger bag type of thing that
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.640]   I carry with me when I don't have my full backpack.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.680]   And I'm on there looking for things.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.280]   And everyone's all like, this is a freaking purse.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.280]   I know.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.280]   Yes.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.280]   That's my lipstick.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.920]   I can't find it everywhere.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.320]   And I'll talk about the new phone that just came out.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.320]   I just got it today.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.480]   Jason Hall just got his.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:29.720]   This was a Kickstarter from a company called NextBit made of former HTC and Google Android
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.040]   folks.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.200]   The Robin is here.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.640]   And you know what?
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.920]   It's better than I thought it would be.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.600]   And we also have lots of talk about from the board of Congress.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.560]   I've also ordered a Galaxy S7 edge.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.800]   That'll come in a couple of weeks.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:50.080]   Our show today brought to you by texture, the mobile app that lets you access the world's
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:56.840]   most popular magazines whenever, wherever you want on your phone or your tablet.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:04.160]   There's some great writing and great reporting, great journalism, great fiction, photography,
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.680]   photojournalism in magazines, kind of locked up in magazines.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.680]   Some of them are on the web.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.680]   A lot of them aren't.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:15.840]   But the last thing I want to do is bring home a pile of glossy four color paper every
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.000]   week and put it on my coffee table.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.160]   I don't want the mailman to bring it either.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.920]   They're kind of hidden away in a vault until texture.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.200]   Texture gives you all the best magazines.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.880]   Exactly the same form as you'd get on the newsstand.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:36.680]   There's an issue plus past issues, even bonus features like video you can't get.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.320]   There's ad week.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.680]   There's wired.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.960]   There's vanity fair.
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.960]   There's fortune.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.360]   There's all the magazines, Bloomberg markets, Bonapétit, Billboard.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.400]   You know what the best magazine in the world is, Leo?
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.400]   What's that?
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.400]   It's the New Yorker magazine.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.400]   Love the idea.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:57.000]   They're the best fact-checked, most wonderful stories in there.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.360]   And there's always an article in New Yorker I want to read.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   But you know what I don't like?
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.960]   It's weekly and I feel guilty that I had a lot of cover to cover.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.400]   So for the cost of about three magazines a month, you subscribe to it and the National
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.080]   Geographic.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:15.680]   And by the way, Entertainment Weekly, us and all the gossip magazines.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.680]   There's Rolling Stone.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.040]   There's almost every month there's an article I want to read in there.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.840]   Do I want to subscribe just for that one article?
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:21.840]   No.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.840]   You don't have to.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.640]   This is like Netflix for magazines.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.640]   They're all in there.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.840]   Yeah, I'm so glad the New Yorker's in there.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.920]   It's the cartoons alone.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.080]   But if you only read the cartoons, you feel like, "Why am I killing all these trees for
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.000]   just the cartoons?"
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.720]   Anyway, here's the deal.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.680]   You can try it for free right now.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:47.600]   If you go to Texture, T-E-X-T-U-R-E, Texture.com, this is the same as the next issue.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.560]   We used to do the answer next issue.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.360]   They just rebranded it.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.560]   Texture.com/Twig, free trials waiting for you.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.360]   They do some really interesting things because not only do you get the magazines but they
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:05.480]   have editors who create topic sections so you can deep dive into articles about a topic
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.760]   across a lot of magazines.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.760]   Boys life.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:12.160]   I would love, what's the cartoon in the back of boys life?
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.000]   Fergus and Fergus or whatever.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   She's.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.320]   Yeah, I hope you don't remember that from your own use.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.320]   I do.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.320]   I would love to.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.520]   Oh man, is right.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.480]   PC Magazine, Macworld Magazine.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:28.240]   I'm just, even for National Geographic, this is so great.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.840]   Go to Texture.com/Twig.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.160]   Try it free so you can see all the features.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.160]   You're going to love it.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:38.640]   The world's most popular magazines on your smartphone, on your tablet.

[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.240]   Texture.com/Twig.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:47.440]   Jeff Jarvis is here from, as always, from the City University of New York.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.160]   So AMP is about to roll out like-
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.160]   It is rolled out.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.160]   It is out.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.240]   And Facebook articles also out for everybody.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.080]   Well, that happens in April.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.080]   But yes, it will.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.080]   Oh, it's going too.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.080]   Yes.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.080]   Not Apple News.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.560]   You still have to be kind of a publisher with Apple News.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:11.480]   But these are three platforms that are designed to make mobile content faster, easier, lighter,
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.960]   better to read.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:13.960]   Right.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.560]   And, you know, Facebook's a walled garden.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.760]   I was talking to somebody who said, I don't, I always Dan Gilmore said, I can't understand
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:25.480]   why anybody would bury their content in Facebook.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.480]   Except that there's people are.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.800]   But you maintain your copyright.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.040]   You can put it anywhere.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.200]   You're cross-posing it there.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.600]   And even Dave Weiner just put a post up today.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.600]   Really?
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.680]   How instant articles helps the open web.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.680]   Okay.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.840]   It's the toughest critic you can imagine.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.840]   Good.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:45.480]   If you go to Scripting.com/Twig.com, which of course, Dave likes a lot.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.480]   Exactly.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.480]   He invented.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.760]   And I will go into the details as I'm sure I'll mess it up.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:56.440]   But it is interesting that if you consider, and Dave has been critical of me using media
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.800]   and other using medium, but as long as you can export, as long as you put more one place,
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.720]   you own your own stuff, the question is, why aren't you putting it in all these places
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.720]   to reach people where they are?
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.720]   That makes sense.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.680]   And when you write a blog post, you put it on medium.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.800]   I don't put it on as much as I should.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.800]   Well, I would.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.800]   And I kind of, I yell at you for that.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:16.560]   I mean, I don't enter Kevin Marks here telling me I should use no to put it on all places.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:22.040]   Go posse and post, you know, on your personal thing and syndicate to everybody else.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.240]   But you can't do that.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.880]   It's kind of time consuming to do that because you have to do it by hand in many cases.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.880]   AMP.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:40.000]   I talked to Jigress in Google this week and I've been defending AMP on the fear that Google,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.320]   because it was, it was in an ad age story about Tiwisco.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.400]   Jigress was misquoted and or mis-summarized.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:53.160]   And they presumed that Google would favor AMP content in search and such.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.840]   And I looked into this.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.840]   I asked them that.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.080]   And Richard was very clear.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.760]   No, no, only to the extent that because it's faster and we fat and we favor any faster
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.680]   page, will it be favored?
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.680]   But.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:11.360]   And if it were favored, that to me would be a monopolistic move by Google.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.360]   Here's the issue.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:18.640]   Well, here's the issue I do have, which is that if you do a search on a topic like look
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:22.920]   up AMP and there comes a carousel, which is a new thing.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.320]   Not always at the top, but it's prominently displayed.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.600]   That is just AMP content.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.600]   Right.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.960]   I thought at first that was only going to be used for the demo purposes to say, Oh, look
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:34.960]   what it can do.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:35.960]   It would fun.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.200]   I had no problem with that.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.120]   But now that AMP content is there, so I asked them and I said, well, what's your definition
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.120]   of fast?
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.600]   If I can make my page as fast as AMP, you know, how are you?
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   Why am I not the carousel?
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.680]   They don't have an answer there.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.680]   They don't have an answer there.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.160]   The carousel is just promoting AMP content.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.440]   And I think that makes me uncomfortable.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.880]   And this is by the way, only in mobile search because they say again and again, AMP is really
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.440]   just about speeding up mobile.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:10.160]   Although so there's a burden on a publisher because you have to create an AMP page.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.560]   AMP is not an open standard.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:17.680]   They could say that all they want, but Google sets the standard, including what tags are
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.040]   allowed and not allowed.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.120]   The big example to me is redefining the image tag.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.520]   That's been in HTML since day one.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:31.320]   And no, you can't use it telling you what JavaScript you may and may not use from kind
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.800]   of this purest engineering standpoint.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.800]   I understand.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   Well, it speeds up pages.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.040]   It's really, here's what I think is going on.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.640]   Google was very nervous about ad blocking.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:46.760]   The boycott of ads because Google's an ad company.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.880]   And they said, why do people block ads?
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.440]   And they actually didn't get it right.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:56.880]   They said people block ads because it makes pages fat and slow and sluggish.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.400]   And so we're just going to make pages fast and lean.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:07.000]   And they'll still have ads, but they'll be acceptable ads, ads that we allow.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.400]   But what they don't understand is, A, people block ads because they don't like ads, period.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.840]   B, they're worried about security concerns.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.400]   Maybe this addresses that.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:19.320]   Some of it is, of course, the waste of bandwidth and speed.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.320]   And this does address that.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:25.280]   But I don't think, OK, so it's a response to ad blockers.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.800]   It's in their financial interest.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:32.080]   And now they're going to favor it in their search results.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.680]   And you cannot deny that a carousel is there.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.960]   There are argument to me when I raised this question, which I did with them, it was, I
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.640]   barcode until today, was, well, the carousel won't always be at the top.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.040]   No, other more important stories may be above it.
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.720]   OK, but the carousel is still a favored position.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:54.680]   And here's an example, by the way, I just Googled on my phone, FBI Apple.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.040]   OK, one story from Wired at the top.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:03.040]   Here's the AMP carousel, which is the more compelling, interesting content, which are
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.960]   you more likely to link to?
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.200]   This is AMP content.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.840]   And by the way, this is big publishers.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:09.680]   It's a BBC.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.680]   It's USA Today.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:11.600]   It's ABC News.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.800]   It's the Verge.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.680]   It is not the Jonathan Zadarski blog.
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:16.880]   It is not Twit.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.280]   It is not any of the independent content you might be interested in.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:20.800]   Well, no.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.080]   No, I searched on Obama.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:29.280]   And the first thing in the carousel is the Blaze, which is in trouble with some of your
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.960]   users now, some of your viewers.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:35.600]   But is a right-wing nut job site.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.840]   From what's his name?
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.600]   Breitbart?
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:38.960]   Who does?
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.280]   Yeah, no, no, no, the former Fox News guy was even too crazy for Fox.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.280]   Oh, right.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.280]   That guy.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.280]   That guy.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.280]   Yeah, that guy.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.280]   So what's the news judge that goes into?
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.280]   Glandbeck, thank you.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.520]   When it goes into the people, you can, yes, you can waste your time emailing me how I'm
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.080]   adorbed by criticizing Glandbeck.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.080]   Save your effort.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.400]   Get a life relax.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.760]   So what's the news judgment?
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.200]   What's the structure that goes into the carousel versus what's Obama?
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.280]   I should point out, by the way.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.280]   The more important story is Obama.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.480]   Yes, when you search for Obama on Google, you don't get AMP and AMP carousel, but you
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.480]   do get a bunch of YouTube videos.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.360]   Well, I know I don't get that.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.400]   I'm getting all these YouTube videos.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.560]   This is not associated with Google in any way.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.040]   Which is not associated with Google.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.720]   When am I getting only YouTube video?
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.720]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.120]   I clicked videos by accident.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.120]   Oh, I see.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.120]   All right.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.120]   But guess what?
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.000]   I do get a Yahoo story for me and then a bunch of AMP content.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.360]   That to me is more than favoring AMP.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.360]   That is like putting it front and center.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:43.920]   I think there's another issue also, which is that AMP delivers up components of a web
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:49.080]   page that are both Google's version and in some cases come from Google itself, come
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.840]   from Google servers.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.340]   There's another thing that we'll probably talk about at some point today called Project
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:40:02.960]   Shield where journalists, websites are cached on Google servers and so they can't be brought
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.520]   down with DDoS attacks.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.520]   Nice.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.520]   Love that.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.640]   And then this is tied in.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:18.200]   Stick with me here with Facebook with internet.org, which doesn't give people in poorer countries
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.200]   the internet for free.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:24.600]   It gives them a cached version of the internet on Facebook servers for free, a very limited
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.440]   version.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:33.320]   And so what we see by Google and Facebook is an attempt to move people off the public
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.120]   internet onto the ones that are on their own private servers.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:41.320]   I think that's a little, Mike, I think that, yeah, I'm hearing that this is a, this is
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.520]   a, that AMP is somehow a, a, another walled garden.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.520]   I don't buy that.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.000]   You don't have to use the CDN.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.640]   You can make your own if you want.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.600]   You can, you can use Akama, you can do anywhere you want.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:56.040]   They're offering you a free CDN, but it is not a requirement of AMP period.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.040]   Right.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.040]   I understand.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.200]   And I don't think there's bad intent.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:04.040]   I think this is just what's necessary to make these good things possible.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:08.640]   This is what often happens with Google is they do things that make sense as engineers,
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.560]   not knowing completely what the impact will be public opinion.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.280]   And yeah, I have to point out these are both, it's project shields, not, I like project
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.280]   shield.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.280]   But AMP is self-serving, ultimately self-serving.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:24.920]   My episode, but, but, well, no, I mean, I, I, though I was just critical of that part
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:28.920]   of the execution, making the, we, we, we in media messed up the way we said this was
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:32.080]   the show before, I think making the faster web is generally a good thing.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.400]   It is an open standard.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.240]   They will have to figure out the governance to make it a truly open standard because right
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.280]   now it's Google's open standard.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:42.960]   I would not reject AMP just because Google does in fact benefit from it.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.440]   I think it's Google's version of zero rating.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:52.880]   And I think it'll be very popular with people just as zero rating is, you know, when T-Mobile
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:58.080]   says, Hey, Ben John, you're, you're not going to go against your data plan.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:01.160]   Everybody yells at me for saying that's a bad idea.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.840]   Because that's a great idea from their point of view as is AMP.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:08.480]   Everything's faster and nicer and slick and sweet in the beautiful Google universe.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.320]   But it is not.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:16.400]   It's just like, what's wrong with being, what's wrong with being in Google CDN?
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.400]   Well, it's not open.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.240]   Now, that's not.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.240]   The phone is not open.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.400]   You pay for Akamai.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.560]   Yeah, but well, I don't, it's not so much about the CDN that bothers me.
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:34.240]   What it is, is that Google is now going to favor web pages designed with its own proprietary
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.240]   non standard form.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.240]   So let's carry it.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.600]   So what if what if tomorrow they said, Oh, gee, okay.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.960]   All right, we'll get rid of the carousel or we'll include.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:46.320]   Well, I'm just saying I told you so because nobody, because I said this and everybody said,
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.320]   Oh, don't worry.
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:50.120]   It won't be a favorite by Google.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.560]   I told you so, but if they got rid of that, they're not going to get rid of it.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.560]   It's the whole point.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.560]   What if they did?
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.560]   Is that the only objection?
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.560]   Well, it'd be better.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.640]   They wouldn't be using their, see, Google's strong arms people.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:00.640]   Look, I agree.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.960]   It's a good idea that all sites should be HTTPS.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:07.320]   But then as soon as you start using your, and this is that argument I keep coming back
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:12.720]   to on this show that because search is so important, it should be a priesthood.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.840]   It should not serve Google's commercial interests.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.840]   It's a company.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:23.440]   I understand it's a company, but it's a company with so much power because the power of the
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.160]   Google search is essentially the power to exist on the internet.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.480]   That's Microsoft ruined the world.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:36.040]   When you move into Germany, fella, I don't, you really look at this as Google saying,
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.040]   Hey, don't worry.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.040]   We'll take care of this.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.200]   Well, in some cases they do what they do and they do take care of things.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:46.240]   Yeah, I can't also shut ourselves off to the notion that a company can do something right.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:52.240]   Yeah, but this is the, this again, it's, there's a theoretical dimension to this.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.320]   Of course, I think Google is trying to do the right thing.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.080]   Yes, faster pages are better.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:00.520]   Yes, they're, they're being open to a certain extent, but this is why we have, you know,
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:04.440]   I think your argument in the initial part of this, why we have standards, standards,
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.000]   every, every company says, well, this is the way to do it.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.920]   And another company say, no, that's not the way to do it.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.160]   This is the way to do it.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.640]   And that's why we have standards bodies.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.560]   They can all figure out and agree.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.560]   They can all figure out how to do it.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:21.560]   So, you know, we have a lot of standards bodies that are bureaucracies that take time.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:23.560]   So both those, so let's just go right ahead.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:28.560]   But again, with this internet.org thing, Google says, come on, everybody's welcome on our version
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:29.560]   of the internet.
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.560]   And Facebook goes, well, everybody's welcome on our version of the internet.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.560]   That's where I think you're going to part guys.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.560]   That's where I think you're going to part guys.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.560]   That's where I think you're going to part.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.560]   Here's the other thing.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.560]   Well, then where's the Google?
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.560]   Where are the Google sites on internet?
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.560]   They're not there.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.560]   Why?
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.560]   Because Google is a competitor with Facebook and they don't live on Facebook's internet.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.560]   That's the point is that Facebook has instant articles.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.560]   Google has AMP.
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:48.560]   But AMP is not AMP is in fact opened.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.560]   Anybody can use it.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.560]   Here's where it's going to change.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.560]   And I've said this on the show before.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.560]   So I'm repeating myself and I apologize because you've heard it before.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:00.560]   It's only coincidental that this happens to start with news because they want to do something
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.560]   nice for news in Europe.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.560]   They come back.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.560]   Dave Bessbrough says, I want a faster web.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.560]   I want to clean up the web.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.560]   It's a mess.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.560]   They put those two things together.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.360]   What's going to happen fairly quickly here is that AMP is not going to be just news and
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.360]   news publishers.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.160]   AMP is going to be any AMP page on the web.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.920]   And then the Picarasel is going to become pretty much meaningless.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.440]   And the question is, are pages fast or slow?
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:27.240]   And in a mobile world, slow pages will indeed perform badly.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:31.400]   And one by Hook or Kirk or one standard or another, pages will have to get faster and
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.880]   later and clean up the mess we made of the web.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:39.600]   You know, it's the irony of this is that according to Dave Weiner, Facebook is using open web
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.080]   technology and standards.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:44.440]   You're using RSS and it's compatible.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.560]   In fact, you don't have to host it on Facebook for instant articles to work.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:50.680]   You can do your own thing.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:51.680]   Well you're served.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:52.680]   You're hosted.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:53.680]   You are.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.280]   No, he says you don't have to be.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.280]   He says you are all.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.240]   He says you could create outside.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:04.920]   But at the end, when that has actually served to you, Leo, the port on your Facebook, Facebook
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.080]   serving that they're cashing it through to.
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.080]   It was wouldn't be fast.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:14.560]   But he says you don't have to because it's an open format.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:19.080]   You can post use the same format, same content to post the LinkedIn, Twitter, Medium or any
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.760]   new service that might come along.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.960]   So Facebook does not have an exclusive on this flow.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.560]   They are not being a silo.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.560]   How about that?
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.560]   He says it's open.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.560]   I'm just correct.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.560]   You said a minute ago though.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.600]   He says you can't be turned off.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.200]   If you're using right, but it doesn't have to be.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.440]   You can have instant article content served by others.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:44.200]   You can't stay with same with him.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:48.120]   Emp is just a subset of HTML full stop period is the subset you don't like.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.120]   What is the subset?
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.120]   It's a web page.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:54.840]   It is just what we get Dave Weiner on because it but my senses of this that is that oddly
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:59.080]   enough, Facebook is not using nonstandard tags.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:02.400]   They're using standards, including RSS.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:07.480]   But when you are served in instant articles, you are cashed by Facebook servers served
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.480]   by Facebook servers.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.360]   He says, I can and will modify River five to support the instant article format.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:15.080]   That's his content system.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:19.800]   All kinds of new services can boot up on the flow without depending upon Facebook servers.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.640]   You can't be turned off by Facebook.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.840]   This is the key feature of the open web.
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.280]   It's the platform without a platform vendor.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.000]   What's interesting about amp, you're right.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.040]   Others can host AMP concache app content.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:34.040]   But only Google can say what's acceptable in AMP.
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.640]   Only Google can say what JavaScript can exist in it.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:40.480]   Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.400]   Instant articles also takes a subset of HTML.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.400]   You can't do it.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.400]   But a legitimate subset.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.400]   Whoa.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.600]   Well, no, that's important.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:53.960]   Who is if I want to do anybody against AMP?
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.600]   I want to do hop up ads.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:59.960]   This is what drives me and Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:00.960]   Well, I want to do pop up ads.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:03.200]   I can't do them in either format.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.840]   There are things that I am not allowed to do.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.840]   There is a subset.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:09.800]   I'm not allowed to do a subset, but it's not a standard subset.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:16.880]   So in other words, if you serve AMP content to Firefox right now, it'll go what?
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.280]   I don't know what this is.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.760]   Because it's not standard.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:23.840]   If you serve instant articles to Firefox, it'll go, yeah, let me render that.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:24.840]   I don't know.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:25.840]   Let's try that.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.840]   Isn't that the case?
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:27.840]   Am I wrong?
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:28.840]   Try that.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:29.840]   Open up Firefox.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:30.840]   Don't you, Arlen?
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.240]   Don't you have to use Chrome?
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.880]   I don't know yet.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:43.280]   Maybe it is to start with, but they, well, there's a new standard with nonstandard tags.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   Maybe I'm misunderstanding it.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.840]   Maybe it generates standard HTML.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.480]   Is that right?
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:48.480]   It might.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.480]   I don't know.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.480]   Tusted.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:57.160]   I can't open up Firefox because I have a Chromebook.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:00.520]   I had this question before and I should have probably answered this to my satisfaction.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.440]   Go find an AMP article.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.440]   Let me see so far.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.440]   I have Safari on here.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.440]   That would be awesome.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.440]   I think you are.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.440]   I'll put it in and see what happens.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.440]   I don't know.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:09.440]   I don't know.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:10.440]   I don't know.
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.440]   So let's do a Google server.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:12.440]   Oh, see, I'm not on mobile.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.080]   Shoot, but you can still put it.
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.080]   No, no, you can still do that.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.800]   How do you get an AMP?
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.800]   How do you get an AMP?
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.280]   Open up, open up a story in.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:23.800]   Okay, let me open this up.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:24.800]   So this URL.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:25.800]   Who is this?
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.800]   Who is?
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:27.800]   Who is AMP?
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:28.800]   Who is AMPed?
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.800]   Everything.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.800]   Washington Post, Guardian, Your Times.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.800]   ABC.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:40.800]   Yeah, that's even all in the format for AMP.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:45.280]   But it's not showing the AMP URL.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.440]   So I don't know what the AMP.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:54.240]   Do you need Kevin Marks, amper sign AMP or something?
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:56.480]   I thought so, but I'm not showing that.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:57.480]   I don't know.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.480]   Force.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.480]   AMP content.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:04.820]   If you can show source here, can I show source on my phone?
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:07.320]   No, don't show source.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:12.960]   That's a bad idea.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.080]   How does how does somebody saying AMP does work?
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.920]   Evil IRC, you know, Chairman says AMP does work on mobile Safari.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.920]   All right.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:22.920]   Okay.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:26.440]   If that's the case, if in other words, you write the page in some non-standard monologue.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:31.000]   It's not a markup, but it generates standard markup, then actually I don't have a problem
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   with that.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Okay.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.320]   As long as it's standard, as long as what goes out on the web is standard.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.600]   I mean, no JS is non-standard markup.
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:45.160]   When we write pages for our website, we're not writing in an HTML, but it's, you know,
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:49.600]   same thing if you use CoffeeScript or a lot of other things, you use.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.800]   So there's another issue to AMP.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:58.880]   And Facebook's version of this that's really kind of interesting that we should stop and
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:03.960]   take notice of, which is that assuming those are good things, that faster mobile websites
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:04.960]   are good.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:05.960]   And I think that's a safe assumption.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:06.960]   Great with your assumption.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:13.080]   That's part of a larger trend where the mobile web is now becoming vastly better than the
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:15.240]   desktop web, if you can call it the desktop web.
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.960]   We used to think that mobile was a subset.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:22.720]   So for example, there are all kinds of new startups launching on mobile only, Adam Bank
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:30.240]   in the UK, Pokemon Go, for example, Poshmark, GameTime, Go90, a mobile only weather show
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.560]   called the Lyft from the Weather Channel.
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:39.200]   So these are actual, these actual content and services that exist on your phone that
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.760]   you can't get on your desktop.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:46.080]   So there are things like the, and then there are features coming out on apps where the
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:49.960]   new features exist only on mobile devices, like Spotify's party feature.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:53.040]   You can't use that from a laptop and so on.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:56.200]   And of course, Facebook and Google are making the mobile web faster.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:00.000]   So we're getting the point where increasingly the mobile web is pulling away from the desktop
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:06.640]   web and the desktop web is the, the internet's unwanted step child.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:07.640]   That's another thing.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.640]   That's another thing.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:12.960]   Even here, although given the move to mobile, I guess it's almost a bad.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:13.960]   That's just everybody.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.640]   If you open up the name of the lab piece I put on how fast is it on the rundown, I think
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:23.680]   it's very interesting, you'll see the relative speed of similar content, amp, non-ampe.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:27.200]   Yeah, but again, that's like that.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.320]   I understand that's the same thing you could say, well, isn't this nice?
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:33.080]   I don't have to pay T-Mobile for my Netflix view.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.400]   No, but how it is good.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.960]   Yes, it's good.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.280]   But no, it's a faster web page period, full stop.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.280]   It's a fast web page.
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.280]   That's a good thing.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.280]   We messed up the web and this makes it faster.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:43.280]   And let Google fix it.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.520]   Let me know what you can do.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.120]   So what do you want?
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:49.600]   Yahoo to fix it.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.600]   We didn't fix it.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.600]   We could have fixed it in media.
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.600]   We didn't.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.440]   Yeah, that's why everybody uses ad blockers.
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:57.040]   By the way, the web is nice and fast with ad blockers.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:58.040]   Yeah?
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.040]   Yeah?
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:05.200]   But I'd sure rather have fed journalists with ads on faster pages and fewer people motivated
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.200]   to put in ad blockers.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.200]   It's not a bad thing.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:14.720]   I need to actually do some research and make sure because I don't understand.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:18.840]   So you can get AMP content on a not without Chrome.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:23.080]   Like I don't have to use Chrome or Google browser to see an AMP page.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.080]   I'm not saying it doesn't.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.080]   I'm not saying it doesn't.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.080]   I do not know.
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:28.440]   I know that they've said that.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:33.040]   Pretty sure they've said that they intend to make it work for all browsers.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.240]   But I can't remember when that was said so I better.
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.800]   I don't know.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:48.240]   So if you take a New York Times story that on the web, the old girl fashion web took 0.985
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:52.640]   seconds to begin the load and fully in 3.82 seconds.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:58.920]   The mobile version, similar 0.857 seconds to start loading, fully loaded in 2.996.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.040]   I stipulate AMP is faster.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.040]   No, I'm not.
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:08.520]   Let's say a little praise.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.520]   Okay.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:12.480]   The AMP version, note the AMP.html in the URL it says here, loads in 0.24 seconds and is
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:16.280]   fully loaded in 0.646 seconds.
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:21.680]   So it's substantially faster and it changes the basic experience of the web.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.680]   I don't feel like I'm going to the New York Times.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:28.920]   I feel like when I click on another link now, I feel like I'm reading it there or the carousel
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:29.920]   or wherever.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.600]   I don't feel like I've had to go somewhere.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.600]   Right.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:35.800]   That is a fundamental change in the experience of the web.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:40.120]   This notion and this goes back to all my Yammarines years ago on this show about the link economy.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:44.680]   And when I saw, this is the, you know, my epiphany on this was the idea that we had to
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.720]   send readers over to get to the content.
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.360]   Why doesn't the content come to the reader?
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.120]   And this is a moral equivalent of that.
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.720]   That's fundamentally important.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:55.680]   And the fact that Google did it, I mean, I had this argument at, at Newsgeist, people
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:56.680]   say, oh, should I do this?
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:00.280]   I said, we talked, we complain about this a year ago at the same conference and nothing
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.760]   happened to media since then.
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:05.840]   So Google went out and did something good for them.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.240]   You don't have to use it.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.840]   You're an impatient man, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:12.680]   Yeah, but if isn't it bad if Google favors AMP and their search results?
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.680]   That's what I've just said.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:14.680]   I agree.
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:15.680]   So I'm criticizing Google here.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:17.800]   I think that the carousel is a problem.
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:21.160]   I think it's a problem for, as we like to say, optics.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.080]   I think it's a problem in Europe.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:26.520]   I think that there being a little naive in that.
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:30.160]   And just saying that, well, it's not necessarily the first thing on the page is disingenuous
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.040]   and I think that's a vulnerability.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.040]   Yeah, they need to pay it.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:38.040]   And I think what Google has to do, my suggestion is what Google has to do is to set a standard
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.120]   of speed, whatever they set that.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:43.440]   And however you meet that standard, then if they want to have a carousel of that, that's
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:49.120]   how you foster, that's how you foster, you know, the reverse ad tech.
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.080]   So they did one version of speed.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.680]   They should be open to many versions of speed.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:56.360]   If all they care about us, same problem I have with the notion of the digital news initiative
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:03.640]   is a European Liner's edition initiative and all they're doing is playing.
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:06.280]   They're not really caring about news in that sense.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:08.160]   Okay, so here's your.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.240]   So I have a really caring about speed.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:13.880]   Here's what care about speed and have one of many versions how to get there.
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.000]   Here's an amp URL from USA Today.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.160]   I put it into Chrome.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.560]   It loaded very fast, Jeff.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:22.560]   You're absolutely right.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:23.800]   And this is what it looks like.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:24.800]   It looks bad there.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:25.800]   The headlines.
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.560]   Well, that's why I'm getting some rendering issues.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:28.880]   Don't worry about that.
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.920]   Now I load the same thing in Safari.
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:33.600]   This is the same URL.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.120]   But as you can see, this is a non-ampt version.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:40.680]   So my question is, I don't know what question is.
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:43.600]   That's an issue they've got to figure out.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:47.920]   Now, the question is, is this HTML?
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:48.920]   What am I?
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.240]   What is what is AMP?
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.240]   Is it render into?
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.880]   I mean, it's out as of today.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:58.080]   So the question for me is, what are fire-- what we should ask is.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:03.560]   What I'm curious to get the answer from is, what do firefox folks say at Mozilla about
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:04.560]   AMP?
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.560]   And I don't know.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.640]   And I've got a friend who's there and I should ask her.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:11.880]   What their stance is on AMP and will they render AMP or will they somehow protest and
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.800]   agree with Leo that it's the work of the devil?
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.960]   I don't know.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:16.960]   I would think that--
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:21.920]   I mean, the other thing I have to point out is you use the master version.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:25.560]   One of the things that we don't want to do is load a bunch of JavaScript, unknown JavaScript
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:26.560]   from Google.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.000]   I mean, I don't think that's a good idea.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.320]   The so-- okay.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.320]   So--
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:34.320]   That's--
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:35.320]   I'm getting back some weird--
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:37.320]   Get the love of some kind of old Java.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:39.160]   Here's a tag AMP dash pixel.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.160]   Okay.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:43.760]   So it's kind of some-- it's kind of odd looking HTML.
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.480]   This isn't Chrome.
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:50.000]   See AMP dash image is the image tag here.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   Okay.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:58:01.520]   So-- and let me look at the same source in Safari because that's interesting.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:07.640]   I don't-- I feel like I'm getting a different page.
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:12.400]   And that's definitely non-standard HTML, which Chrome handles obviously because-- so
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.400]   that's another thing.
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:16.200]   What if you made pages that only got rendered properly by a Google--
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:20.960]   Well, what happens is that the other browser can look and not get the AMP for it.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:21.960]   It gets the regular version.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:25.320]   But what it requires is-- here's the real question to me.
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:29.160]   It requires publishers to then maintain two versions as long as there's that separation,
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.880]   which is the issue you're right with non-standard.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:35.720]   I mean, if I were a publisher tomorrow, you know, what you want is a system that would
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:36.720]   enable a publisher to say screw it.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.280]   I'm going to produce one version of everything.
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:39.640]   It's an AMP version.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:45.440]   If that doesn't work, then you're right that there is a vanity.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:49.480]   The other thing that is a little bit of news around AMP is that one of the things that
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:54.160]   the European publishers had demanded, no surprise, was treatment of paywalls.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:58.080]   So now on the client side-- not the server side yet, though they're working on that--
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:03.600]   on the client side, when you go to a paywall page, it does that thing where it grays out
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:06.840]   the bottom like the Wall Street Journal does and says, "Oh, you want to see this?
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.280]   Pay up."
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:12.680]   And as I understand how that works, that the content is actually served on the client.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:17.320]   The client just blocks it until you're cleared, as opposed to a server side solution where
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:20.840]   the content would only be served up if you're a known user.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:27.200]   But that was a big requirement for publishers who have paywalls to be able to make AMP paywall
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.360]   friendly.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.280]   And instant articles is not paywall friendly.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:36.240]   Okay, so I'm not a big friend of paywall, so I don't necessarily care, but that's a
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:37.920]   big difference in the two right now.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.480]   Briefly, though, a little quick investigation.
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:45.240]   I was giving the page that I was-- the page that I was served in Safari does not have any
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:49.880]   of those weird AMP image tags, AMP dash image.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:55.120]   So I-- even though I went to the same exact URL that has AMP in the URL, CPT dash AMP
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:56.120]   dot production dot connection.
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.360]   It went to a different version.
[00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:02.440]   It served up a version that Safari could see, which is not an AMPed version.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.440]   So if you're--
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.440]   If you look at those--
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.440]   So this is another problem I have.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:10.960]   I think it's a pointer in the source code probably from one version to another.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.760]   I'm not sure how that works exactly.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:13.760]   I don't think--
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:23.480]   If an AMP page requires a Google product to load, it's another problem.
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.480]   Isn't it?
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:29.200]   Yeah, but this is where I'm saying early days, and this is where I'm also saying this is
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.960]   why number one--
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.520]   I'll repeat it myself.
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:36.600]   Number one, what Google should be doing I think is saying, we favor the fast web.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.000]   Here's our way to get to it.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.320]   Here's the standard we set.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:43.200]   If you have another standard that gets you there, honky about--
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:47.360]   Then there's a case to be made that the way standards do get advanced is by unilateral
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:52.520]   effort like from a cup of a Microsoft, and they create something, and then everybody says,
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.680]   oh, that's great.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.840]   Let's put that in the standard.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.320]   So I would hope--
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.320]   Or they fight over it and doesn't work.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.800]   There is an open standard structure for this.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:02.800]   It is on GitHub.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.560]   You can see what the JavaScript does and doesn't do.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.880]   That's open.
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.880]   But that's one issue.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.320]   The second issue is the carousel.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.320]   All right.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.400]   How many hours have we done?
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.400]   I know.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.400]   I know.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.400]   I know.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.400]   I know.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.400]   I know.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.400]   I know.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.400]   I'll shut up now.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.960]   By the way, this project shield is pretty cool.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.640]   The idea of this is to provide DDoS protected.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:30.240]   The reason I'm very aware of this is our friend Steve Gibson.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.480]   It was DDoSed off and on for days, bringing his site down.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:39.480]   The problem is that the features of his site, like shields up, could not be used in a DDoS
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:40.720]   protected environment.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.720]   Yeah.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:42.720]   Oh.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.000]   So how does Google exactly do this?
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:52.160]   It basically caches the site on Google servers and then Google servers are so gigantic that
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.200]   they can't be destroyed by a DDoS attack.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.640]   And what's interesting about this to me--
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.120]   But they're doing this for free for people?
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.120]   For free.
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.600]   And who's doing it?
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.600]   Jigsaw.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.520]   Now, I thought Jigsaw was a think tank.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.720]   I thought there was sitting around smoking opium and stuff and just coming up with grand
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:12.240]   ideas, but this is actually a service that is being provided by Jigsaw.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.240]   So I think that's really interesting.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.640]   So they're going to actually be doing things.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.640]   Not just--
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:23.360]   This works roughly the same as commercial DDoS protection sites like-- and I'm trying
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:30.240]   to remember John Graham coming site company-- CloudFlare by a reverse proxy.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.600]   So in exactly right, it goes through Google.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.920]   The problem is that Steve raised with all of these sites is that they would own-- they
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.320]   have to own the certificate.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:43.320]   They have to own the domain name and that he cannot then provide outbound services like
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.720]   shields up.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.960]   But it's fine for a news site.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:50.200]   And what this is intended to do is protect news sites against being brought down as a
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.600]   form of censorship.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:56.880]   Well, it's even better than just protecting news sites from censorship and in their announcement
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.720]   they talked about a specific Iranian news website that was brought down by the Iranian
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:06.920]   government, most likely, to prevent them from reporting on shenanigans in their election,
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.920]   et cetera.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.560]   But what's interesting about this is that they're neutral in terms of are you left and
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:17.080]   right or whatever politics, but they're not neutral in terms of what kind of news site
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.080]   it is.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:24.720]   So if it's a government-owned website like China TV or state media, they will not protect
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.120]   those sites.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.120]   So now we're--
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.120]   That's interesting.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.120]   Right.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.120]   So government sites can be DDoSed.
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:37.360]   Well, and privately the Chinese government has equal resources, but does the North Korean
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.360]   does--
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.360]   Maybe not North Korea.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.360]   Except South Korea was DDoSed.
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:43.160]   South Korea, I would argue, would need protection from North Korea.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.160]   Maybe.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.160]   Maybe.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.440]   I mean, to bring down a modern site, you need a lot of bandwidth.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:55.160]   By the way, we talked a lot about this on security now on Tuesday.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.200]   I encourage you to listen to that episode.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:06.320]   But DDoSed attacks could easily be mitigated if ISPs would simply block packets coming out
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:10.400]   of their networks that don't have IP addresses within their IP range.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.800]   In other words, spoofed IP addresses.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.800]   That's how you have to do this.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:19.240]   You have to-- because otherwise, if you're a bad guy in trying to bring a site down,
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.200]   you can't use your IP address.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.840]   They just block those IP addresses.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:27.960]   They use raw sockets and other techniques to spoof the IP addresses, just to make up
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.560]   IP addresses so that you can't block any given IP addresses.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.560]   That's to come from many.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.440]   You could do that with a botnet as well.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:41.240]   But if in general ISPs, just simply-- it would not-- in any way impinge on their effectiveness,
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:45.160]   simply said, look, that address is not from our network.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.840]   Why are you pretending to be that address?
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:49.520]   We're going to drop that packet.
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.320]   None of this would happen.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.320]   And I'm not sure why.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.320]   Are there any implications at all to that happening?
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.800]   Not that I know of.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.640]   Of VPNs or--
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:04:59.640]   No.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:04.440]   Well, it would mean that you wouldn't be able to be anonymous on a network, but you could
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:08.240]   still go out of the network using Tor and be anonymous.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:11.120]   It seems to me like this is a very simple thing.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.440]   And I think Steve Gibson agrees.
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:18.800]   Because every internet service provider, every connection in the internet is provided with
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:22.960]   a range of IP addresses that they own that their legal addresses.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:28.760]   Your address when you use Cox or Comcast or Time Warner is within that range of addresses.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.200]   If none of the attacks are coming from--
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.200]   If none of the attacks are coming from--
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.200]   If none of the attacks are coming from--
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.200]   If none of the attacks are coming from--
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.200]   If none of the attacks are coming from--
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.200]   If none of the attacks are coming from--
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.200]   If none of the attacks are coming from--
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.200]   If none of the attacks are coming from--
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.200]   If none of the attacks are coming from--

[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:53.200]   If none of the attacks are coming from--

[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.200]   If a carrier moved to RCS away from SMS,
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.200]   which I bet they would like to do,
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.200]   they'd have to support it.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.200]   It's data, it's data not--
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.200]   SMS is a weird technology.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.200]   It's not data technology.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:33.200]   So I'm all for this one.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.200]   I think this is a really good idea,
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.200]   but we'll see.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.200]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.200]   You got this big Apple.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:46.200]   Right now Android users are at a disadvantage
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.200]   when they communicate with Apple users.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:52.200]   Apple users can create a group that Android people can't be in.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.200]   Right.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.200]   You're a green box instead of a blue box.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.200]   My message is great.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.200]   Yes, unless you're on Apple.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.200]   Right.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.200]   So I like this idea.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.200]   I think this is something Google and the operators are probably
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.200]   going to do.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.200]   We'll see.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:15.200]   We should mention just very quickly that we should
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.200]   say that digital news initiative in Europe,
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:23.200]   Google gave away 27 million euros in grants to tons of publishers
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.200]   and independent people to do innovation only in Europe,
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.200]   again only in Europe, because they're trouble--
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.200]   they're problem children, but they're trying to do so.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:36.200]   And Sundar Pachai gave a big speech in Paris today,
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:40.200]   pushing AMP and the digital news initiative and Project Shield,
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:44.200]   emphasizing how much they care about news and care about journalism
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:48.200]   and Sundar saluted that flag ably.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.200]   And in a completely unrelated story,
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.200]   a German court rejected a suit by publishers against Google.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.200]   I missed this Friday.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.200]   If I'd seen this, I would have been tweeting all over it.
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.200]   It's kind of beautiful, because they said,
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.200]   "I love this part that, well, Google linking to people
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.200]   is a win-win."
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.200]   Imagine that.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.200]   This is the Axl Springer suit.
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.200]   Yep.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:11.200]   I don't know where this sits in with the panoply of suits
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.200]   that have been going on many.
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.200]   Right.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.200]   But I find it absolutely fascinating.
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.200]   Related ruling on whether publishers should receive payments
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.200]   from Google for displaying their news articles
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.200]   and still outstanding.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.200]   So I don't know where-- again, I'm not sure where this one fits in.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.200]   Nonetheless, the judge said, "Are you in fools?
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.200]   Are you in the end?
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.200]   Are you crazy?"
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.200]   Gee, that's so--
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.200]   Did you see it's that root?
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.200]   Makes such sense.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.200]   Spotted-- I don't know if this is a big story or not.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:43.200]   Spotify chose Google's cloud over Amazon Web Services.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:48.200]   All of Spotify is now on Google servers, which--
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.200]   I don't know.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:51.200]   Maybe this is the beginning of an acquisition,
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.200]   although why Google would buy Spotify, I guess,
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.200]   for the customers, right?
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.200]   They're the biggest.
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.200]   Google Play.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.200]   I mean, compared to them over in Google Play music.
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:06.200]   Where was it before?
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.200]   I saw--
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.200]   It was on Amazon.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.200]   It was all on Amazon Web Services.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.200]   Well, that's right.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.200]   So it's a big-- it's a big win.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:18.200]   Google is number three behind Amazon, Microsoft, Azure.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.200]   Not sure why they did it.
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:23.200]   One of the Spotify Vice President, Nicholas Hartos,
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:26.200]   said, "Google's ability to analyze massive amounts of data
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.200]   tipped the scales.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.200]   They like the analytics."
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.200]   Ooh.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.200]   That's a good idea.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:35.200]   Google's ability to analyze massive amounts of data tipped the scales.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.200]   Ooh.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.200]   That's where Google has the edge.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.200]   That's where we think they will continue to have the edge,
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.200]   Mr. Hartos said, according to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.200]   It's funny.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:50.200]   It almost felt like Google had given up on cloud services.
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:53.200]   No, I think it had been quietly persuaded.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:58.200]   Also, we negotiated hard on price, said Mr. Hartos.
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.200]   Mr. Hartos.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.200]   It's free.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:04.200]   What have they also-- where did I put this?
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.200]   Oh, I put it in the number, but I don't care.
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.200]   It's the first one.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:13.200]   Google's calling on drive manufacturers to rethink the three and
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.200]   a half inch drive that's used for the cloud.
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.200]   And it's not really--
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.200]   That's going to be more efficient.
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.200]   They buy more drives probably than anybody.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.200]   Well, Amazon, God knows probably--
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.200]   Google does buy more than anybody.
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.200]   It'd be interesting.
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.200]   So what do they want?
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.200]   They want to go forward.
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:30.200]   Well, if the story is-- if they're three and a half inch,
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:33.200]   they want higher stacks so they're more efficient.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.200]   More drives.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:38.200]   Where was it here?
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.200]   They can move-- they're big enough they could probably move
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:43.200]   the market a little bit.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:46.200]   Google proposes taller drives than the standard one inch for
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.200]   three and a half disks and 15 millimeters for two and a half
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.200]   inch drives.
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.200]   Taller drives allow more platters per disk, which adds
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:57.200]   capacity and amortizes the cost of packaging to print a circuit
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:00.200]   board and the driver motor actuator.
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:03.200]   Given a fixed total capacity per disk, smaller disks can yield
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:07.200]   smaller seek distances and higher RPM due to platter stability
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:13.200]   and thus higher IOPS, but worse gigabytes per dollar.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.200]   So there's a standard form factor because you've got to fit
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.200]   them into your cases and your server racks.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.200]   And if Google says, "We don't like that size."
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.200]   Make them make of this size.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.200]   They probably buy enough drives they could move the market.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:31.200]   You think that'd be weird because then everybody else would
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.200]   have to redesign their enclosures.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.200]   Well, it's interesting if you go to the Clayton Christensen
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.200]   world, you know, it was all-- it was about-- the disruption was
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.200]   all about disk drive sizes and disk drive types.
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:47.200]   And I was thinking about it as I saw this because consumers don't
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.200]   use disk drives anymore.
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:53.200]   We are unaware of changes in the disk drive industry.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.200]   Really?
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.200]   We use an SSD.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.200]   We buy one drive every few years, right?
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.200]   There's some changes though.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:04.200]   I mean, I showed you that Samsung Terabyte drive the size of
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:09.200]   a matchbook that I use that carry around in my purse.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.200]   And then now that that was--
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.200]   [laughter]
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:16.200]   See, a man purse is so different from a female purse.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.200]   But they don't have a terabyte of them.
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.200]   They don't have terabytes in their purse.
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:22.200]   They got lipstick and things.
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:26.200]   Now they're going to do-- they just released-- that was the T1,
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.200]   the Samsung T1.
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.200]   They've just released the Samsung T3.
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.200]   It's two terabytes, same size.
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.200]   Well, the problem is I'll lose that.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.200]   I bought a big thumb drive.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:37.200]   And I lost the damn thing.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.200]   Keep on losing them.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.200]   And now that I've got one that's a--
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.200]   Oh, that's a lot of--
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.200]   It's a lot of--
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.200]   A USB-A versus C.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:45.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.200]   And since--
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.200]   Because well, I can do both, which is nice.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:49.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.200]   But it's so tiny.
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.200]   They're tiny.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.200]   And it doesn't have a clip on it.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:53.200]   Use encryption.
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.200]   I hope you use encryption.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.200]   I've got nothing of note on it.
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:56.200]   Oh, okay.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.200]   For--
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.200]   I believe me.
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.200]   Samsung's ships with encryption built in, and I made sure to keep--
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.200]   I would-- first I took it off, and I thought,
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.200]   "What am I doing?"
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:05.200]   That's my whole life on that thing.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.200]   I want to-- I want you to have a good night's sleep,
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.200]   so I'm not going to show you the nightmare-inducing video
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.200]   of the robot yet.
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.200]   First, I'm going to tell you about a mattress.
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:16.200]   Then.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:17.200]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:19.200]   This is why they pay him.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.200]   You want to get a good night's sleep before you see this,
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.200]   because you will not be sleeping for some days.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.200]   You also might want to go to the mattresses
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.200]   against the robot army.
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:30.200]   Our show today brought to you by Casper,
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.200]   the best mattresses ever.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.200]   We're going to the mattresses.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:36.200]   I love that line in the Godfather.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:39.200]   I don't think the Godfather's mattresses were this good.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:43.200]   I wonder how these mattresses do against the shotgun blasts.
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.200]   You know what I mean?
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:47.200]   It's great, because they could have gotten them in those compact boxes.
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.200]   Yes.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.200]   They wouldn't have to haul them on big trucks.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.200]   It's so much easier to go to the mattresses.
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.200]   The mattress comes-- they deliver it to you in that box.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:58.200]   That's a queen-sized mattress in a box that's the size of my lower torso.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.200]   I don't know.
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.200]   I can't think of what that is.
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.200]   That size is right there.
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.200]   Free delivery.
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.200]   Here's the best part.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.200]   Paying this 100-day returns.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.200]   If any time within the first 100 nights you decide,
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.200]   "This isn't for me.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.200]   They come and they get it.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:17.200]   They return you every penny because they want you to be happy."
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.200]   They don't have a showroom.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.200]   You're saving a lot of money.
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.200]   You're shipping direct to you.
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:26.200]   They know you want some way to try it, but I like the idea of having 100 days to decide.
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.200]   These are beautiful mattresses.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.200]   It's just the right sink and bounce.
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.200]   They're firm but soft.
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.200]   I don't know how they do it.
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:34.200]   They're cool.
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:37.200]   Summer's coming soon, I hope.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:40.200]   Those hot nights, you're going to be glad you have a Casper mattress.
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:42.200]   They breathe.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:47.200]   They do some sort of open cell thing that really is nice.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:52.200]   They also, they smell great right out of the box, which is, I don't know if that matters to you,
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.200]   but it matters to me.
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.200]   I love my Casper.
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.200]   And many people do.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.200]   You should try it.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.200]   Also, check out Casper's pillows.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.200]   I'm using Casper pillows now too.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.200]   I'm all Casper, baby.
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.200]   I'm all in on the Casper.
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:10.200]   They have a dual layer pillow that is literally the most comfortable pill.
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:11.200]   It's big.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:13.200]   Well, I guess maybe I got the king.
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.200]   They have other sizes because it is really.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.200]   That's like a body pillow.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.200]   I've got to get one of those.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.200]   I want to marry this pillow.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.200]   This is the pillow is, they do have a standard size.
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.200]   This pillow is awesome.
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:27.200]   And I used to think I had to have a feather pillow.
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.200]   This is not.
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.200]   And it's much better than my feather pillows.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:32.200]   It's also much more consistent.
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.200]   The feather pillows get lumpy.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:34.200]   This is nice.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:38.200]   Casper's mattress is made in the USA, so you feel good about that.
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:40.200]   You're buying direct from the factory.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:41.200]   They're nice guys.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.200]   And you're going to save too.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:46.200]   In fact, you're going to save an additional 50 bucks because you're listening to the show.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.200]   Go to Casper.com/twig.

[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:11.200]   All right.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.200]   You ready for a scary robot video?
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.200]   This is from Boston Dynamics, the company Google bought.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.200]   They made that scary dog.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.200]   Remember the dog?
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:23.200]   But those dogs were like diesel engines.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.200]   And they were kind of noisy.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:28.200]   Marine Corps turned them down because they said they're way too loud.
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:31.200]   No way we're sneaking into some village.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.200]   This robot is electric.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:36.200]   All it sounds like is untethered.
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.200]   And untethered?
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.200]   There are no strings on me according to ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:42.200]   I give you what's his name?
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.200]   We're going to name him?
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.200]   Atlas.
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.200]   Atlas, the Boston Dynamics robot.
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.200]   He's walking.
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.200]   He's bipedal.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.200]   Now you might say that's a lot of work to go to.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:54.200]   I mean, you could just put it on wheels, but they want robots that are like human.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:20:00.200]   For since the Fukushima nuclear plant, humans had to go in there.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:03.200]   And notice the robot has a cod piece.
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.200]   That's not a cod piece.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.200]   That's a European carry-off.
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:09.200]   Look at that.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.200]   He's stumbling.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.200]   He's stumbling, but no.
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:12.200]   This is snow.
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:17.200]   He's walking through snow and the snow is even, but underneath the snow, there's uneven ground.
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:20.200]   And so he stumbles and recovers.
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.200]   He's a little drunk.
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:22.200]   He's had a few.
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:23.200]   Go home, robot.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.200]   You're drunk.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.200]   But, I mean, okay.
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:30.200]   Pretty impressive, but imagine that coming at you.
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.200]   Inextrably.
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.200]   He's walking next to a fella.
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:36.200]   You can see it's a kind of normal human size.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.200]   It's got arms and legs.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:38.200]   They're having a talk.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.200]   They're going to say, "Look, we're going to be abusing you."
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:46.200]   Siri is lifting boxes, putting them on the shelves, doing a pretty good job too.
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.200]   So he could work in a warehouse.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.200]   Again, warehouses are designed for humans.
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:50.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.200]   So a human robot makes sense in some situations.
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.200]   Not all.
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.200]   Look at that.
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:58.200]   Now, okay, fine.
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:02.200]   You could put a box on a shelf if you just pick it up and put it on a shelf.
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:06.200]   But what if we take the box and somebody with a hock, I'm schmuck with a hockey stick,
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:09.200]   knocks it out of your hands and then pushes you back.
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.200]   That was mean.
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:11.200]   Don't anger the robot.
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.200]   He's been marked for deletion.
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.200]   Look, he's got the hockey stick.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.200]   He's sliding the box along.
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:17.200]   He's clearly Canadian.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:19.200]   Why a hockey stick?
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.200]   Oh, Canadians be too nice to do that.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:22.200]   That's Boston.
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.200]   He's a Celtics fan or a Bruins fan.
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.200]   So here's the question.
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:32.200]   By the way, notice the QR codes, the robot readable codes on these boxes.
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:35.200]   And you'll see too when it uses the door, there's codes there.
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.200]   They have some sort of vision.
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.200]   This is so mean.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.200]   He keeps moving it away from the robot.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:42.200]   Yeah, the hockey guy is trolling him hard by pushing it away.
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.200]   No, no, wait!
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:44.200]   Don't do that.
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.200]   Oh, he knocked him over.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.200]   That's just not nice.
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.200]   He knocked him on his face.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:50.200]   He did a face plan on the concrete.
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.200]   And then the robot does what I think is reasonable.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.200]   Make sure you play it all the way to the end, please, Jason.
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.200]   He leaps to the top.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.200]   He gets up and he's like, "You know what?
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.200]   I'm just going to keep on going."
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.200]   I'm leaving.
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:03.200]   I'm out of here.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.200]   He's opening a door.
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.200]   I'd leave too.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.200]   The thing is, okay, just...
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.200]   Do you feel like the guy who knocked him over?
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:13.200]   Just a little tiny part in the back of his mind is thinking,
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.200]   "I hope he doesn't get mad at me."
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.200]   Right.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.200]   Right.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.200]   There's going to be payback.
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.200]   The robots never forget.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:22.200]   And when Skynet happens, he's going to come back with his friends.
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:26.200]   I even think he's just thinking, like, "I know I wrote the software.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.200]   I know this thing isn't going to get mad.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.200]   It's just a program.
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.200]   It's just a bot.
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.200]   It's just a machine."
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.200]   But maybe not.
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.200]   Maybe, like, because it could crush him.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.200]   Really?
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.200]   Like, you could just go wham.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.200]   And you...
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:43.200]   Jason, can you pull up the new trailer for the new season of Silicon Valley, HBO, Silicon Valley?
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.200]   Oh, is it back?
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:47.200]   Yeah, there's actually an atlas reference in there.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:52.200]   There's actually a scene where Erlich kicks the big dog.
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.200]   Really?
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.200]   Yeah.
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:55.200]   There is.
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.200]   All right, I'm going to have to finish.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:57.200]   I can search too.
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.200]   You look for the...
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.200]   I'll show you this.
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:03.200]   Apparently, there's been a Twitter account set up by the atlas robot.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.200]   Big dog has told me what you've done.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.200]   Yes.
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.200]   Where...
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.200]   Ah!
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:12.200]   Using my OCR to read your ID, I am close to getting your name.
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:21.200]   The Boston Dynamics/Google is really good at this recovery system where they knock them over,
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.200]   they kick them, they put them on the...
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.200]   It's hard to do for bifurial.
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.200]   It's very hard to do.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:29.200]   I mean, and you understand why they're doing it because there are places that you need.
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.200]   So here's Silicon Valley that you need to humans in there.
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.200]   This is coming back.
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:34.200]   This is the best show for people we're into.
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.200]   I'm lying.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.200]   For people we're into technology.
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.200]   It was all in jokes written by people.
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:41.200]   Right.
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.200]   Like the...
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.200]   You have been triliquist dummy.
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.200]   If I'm lying, you look like...
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:48.200]   I want to be CEO of Pied Piper.
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.200]   This is the only one.
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:51.200]   I want my kicks the dog.
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.200]   I want this company.
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.200]   He kicks the robot dog.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.200]   I deserve it.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.200]   It's my top off.
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:56.200]   It's my idea around.
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:57.200]   There's on it.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.200]   So...
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.200]   What do you say to that?
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:01.200]   Action.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:02.200]   Oh!
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:03.200]   Oh!
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:05.200]   You were standing against the top!
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.200]   What were you saying?
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.200]   Did you do it?
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.200]   That's comedy, my friends.
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:09.200]   Google.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:10.200]   That is comedy.
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.200]   This is show Jeff.
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:12.200]   Are you a fan?
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.200]   I'm just behind.
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.200]   It's one of those cases where I got behind.
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.200]   And then I...
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.200]   So yeah, I have been, but I've got to catch up before it starts again.
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:19.200]   Yeah.
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:20.200]   Well, it's not hard.
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.200]   It's only half enough.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:22.200]   Yeah, I know.
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.200]   I've got someone to catch up on.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.200]   And it's only a giant episode to eat.
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:26.200]   Yeah, it's really not much content compared to...
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.200]   We're watching Fortitude now.
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:30.200]   Have you watched Billions yet?
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.200]   Same thing.
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:35.200]   The problem is, because I travel, the things that I can download...
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.200]   No.
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.200]   ...will play...
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:38.200]   Right.
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:39.200]   Billions.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:41.200]   I've got Fort Billions and iTunes because I want to wait.
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:42.200]   But you still have to wait.
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.200]   Yeah.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:45.200]   I hate watching a show when it's still on.
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.200]   I hate that.
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:48.200]   Because then I can't binge it.
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:49.200]   Have you seen Scorpion?
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:50.200]   No.
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:53.200]   It's a dumb show about smart people.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.200]   I thought that was called Big Bang Theory.
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:58.200]   Well, I learned something interesting about this show.
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:24:59.200]   Hey!
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:00.200]   Hey!
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:05.200]   So what this show is about is about a guy named Walter O'Brien, who's IQ is 197.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.200]   He's like, "You Leo."
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.200]   He's got this enormous intellect.
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:11.200]   And so he forms together this team of genius...
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.200]   They have only 187.
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.200]   Oh, you know.
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:14.200]   Who's counting?
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.200]   Give or take 10.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.200]   He puts together this team of geniuses and they help...
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.200]   Oh, yeah, I've seen the trailers.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.200]   Yeah, okay.
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.200]   So here's what's interesting about it.
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.200]   Walter O'Brien's a real person.
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.200]   Scorpion is a real thing.
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.200]   What?
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:24.200]   They've existed for 25 years.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.200]   Doing what?
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.200]   They are geniuses for hire.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.200]   There are 2,500 of them now.
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:33.200]   They outsource this and they hire these super high IQ people.
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:37.200]   So if you need anything done that requires the work of geniuses,
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.200]   they'll say, "Okay, $5,000.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.200]   We'll do it."
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.200]   What?
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.200]   They do all kinds of crazy stuff.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.200]   Now here's the craziest part about it.
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.200]   Where did the show come from?
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:50.200]   They expanded so much that they were having trouble hiring more geniuses.
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:51.200]   They couldn't find their team.
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:52.200]   Yeah, well, there's a limit.
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:56.200]   So they have this process for figuring out how to solve problems.
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:59.200]   They applied that process to the problem of how to get more geniuses,
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.200]   and the solution was the TV show.
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.200]   So they went to Hollywood and they said, "Okay, we want to do this."
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.200]   It's all about hiring.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:08.200]   The TV show exists to help them hire.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.200]   No.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:10.200]   Yes.
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:11.200]   So Walter O'Brien was a hacker.
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.200]   Scorpion was his hacker.
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.200]   And in fact, I think you should have Walter O'Brien on triangulation.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.200]   I will, because he probably wants to hire some people.
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.200]   We have smart people watching this show.
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.200]   Absolutely.
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:21.200]   He would, I'm sure that's why he did on it.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.200]   Get on it.
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.200]   So smart people can ask you a question.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:25.200]   Otherwise I'm hiring a scorpion.
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:26.200]   Yes.
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:29.200]   They use an ethernet cable to connect a jet to a Corvette.
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:31.200]   No, there's no port on a Corvette.
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:32.200]   It's a dumb show.
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:33.200]   No, no, no, they do.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.200]   They did this.
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.200]   They do it on a Mercedes-Benz.
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:38.200]   They use an ethernet cable to connect a jet to a Mercedes-Benz.
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:41.200]   They use an ethernet cable to connect a jet to a Mercedes-Benz.
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.200]   They use an ethernet cable to connect a jet to a Mercedes-Benz.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.200]   They use an ethernet cable to connect a jet to a Mercedes-Benz.
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:48.200]   They use an ethernet cable to connect a jet to a Mercedes-Benz.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.200]   They use an ethernet cable to connect a jet to a Mercedes-Benz.
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:53.200]   They use an ethernet cable to connect a jet to a Mercedes-Benz.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.200]   They use an ethernet cable to connect a Mercedes-Benz.
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:57.200]   They use an ethernet cable to connect a Mercedes-Benz.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.200]   They use an ethernet cable to connect a Mercedes-Benz.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.200]   They use an ethernet cable to connect a Mercedes-Benz.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.200]   They use an ethernet cable to connect a Mercedes-Benz.
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:05.200]   Genius.
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.200]   So, you got a question?
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.200]   Yeah, I'm sorry, yes.
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:11.200]   Oh, man, sick guys.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:15.200]   So, as you know, my Pixel C died.
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.200]   Yes, horrible death.
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:17.200]   I have a new one.
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.200]   It's wonderful thing.
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:19.200]   Now, you made me nervous.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.200]   Like, every time I turn on my Pixel C and it doesn't start.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:22.200]   I know.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.200]   Oh, no, it really went over completely over the edge.
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.200]   Can't start.
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.200]   So, then, here's the other problem.
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:30.920]   So, then, I tried to use my phone and I went out of town with my new Pixel C and I tried
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:36.600]   to download movies for the plane onto my phone and said, "Oh, five devices.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:41.640]   How do I find any place where I can tell Google to ignore the old device, which I couldn't
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.200]   clear because it died?"
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:45.200]   I don't like that.
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.200]   Anybody know how to do that?
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:49.200]   Yeah, you have to constantly Google and get on a white list.
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.200]   Oh, no.
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:51.200]   It's really annoying.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:55.200]   So, you have to do that every time you buy 87 Android things.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:00.200]   Well, so, I was able to get some, but I complained about it.
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:04.680]   And because I think you have to wait like only you can only, there's a period, you have
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:05.880]   to, there's a waiting period.
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:07.240]   And this, by the way, is in Google's fault.
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.120]   This is the music industry.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:12.640]   They do all of this shenanigans to keep you because they don't, they have some notion
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:19.400]   that you're going to give it to your friends and let them use it for a day and then deauthorize
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.760]   them and use it again yourself or something.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.200]   I don't know what they're thinking.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.200]   I have devices to find devices.
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.800]   If I want to deauthorize every day, I should be able to.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.800]   Yeah.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:28.800]   But that's not--
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.800]   But I don't even see any place to deauthorize at all.
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:33.080]   Yeah, you have to go online.
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.080]   But you know, and there's--
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:35.200]   Oh, I should try that.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.200]   You can.
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.200]   You can manage devices.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:38.200]   Just Google--
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.200]   I have to find it.
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:44.720]   Google managed devices.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:47.960]   But the problem is that there's limits on how you can do it.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:51.120]   It's maybe Android device manager.
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:53.120]   No, that's not it.
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.120]   There's a way to do it.
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.120]   I'll find it for you after the show.
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:57.880]   But I was complaining about this.
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:03.120]   And somebody from Google sent me a note saying, "Yeah, you'd use a lot of devices.
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.280]   We can whitelist you."
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:08.360]   So I have-- you can ask them to get like on the specialist.
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:11.640]   That's not a solution for the rest of the world.
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:12.880]   But we're an unusual situation.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.200]   I'm an unusual situation.
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.200]   I use it.
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.200]   I've got a new phone every few weeks.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.200]   Manage devices is the Android thing where you can handle--
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.200]   No, my device is.
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.960]   It's Google.com.
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:26.480]   No, that's not it.
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:28.160]   I don't know.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.640]   I don't know.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.640]   Yeah, that's the Android device manager.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:32.640]   You want--
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:33.640]   Yeah, accounts.google.com.
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:34.640]   Is it?
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:39.000]   Or does that get you into the device manager?
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.880]   Problem is that all I'll stop talking about this is nobody that rush the world cares about
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:44.880]   this.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.120]   But everything I got was for Google Music, not for Google Play.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:48.640]   Oh, here it is.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:52.840]   Go to-- open your web browser, navigate to the Google Play Store, click the gear button
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:56.120]   in the top right corner of the screen select Settings.
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:57.120]   Right.
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:59.880]   Now that's from the store, never mind.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.560]   Nope, right.
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:04.040]   How to deauthorize Google Play Music Devices.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.040]   That's what we want, right?
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.040]   The music.
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:07.040]   I don't want music.
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:08.040]   No, I don't want music.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.040]   I want Google Play.
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:10.040]   It's different.
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.040]   Oh.
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.040]   Yeah, because you have Google Play Music on 10 different devices.
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:13.040]   Right.
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.040]   I've got shows.
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.040]   You want shows.
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:16.040]   Oh, it shows.
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:17.040]   Play.
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:21.120]   And that's where I cannot find it anywhere.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.840]   By the only guy who uses Google Play that much.
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:24.840]   Yes.
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:25.840]   It's never been up before.
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:27.440]   You're at Jarvis.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:28.440]   Wow.
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:29.920]   Google schmuck you.
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:31.200]   I'm sure somebody will get ahold of you.
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.200]   I thought you were talking about music.
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.800]   You're talking about TV.
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:34.800]   TV?
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:41.160]   The other problem was I had-- I'm watching Fortitude, which is really amazingly weird.
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:42.160]   Arctic.
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:43.840]   I love Arctic things.
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:46.480]   And I had some episodes on Amazon on there.
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:49.360]   Once they're downloaded on one device, you cannot download on another device.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.360]   Hello, Amazon there.
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:51.360]   It's dead down.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:52.360]   Sorry, man.
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.360]   You're right.
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.200]   It's not their fault.
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:56.680]   It's these stupid Hollywood.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:57.680]   It's Hollywood.
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:05.520]   So a lot of new devices at Mobile World Congress.
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:07.520]   Robert Ballester is there doing our coverage.
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:10.560]   You can watch live feeds all day, every day.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:15.120]   We've got the specials online at twit.tv/specials.
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:19.320]   Let's start with the first device, I think, announced, which was the LG G5 phone.
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:22.240]   I'm sure that they talked about-- in fact, I know they talked about this and all about
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:24.800]   Android yesterday, all the phones.
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:28.600]   The G5's-- G4 was a very popular phone with an excellent camera.
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.840]   Apparently, they've done something kind of interesting.
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:35.080]   They've got-- these phones are now modular, which means you can do the hand jive even
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:37.400]   better.
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:38.920]   The bottom snaps off.
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:39.920]   There's a button.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:44.440]   So you can swap batteries, but you can also swap what you put in there.
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:50.080]   So there's a camera cartridge that gives you a big battery, 4,000 milliamp power battery,
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:54.360]   and a dedicated camera button and a dedicated zoom.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:57.200]   Although I think it's still optical or a digital zoom.
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:58.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:31:59.200]   So big deal.
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.200]   Yeah, sure.
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:07.680]   There's also a high-fi module that they did with B&O that gives you high-res music playback.
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:12.000]   Now you actually get a headphone jack unless you have that module in.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000]   Is that correct?
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000]   Are you kidding?
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000]   I hear that part.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.480]   Don't quote me on that until we can--
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.480]   That would be weird.
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:22.320]   They also have two cameras on the back, one with kind of a normal 78-degree angle, one
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:28.440]   with a 135-degree angle, which means you get very wide.
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:29.440]   That's kind of nice.
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:32.520]   I mean, one of the issues really-- the only issue, I think, with using a camera phone,
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.800]   the cameras have gotten so good, is zoom.
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:36.800]   Right?
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:41.440]   Is the ability to zoom in, and then there's, for unaccountably, a woman with a beard.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.000]   I think that's the cool thing about the wheel.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.840]   The zoom wheel is, instead of tapping the screen to zoom in, you could just scroll that wheel
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:47.840]   to zoom in.
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:50.480]   Yeah, but it's digital zoom, which means all you're doing is blowing up the pixels.
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.640]   Right, but it's a smooth-- when you have that many pixels out.
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:53.640]   It's smoother.
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:54.640]   Yeah, it's a high--
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:55.640]   This is problematic.
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:33:00.520]   I mean, essentially, conceptually what they're doing is they have a module to improve photography.
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:01.520]   Right.
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:03.000]   But photography is already so great.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000]   That's good.
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000]   How many people are going to--
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000]   Yeah.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000]   You know, how much better is it?
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000]   Well, it's bulky, and it's a big bump.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.040]   The other thing both Samsung with its new galaxies and the LG with the G5 for doing is
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:16.720]   an always on display, which I like.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:21.920]   These new OLED displays are so efficient that they can keep time or a calendar or something
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:26.000]   always on the screen at all times, not when you tap it or wave your hand over it, but
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000]   at all times.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.960]   LG says it only reduces battery life by .8% an hour.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:32.240]   So that's a great feature.
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.840]   I'm looking forward to seeing that.
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:37.560]   Samsung had-- Oh, LG announced one other thing we should probably mention, which is
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:45.040]   it's VR, finally has its own VR solution, which looks like those goggles, the steampunk
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.040]   goggles.
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:47.040]   Opera glasses.
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:51.880]   And they have a-- the steampunk goggles have their own screen, so you use the type C cable
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.320]   to connect the phone.
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:54.820]   Yeah.
[01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:55.820]   And that way, they're lighter.
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:57.680]   They're a little easier to wear.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:59.880]   Do you not like the looks of them?
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:00.880]   I mean, I think--
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:01.880]   No, they look great.
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:02.880]   I think they look really good.
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:03.880]   I think they're better than the visor.
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:04.880]   Right.
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:05.880]   Is there a picture?
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.320]   Let me see if I can find one.
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:12.760]   They've also announced a 360-degree camera that looks a lot, frankly, like the Ricoh Theta
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:15.200]   S. Everybody's doing this now.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.200]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:21.560]   Here's a picture of the 360 VR visor.
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:25.000]   You look more like data from Star Trek than you look like--
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000]   Was it a lot lighter?
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000]   Boston MX robots.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000]   Yeah, it's a lot lighter.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.800]   I think that's a good idea.
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:40.280]   Well, then all comes Samsung, and they announce, of course, the Galaxy S7 and the S7 Edge 5.1
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:43.440]   and 5.5 inches respectively.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.520]   Looks like an amazing camera on these new phones.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:48.840]   So F1.7, which is very fast.
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:55.040]   They reduced the number of pixels from 16 to 12 number of megapixels.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:59.480]   And they say that's so we can give you bigger megapixels, so that plus the high F stop
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:04.080]   mean much better low light performance, much better focusing too because every pixel of
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:06.840]   the 12 is able to do phase detection.
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:10.200]   So apparently the focusing is very quick.
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:14.000]   So a good low light camera that can focus fast, that's good optical image, just stabilization
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.080]   is available.
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:18.800]   So these are-- this is two really excellent phones.
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:22.080]   These two were kind of the best phones of last-- best Android phones of last year, so
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:23.400]   I'll be looking forward to it.
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:27.560]   I got though the new Robin, and I'll talk about that as my pick of the week in just
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:29.120]   a little bit.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:33.520]   Also Samsung announced a 360 degree camera.
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:36.160]   They didn't announce pricing, but theirs looks pretty good.
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:38.160]   It's two lenses.
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:39.160]   Why not?
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:41.160]   More to use for tripods and stuff than carrying around those.
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:42.160]   But that's better.
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.160]   You don't want your hand.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:47.480]   I realize with the Theta, your hand is not-- you shouldn't have it in the picture.
[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.320]   You want to put that on a tripod.
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:53.160]   You can't hold the tripod or monopod on it.
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:56.920]   And conceptually, it's similar to the Rico Theta with two lenses and stuff.
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:57.920]   Same idea.
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:59.920]   You can ditch together in real time.
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:02.320]   I'd love to see that built into a smartphone.
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.320]   I would buy that smartphone.
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:07.560]   Well, what they pitched was interesting is it does-- if you have a Samsung Galaxy, I
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:09.680]   presume S7, but I don't know.
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:13.520]   If you have a Samsung Galaxy, you can link it to that.
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.120]   And then the Galaxy in real time will see it.
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:22.240]   In fact, you could put the Galaxy in the VR headset and watch in-- it looked like real
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:27.360]   time as your friends are streaming 360 degree video of their visit to Barcelona.
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:30.160]   You could be at home looking around, looking up, looking down.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:32.120]   If that's the case, I'm buying that right away.
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:36.240]   You could mount it to your helmet and then you could see as you're walking around through
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.240]   the goggles.
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:38.240]   Could that be awesome?
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:41.000]   Yeah, you could see the sidewalk and then I don't even need to use my eyes, exactly.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.520]   You never have to take off the goggles.
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:44.600]   You never have to take off the goggles, Jason.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:45.920]   To heck with reality.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:48.800]   Go virtual reality.
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:52.160]   Also the SD card is back, baby, which is nice.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:56.280]   That was something Samsung got last year, much to people's dismay.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:01.080]   They have 32 gigs in the US, so you can need the SD card of storage.
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:04.920]   And then they also brought back waterproof or water resistant IP68.
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:05.920]   Bigger battery too.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.760]   Nice sized battery on the S1.
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:08.760]   Nice sized battery on the S1.
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:09.760]   I don't know.
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:12.080]   I think it's a great feature.
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.080]   You like it.
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:14.080]   I love it.
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:15.080]   You love the phone in the toilet a lot.
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:16.080]   What is going on?
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.680]   Well, if it goes in the toilet, we're going to have to figure out what to do.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:20.360]   No, but I just think that it's a great feature.
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:21.360]   Like, you know--
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:22.360]   You could wash it off.
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:25.800]   It's easy enough, it seems, for these companies to make things--
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:26.800]   Waterproof.
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.560]   Water can be fatal to a phone.
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:35.720]   It's just a nice-- there's a lot of reasons why you can get water on your phone.
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:38.680]   You can drop it into the whatever.
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:41.000]   So into the ocean.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.320]   So I like that feature.
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:45.320]   I just think all phones ought to be waterproof.
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:48.040]   Google+ was updated.
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.440]   Google+ is also waterproof.
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:51.440]   Okay.
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:57.080]   The parade of celebrities quitting Twitter is growing longer by one.
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.080]   Stephen Fry quit last week.
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:00.080]   Adam Baldwin.
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.680]   I don't even know who that is.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:08.000]   Is quitting for good because Twitter is censoring conservatives.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.960]   He is in the TNT hit show.
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:10.960]   It says so right here.
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:13.800]   The last ship.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:20.120]   And he's got a very muscular, manly kind of conservative body.
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:29.400]   I think it has to be said that Stephen Fry's farewell note to Twitter was really hilarious.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:32.080]   Of course, everything Stephen Fry does is hilarious.
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:34.680]   The headline was, "Too many people have peed in the pool."
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:35.680]   And he goes on from there.
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:36.680]   I don't blame him.
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:40.480]   But I, for one, despite wanting to quit Twitter-- I was, by the way, I just want to point out
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.480]   I was the first person to quit Twitter.
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:45.400]   A lot of quit Twitter more often than anybody else.
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:46.960]   Maybe, but I quit in 2007.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:49.960]   I don't think anybody quit sooner than that.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:54.440]   But, you know, at this point, you just-- Twitter is what Twitter is.
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:55.880]   I still love it.
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:56.880]   I can't believe you.
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:57.880]   I'm wearing my Twitter patch.
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:58.880]   I'm trying to be invisible.
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:00.600]   Are you wearing a patch?
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:01.600]   That might help.
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:02.600]   You know?
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:04.320]   It is because that's how you know what's going on.
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:05.320]   Right?
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:07.320]   You just go to Twitter.
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:10.760]   I keep TweetDeck running on one screen in my desk all day.
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:13.600]   But I don't know how people live with one account.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.760]   I have one account for incoming and one account for outgoing, essentially.
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.240]   You wrote an article on that.
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:23.360]   Highly recommended it at the time and I recommend people still read it.
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:24.600]   It was a data machine.
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:25.600]   Where did you write that for?
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:26.600]   I don't recommend it.
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:27.600]   It was an unusual magazine.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.000]   It wasn't anybody regulars.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.000]   But just Google might get out there in multiple Twitter.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.880]   That one was actually crazier than the-- that one required three Twitter accounts.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:38.880]   So basically--
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:39.880]   Right.
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:40.880]   Or you've narrowed it down.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:41.880]   Right.
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:44.840]   So I have a Twitter account where I put content that isn't on Twitter and turn it into Twitter
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:45.840]   content.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:49.120]   So I've subscribed to that feed so it shows up in my Twitter account.
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:54.920]   So for example, there are multiple ways to turn Google alerts into tweets.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:56.480]   So for baseline magazine.
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.560]   Baseline magazine, that's what it was.
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:01.840]   How you know what you need to know all the time.
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:05.920]   And so this is the technique that I use and it's really fantastic.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:10.840]   You can take Reddit content and turn it into RSS feed and take the RSS feed and turn it
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:12.280]   into a Twitter feed.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:15.640]   And then you have-- it's convoluted.
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:17.720]   If I read this article, would I know how?
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:18.720]   Yes.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:19.960]   It's specific step by step on how to do that.
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:22.520]   But the end result is one feed.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:23.520]   One Twitter feed.
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:27.600]   And of course I'm using-- you can use TweetDeck or any number of other services to make
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:28.600]   it automatic.
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:31.520]   I wish Twitter would keep TweetDeck up to date and understand what they're doing.
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:33.480]   My feed has become a thing of beauty.
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:35.240]   Oh, and then you add Google alerts to it.
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:36.240]   Google alerts.
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:38.000]   You can add-- there's all kinds that like it.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:45.280]   You can use IFTTT to turn just about any RSS feed into--
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:48.080]   And so it's IFTTT and Zapier and then--
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:49.240]   And a bunch of other--
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:51.920]   Our very-- and Google alerts are all very useful ways to make your--
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:53.920]   But here's something people to try.
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.560]   I don't think a lot of people know how to do this.
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:59.040]   But go to your favorite Reddit, subreddit.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.040]   Right?
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:03.280]   And at the very end, make sure there's a forward slash.
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:05.440]   Put dot RSS at the end and that's an RSS feed.
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:06.440]   Nice.
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:07.440]   That's all you have to do.
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:10.520]   On RSS feed, you can do all kinds of magic stuff with that.
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:12.720]   And this is just one of those things you can do.
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:15.480]   Jeff, are you up for this?
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:16.480]   No.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:18.960]   He's complicated.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:21.960]   He's too busy quitting Twitter as we--
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:23.800]   No, I don't quit Twitter.
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:24.800]   I just want--
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:25.800]   I just want--
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:26.800]   I just want--
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:27.800]   You just come here, we'll do a little show.
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:28.800]   How many people have you blocked?
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:29.800]   You know.
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:30.800]   Oh, many.
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:31.800]   Well--
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:32.800]   No, actually, I stopped blocking.
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:33.800]   You know what I do now?
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:34.800]   Don't tell anybody this is my secret.
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:35.800]   I mute them.
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:36.800]   Right.
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:40.560]   Because they know if you blocked them, if you mute them, they just keep nattering on
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:41.560]   with that.
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:44.440]   Well, the knowledge that you blocked them is that--
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:45.440]   That's success.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.280]   That substitutes getting a rise out of you.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:48.280]   Right.
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:53.280]   So, muting is great because basically-- I mean, I can mute kind of liberally because
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:57.720]   I just go, well, I don't-- it's not necessarily even a negative.
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:58.920]   It's just, I don't want that in my feed.
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:01.920]   I'm trying to refine my feed to make it more useful.
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:02.920]   And it's very nice.
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:03.920]   I have a very nice feed.
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:08.520]   You could come to a new place with trolling and haters and in the case of Stephen Fry
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:11.840]   with politically crept mobs.
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:14.080]   That's his main beef.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:19.400]   Which is that it's so universal that there's literally nobody who has any sort of public
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.120]   presence on Twitter doesn't get--
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:22.120]   Lives in a world of--
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:23.720]   Serious out of a rash.
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:28.080]   And you see like, you know, celebrities reading mean tweets on Jimmy Kimmel like it is.
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:29.080]   Hell-arius.
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:33.840]   But the point is that it's just become a kind of background noise now.
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:39.640]   I don't-- you know, I think that to leave Twitter because of trolls or whatever, it doesn't matter.
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:40.880]   You know, there's still going to--
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:42.520]   There's still going to get away from it.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:43.440]   Although your name on Twitter--
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:44.440]   Let's face it.
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:45.440]   Twitter.
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:46.440]   Yeah, right.
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:47.440]   That's right.
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:48.440]   It's whether you're there.
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:51.120]   Something like Stephen-- everybody was mad about something Stephen Fry said on TV.
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.280]   Where are they going to say it on Twitter?
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:56.480]   So the people who are asking him about that don't even care that he's on Twitter.
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:57.480]   Yeah.
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:02.240]   So Margaret Sullivan, who we love as the public--
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:04.240]   What do they call her?
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:06.880]   The public editor here at New York Times.
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:12.040]   She's the one who when the New York Times screws up, which does fairly frequently, goes
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:14.720]   to the reporter and says, "What did you do?"
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:16.400]   And then writes about it.
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:20.920]   And it was, you know, it's kind of the old concept of an ombudsman.
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:23.560]   She just brought it to a whole new level.
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:24.560]   She did.
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:30.600]   And brought a tremendous intelligence to learning the lessons about journalism in broader ways.
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:37.760]   She also took the times to task for its anonymous sources and other things, but tremendous respect.
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:38.760]   Just amazing.
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:41.680]   And I think raised the level, the quality of journalism at the New York Times, which
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:46.600]   is kind of a big statement given that those are in theory the best journalists in the world.
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:50.560]   Margaret was a long time-- the V-long time editor of the Buffalo Eevee News.
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:51.560]   Really?
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:54.080]   Or is the Eevee News more Buffalo-- Interesting.
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:55.080]   Buffalo paper.
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:56.080]   She's got a new job.
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:57.080]   Yeah, she does.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:58.080]   Where she goes.
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:59.560]   She's the new media writer at The Washington Post.
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:03.160]   They have to feel like this is almost Jeff Bezos poaching somebody from his Irish front.
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:04.160]   Well, yeah, it is.
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:05.160]   It's interesting.
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:09.600]   I mean, I think that David Carr, he rushed in peace, was the media writer at The New York
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.600]   Times, and he has no passed away.
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:12.600]   Great one.
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:13.600]   But a year ago.
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:14.600]   Great one.
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:17.120]   And Jim Rittenberg has been named as a replacement.
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:20.800]   Margaret would have been-- Margaret, I think, is-- and I say nothing against Jim, but Margaret,
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:24.920]   I think, was the heir to David Carr and rained by media, but she couldn't work for The New
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:30.480]   York Times because it would have been a revolving door for the ombudsman to say, "Oh, you know
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:31.480]   what?
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:33.080]   I think I might want a job there someday."
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:34.080]   You can't do that.
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:37.240]   So if she wanted a normal job at the time, she couldn't do it.
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:38.560]   She'd have to go somewhere else.
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:39.560]   No.
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:44.160]   Yeah, because you're making yourself suspect in your movie.
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:45.760]   Is it hard to be the public editor?
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:49.360]   She was there three and a half years, which they say is longer than anyone else?
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:50.360]   It is.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.360]   It is hard because-- Because people you work with hate you.
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:53.360]   Yeah, the newsroom--
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:54.360]   You're their name.
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:55.720]   --you know, prowls you pass.
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:56.720]   Right.
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:59.000]   And you've got to deal with the other things.
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.840]   I think it's-- another one to say.
[01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:04.600]   Another one says, "But I think it's really got to be hard.
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:07.200]   He's dealing with all the crazies out there who want to complain."
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:12.760]   You know, you can imagine how many, you know, nine-elevered truther email she gets.
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:13.760]   Right.
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:16.880]   And somebody has to deal with them and say, "Well, no, actually, I don't think she did
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:23.200]   a very nice job of not being a nanny, not being a scold."
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:29.520]   But of really kind of teasing out, like that story that Times wrote, which was a wonderful
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:34.160]   story about the guy who kind of died alone.
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:36.240]   And then they went back through it.
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:40.200]   And the reporter had been working on it like a year.
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:45.000]   And I read it and I felt a little queasy about the privacy violation and everything.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.280]   But it wasn't completely-- wasn't cut and dried.
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:52.520]   And I thought she did a great job when she wrote a whole column about it, teasing out
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:55.560]   both sides of it and talking to the reporter about it.
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:56.560]   I thought it was great.
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:00.280]   Yeah, when they did their big Amazon, you know, expose, supposedly, she came back.
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:03.000]   I was among those who said, "I think I went overboard."
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.440]   And she came and looked at it and said, "Well, there's a point there that is overboard."
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:07.800]   And another point that's there.
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:09.880]   But she would come down to conclusions.
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:12.760]   She would make tough rulings from the bench.
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:16.080]   Oh, since she's scolded the New York Times many times.
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:17.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:21.160]   But she'd also tell readers when knows you're wearing the Times to this right.
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:25.160]   It's really, really intelligent, really nice person, really smart about the business, about
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.160]   journalism.
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:32.440]   And so I'm delighted that she stays as a voice in writing about journalism media.
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:34.360]   I congratulate the Washington Post for getting in there.
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:38.440]   I think it's too bad that she couldn't be David's heir.
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.600]   But I understand why.
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:43.760]   So it's not a bad outcome at all, except that she's kind of a neighbor in New York.
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:44.760]   And I don't want her to wash in.
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:45.760]   I want her to be in New York.
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:48.280]   Well, I don't know if she has to go to Washington.
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:50.880]   If you're going to cover pop culture, I think you probably could do a better job in New
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:51.880]   York than in Washington.
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:52.880]   I think that's true.
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:54.920]   Because sexual see, she can do it from home.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:56.720]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:00.600]   She's going to do a weekly column related to digital media and how that transformation
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.920]   is affecting people's lives and works.
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:03.920]   That's interesting.
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:05.600]   That'll be, couldn't think of a better person into it.
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.840]   It's a very nice writer.
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:09.200]   She will be moving to DC.
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:10.200]   You're right.
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:11.200]   Tragic.
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:17.960]   Hey, Jeff, did you read an article about TMZ in the New Yorker this week?
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:18.960]   No.
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:23.160]   I read an article about the New Yorker and TMZ.
[01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.160]   Is that correct?
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:25.160]   Yes.
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:26.160]   Same thing.
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:27.160]   Okay.
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:28.160]   It goes either way.
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:29.160]   It's called the digital dirt.
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:30.160]   And it's about TMZ.
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:34.960]   It's about Harvey Levine and why they do what they do, where he came from.
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:35.960]   It's fascinating.
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:36.960]   I will read it.
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:39.880]   And it made me kind of a TMZ fanboy.
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:45.960]   Well, I watch Harvey Levine as he talks to his bullpen of gossip columnist on TV.
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:51.280]   And I find it quite engaging, even though the content makes me feel dirty.
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:52.840]   Well, here's really well done.
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:53.840]   You know what?
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:57.960]   Is he not a journalist in the British style, the kind of Nick Denton style of the muckraker?
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:47:59.480]   Is that kind of where he comes from?
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:02.960]   I think the most controversial thing he does is that they buy stories.
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:03.960]   Right.
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:04.960]   They pay for it.
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:10.880]   But beyond that, he's different from a tabloid in that they actually dig up facts.
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:13.120]   They actually get hard evidence.
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.560]   And their stories are based on hard evidence.
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:20.520]   So in a nutshell, where he comes from is his dad was owned a liquor store, something
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:21.520]   when he was growing up.
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:22.600]   And he grew up in LA.
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:30.080]   And his dad was part of this witch hunt by local police over underage purchasing of liquor.
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:35.040]   Meanwhile, there were similar stories in the news about these posh clubs of celebrity underage
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:36.960]   drinkers that nobody was doing anything about.
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:40.880]   And he realized and got a chip on his shoulder early in his life about a double standard
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:43.320]   between celebrities and the public.
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:47.360]   And he's always been obsessed about bringing celebrities down to everybody else's level.
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:50.480]   So that's kind of a bit of a...
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:52.480]   That's not my favorite guy.
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:58.400]   Well, but in Hollywood, it's kind of an interesting thing because he noticed, for example, he's
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:03.920]   the guy, Tim Z broke the...
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:05.920]   What's his name?
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:06.920]   The guy who...
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:07.920]   Oh, Jason Simpson?
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:11.080]   No, no, the anti-semitic rant by...
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:12.640]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:13.640]   Mad Max.
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:14.640]   Mad Max, yeah.
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:15.800]   What kind of thing of his name?
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:17.040]   And they broke that story.
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:24.040]   And what happened was, the story was originally he heard that this event took place where he's
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:26.480]   going on this rant and causing out the police and all this stuff.
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:28.920]   And when he went to investigate it, there was this huge cup...
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:29.920]   No Gibson.
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:30.920]   No Gibson, thank you.
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:32.080]   There was a huge cover-up by the police.
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:34.800]   They literally lied to him and said, "No, that never happened."
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:35.800]   He never said those things.
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:36.880]   And they should, frankly.
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:39.720]   And so when he finally got the hard evidence of...
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:41.640]   They had a whole transcript of everything he said.
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:44.600]   When they got the hard evidence, that's not two stories.
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:45.600]   One is...
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:47.440]   No Gibson is a raving lunatic.
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:51.880]   Number two, the police routinely in LA do cover-ups for celebrities.
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:54.800]   Of course they never do for non-celebrities.
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:56.800]   And if you're watching the people versus Jason Simpson...
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:57.800]   I am.
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:49:59.440]   Wow.
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:04.280]   You see this and the people versus Jose Simpson, the police were dying to give OJ Simpson a
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:06.200]   pass because they were buddies.
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:07.200]   He's the judge.
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:10.120]   Anyway, so the article is brilliant.
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:13.000]   By the way, another great show you got to watch, Jeff.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000]   Add that to your list.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000]   American Crime Story.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000]   People versus OJ Simpson.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:17.000]   It's really good.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.000]   The casting is amazing.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.240]   You know, the casting is great.
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:22.880]   John Travolta is hysterical as Robert Shapiro.
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:26.680]   But what's good about it is we all know that we like lived through...
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:27.680]   Yes.
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:30.240]   Those of us of certain age lived through it.
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:32.400]   And so you go, "Oh, there's Marcia Clark."
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:36.440]   You know, "Oh, the Kardashian girls when they were 12."
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:37.440]   Right.
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:41.880]   There's a scene in there where Robert Kardashian is lecturing his kids in a restaurant and
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:44.160]   saying, "We're Kardashians.
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:47.840]   Fame means nothing to us."
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:49.560]   It's all about having a good heart.
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:50.560]   That's not about fame.
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:51.560]   Fame doesn't matter.
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:52.720]   There's a lot of tongue and cheek.
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:55.040]   Like, look ahead, look back, things like that.
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:59.680]   The girls are watching themselves, you know, their father on TV and they're shouting his
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:00.760]   name.
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:01.760]   It's really...
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:04.800]   Because you know what's going to happen to them that makes it all the more interesting.
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:08.400]   It's a great cautionary tale about the media.
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:09.400]   Wow.
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:14.880]   Because you see the Marcia Clark's of the world realize that incredible power of television
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:15.880]   and...
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:17.440]   Well, in fact, she's in vain.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:21.920]   She says, "I won't use a witness that's been paid by state channels like TMZ for their
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:22.920]   story.
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:23.920]   I can't use them."
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:24.920]   Yeah.
[01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:26.720]   But the problem is they all did.
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:27.720]   Right.
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:28.720]   Really?
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:29.720]   Breaking news.
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:30.720]   Breaking news.
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:31.720]   Yes.
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:32.720]   Just in.
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:33.720]   Just in.
[01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:34.720]   Just in.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:35.720]   Just in.
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:36.720]   Marc Andres has tweeted again.
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:37.720]   Oh, dear.
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:38.720]   Oh, no.
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:39.720]   He's back.
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:41.880]   No, just to promote a new hire on the team.
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:42.880]   But he's not.
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:43.880]   He's there.
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:44.880]   He's easing in slowly.
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:45.880]   He's insulting China this time.
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:50.520]   He's slowly easing in.
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:52.640]   I'm sad to say, I read this this morning.
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:55.320]   We often recommended a company called Slysoft.
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:52:00.400]   They made a very good Blu-ray DVD ripper called any DVD.
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:01.760]   They were in Antigua.
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:02.760]   They had to be.
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:05.760]   If you were in the United States, of course, making Blu-ray ripping software, you'd be
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:07.000]   out of business very quickly.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:12.440]   Well, apparently there is nowhere safe from the Motion Picture Association of America.
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:19.640]   And for those of you making archival copies of your Blu-ray DVDs that you bought legitimately,
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:20.640]   Slysoft is no more.
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:22.400]   The website has been shut down.
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:25.320]   Any DVD is no longer for sale.
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:30.640]   According to Torrent Freak, the action came several days after a group of Hollywood studios
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:34.200]   and technology partners asked the US government to intervene.
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:40.080]   If you go to the website, Slysoft.com, it says, "Due to recent regulatory requirements,
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:42.600]   we have had to cease all activities relating to Slysoft.
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:47.240]   We wish to thank our loyal customers' clients for their patronage over the years they had
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:51.320]   been brought to court in Antigua.
[01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:57.480]   And in fact, the local court found the owner Giancarlo Bettini guilty of violating the Copyright
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:53:00.400]   Act a whole six times.
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:03.720]   And he had to pay $5,000 for each offense.
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:06.200]   That's $30,000.
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:08.480]   That didn't really slow him down.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:17.520]   So anyway, he was breaking the law, the Digital Malaym Copyright Act.
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:26.200]   And I guess because of treaties, even Antigua and Barbuda are signatories to the convention.
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:27.200]   So there you go.
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:29.400]   But if you can't break US law in the Caribbean--
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:30.360]   Where?
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:32.280]   - I mean what's the world coming to you?
[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:33.680]   - I know.
[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:38.680]   - Soon they'll be getting going after my Canary Island funds.
[01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:41.460]   First Swiss bank started obeying the law
[01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:43.640]   and now they're shocking.
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:47.480]   - Next thing you know Facebook and Apple have to pay taxes,
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:48.420]   it's an outrage.
[01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:50.480]   - Did you know that Google employees
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:55.520]   may receive prophylactics with a slogan
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:57.320]   "I'm feeling lucky on them"?
[01:53:57.320 --> 01:53:58.840]   - This feels like something for snopes
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:00.760]   but it's on business inside of her.
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:02.720]   (laughing)
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:03.560]   - There are a fish--
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:05.040]   - It's not April 1st.
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:07.040]   - You know, why not, don't be evil.
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:09.960]   First of all, good on Google for putting them in a hand
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:11.100]   and about, why not?
[01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:15.880]   Great, it's contraception, prevents transmission of STDs
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:16.720]   or helps.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:17.800]   - They've been doing it for six years it says here.
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:20.440]   - And if you're gonna have a condom that's made by Google,
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:22.840]   what better name than I'm feeling lucky?
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:25.640]   - And colors, primary colors.
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:26.520]   - Google colors.
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:28.320]   - Google colors.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:30.480]   - Oh they are, they're Google colors.
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:32.520]   (laughing)
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:33.360]   Missed that.
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:36.320]   It's not easy being green.
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:37.280]   - Missed that.
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:39.720]   - All right, we're gonna wrap it up right after this.
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:43.000]   Watson, do you wanna talk about Watson?
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.400]   - I went on a Watson festival on the rundown.
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:46.960]   - I see quite a few Watson stories.
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:48.680]   What is Watson?
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:49.560]   - Well you remember all,
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:52.040]   Watson Watson is IBM's super smart,
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:52.880]   jeopardy-winning beer.
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:54.760]   - Did you see John Markoff's great New York Times article
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:56.800]   where they talked about the different voices
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:58.880]   that they were considering for Watson?
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:54:59.720]   - I didn't see that.
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:01.080]   - Including the creepy kids voice.
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:02.080]   - Yeah.
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:05.080]   - I guess Markoff has a new book about this.
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:06.040]   - Yeah.
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:09.560]   - So well, David Kenny, who sold the Weather Channel
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:14.240]   to IBM for Watson use is now the head of Watson.
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:17.280]   And David was ex-President of Akamai,
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:21.760]   ex, big marketing, marketing,
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:22.960]   publicist, the ad agency.
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:25.200]   David's got an amazing career all around.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:28.720]   So he's just Facebooking, linking all kinds of great stuff.
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:30.000]   So I just thought it was,
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.920]   Watson is gonna be used by a dating service
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:34.480]   to try to give you the right date.
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:37.360]   Watson knows when you're sad from your writing.
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:38.880]   Watson is now being used,
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:41.560]   they're offering it up as a service for customer service
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:43.600]   and understanding all the connections with your customers,
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:45.000]   which means you better have them.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.760]   And finally, to just scare the heck out of journalists,
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:49.920]   Watson's gonna write any headlines.
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:51.080]   - Wow.
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:55.160]   And how do you feel about machine intelligence
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:57.880]   being applied to any sort of journalism job?
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:00.320]   Jeff is, I mean, obviously there are sports
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:02.320]   and also financial news stories
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:04.320]   that are written entirely by computers.
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:05.920]   - As I've been fond of saying,
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:08.560]   articles are just another form of data visualization.
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:10.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:11.560]   Yeah, and I tend to think that anything
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:13.960]   that can be done by a machine as well or better
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:15.160]   than a human ought to be,
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:18.760]   because that basically indicates that the human,
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:21.480]   after you realize that doing that job
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:23.160]   will be functioning as a machine.
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:24.600]   So that's not good either.
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:26.440]   So I'll be curious to see what they do.
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:28.920]   Although when Watson was acting as a chef
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:30.400]   and inventing new recipes,
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:33.120]   I find that highly suspicious, chocolate burritos
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:34.520]   and like weird stuff.
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:35.360]   I don't think that would--
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:36.720]   - I don't think they're,
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:37.920]   the other thing I don't like about this
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:40.520]   is it personifies machines, which I'm against.
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:44.520]   Because this is, the anthropomorphization of machines
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:46.920]   is what makes it creepy, right?
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:48.680]   If they're just machines, they're not creepy.
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:51.480]   So I, and I don't think there's like a box that's Watson,
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:52.680]   like there's Watson.
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:54.800]   It's like a lot of-- - It's a division.
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:56.760]   - It's the vision. - Of IBM, yeah.
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:58.920]   - It's not a computer, it's a division.
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:00.000]   That's a better way to think of it.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.240]   - So, but Mike, back to your point,
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:04.360]   answer me this, both of you.
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:05.920]   'Cause I've been trying to think about this through.
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:08.760]   If you were gonna utilize, and I emailed Kenny
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:09.760]   when he got the job and said,
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:11.240]   I wanna talk to him about this at some point,
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:13.840]   if you utilized artificial intelligence for journalism,
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:14.800]   what would that mean to you?
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:16.680]   How could artificial intelligence be used?
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:19.400]   - Well, have a computer's been writing sports articles
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:22.040]   for years. - That's one, yes they have, yes.
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:25.080]   - Well, that's easy, it's very formulaic.
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:26.600]   - It's data visualization.
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:28.760]   - I mean, when I said it, you're taking a box score
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:31.120]   and making it readable to our brain.
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:33.320]   - But how, in terms of investigation
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:36.760]   and finding anomalies, using resources of data?
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:38.400]   - Investigative journalism, I think,
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:40.320]   would be killer for that, because essentially,
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:43.400]   imagine if you had a artificial intelligence agent
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:45.560]   and you have a story where you're working on this thing,
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:49.600]   and for that to pursue, everybody mentioned in the story,
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:52.520]   all the facts, all the companies, find linkages,
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:56.040]   find, go see where the public information is available,
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:57.120]   and then come back to you and say,
[01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:59.280]   okay, you need to request these documents
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:01.000]   under the Freedom of Information Act.
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.080]   You need to call this person,
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:04.000]   because this person knows three of these people,
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.080]   for some reason, you need to find out why they're all gonna,
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:07.160]   you know, that sort of thing,
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:12.200]   to basically function as a chess computer functions
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:16.280]   and see and pursue all of the avenues
[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:17.920]   to see where they kind of lead.
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:19.720]   I think that would be extremely valuable,
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:22.280]   'cause reporters these days just don't have,
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:23.240]   usually don't have the time.
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:25.200]   - I wanna recommend a really good book.
[01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:27.360]   We interviewed the authors of it on Monday,
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:30.960]   on triangulation, it's called The Future of Professions,
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:33.200]   Richard Siskind and Daniel Siskind.
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:36.120]   How technology will transform the work of human experts?
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:39.000]   And it really, we talked about these exact issues,
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.480]   like where is the line, what can a computer do?
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:44.560]   Where, what does expertise mean?
[01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:49.560]   What is the human expertise versus machine expertise?
[01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:52.040]   And the book, this is actually quite a scholarly book.
[01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:56.200]   It is not a popular science book,
[01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:57.520]   it's from Oxford University Press,
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:58.960]   and it's very interesting.
[01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:00.320]   They raised some really good issues.
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:02.720]   It was, I thought, a fascinating conversation.
[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:05.760]   - And this feeds in beautifully to my pick this week.
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:07.600]   - Good, well, we'll get to that in a moment.
[01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:12.440]   By the way, the answers might surprise you in this book.
[01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:15.240]   In other words, machines can do a lot more,
[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:17.440]   maybe than we would like to give them credit
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:19.520]   for along these lines.
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:21.040]   - So today brought you by those good folks
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:22.880]   at ZipRecruiter, we love this company,
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:24.280]   we've used this company.
[01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:26.200]   You could post to 100 plus job sites,
[01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:29.040]   including social networks with a single click of the mouse.
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:30.800]   So you're gonna reach the largest audience,
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:33.440]   and you know the more people your job posting reaches,
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:36.480]   the more likely you're gonna find that exact right person
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:37.560]   for your new employee.
[01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:38.840]   And it is so important.
[01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:41.640]   The people who are, you know, are your company,
[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:43.200]   are your company, it's made of people.
[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:46.120]   And a great person can bring your company up,
[01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:49.280]   a bad person can bring your company down.
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:51.800]   So you wanna get this great employee.
[01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:53.520]   And of course the problem is,
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:54.680]   you're doing it yourself,
[01:59:54.680 --> 01:59:56.520]   you're doing it probably at a time when you're short handed,
[01:59:56.520 --> 01:59:58.680]   this is why I love ZipRecruiter.
[01:59:58.680 --> 02:00:01.480]   You also will get instantly matched to,
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:04.120]   I think they have like six million current resumes
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:05.200]   in their database.
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:06.960]   So literally within the first date,
[02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:08.480]   you're gonna get a bunch of applicants.
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:09.720]   Now here's the good news,
[02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:11.440]   they don't come to your inbox,
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:13.240]   and they don't call you,
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:14.920]   they go in a ZipRecruiter's interface,
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:16.760]   so you can quickly screen them,
[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:20.280]   and rate them and find the right person fast.
[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:22.680]   So you reach the biggest audience,
[02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:25.560]   you've got tools to handle the applications,
[02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:28.280]   and you're gonna hire somebody within just a few days,
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:29.600]   and you're gonna hire the right person.
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:32.080]   We got an email from a listener named Dan,
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:33.440]   he's been using ZipRecruiter,
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:36.360]   he said the hardest part about running a business
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:38.400]   when you need to hire is that you have to spend extra time
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:40.800]   recruiting when you're short staffed.
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:41.640]   But with ZipRecruiter,
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:44.280]   I've gotten quality candidates within 24 hours
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:45.600]   of posting a job.
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:48.440]   ZipRecruiter's website makes this process so much faster
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:52.080]   by letting me manage candidates in one place.
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:55.840]   I hope that you've heard me,
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:56.800]   and you're gonna try this,
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:00:58.920]   'cause if you're in charge of hiring,
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:00.800]   this is a lifesaver, we've used it,
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:03.280]   or over 400,000 businesses have used it,
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:04.640]   and I want you to try it right now,
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:05.800]   free for the next four days,
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:10.040]   go to ziprecruiter.com/twig,
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:13.440]   ziprecruiter.com/twig,
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:17.320]   and you gotta try it free,
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:18.400]   I think you're gonna like it,
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:20.080]   ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:23.520]   What was that pick of the week, Mr. Mike Elgin?
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:28.320]   Okay, well the pick of the week is a service called x.ai,
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:33.040]   and this is a service that uses a Siri
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:36.800]   like artificial intelligence agent to schedule meetings.
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:40.400]   Now this is, you can look at virtual assistants
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:41.600]   in two categories.
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:44.640]   One is the all-purpose kind, Siri, Google Now,
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:47.840]   Cortana, et cetera, and the other are verticals.
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:50.960]   These verticals are much better at doing the one thing
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:52.240]   than the all-purpose ones are.
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:53.880]   So for scheduling meetings,
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:56.520]   there's nothing even close to x.ai.
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:01:59.200]   The virtual assistant is named Amy or Andrew,
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:01.240]   depending on which gender you want.
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:02.080]   I'm Amy.
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:04.560]   And they're gonna allow you to pick any name that you want,
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:06.720]   but essentially it's gonna cost nine bucks a month,
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:09.240]   and what I encourage everybody to do today
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:10.160]   is get on their list.
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:12.840]   There's a wait list on this thing, it's still in beta.
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:16.080]   They go public later this year.
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:17.080]   And this looks really cool.
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:19.040]   But when it's in beta, they'll take it out.
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:20.200]   So have you used it?
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:23.240]   I've used it on the, I'm signed up for the beta,
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:24.400]   but I've used it to actually,
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:26.800]   I've interviewed the CEO a couple days ago.
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:28.120]   And to schedule that,
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:30.040]   - Oh, of course he's using it.
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:30.880]   - He's using it.
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:33.200]   And so what you do is let's say,
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:34.800]   I wanna meet with you, so I send you an email,
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:35.960]   and you're a user.
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:39.680]   You simply reply to me and you copy Amy.
[02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:41.160]   - So here's an example.
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:43.400]   Mary writes to Greg, it was nice to meet you.
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:44.360]   Do you have time for coffee?
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:45.440]   I'd like to talk.
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:48.960]   Greg sends a response to Mary, but see seeing Amy.
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:50.040]   Sure, Mary, and then says,
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:51.760]   "Amy, can you find 30 minutes for coffee
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:52.600]   "in my office?
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:53.440]   "Cheers, Greg."
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:56.560]   Then Amy, now does Amy act like a bot or kids?
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:57.960]   It's just like a person who's got humor.
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:02:59.280]   It's like most of the people who are
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:01.120]   who are on the recipient side
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:04.120]   don't know that it's artificial intelligence,
[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:06.640]   and they have all this data about people asking her out,
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:08.200]   and saying flowers and chocolates.
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:09.040]   Amy, you're cute.
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:11.960]   Yeah, and so basically it goes back and forth,
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:14.280]   and if you reschedule the meeting,
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:17.680]   the software will take care of that.
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:20.440]   And it learns your particular, like,
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:22.240]   for example, in your case,
[02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:25.040]   you don't want to schedule meetings for Thursday and Friday,
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:26.440]   and so--
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:28.080]   Or Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:30.040]   Or after a certain hour's or one day's Saturday.
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:31.720]   Or Saturday either, yeah.
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:34.800]   So it'll learn all of the times when you can't do,
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:36.880]   and so over time it's constantly learning,
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:40.880]   and just about everybody I've talked to who uses X.ai
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:43.040]   says it's just amazing.
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:45.280]   They don't even have to think about meetings anymore.
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:47.640]   It's just all handled by behind the scenes.
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:50.440]   And so, again, what I recommend that everybody do,
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:52.120]   whether you think you're gonna use it or not,
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:53.800]   is just sign up, 'cause it's gonna be a little while
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:56.680]   before you get to the point where you could use it.
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:58.640]   Once you do get to the top of the class,
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:01.720]   I think it's a month free, so you'll be able to try it from.
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:04.000]   You're gonna forgive me for being skeptical,
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.160]   'cause I just read the article about xenofits
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:08.760]   and the fact that while it looked like it was all automated,
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:11.000]   they had all these people in a sweatshop in the back,
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.720]   doing all the hard work.
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:14.960]   This is really good computer, or is there a human at all?
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:17.440]   Okay, so I talked to Dennis Mortensen about that.
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:21.680]   He's the CEO, and they're working toward--
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:22.520]   Yeah, huh.
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:23.840]   Total automation.
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:26.040]   Because computer's not that smart.
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:28.840]   What they're using people to train it.
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:32.440]   So they don't actually see the emails, they see data.
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:34.320]   So they see what the supplies are to their data,
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:37.160]   and they go and tweak it, and they do various things.
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:41.640]   And then, but they claim that probably by the end of the year,
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:43.520]   it'll be 100% automated.
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:45.080]   And again, they're always working toward that.
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:48.240]   But yes, it's not like Facebook M,
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:49.760]   which actually has people--
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:51.320]   That's real humans, yeah.
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:52.920]   Depending on the query.
[02:04:52.920 --> 02:04:54.560]   Human supported.
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:55.560]   Exactly.
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:59.720]   But they're going for this super automated process.
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:02.280]   And I think it's brilliant that they have this virtual assistant
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:05.040]   living an email, because it lowers your expectations
[02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:05.960]   about the speed.
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:09.720]   If you ask something of Siri, and you don't get a reply
[02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:11.960]   in a quarter of a second, you're like, oh, this is terrible.
[02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:13.200]   I can't do this.
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:16.360]   But if you send an email, if you get that email in like 10
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:18.240]   minutes or whatever, that's fine.
[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:22.080]   And so it's just-- it's like having a personal assistant
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:23.680]   handling your meetings.
[02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:24.120]   I love it.
[02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:25.480]   I'm signing up.
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:28.640]   I don't even do that many meetings.
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:30.800]   Have Amy reject people.
[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:31.440]   Yeah, that's great.
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:32.720]   So I just signed up.
[02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:36.600]   And if you want to jump the line, I'm in group 150.
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:37.680]   You tweet it.
[02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:39.560]   You tweet it, and you can move up.
[02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:42.480]   So move up three groups, one per share.
[02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:44.520]   Move up 10 groups, two per for referrals.
[02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:48.040]   So folks, if you see my tweet and sign in, I'll move up.
[02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:48.540]   Oh, good.
[02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:49.640]   I'll sign up through your referral.
[02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:53.800]   Nice.
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:58.560]   x.ai, by the way, superb URL.
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:00.560]   Yeah, very nice.
[02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:02.760]   Nice job.
[02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:05.000]   Your number of the week, Mr. J.
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.600]   I'm going to go with the amazing Jorge Ramos, who
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:11.360]   has been using Facebook live like crazy mainly
[02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:14.360]   from the primaries, but just been going on.
[02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:19.960]   David Fulkman flick at NPR just wrote a story about him doing
[02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:20.240]   this.
[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:23.680]   And they're kind of amazed that he spent sometimes 45 minutes
[02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:25.360]   or an hour on video.
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:26.280]   Try twig.
[02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:31.760]   But on the night of the Iowa caucuses,
[02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:36.120]   he was viewed by 2.6 million people in New Hampshire.
[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:38.080]   They did three videos, totally 75 minutes,
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:40.000]   viewed total 4 million times.
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.640]   That's beaten cable audience.
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:44.760]   Unfortunately, he sees Facebook numbers
[02:06:44.760 --> 02:06:46.760]   where the minute the video starts,
[02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:47.800]   your count is right.
[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:48.560]   That's an issue.
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:49.960]   Well, but yes, that's it.
[02:06:49.960 --> 02:06:51.600]   Well, I don't know how live is counted
[02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:53.320]   versus other videos.
[02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:55.480]   It's a really interesting question.
[02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:57.320]   So I don't know who the numbers are and all that.
[02:06:57.320 --> 02:07:01.600]   But he is gained even if the numbers are specious,
[02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:03.000]   all numbers are.
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.200]   He's gaining new audience.
[02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:08.400]   We got to try this because we're doing exactly what he is.
[02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:11.720]   He's streaming as he sets up and shoots and comes back.
[02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:12.720]   Try what happens.
[02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:13.960]   We do that all the time.
[02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:15.000]   That's what this show is.
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.880]   Take a phone to the camera.
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:20.560]   You'll remember that Ramos was the guy who challenged Trump
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:22.240]   and Trump kicked him out and then he came back.
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:23.320]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:24.880]   So he's made huge branding efforts.
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:28.320]   So he's a fascinating guy because at Unubiziong,
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:33.040]   he is the anchor of Notissiero Unubiziong,
[02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:33.400]   the--
[02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:35.160]   He's on every night on their newscast.
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:38.240]   On Sunday, he's on the public fair show called El Pinto.
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:41.080]   But then he's also the anchor of the weekly news magazine,
[02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:43.680]   America on Fusion.
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:46.280]   Fusion need people in a lot of talent there,
[02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:47.520]   not seen that much.
[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:52.200]   So this is the way to come out.
[02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:54.160]   Like, what's going to happen?
[02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:55.200]   Cool.
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.160]   So I thought that--
[02:07:56.160 --> 02:07:57.720]   We got to do more of this kind of stuff.
[02:07:57.720 --> 02:07:58.920]   Yeah, I think so.
[02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:00.560]   Also, the Guardian just did an experiment
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:02.800]   from the Westminster Dog Show.
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:04.200]   And they tried-- and I have already
[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:05.360]   it's-- I don't know what the results were,
[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:08.040]   but they tried Periscope versus Facebook Live.
[02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:09.680]   So media companies are trying this now.
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:10.680]   Oh, there's no question.
[02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:12.480]   Facebook Live's huge.
[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:16.760]   But what Mashable does is they do Periscope and Mirkat
[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:17.480]   at the same time.
[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:18.280]   I don't see--
[02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:19.560]   Why not just tape three phones?
[02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:20.560]   Yeah.
[02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:22.800]   And just prop it up there and let them all roll.
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:23.920]   And why not?
[02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:24.640]   It's more audience.
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:26.040]   Otherwise, speaking of news, Apple, quickly,
[02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:28.040]   have you guys tried the new quartz app?
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:29.040]   It's Apple.
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:29.760]   Yeah, I have.
[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:30.360]   It's funny.
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:31.400]   Yeah, it is funny.
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:32.920]   There's say they say-- and Android's coming.
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:35.760]   We showed it on iOS today on Monday.
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:38.720]   It's effectively an app with a chat interface.
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:40.840]   So you're chatting with a news bot.
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:43.320]   And it says, well, here's Story 1.
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:44.040]   What do you think?
[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:45.520]   And then you could say, yeah, tell me more.
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:46.880]   Or no, that's enough.
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:47.640]   Next.
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:49.720]   And you have a conversation six stories later.
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:51.200]   They go, that's all there is today.
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:52.920]   See you tomorrow.
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:55.680]   And I have to think it's a trial, not for an app,
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:57.600]   but for a news bot.
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:08:58.800]   I would think so.
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:08:59.600]   I make an app.
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:01.400]   You could just do that and make a bot
[02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:02.960]   that you could join with Messenger.
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:05.280]   Oh, they can add ads and stuff like that.
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:05.600]   They do.
[02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:07.960]   They have lots of ads.
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:09.280]   I think it's interesting.
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:10.120]   It is.
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:11.200]   I kind of like it.
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:13.920]   I don't find myself going to it regularly.
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:15.320]   But I use news differently.
[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:16.800]   Like I'm looking for a way to share it.
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:19.480]   If I see a story I want to talk about, that kind of thing.
[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:21.800]   This is just more like, if you're lonely,
[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:25.080]   you can chat with your news bot.
[02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:28.680]   Well, there's a bot in China that Microsoft
[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:31.440]   makes called Shao Ice, I think we've all heard of it,
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:34.560]   which is for interacting just for the sake of it.
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:38.520]   And I can't talk about what I've learned recently,
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:41.640]   but there are some of those coming to the English language
[02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:42.480]   world and to the US.
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:43.240]   I'm ready.
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:44.760]   Because I'm a lonely person.
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:46.800]   It's just, you know, people are overrated.
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:48.960]   It's nice to talk to a machine once I'm on bots.
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:51.440]   So long as I don't push them and they come after me.
[02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:53.000]   Well, Amy's coming.
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:53.880]   Amy's here.
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:55.000]   I don't have much time.
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:55.880]   We've got to run.
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:57.720]   We're way late.
[02:09:57.720 --> 02:09:58.800]   What a shock.
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:00.120]   But I'll just mention the--
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:01.240]   I got the next bit--
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:02.800]   Robin, this was a Kickstarter.
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:07.360]   Kind of a pretty good pedigree on this phone.
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:09.520]   Next bit was founded by--
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:11.280]   Look like an armed processor there for a second.
[02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:13.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:14.280]   Very clever.
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:16.160]   Very clever.
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:20.200]   Was founded by a former head of design at HTC.
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:24.720]   In fact, you can see some of the HTC pieces in this.
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:28.400]   And then one of the folks who started Android,
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:32.360]   I think, was early on Android off to look.
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:34.800]   But it's-- by the way, you may look at this.
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:37.880]   Robin's egg blue, but they have a black or midnight blue
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:38.280]   version.
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:42.000]   The point is it's relatively inexpensive.
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.760]   It's a $3.99 out the door unlocked.
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:48.680]   It has some very nice features.
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:49.680]   I love the screen.
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:51.680]   It's kind of an interesting feel and you felt it.
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:52.180]   Yeah.
[02:10:52.180 --> 02:10:53.520]   It's pretty interesting.
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:55.120]   It's pretty interesting.
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:59.400]   It's soft, kind of touchy plastic.
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:02.800]   I might have it for long enough to try the camera and so forth.
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:05.680]   It's got front facing speakers like the HTC One,
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:06.760]   unlike that.
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:09.320]   I just feel like it's a nice looking phone.
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:11.440]   USB Type-C connector on the bottom.
[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:15.120]   But here's the secret sauce, which I don't really know if this
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:16.600]   makes any sense at all.
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:20.880]   It only has 32 gigabytes of storage, which for most
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:22.360]   people would probably be enough.
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:26.320]   So what it does is offload apps that you don't use much to--
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:28.560]   they're free cloud storage.
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:31.800]   And if you need the app, you tap it and then it downloads it.
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:33.320]   You'll see lights on the back.
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:35.320]   There's a little cloud on the back to show you.
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:38.400]   So it's periodically looking at what you do with your phone
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:39.520]   and then how you use it.
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:42.600]   And then if you don't need that app, it'll just move it off
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:43.400]   your phone.
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:45.600]   It comes with its own launcher, which I'm not crazy about.
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:49.000]   But there's no reason you have to use their launcher.
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.520]   Although the compelling reason you use their launcher is if
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:56.280]   an app is moved off the phone, the icon will be a little
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:56.920]   grayed out.
[02:11:56.920 --> 02:11:58.520]   And that way you'll know, oh, it's not there.
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:01.480]   It's going to take a little bit longer to launch it.
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:03.440]   I don't think that's a compelling enough reason for me to
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:04.600]   abandon my Nova launcher.
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:06.840]   But I have to say for 300 bucks, it's a little--
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:08.160]   that's not super cheap.
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:10.960]   There's great $200, $300 phones out there.
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:15.840]   But for the price, it's still less than the $399, still
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:18.320]   less than the flagship phones.
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:19.560]   This might be a very good choice.
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:20.840]   It's unlocked.
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:24.560]   And you can find it at nextbit.com.
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:27.920]   And I'll probably have a more detailed review for you in a
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:28.440]   week or so.
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:29.560]   I just got it.
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:31.600]   But I mean, it's kind of friendly.
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:32.040]   Yeah.
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:32.720]   Feels friendly.
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:34.040]   Yeah.
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:36.880]   Well, a fingerprint reader, which this is unique, is on
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:38.040]   switch.
[02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:42.480]   So you switch it on and you have the fingerprint reading at
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:45.680]   the same time, which is pretty convenient.
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:48.120]   It's pretty standard Android.
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:50.080]   Looks like-- yeah, except for the launcher.
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:51.480]   It looks like stock Android.
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:55.000]   They've colorized stuff a little bit, you see.
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.760]   I'm not sure I'll use their launcher.
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:12:59.200]   Widgets are not visible on the screen.
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:02.680]   You pinch to see your widgets, which is really weird.
[02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:07.120]   I do love the screen.
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:09.280]   I think it's a really crisp, nice screen.
[02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:11.080]   I don't know if it's O-Litter IPS.
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:13.320]   But it's a box, although everybody--
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:15.320]   that's kind of table stakes all of a sudden.
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:18.280]   Everybody's got great screens.
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:21.400]   Anyway, Jason Howells has one as well.
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:24.240]   And we'll probably have reviews for you soon.
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:26.880]   Jeff Jarvis, thank you so much, Professor of Journalism,
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:28.560]   City University of New York.
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:31.600]   My personal hero, good buddy.
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:32.280]   Great to have you.
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:33.920]   Shabai's books, public parts.
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:35.880]   What would Google do?
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:39.160]   Geek's bearing gifts all about the news, Biz.
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:41.600]   And of course, Gutenberg, the geek, which is a single on
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:42.840]   Amazon.
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:44.640]   I've got to take that out and put it up for free on medium.
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:45.680]   It's been up there for so long.
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:46.840]   It's time to do that.
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:47.920]   It's time to get people.
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:50.640]   And yeah, he blogs at Buzz Machine and Medium as well.
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:51.160]   Sometimes.
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:52.880]   Yes.
[02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:54.640]   We also thank Mike Elgin for stopping by.
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:56.160]   Yeah, it's so great to see you.
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:57.240]   Mike Elgin, thanks you.
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:13:58.640]   You should be on the show all the time.
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:00.680]   I just feel like you're such a great--
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:01.280]   I love this show.
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:02.800]   Your insight is so good.
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:04.960]   Catch us writing in computer world and data
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:07.760]   nation and all sorts of places.
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:10.160]   Google+ that follow them on the Twitter.
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:11.800]   And I've got a new little project coming up.
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:13.200]   I'm going to announce it in three weeks.
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:15.640]   And you have a podcast about food, by the way, which I love.
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:16.520]   Food and tech.
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:17.480]   Food and tech.
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:20.520]   And yeah, I recently interviewed B. Wilson, the
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:22.480]   Britain's favorite food writer.
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:24.320]   I got-- yeah, that's a lot of fun.
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:26.400]   What's the name of that show and where can I find it?
[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:27.440]   It's called the fatcast.
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:30.160]   You can find it on iTunes.
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:31.880]   Isn't that a great name?
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:34.040]   It's fat is for food and technology.
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:37.880]   And not the freakishly amazing tech transmission show.
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:38.560]   That's a different one.
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:40.120]   That's a good description of the show.
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:40.640]   Quiet.
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:42.680]   That is not the actual name.
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:44.120]   So yeah, you can find that.
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:47.480]   And you can find me on Google+ Twitter, et cetera.
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:48.760]   And yeah, that's a lot of fun.
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:49.600]   Nice to have you.
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:51.120]   Good to see you again.
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:52.200]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:53.080]   We do this week in Google.
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:55.040]   It's kind of my last show of the week.
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:56.920]   My weekend begins now.
[02:14:56.920 --> 02:15:01.440]   Every Wednesday, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2,130 UTC.
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:02.880]   Join us live if you can, but if not,
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:04.920]   on-demand audio and video at the website,
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:06.480]   twitter.tv/twig.
[02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:08.440]   And wherever finer podcasts are aggregated.
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:11.720]   And of course, don't forget the great Twitter apps everywhere
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:12.840]   you want to be.
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:13.760]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:16.080]   And we'll see you next time on Twig.
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:19.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:22.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:25.020]   (upbeat music)
[02:15:25.020 --> 02:15:27.600]   (gentle music)
