[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, Jeff Jarvis is here. He's visiting for Berlin.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   Matthew Ingram's on the line from Toronto. We're going to talk about the new YouTube red.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.600]   Why they did it? Now it works. We'll also give you a look at Twitter and the first Twitter TV ads.

[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.160]   Did I say that right? It's all next, Antwig.

[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.040]   This week in Google show where we don't just cover Google. Don't let that name fool you.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.440]   We cover whatever the heck we want to because when you have professor Jeff Jarvis, the star
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.840]   of the journalism school at the City University of New York, if Jeff wants to talk about anything,
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.160]   hey Jeff from Berlin. Good knobbitt. Good knobbitt. Is it late at night there?
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:30.240]   It is nine forty-five. Oh. So it's your bedtime but not that. It's bedtime. It's bedtime.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.920]   And that's Matthew Ingram from Ottawa. He writes for fortune tuck. I'm Toronto, whatever.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.920]   North of the... North of the... Forty-nine parallel. I don't know what the hell it is.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.520]   That's all the same up there. No, of course I know the difference. Toronto.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.280]   I don't know why I thought you were not a wuff for some reason.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.920]   Because everyone were focused on Ottawa. That's where you're at Lake is.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.600]   And that's where the new Prime Minister will be soon.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.360]   Is he already seated? Is there a lag between election and...
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.840]   There's a whole ceremony with like virgins and stuff.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.240]   Of course. So I don't think that's actually taking place. But um...
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.200]   Stone of Stone. He's uh...
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.240]   Marchy people down the street. Big reaction seems to be how good looking he is.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.480]   Everyone's like, "Wow." Wow, he's... It's hot.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.640]   Well they've been staring at Stephen Harper for ten years.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.080]   It looks just like me, I might add.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.120]   The funny thing was his father wasn't actually that good looking but his wife was so beautiful
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.480]   that it kind of brought him up, right? Pierre was dashing. He may not have been good looking
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.840]   but he was dashing. Right, right. He had a lot of charisma.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.800]   Well, so you're about my age, Matthew. So you were an adult when Pierre Trudeau was the Prime Minister, right?
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.880]   Yeah, I was a sort of young adult. Yeah. And I definitely remember it.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.320]   And he must have been exciting at that time. He was a very jazzy Prime Minister.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.520]   Yeah, the only thing was I lived out west at the time and so the west hated. Oh yeah.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.200]   With a deep and a binding. Well, I didn't know you lived west. You're all a fan company.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.400]   Yeah. You mean west? No, we don't live in the cow country.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.960]   Yeah. You lived in Alberta. Yeah, Edmonton. Wow.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:25.600]   In Winnipeg alone. No one really cares about that. But oil was a big deal and sort of...
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.920]   And that's why Harper was Prime Minister for ten years, right? Yeah.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.920]   The asserted power of the west, although all the population is
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.440]   on the east coast and they've just reasserted their power.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.800]   Well, and if you look at who voted, if you look at a map of who voted for the liberals,
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:51.840]   it's Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, and BC. And in between, it's just this vast area that did not.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.480]   So you know what, Matthew? I loved looking at the at the, you know, colored map because by size,
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.320]   it looks like one tiny bit of the Northwest Territories is bigger than all of Canada and 14
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.640]   power. Because it's just the huge red. But nobody lives there.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.560]   So Jeff, what are you doing in Berlin? I know this is part of your, you're on some amazing global
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.400]   tour. His international goodwill tour.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:29.200]   Apparently the trillions have decided to cut him off. You must be in the east.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.400]   Before he even got started. No.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.800]   They realize it's about Google. So they shut the code down.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.680]   Shut it down. It's a show about Google. No more.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.680]   Go to down. There he goes. You were about to explain as something, Jeff.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.400]   I'm at the European Broadcasters Union News Exchange.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.920]   Did I do it again? No, I know. I'm frozen now.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.320]   They just trade news with each other.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.600]   How does what's not all about?
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.360]   It sounds like maybe like a new service, like a cooperative news service kind of thing.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.000]   No, it's all the state broadcasters get together and talk about how important they are.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.160]   Nice. It should be fun. Sounds like fun.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.040]   And then from there you go where?
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:21.440]   Legos Johannesburg. Why?
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.720]   Legos for a bank. Johannesburg for African business.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.320]   I am in Miami for a lot and thing. Then back.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.600]   Do you try to tie all this stuff together so that it's all one big trip or this was just bad luck?
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.360]   No, it just happens that way.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.240]   Everybody wants to hear from it. I want to keep my
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.360]   global United Global Services status next year.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.880]   So I went to YouTube this morning just to see what I could see and look low and behold,
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.360]   because I subscribe to YouTube to a Google All Access used to be called All Access.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.320]   Now it's just Google Google Music. I've got YouTube,
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:08.880]   Red, and it's true if I just play anything. It's kind of hard to believe. The videos just start.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:15.280]   I don't there's no pre-roll. There's no there's no banners.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:22.080]   It's the strangest, it's the strangest experience I've ever had of YouTube.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.040]   You just don't expect this. It's so weird.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.720]   I wonder how long you have to watch one of those videos to get a share.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.200]   Oh, that's an interesting thing because I'm just playing one second of each.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:40.960]   So this is the $10 a month service. Can't imagine any. I don't know.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.520]   Maybe a chat room you let me know. Is there anybody
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:49.760]   in the chat room paying $10 a month to get ad-free YouTube? I think not.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.840]   But when you see YouTube really sold this all wrong,
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.120]   because that's what they sold. But really what they should say is,
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.280]   if you pay for Google Music, you will also get ad-free YouTube.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.120]   That is great.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:12.560]   When they first announced it, I thought, well, why would anybody pay $9.99 just to get rid of ads
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.800]   on some stuff? And someone said, yeah, but you get Google Play music for free.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.000]   It's like, OK, that actually makes sense. That's a pretty good deal.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:31.520]   Now, we were a little worried because ad-free to me implied maybe none of our ads either.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.880]   But they don't like your ads.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.040]   They don't apparently care. No, it's Google's supply.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.840]   They roll in.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.400]   Pre-roll in the banners and all of that stuff.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.840]   So I'm thrilled. This is a great experience.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.320]   Now, see, notice, I'm seeing promotional stuff like Order Lindsey's new book is up there still.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.440]   And those links.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.120]   So you're actually going to get another music service as well. You know that too, right?
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.240]   No.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.160]   So yeah, so soon there's going to be something called YouTube music.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.480]   So you'll get that for free as well.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.680]   Well, so I tried to figure this out when I was writing about it.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:11.680]   So you get Google Play music and you get YouTube with no ads.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.160]   And then you'll get something called YouTube music.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:22.400]   Oh, because now when I when I subscribe to Google without video without ads.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.360]   Yeah, no, without video, will it wouldn't be YouTube?
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.320]   Would it?
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.040]   That's something you see.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:34.160]   So if you use YouTube as a way to listen to music, then this will be that, except without ads.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:34.560]   Nice.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:44.080]   I think I did get something when I got Google Play music that was ad-free,
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.160]   like maybe it was Vivo's or something, ad-free music.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.040]   Yeah, it could be.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:49.680]   Could be Vivo.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.000]   And then you could do a playlist.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.400]   Yeah, I know.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.520]   You're forgetting Vivo exactly.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.480]   What is Vivo?
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.920]   And then you also can download, which is, I don't know.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.400]   Let me actually look at this because I haven't.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.760]   You can download for offline and you can also, you can play in the background.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.000]   So you can keep it playing while you're, couldn't I always do that?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.800]   Is that?
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.520]   Don't think so.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:13.840]   Oh.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.840]   At least they said that was.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.720]   Yeah, no, they mentioned this.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.840]   You can play in the background.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.000]   You could definitely do that, but I'm not sure about offline.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:21.520]   Okay.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.840]   You will know, but they did sell this as background play, but I'm not.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.720]   And somebody said in the chat room, oh, I'm loving the background play.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.760]   I don't really know.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.920]   I had the background play for the last year.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.440]   It feels like that's something it's always done.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.520]   So I don't, it's so confusing.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.920]   Or maybe not full year, but definitely had it.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.000]   Because they promoted that as one of the things you could do.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.480]   I know.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.640]   Now the download, I'm still not sure.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.120]   How to download here.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.760]   I'm not sure if you're going to be able to do offline on the website itself,
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.240]   or if that's going to be too mobile when you have access to the YouTube music.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.520]   Not quite sure.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.320]   Your stats for nerds.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.600]   I never saw this one before.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.360]   Like I can get stats over, over Adele's music.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.400]   So copy video URL, copy video URL, current time, copy and bedcode report.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:10.640]   Nope.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.920]   That's not the download there.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.880]   I don't see anything.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.720]   Here.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.320]   Maybe in settings.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.800]   Why don't you try searching Google?
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.920]   How do you do that?
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.720]   How does that work?
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.440]   What would I search for?
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.120]   How to download music from YouTube?
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.800]   No, that's going to give me all the things like TubeSock, all the...
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   Third party.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.440]   Maybe it's mobile only.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.040]   Oh, maybe it's on.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.760]   That's what I'm wondering.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.120]   Maybe it's mobile only.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.760]   You're also on the mobile app from what I understand.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:45.760]   Get the ability to choose to only stream audio and leave the video behind.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.280]   If you want to save your bandwidth.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:47.920]   Like that.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.200]   Do like that.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:49.280]   Good idea.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.040]   That's what you were saying, Jeff, but I didn't...
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:51.600]   I didn't...
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:51.920]   I didn't...
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.120]   Kind of do it.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.480]   So...
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.640]   Incidentally, the...
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:02.800]   I mean, maybe we're going to get into this, but the things like downloading, like offline,
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:09.200]   is part of the reason why, as far as I understand it, ESPN's videos have all disappeared.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.720]   And all his channels have gone dark.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.440]   That's a rights issue with the content.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:20.240]   Because in some cases, they don't have the right to a specific game or event for offline or channeling.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.280]   No name, but not download.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.240]   That would be exactly.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.200]   And yeah, they haven't...
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.120]   They don't seem to have in any way deprecated or hidden our stuff.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.720]   So I'm very relieved.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.360]   This is good.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.280]   Very happy about this.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.200]   Yeah, we can't get it.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.080]   Not literally.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.040]   It's US only.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:37.840]   No, of course.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:38.640]   For now.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.120]   Don't blame...
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.320]   I wouldn't blame YouTube on that.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.760]   That's a rights issue, of course.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:50.000]   And a lot of people were already doing a roll your own YouTube read just by running an ad blocker on YouTube.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.720]   But I would guess that YouTube will figure out a way to get around those ad blockers at some point.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.640]   It's interesting how the...
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.400]   There was a huge...
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.600]   Well, not huge, but there was an outcry about,
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:12.400]   you know, Google basically forcing content producers and publishers to sign up with YouTube read, basically.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.040]   And I had a bunch of back and forth with them about...
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.160]   Because there were a couple of blog posts about, "Hey, why is Google forcing us to do this?"
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.920]   I mean, from Google's point of view, they're trying this model because they're hoping it will generate
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.680]   more revenue for them and for people whose content is on there.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.600]   And it's also a response to ad blockers.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:46.720]   And I think it's also a step toward YouTube being a destination for more premium content, right?
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.720]   Isn't this what they've always wanted to do?
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:55.920]   Their own shows, their own content, and more premium stuff, not just three-minute clips of...
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.920]   Right.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.280]   People catching on fire.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.720]   And so if you're going to watch, you know, meet the press on YouTube or whatever it is,
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:11.600]   having those silly pre-rolls and pop-ups and all that stuff, that wouldn't really help the experience.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.440]   And let's face it, that stuff is garbage anyway.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.160]   I mean, no one...
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:21.600]   No human being, I think, watches 99% of those pre-rolls.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.480]   Like everyone...
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.520]   We all skip.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.520]   Click Skip Add as soon as I can.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.040]   I've been told, and I don't know if it's true or just a rationalization,
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.280]   that maybe Jeff, you know, advertisers actually like that kind of a signal.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.760]   Why?
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:42.160]   Remember when Dig had people voting up or down on the ads, and they said advertisers like that.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.400]   They don't want to show you an ad that you don't like.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.440]   So...
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.520]   They kind of would like the information about people skipping.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.600]   And then, of course, the challenge is for them to make ads, which I don't think is a bad challenge,
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.360]   that are unskippable.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.200]   We've talked about this a bit on the show. I think that what we're seeing is the beginning of new ad standards,
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:07.280]   where Google in AMP has set up minimum standards for irritability.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.160]   The interactive advertising bureau has done the same.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:17.360]   But we have to go way beyond that and push to a level of quality, and we're not there with advertising.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.320]   Have you seen the Geico ad that you can't skip?
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:22.800]   No.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.160]   This is actually funny.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.000]   They say you can't skip this ad because it's already over. Watch this.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.480]   Me.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.520]   Think the savings.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.760]   You can't skip this Geico ad because it's already over Geico.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.040]   15 minutes could save you.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.880]   15% or more on car insurance.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:43.760]   The family's frozen, but then the same Bernard comes in and starts eating dead spaghetti.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.000]   And the spaghetti is moving.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.320]   It's apparently just the actors that are frozen.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.120]   Oh my god, the dog's eating the girl's meatball.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.880]   She's having a hard time staying.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.920]   She's moving.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.200]   She can't.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.760]   It's like, "Well, there's a giant dog eating my food."
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.960]   Is spaghetti bad for St. Bernard?
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   He's skipping the salad going right over to the...
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.240]   Oh my god, he's making a...
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:06.720]   Oh man.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.240]   This is the...
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.440]   So this is what I'm saying.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.880]   If you have skippable ads, it just incends advertisers to make better ads that you don't
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.440]   want to skip.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.640]   And this is hysterical.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.280]   I thought you were talking about one.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.440]   There was an ad where it said, "Don't you hate not being able to skip things?"
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.320]   So it was a guy watching an ad and he kept pushing the skipp.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.280]   That was a good question.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.640]   That was a good skip ad button.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.600]   And it didn't work.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:37.440]   And then the message was, "When you don't have control over something, it's frustrating."
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.000]   That was so funny.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.320]   And one of the comments on here, one of the first comments is from Todd Nasko,
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.920]   who says, "I'm the dad in that ad."
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.120]   It was so much fun to work on and the kids did an amazing job.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.040]   It was difficult to keep a straight face and not laugh with the dog named Bolt
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.200]   in your face eating all the food.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.600]   The only thing we were allowed to move off-rozen were our eyes.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.920]   Kaiko's ad team is very, very, very...
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.640]   They are good.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.240]   They are.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.880]   The unskippable ad.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.680]   We need more of those.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:09.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.800]   Here's another one.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.840]   You want to see another one?
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.280]   So what do you say?
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.720]   I say savings.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.760]   You can't skip this geico ad because it's already over,
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.320]   Geico.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.280]   15 minutes could sit.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.840]   By the way, another incentive to make short ads, right?
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.400]   Oh, cold the door.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.120]   Thank you so much.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:35.680]   They're really elevated.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.200]   Shaking hands.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.640]   They've frozen completely.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.840]   She's puzzled.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.520]   Oh, I love this.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.400]   That's great.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.080]   Okay, I'll just do it myself then.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:57.280]   How many takes do they have to be short?
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.320]   Oh, must be so fun.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:58.800]   I love these.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.560]   I'm really excused.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.360]   Here's another one.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.080]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:02.560]   Geico.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.720]   Now, by the way, that's the other thing that will happen is other...
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   These people, your ad will go viral, right?
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.320]   Isn't this what you want?
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.360]   No, this is what happens.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.240]   You do it the first time and then you realize you want to watch all of them.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.400]   So they get maximum bang for their buck, right?
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.520]   Cleaning crew.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:16.560]   Babies.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.200]   You can't skip this, Geico.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.240]   Cleaning crew's frozen.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.040]   It's already over.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:21.600]   Geico.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.400]   15 minutes.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.720]   He's pointing his duster at the guy with the vacuum.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.120]   The vacuum escapes.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:33.120]   Now I'm running a muck.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.480]   It's hit the wire.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.200]   Short circuit.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.320]   The lights are going out.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.720]   You can't...
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.400]   Oh, it's going again.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.360]   Oh, now it's going...
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.680]   It's wrapping itself around the guy's feet.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.440]   I have a feeling this isn't going to end well.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.480]   Smoke alarms are going off.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.720]   They actually just began that one.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.000]   That one, this must have been an early edition.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.800]   You know what?
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:57.680]   There's a ton of them.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.240]   I didn't know this.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:00.880]   It's a whole camera.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.480]   I haven't seen those.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.120]   Those are great.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.360]   Now, this is the funny part.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.760]   Here's an article about it in ad week.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.320]   Viewership rates for YouTube pre-roll ads are generally poor.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.600]   Part of the problem is, very few marketers specifically,
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.880]   Taylor ads to pre-roll.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.120]   They just take their TV spots, put them there.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.400]   And of course, it's five seconds.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.920]   And it's over.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.200]   I'm not going to watch the rest of it.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.280]   Guy Conner stands this.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.120]   It doesn't have results.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.240]   The ads run 15, 30s, and even longer spots.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.760]   But the point is that it's the five seconds is the ad.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.000]   And then what happens after the five seconds.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.360]   That's...
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.280]   Which there's no message whatsoever.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.040]   But Guy Co has always done that.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.120]   The message that Guy Co adds, 90% of the ad is humor.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.960]   And then there's a little payoff at the end,
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.920]   which I think is brilliant.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.240]   I know it's Guy Co.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.360]   It's sunk in, right?
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.520]   I know they sell insurance.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.200]   It works.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.680]   Have you ever bought Guy Co?
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.360]   High five?
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.040]   I should play the high five one.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:05.760]   All right, you ready?
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.240]   Here's...
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.160]   I'm getting requests now.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.000]   That's the goodest game that is.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.480]   They're getting...
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.640]   So, Jammerby says I should play this one.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.200]   This is the high five unskippable ad.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.440]   Let me go back.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.320]   Savings!
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.480]   So two guys, they jump.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.280]   They say high five.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.280]   And now they're in the midair, frozen.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.760]   And then you see the strings.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.400]   And they're hanging on the strings.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.600]   The guy's got a barbecue.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.440]   He drops the hot dog from his tongs.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.880]   And now the barbecue's bursting into flame.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.360]   And now the other...
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:39.920]   The steak...
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.120]   Oh, his shoe is burning.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.440]   Oh my god, the humanity.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.640]   The poor guy.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.080]   He's just sitting there.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.120]   I think this is...
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.800]   You know what?
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.840]   Great ads are great.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.840]   Great.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.400]   And I don't mind giving a plug to Guy Co.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.000]   They deserve some kudos for that.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.080]   And the agency especially.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.360]   Hey, here's good news from Google Play Music.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.200]   We got the news yesterday,
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.120]   but actually we've known about it for some time.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.560]   We've been under NDA,
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:06.960]   not me.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.760]   They wouldn't tell me.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.560]   Because I leak like a sieve.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.240]   Because your wife knows.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.240]   But my wife, yeah, Lisa says,
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.320]   "Don't tell Leo.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.880]   Tell me I can keep a secret."
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.880]   Podcasts are coming to Google Play Music.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.720]   And in fact, we were one of the first...
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.440]   They signed up.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.720]   We're right there on the announcement,
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.840]   along with The Nerdist and
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.760]   how stuff works and startup from Gimlet Media.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.480]   And they say this is not going to happen right away.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.480]   They're reaching out right now to podcasters
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.960]   to submit their feeds.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.560]   But eventually, this is under the guy who does Songza.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.040]   Songza was a great acquisition,
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.320]   I think, of Google Play Music.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.640]   It's when you first launch your Google Play Music,
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.480]   it says, "It's a Thursday afternoon.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.400]   What do you want to do?"
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.440]   It gives you different playlists for different moods.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.960]   I love that.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.920]   I loved Songza.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.080]   And I was really thrilled when they added it to Google Play Music.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.800]   Apparently, that's what they're going to do with podcasts as well.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.840]   You're in a bad mood.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.640]   Want to be cheered up?
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.520]   Here's a playlist of podcasts that will make you feel good.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.200]   That was Azo Raskin.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:08.640]   Songza.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.640]   Jeff Raskin.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.720]   Oh, is this Jeff Raskin's son?
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.040]   I didn't know that.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.680]   He had an operating system that was very interesting.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:20.480]   Very--
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.240]   I didn't know that that's who Songza was.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.520]   Jeff Raskin.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.040]   People may not remember the name,
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.600]   but they ought to.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.440]   He was the guy who thought up the Macintosh.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.960]   Old people remember.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.360]   And was fired by Steve Jobs,
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.480]   because Steve wanted it.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.480]   But he always wanted it.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.600]   Raskin's a plant.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.200]   And I remember interviewing him many times.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.800]   I thought he was just a wonderful guy.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.360]   Really loved him.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.560]   He's passed away since.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.080]   But his idea was to make a computer for the rest of us.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:44.640]   What a thought.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.400]   What an idea.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.200]   He was a genius.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:47.920]   He really was.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.440]   So as podcasters were thrilled,
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.480]   because there has never before been
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.280]   a Google-supplied podcast client on Android.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.600]   Well, no, there was.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.280]   It was Google Watchma Call it.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:03.920]   Listen.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.960]   Google Watchma Call it.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.600]   It was right.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.560]   I forgot about listen.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.240]   Listen wasn't really a directory necessarily.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:10.800]   It was more.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.240]   Use the ones.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.040]   I subscribed.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.480]   No, you would subscribe.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.560]   I don't know if they had how much discovery they had.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.360]   I can't remember being much about discovery.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:19.760]   This is.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.640]   This is a little bit.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.840]   I don't remember this.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.520]   It's even more than reader,
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.600]   because I was pretty much stopped using RSS.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.440]   But I was using listen.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.400]   You know, that's so funny,
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.360]   because every mainstream media story said,
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.680]   Google's never had a native Android.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.880]   And I bought it.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.320]   Of course, listen.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:36.880]   Doi.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.880]   So this will be installed as.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.120]   Now, how are they going to do this?
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.200]   Will this be installed on?
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.160]   It'll be part of Google Play Music, right?
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.800]   So here's the songs of buttons.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.600]   It's Wednesday afternoon,
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.880]   Play Music for.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.720]   I keep getting entering beast mode.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.600]   Do you get that too,
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.480]   or is that just for me?
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.320]   Entering beast mode.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:58.880]   I see a melon.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.360]   I see a melon.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:23:59.680]   Keep it.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.560]   That's just for you, Leo.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.680]   Keep in common, Melo.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.800]   I don't know why.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.440]   I've never wanted to enter beast mode.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.000]   Not once.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.720]   You should try it.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.440]   You should try it.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.680]   Headbanging classic rock.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.680]   Greatest aggro anthems.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.760]   Rock is punk and garage rock.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.600]   Heavy menacing metal.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.200]   Speaker busting heavy rock.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:17.920]   This is not me.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.560]   By the way, you then go a deeper,
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.560]   and you get a playlist,
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.080]   to several players within that.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.920]   So it really goes quite deep.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.680]   You are tattooed, you know, Leo.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.640]   I do have a tat.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.400]   You must Google knows I have a tat.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.600]   There you go.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.120]   That's God damn it.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.800]   So you must like slayer.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.280]   I do.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.160]   I love slayer.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.000]   How about the early years of grunge?
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.720]   Handpicked by the members of Pearl Jam.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.720]   This is so,
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.640]   I had to click five times,
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.800]   to even know that Pearl Jam
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.720]   has made a playlist for Google Play music.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.200]   That is bearing the lead a little bit.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.880]   Yeah, but nevertheless,
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.840]   this is a great service.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.960]   So I'm excited that we'll be.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.480]   We'll be part of this.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.360]   It's not all Pearl Jam.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.480]   In fact, I don't think there's
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.080]   there's not got much Pearl Jam in it.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.440]   Oh.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.760]   Um, so this is kind of neat,
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.880]   but it's Pearl Jam-ish.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.680]   I really like Google music.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.120]   And I go play music.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.040]   And I think for 10 bucks a month,
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:13.520]   you get that.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.360]   You get ad-free YouTube.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.840]   You get ad-free music videos on YouTube.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.800]   That's that that's the compelling story, isn't it?
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.600]   It's pretty, I mean,
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.400]   it seems pretty big.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.160]   I thought if it was just a ditch ads,
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.120]   no one's going to pay that.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.160]   I mean, but you get a whole lot with that.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:34.880]   Recommended for you.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.040]   Thick radio similar to Robin thick.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.560]   Wow.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.600]   That means it's similar to everything else.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.240]   It's never been made.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:44.800]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.200]   I was thinking Alan thick.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.960]   I thought it was Alan thick radio.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.440]   That's different.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.160]   That would be worse.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.320]   It's a joke because even better.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.680]   Similar to Robin thick,
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.160]   makes being similar to Marvin Gaye.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:56.800]   Right.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.200]   Right.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.400]   Good point.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.080]   Well, this is even worse.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.600]   Okay, similar to the Beatles,
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.040]   because they don't have any Beatles.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.880]   I get the beat all's radio.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.440]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.320]   Here's songs by the beat all's.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.680]   This is a Beatles tribute band.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.320]   I don't think so.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.760]   Yeah, but you've got the you've got
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.840]   the actual players down there also in the station.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.800]   I know, but this is kind of look.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   The use of that's the real George Harrison.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.560]   This is even that's the real ring.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.560]   This is this is what happens though.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.760]   When an artist says,
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.400]   no, I don't want to.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.760]   They're solo stuff, right?
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.880]   Yeah, you get the solo stuff.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.000]   And I bought, of course,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:32.960]   in the monkeys.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.160]   I own all the boys.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.520]   All the Beatles music.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.480]   So I it will show all of Ringo's music.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.240]   No, no for that.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.440]   I have Google playing music.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.560]   Thank God.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.280]   But it's like did you say the monkeys were like the Beatles?
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:45.600]   Yes.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.800]   Well, they weren't.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.080]   It got so legal.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:48.880]   It should be.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.640]   But I but they were frankly,
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.760]   if you if you're if you're brutally honest.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:59.040]   But what what's back off pugulu like?
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.160]   He said love.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.160]   He said love.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.880]   You can't you can't help but love Ringo's star.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.960]   He's the Steven Wozniak of the Beatles.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:11.760]   That guy does.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.560]   That guy has zero abs together.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.120]   Zero abs to give.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.760]   He's a he's a he's a he's a kind of teacher you'd like.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.120]   Um, anyway, I like Google.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:23.680]   Play music.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.440]   I actually love Google Play music.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.200]   There's some restrictions that bother me a little bit.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.120]   And it's all from the music industry, of course.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.840]   The biggest one is that it's tied to your Google account.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.000]   So you can't share with your friends and family.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.880]   Because then they can access G email and everything else.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.640]   Well, but they have the family plans coming up.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.000]   And the family plan will solve that.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.040]   Thank you Google.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.080]   15 bucks, I think.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.920]   Come on out and I will definitely do that.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.480]   And then the other one is that there are a limited number of devices.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.800]   They're fairly stingy on the limited number of devices.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:51.680]   I can't write it was like five.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.120]   Can you kill a device though?
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.320]   So you don't have that problem.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.760]   And this is the same problem with iTunes.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.280]   They they artificial limits on killing devices.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.720]   Like you only kill a couple of devices.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.200]   The director of you.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.360]   It's a big problem for me.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.840]   And but not normal people.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.560]   Not normal people.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.400]   But I have a new phone every a few months.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.560]   And in fact, I'd run right up against that.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.040]   All I had five devices authenticated, none of which I can currently use.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.800]   And I couldn't unauthenticate them because I'd already authenticated the max.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:23.520]   And I was complaining about on this show and full disclosure, somebody contacted me from
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:28.640]   Google and said, we'll whitelist you because you're an unusual.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.440]   Oh, wow.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.840]   Yeah, they do that for some folks who actually.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.400]   That was nice.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:32.880]   So I didn't want to.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:38.320]   And I mean, I am getting something for free from them, which is the ability to activate the devices.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.360]   If you review a lot of devices, that's not a normal use case.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.440]   It makes sense to whitelist someone who's, you know, going through multiple phones.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.240]   Yeah, I'm pretty.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:51.600]   And I'm not, and I'm not, you know, I'm not listening to more than one Google play music stream at a
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.720]   time or anything like that.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.360]   Oh, it's not like I've given it to all my friends and family because you can't because it's your,
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.960]   it's your Google ID.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.000]   You don't want to give that out.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.480]   So those are a couple of limitations.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.240]   Some people might, my book, but I think all and all they're doing a great job on this.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.320]   I actually think their recommendations are pretty good.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.560]   That's one thing that I kind of look for.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:16.000]   Like I like the human curated stuff, but I'm mostly looking for, you know, I uploaded all
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.560]   80 gigs of music I have or whatever.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.920]   And I'm looking for Google to say, here's some stuff we think you might like.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.360]   The recommendations are pretty good.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.200]   I mean, aside from the calls.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.480]   Right.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:26.720]   Right.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.200]   That's the GQ's Google play newsstand.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.120]   No, what's that?
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.040]   I have, I have, I like it.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:33.920]   I like it a lot.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.120]   Okay.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.200]   Well, the newsstand, no, I use that as a news app.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.880]   That's like a flipboard only.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:45.920]   No, I, you know, what's interesting is I've been really trying to use Apple's news on the iPhone.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.520]   And it's excable.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.560]   It's terrible.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.760]   Yeah, it looks awful.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.640]   It's terrible.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.160]   There's, you know, I think part of it is because Apple doesn't want to spy on me.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.680]   Like they don't know anything about me.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.080]   I was getting Detroit weather for a while.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.040]   So that makes it worse.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:01.600]   You're right.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.400]   Spying helps.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.440]   Please spy on me.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.440]   Because I want you to know what I'm interested in.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.520]   So you'll make reasonable recommendations.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.840]   I set up a stand for my mom.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.320]   New stands.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.040]   It's nice.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.200]   Newspaper.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:24.240]   And first you think, well, this is really all about subscribing to magazines.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.160]   Like they're selling newspapers and magazines and that is part of it.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.720]   But it will also just recommend stories for you.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:36.800]   And if you, if you have a New York Times or Wall Street Journal subscription, it'll,
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:41.120]   it'll lift that 10 article a month restriction and all that.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.000]   I think it's really good.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.320]   It's actually something that like I'm a big fan of Flipboard as well.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.760]   I like the UI.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.800]   I like the design.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.720]   I like what they do with it's just a beautiful thing, especially on an iPad.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.360]   But the one thing they don't, they're not particularly good at is recommendations.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.160]   And, you know, I think things are trying to get better, but
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.120]   but they're going up against Google and.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.720]   One thing I will mention
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:11.040]   is as far as discovery goes.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.800]   Let me see if I can get it working.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.960]   Spotify has excellent discovery.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.720]   They have a Discover playlist.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:24.720]   Have you, I don't know if you're a Spotify subscriber, but every Monday they generate a new
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.320]   Discover playlist.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.720]   And some of those are really good.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.600]   And it's weird.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.320]   It's a mix.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.840]   And I have to think it comes a little bit from stuff I'm interested.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.040]   In fact, the album art is me.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.560]   So that tells me it's my personal playlist.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.320]   And it's old as well as new.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.760]   That's just some really old stuff.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.400]   And then some really new stuff.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.600]   That's kind of the holy grail.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.480]   And this stuff is not easy to do.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:54.080]   I mean, this data wise, you know, it's almost as hard or maybe even harder than
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.080]   something like voice recognition or handwriting recognition to get something.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:03.120]   Because music is so, you know, the emotional value of that content is so much a part of
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.080]   why you like the song.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:09.040]   It's not just that it has two buzz in it or that it sounds like the other thing.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.560]   The music genome project, right?
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.480]   It doesn't really get deep.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.280]   It's very limited.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:18.480]   So you know that it's like this other piece of music, but that doesn't necessarily mean
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.400]   you're going to like it just because it's got the same tempo or the same instruments.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.520]   It's really hard to do that type of stuff.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.400]   This Discover weekly playlist blows my mind every Monday.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.280]   I was like, be my baby by Bette Midler's in here.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.880]   Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.040]   And then I get this by Vesalva Yere.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.280]   Ova Sameoka.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:44.160]   I don't know why, but I think it's because I have some French music in my playlist.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.240]   I mean, my collection.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.320]   Well, and your name is French.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.280]   Oh, that's why.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:58.880]   Probantic.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.760]   French pop music is, I'm about it.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.240]   I don't know.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.040]   It's just strange.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.880]   But I like it.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.600]   No, I'm not.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.320]   And I like it.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.560]   The weepies.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.960]   The world spins madly on.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.640]   And then tears for fears.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.840]   Everybody wants to rule the world.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.000]   See, this is, I know a computer is doing it.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.280]   But if you feel like you listen to a really eclectic, interesting DJ, yeah.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.280]   And that's what you're going for, right?
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:30.800]   And there's, I mean, with Google Play or Apple, there's a real tension between,
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.160]   because they've got, you know, Apple has DJs, celebrity DJs.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.880]   And so there's a bit of a bit of a bit of algorithm.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:44.000]   And both of them, you know, have pluses and minuses.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:44.320]   Right.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.520]   Pros and cons.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:49.680]   I actually pay for both music and Spotify.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.320]   And at some point, I'm going to have to cut bait with one of them.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.880]   But I just, I don't know which.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.520]   I got Spotify free for two years from my cable company.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.200]   So that's awfully nice.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.080]   Which is pretty cool.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.240]   Didn't know that.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.480]   Well, I pay them like $11,000 a month.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:08.320]   Free.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.600]   The least thing to do.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:13.600]   Should be washing my car and doing my business.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.880]   All right.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.280]   Enough.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.000]   I don't know how we got.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.120]   Oh, because of the podcasting.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.640]   Anyway, I don't know when they're going to launch that, but we're pleased to be part of it.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.600]   And I think that that's a nice thing.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.480]   All of them are doing that.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.760]   We're on Spotify too.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.320]   And they're doing that because it's such a lousy business to be.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.120]   Tied to the record companies.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.560]   That's terrible.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.360]   For your revenue.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:41.840]   And just look at Pandora, which whose stock is down 45%.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.920]   Partly because.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.880]   I wrote about them and about Deezer, which just pulled its IPO.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.440]   Oh, no.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:51.840]   Really?
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.040]   Oh, I'm disappointed.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.160]   And I mean, if you look at the prospectus, it becomes quite obvious.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.760]   Why they pulled their IPO?
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.520]   Because it's a horrible business.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.080]   And no one in the right mind would invest in it.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:07.440]   Because it's just basically money flowing out the door to record labels.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:14.080]   There are so many money that comes in, I think 91% of their revenues are paid out.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:14.480]   Right.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.400]   That's in licensing to record labels.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:22.720]   It's just so because the structure of those deals is so onerous.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:27.040]   In some deals, Deezer confessed in its prospectus some deals.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:31.760]   They have to sign a bulk licensing arrangement and agree to pay a certain amount
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.800]   regardless of how much, how many plays that music.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.320]   So they can actually lose money.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.520]   That's part of the problem is that essentially the record industry gets to decide whether these
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.400]   people live or die.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.840]   Exactly.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.200]   And most of them are not.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:49.040]   I mean, even Pandora, that's horrible.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.960]   Spotify is somewhat better.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.360]   But this business is just structurally designed to fail.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.960]   And I think Spotify knows that.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.000]   I know Apple knows that.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.760]   I know Google knows that.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:05.760]   That's why I know that's why podcasts and other content are being added to these services as
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.640]   fast as possible.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:10.480]   Because you can't rely on the record industry that any time they could just kill you.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.920]   And add free YouTube.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:12.720]   I mean, seriously.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.920]   I mean, that's a big one.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:14.480]   What's better?
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.840]   What's a better model on YouTube?
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.960]   Millions of people every minute give us videos.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.520]   That's a great way to keep your music service numbers up.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.760]   To include that along with it.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.320]   Of course.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.160]   Oh, I'm sorry to hear about Deezer.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.280]   Deezer is a French company.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.960]   Doesn't mean I don't like them.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.720]   It's.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.200]   But I thought they were doing some really.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:37.920]   I know.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.720]   You're like French music.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.600]   I was making a joke.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.400]   I was making a joke.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.240]   No, and I really they were doing CD quality streaming and stuff.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.200]   Some interesting things.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:45.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.800]   Yeah, they've been around for a while.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.920]   Not quite as long as Pandora, but they also.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:54.720]   They're really one in an attempt probably to do the same thing as Spotify and Google.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:59.920]   They bought Stitcher, which is a big podcast platform for us and for a lot of companies.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.480]   Stitcher was integrated into Deezer.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.800]   So man, it's.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.200]   It's tough out there.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:13.600]   They also mentioned that they're so they had I think six million paying subscribers,
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.960]   they said, but in the prospectus, if you dig into the numbers,
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:23.600]   almost half of those came because they did a bundling deal with phone companies.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.160]   And so you would buy a phone and it would have Deezer.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.840]   So technically that's.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.840]   Talk about being through the rock at a hard place, Matthew, right?
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:31.920]   Right.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.880]   Between that color.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.560]   I'm just reading over the levels.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:39.600]   Yeah, you might as well just go in the backyard and set fire to a big pile of money.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.720]   And frankly, how much you think Rogers is paying for your two year free subscription.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.120]   Right.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.320]   To Spotify.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.440]   Probably pennies, right?
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:47.840]   Nothing.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.200]   Tough out there for a pimp.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:56.640]   I was going to play it, but then I thought, you know, I probably shouldn't.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:02.640]   On the other hand, Alphabet's doing just fine.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:03.520]   Thank you very much.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:12.400]   This is this is the first quarterly earnings report from the new Google revenues of 18.7
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.120]   billion growth of 13% year over year.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.480]   For all the big reporting companies, the companies that do a lot of international business currency
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:26.080]   was a big problem because the dollar gets stronger as the euro gets weaker.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:31.600]   And that means that, you know, unless they're doing some hedging, which I gather all the big
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.120]   companies do, they're going to be heard a little bit by currency fluctuations.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.560]   Constance.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.120]   Don't forget they keep a lot of the money outside.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:39.680]   Of sure.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.080]   Right.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:40.560]   It's relevant.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:46.160]   But there if but there without the currency fluctuations, their year over year growth was 21%
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.560]   but they only report 13% because of that.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.000]   So that just shows you it hurts.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.640]   Operating income of $4.7 billion in the quarter.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:04.640]   You know, I don't really know how to read balance sheets.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.800]   I don't really have much to say about this.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:16.960]   Traffic acquisition costs for the three months ending in 2015.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.280]   3.5.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:19.840]   4.5.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:20.880]   3.5.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:25.280]   Is that is it millions or is yes in millions 3.5.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:25.600]   Yes.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.880]   Whereas where's the no?
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.880]   I'm sorry, 3.5 billion.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.800]   Million dollars in acquisition.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.840]   That's that's that's your biggest.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.840]   Biggest cost.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:41.360]   Last week was I think I think 250 million in acquisition cost.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.440]   3.5 billion for for alphabet in the alphabet is in this case Google, I think.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.520]   And that's what that tells you though is that there are arbitrage business to that extent.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.960]   What does that mean?
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.520]   That making a penny that means that they're buying traffic to make a pay for on what they
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.240]   consume on it.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.680]   And it's not legit traffic to them.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:06.640]   They have to acquire the traffic to feed the ads but they're paying out a lot of money,
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.320]   but they're just they're making a march.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.920]   Well, and I mean, these publishers do the same thing, right?
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.160]   Buy traffic from outbrain and tabula and which is then you hope.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:16.640]   Which is ridiculous.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:23.040]   Let's take a break and then I want to talk to you about Jonah Paredi's Buzzfeed memo.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.200]   I have a feeling you guys will have something to say about that.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:30.880]   Both of you former newspapermen.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.960]   So once it is paper man, always that's right.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.160]   It's still it's hard to get the ink stain off.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.920]   In the veins, Jeff Jarvis, Matthew Ingram, Amelio Laport this week in Google continues after a
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.120]   word from Blue Apron.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:53.840]   Blue Apron is for people like me who love to eat, but also love to cook, but rarely have time to do
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.120]   the shopping and the prep involved in cooking a great meal.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:03.600]   Blue Apron solves that by delivering everything you need to cook an amazing meal to your door half
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:09.520]   an hour later. You'll be you'll have a dish that you've never made before and you'll feel good about
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.520]   it. Your family will go, wow, great for date night too.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:18.640]   For less than 10 bucks a meal and you get everything, all the fresh ingredients you need,
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:26.720]   including vegetables locally produced, farm fresh vegetables in season, the meats, the fish,
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:33.440]   always fresh, never frozen, no trips to the grocery store, no more sad takeout, meal planning is
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.360]   done for you. You can tell them ahead of time what your dietary preferences are,
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.440]   approve and disapprove individual meals. You're saying, you know, I'm not really into kale. You
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:48.080]   can say no kale meals, whatever. But look at what's on the menu this week, Blue Apron.com/Twitt.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:54.640]   You'll see dishes like baked Sicilian style rigatoni with latcianato kale. I don't even this is one
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:58.400]   of the things that's great. You get produce that you would never even you never heard who existed.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:06.080]   And if you like it, now, yeah, you know where to go and ricotta salata or they do some amazing
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:12.080]   Asian. There's the rigatoni. That looks good. Asian dishes like the Ponzu Tahini soba noodle salad
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.840]   with yellow beet cabbage and chard. And the thing is this, you would never make this really.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:21.840]   You really wouldn't. But once you make it once, then it's easy. Then you know exactly what to do.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:26.480]   And the next time I hear the story, you go, you know, I might do that Ponzu Tahini soba noodle salad.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:33.120]   I love so very much. It's like a little cooking school in a box, refrigerated box. You arrange
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:37.680]   the deliveries to work with your schedule. You'll be cooking with amazing ingredients. Some you've
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:42.880]   never used before, like watermelon radishes and pharaoh and purple potatoes. All the recipe is
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:49.840]   healthful and five to 700 calories of portion. So there, I mean, there's no if you eat that a
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:56.320]   lot, you got to stop. I keep saying this. I love to cook, but I never have time. So we end up eating
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:02.720]   out. And then I always regret it because it's rich. It's fat, and it's probably not what you want to
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:08.800]   eat. But when you love a meal that's like a gourmet chef made it, but it was you cod cakes and roast
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:13.920]   of potatoes with Coleslaw and Dijon Mayo, Mexican chicken and rice casserole. This must be the
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:18.960]   family stuff. Is this family? This looks good. Yeah, this is the family plant. They have kid-friendly
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:24.480]   ingredients and larger dishes, of course, for the whole family. Roast pork and delicata squash.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:31.440]   Oh, with warm pharaoh and kale salad. Oh, man, it's good for your kids, too. They can cook with
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:37.040]   you. They can learn to cook and they'll try stuff and it'll broaden their horizons. It's just,
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:41.600]   it's a great all around. Go to blueapron.com/twit. Your first two meals are free.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:52.880]   Oh, fresh mozzarella. Blueapron.com/twit. First two meals free. It is so much fun. And even if you
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:58.080]   think, I don't love cooking, probably what you don't love is, you know, planning and shopping
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:03.440]   and figuring it out what you need to do. This does it all for you and makes it fun.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:09.280]   Blueapron.com/twit. We thank him for their support of this week in Google.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:17.520]   Jonah Peretti said, I guess he set this out to staff earlier, but decided to publish on the Buzzfeed
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:24.960]   blog for the rest of us to see. Pardon me? He does it all. He's not a couple of kids.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:31.520]   Yeah, he's the guy who said, I don't think unions would be such a good idea for employees.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:38.800]   They wouldn't like that. But his most recent blog post, I thought, was really
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:48.480]   opening the kimono in some ways. Wasn't it to how Buzzfeed does its business?
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:53.760]   And I only knew that because, frankly, because of you, Jeff, because you've always talked about how
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:59.600]   Buzzfeed was moving away from the old model of a home page that people go like,
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.880]   go to the New York Times page and you read it like you would read it in his paper,
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:07.760]   to putting their content everywhere, Facebook and Twitter and where people are,
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:11.840]   a cross-platform global network, he calls it.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:17.680]   Right. Yeah, they were very early with that strategy, although others are trying to do the
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:23.440]   same thing, Vox, for example, but Buzzfeed was one of the first to have, I think it was over a
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:29.760]   year ago, they set up a specific unit called Buzzfeed Distributed. And that's all it did,
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:36.720]   was create content that lived on other networks or platforms. No links back to the Buzzfeed site.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.160]   How many monetize something like that? They have to build the ads into the...
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:45.680]   Well, because, well, no, because what they're really doing is they're selling a skill set.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:50.080]   Buzzfeed says to advertisers, "We can make our crap viral, we can make your crap viral too."
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.760]   We understand how that works. So, right.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.760]   Bice says, "We can make our crap cool, we can make your crap cool too."
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:02.560]   And we, and the rest of the media industry say, "Well, we write stories, we'll write your
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.200]   stories too, and fool people and I think they're yours," which I think is wrong.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:11.520]   And you got to... Jonah's brilliant, he's absolutely brilliant. The problem is, I think that,
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:14.960]   as I said this before, I think media companies make a mistake thinking that that's the model.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.840]   I even think, one thing in his letter that I don't have the data to know either way,
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.600]   but I do not buy people coming for the cats in state for Libya.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:30.640]   Yeah, no, I know that's not true. I just don't buy that. And he tries to argue that.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:37.360]   But instead, what he's done is made a business out of making stuff distributed for advertisers
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:43.360]   for this new world. And he understands that a home site and environment are meaningless.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:47.200]   And that's really forward thinking, that's very Jonah.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.840]   But...
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:50.640]   Let's face it a few...
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.520]   I fear for new publishers.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.840]   What I'm talking about is my fear of publishers is that they think that
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:02.160]   they can subsidize their news that way. I don't think that,
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:07.360]   I have my doubts that Buzzfeed's news is sustainable in any way on its own.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:13.680]   Well, it may be a model for Buzzfeed, but that doesn't necessarily mean
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.160]   it's going to be a model for every other publisher.
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:16.720]   Exactly.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.280]   So what do other publishers do? They pick up the wrong lessons.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:24.320]   Right. Or they try and duplicate something that they don't have the skill set to do.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:31.040]   I mean, Jonah Paredi built Buzzfeed, it started as a lab to understand how content works online.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:36.960]   I mean, the guy is like, Albert Einstein of how content goes viral and gets shared online.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.320]   So we would grant that they know how to do viral.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:45.040]   They know how to make a story that has a fairly good shot at going viral.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:47.680]   Five billion monthly views.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.000]   Five billion monthly views.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:50.560]   Five billion.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:50.800]   Wow.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.000]   Wow.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.040]   So that's a good skill to have.
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:00.400]   And I was trying to figure out what is it that bothers me about Buzzfeed.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:06.240]   And by the way, then they have money to go out and hire somebody like Matt Honan to break news.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.160]   And it always surprises me, but Matt's doing a great job.
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.080]   And I go to, I see it's on Buzzfeed.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.480]   Matt Honan's got this breaking, you know, really.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:19.840]   But my fear is always that when Buzzfeed goes public or gets bought by private equity,
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:23.360]   they're going to say, this part of the business is sweet.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:23.840]   We love it.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:24.160]   Right.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.120]   That news stuff.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.840]   Why are you bothering?
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.320]   Well, it could be that Jonah owns this forever.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.680]   And I think it has to be forever.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:40.400]   I don't think if there to me, it feels, it feels a lot like it made this argument before.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.880]   Feels a lot like what newspapers did.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:48.560]   I mean, newspapers, 85% of the content was entertainment and garbage.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.480]   It could come for the crosswords.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:54.080]   Okay, Matthew, but you did come for the crosswords and you stayed for the news.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:57.600]   It was enough package that was truly subsidized.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.800]   Buzzfeed is not a package.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.040]   It is by its nature distributed everywhere.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.240]   And you just hit one piece of it.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.240]   That doesn't mean you hit the rest of Buzzfeed.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:08.240]   And the old myth of that media that you charge all advertisers for all readers is
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.680]   immediately in case.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:14.320]   But if they can use the same skills to make a piece of news content
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.480]   shareable and go viral, then that helps the news, right?
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.640]   Presumably more people come into contact with it.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.320]   Really because there's no opportunity to be touched.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:26.240]   Who cares if the rest of the operation pays for that?
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.000]   Just the same way it's.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:28.560]   Well, why?
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.480]   Again, I'm not sure what I was trying to say is,
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:35.200]   but if I own it, suddenly I'm Donald Trump and I get bored night by Buzzfeed.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:40.000]   Then I say to the news people, you don't bring anything value.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.240]   I can get rid of you tomorrow and I get rid of cost and I don't lose anything in the
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.600]   benefit of what Buzzfeed is.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:51.200]   Well, even if he doesn't sell that, eventually somebody's going to make that calculus.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:57.600]   Because the only value to the Buzzfeed right now to the prestige news coverage is just
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.400]   to their reputation to burnish their reputation.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.040]   Right?
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.800]   It doesn't add to their virality.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.640]   It certainly doesn't convince advertisers that they know how to make stuff go viral.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.640]   So I mean, reputation does have a market value, right?
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:15.680]   That's why lots of newspapers publish the things they do and want to win awards and so on.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.240]   That's true.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.280]   Because it generates forever.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:17.280]   Okay.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.880]   But you can't say a Pulitzer again, get to make you more money.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.640]   No, but it did.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:25.920]   I had the discussion with the Buzzfeed executive in London last week,
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.440]   where I was in the audience talking to people and I said,
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:34.960]   well, we used, we thought that in media, that environment had value, right?
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:37.280]   You want to be in Vogue, you want to be in the Globe and Mail,
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.040]   you want to be in these classy places.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.680]   And the Buzzfeed executive was there and said, that's dead.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.240]   That's gone.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:50.800]   In a post website world, environment being a classy brand and environment is meaningless.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:52.560]   And so you can't even make that argument either.
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:58.640]   I'm not sure that if you look at the universe of Buzzfeed,
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.800]   we're having a little trouble.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:06.080]   I have to apologize because Jeff's Skype is so late and we're having a very hard time
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:07.280]   going back and forth.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.240]   So just say over when you're done.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.760]   You're done.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:12.160]   Okay.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.080]   Speaking of old.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.040]   Over.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:19.440]   But I mean, if you look at the universe of Buzzfeed content,
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:23.760]   if you look at those five billion monthly views, news has got to be a rounding error.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.440]   I mean, it's not like you're going to actually save that much money, right?
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.520]   If you have a few news people here.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.200]   They got a lot of people over.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.000]   Yeah, they do.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.720]   Over.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.560]   I don't know.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:43.200]   That's the big, the big, well, let's face it, their approach is custom designed
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.800]   for the environment that we're in right now.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:49.680]   I mean, I just finished writing a post a few hours ago, Facebook and Twitter,
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.400]   and how links are disappearing.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.160]   Content exists, where it exists.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.600]   People consume it there.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:56.960]   They either share it or they don't.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.080]   No one's going to click on your damn links, especially if Facebook
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:05.360]   disappears them because it's an instant article and Twitter hides them under a menu
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.560]   in Twitter moments.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.720]   So what do you do in an environment like that?
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.320]   How do you survive?
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:13.120]   I don't know.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:18.080]   Well, it's also kind of a limited time success, right?
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.480]   Because, well, I see a couple problems with this.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:26.800]   One is, viral's great, but maybe it's just me, but I feel like
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:32.160]   it's manipulative and people feel manipulated a little bit by 26 problems,
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.480]   only anxious people will understand.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.960]   And at some point, that's what happened with Upworthy, right?
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:36.960]   True.
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:37.920]   On their Facebook feed.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:37.920]   True.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.800]   And that's why people just get angry about it.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.480]   That stuff is not working as well.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:48.240]   But the thing, the genius about BuzzFeed is that they, all they care about is
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:51.040]   triggering some sort of emotional response.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:59.360]   And in the same, they apply exactly the same kind of algorithm to advertising as they do to their
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.240]   regular content.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:02.960]   Does it provoke an emotional response?
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:12.000]   Hate, love, fear, just a strong emotion that makes you click on it or interact with it in some way?
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.280]   It doesn't necessarily matter what the emotion is.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:19.280]   And you will do it even if you feel uncomfortable.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:22.640]   In some cases, feeling uncomfortable is what makes you share it.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:29.360]   I mean, although Facebook realized that this was a real problem for them because people were feeling
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:29.680]   dirty.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.880]   Right.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:47.240]   We felt
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.240]   that.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.120]   I mean, I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.120]   I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:54.120]   I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:56.120]   I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.120]   I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.120]   I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.120]   I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.120]   I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.120]   I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.120]   I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.120]   I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.120]   I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.120]   I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.120]   I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.120]   I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.120]   I'm not going to be a fan of Facebook.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:17.120]   There's a title, show title.
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:21.120]   You're not dead.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.120]   I'm just thinking.
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:26.400]   It looks exactly the same.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.400]   I think he believes that.
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:31.400]   I think he believes that in the same way newspaper publishers believe.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:36.720]   I feel like BuzzFeed is extremely cynical.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:41.160]   I feel like it's an extraordinarily cynical effort that it really is all about.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.960]   How can we get as many clicks as possible?
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:48.920]   Now that you tell me how they monetize, which I didn't understand, it feels even more dirty
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:57.240]   and cynical because they're basically selling a notion that they could do viral native content.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.040]   Which they can, by the way.
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.040]   Yes.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.880]   In some cases, they're content.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:07.120]   I watched a video ad that, say Frank did called "Dear Kitten" or whatever.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.240]   That thing was hilarious.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.920]   I watched, it was an ad.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.080]   I knew that.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.080]   I watched the whole thing.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.440]   I've watched it several times.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:17.000]   We just watched four Geico ads in a row.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.480]   Exactly.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:25.280]   I think seeing it as a manipulative, if you understand what makes people click on things
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:30.960]   and then you orchestrate your content so that that happens, is that manipulative?
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:36.120]   Newspapers have been doing that for 100 years, trying to get people to buy newspapers,
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:40.160]   coming up with goofy headlines or images or making stuff up.
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:42.200]   It's not that this is any thing new.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:45.080]   I have a peculiarly moralistic point of view.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:50.680]   I might be a Puritan because, for instance, I know that game designers know how to make
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:58.680]   their games insanely addictive by playing upon well-known psychological tricks, Skinner
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:03.000]   box-type, Schenarian kinds of conditioning.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.080]   Just because you know how to do it, whether you're Jonah Peretti with virality or game
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:14.440]   designers with Schenarian reflexes, doesn't mean you should or it's okay if you do.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.240]   It's manipulative and it's wrong.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.000]   It's like Joseph Gebels.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.160]   Yeah, he knew how to do propaganda.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.320]   Really good.
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.200]   That doesn't mean it's okay to do it.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.120]   But is that Puritanical to me?
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.120]   Apparently it is.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.120]   Well, a little bit.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:31.880]   I mean, I'm a part of the compare buzzfeed.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:36.320]   I like to get Godwin's law into every show at some point.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:39.640]   What's that law about Hitler comes into the conversation?
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:40.640]   Godwin's law.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   Godwin's law.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:42.640]   So, congratulations.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:43.640]   Thank you.
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:44.640]   Godwin's law.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:45.640]   But is it manipulative?
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:50.000]   I mean, is it any more manipulative than what newspapers are trying to do to you?
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   Jeff, what do you think?
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   Over.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   Oftentimes no.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.720]   There's an m-call to F-me and-
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:02.720]   No.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.720]   Oh.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:08.360]   I'm going to try them on a different computer.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.360]   I'm going to call you back.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.360]   Stand by Jeff.
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:12.360]   I'll give you a call.
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:13.360]   No, I see.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.360]   Was it?
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.360]   Mm-hmm.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:18.520]   But just because newspapers do it, Matthew, doesn't mean it's okay.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:19.520]   No, no.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:25.160]   I'm not saying, well, and if they were manipulating, I'm a lot more concerned about Facebook algorithms
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:28.800]   manipulating my feed to try and get me to vote for a specific party.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:29.800]   That's creepy too.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:32.240]   Which they've admitted they do.
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:37.520]   Buzzfeed just wants to get me to read something and feel something and share something.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:46.000]   I don't see that as being, you know, a devious, like I don't see it as having, I'm doing it.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   Right?
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   I have free will.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.480]   So, when you write a headline, do you write your own headline?
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:50.480]   Go ahead, Matthew.
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.640]   I do, yeah.
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:56.080]   So when you write a headline, you think about the SEO, the clickability, the virar virality,
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.080]   the shareability.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:58.080]   Definitely.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:00.080]   You have to.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:01.080]   It's part of the job.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.080]   In fact, we write several headlines.
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.080]   Really?
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.080]   What's an SEO?
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.800]   You do A-B testing on your headlines?
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:09.880]   Oh, no, we have multiple headlines that are shown in different ways.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:10.880]   I'm trying to.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:15.840]   And so, some are designed for SEO, some are designed for social, some are designed for
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:20.640]   the tiny proportion of old people who still go to the actual article.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:21.640]   What?
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:22.640]   Okay.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:23.640]   What do you do for old people?
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.640]   You use big words?
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.640]   What do you do?
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:26.640]   Big words.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.640]   I love the adverb.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:29.640]   Very cerebral.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:35.640]   Whereas, whereas the SEO is basically stuff, all the keywords into the headline.
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.440]   And if you can have something like click here, that's great.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:41.240]   See, I guess I am a little pure attack.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:42.840]   I feel like that's wrong.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:48.000]   But like, what you should just do is do the best damn content you could write a headline
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.840]   that describes it accurately and let the chips fall where they may.
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:52.640]   But I obviously in this day and age, that's-
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:54.440]   Oh, which is what you do want to do.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:55.440]   Right.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.440]   Which is what you do want to do.
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:01.760]   But if you want what you write, I mean, there's my personal view and then there's sort
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:06.160]   of, if you're a publisher, obviously, if I write something, I would like lots of people
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:07.160]   to read it.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.440]   That's the whole reason I wrote the thing in the first place.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:12.720]   And so, if I can get more people to see it, that's good.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.720]   Up to a certain point.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:14.720]   Not by tricking them though.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.720]   To a certain point.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.720]   Right.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:17.720]   Up to a certain point.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:20.920]   So then at what point do you feel like you've manipulated people?
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:25.120]   I mean, everyone has their own, you know, did you not mention something in your headline?
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:29.600]   Did you, did you make it sound like something had happened that didn't actually happen?
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:30.600]   Right.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:31.600]   That would be wrong.
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:32.600]   You wouldn't do that.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.600]   Right.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.600]   Except it happens all the time.
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:35.600]   No, I don't know.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:36.600]   And I find that annoying.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:39.880]   And I, to me, that's a strike against an organization when they do that.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:42.640]   Maybe I'm keeping track more than others are.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:44.640]   Maybe I'm not keeping track as well as I'd like.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:48.440]   But I kind of pay attention to the source before I click a link.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:52.200]   When I see it up or the headline and intentionally don't click it.
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:55.960]   It comes back to the economic basis of the business.
[00:59:55.960 --> 01:00:01.960]   If you're being paid based, your company is making money based on eyeballs and page views
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:06.800]   and clicks and impressions, you have to get as many as you can.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:12.680]   And so then it's a kind of slippery slope down which you don't want to side.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:18.840]   Well, I admit, for instance, when we think of a show title, my general instinct is to
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:22.320]   just do something fun and funny that's kind of make, will make people want to click because
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.720]   it's funny.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.840]   But then I also note that I'm always aware of Gia be good if that happened, that thing
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.640]   that were, first of all, it should show up in the show, obviously.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.720]   It shouldn't be ahead of nowhere.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.760]   And I like it if it shows up later in the show because that might encourage somebody
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:39.880]   to keep listening to watch until they hear the title.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.280]   So that is a very kind of mild form of manipulation.
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.920]   It's a little manipulative.
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:52.640]   But and probably I would be more successful if I were more willing to do more of that.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.480]   And I don't even like to mark.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.520]   But it is a slippery slope.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:01.960]   It is a slippery slope because at some point you are going to do things where a substantial
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:07.280]   proportion or even a majority of your audience is going to think, you know, that's a little
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.680]   line, across the line.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:09.680]   Right.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.680]   But everyone has their own line.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:16.880]   So you don't know exactly when the problem is once you pass it, those people are gone.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:23.480]   They're probably going to be like, this is too dodgy or too.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.920]   And so then you can't get them back.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.800]   That's the hard part.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.120]   I'm very judgmental.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:40.840]   I just I'm getting old and I feel like I don't like this new world where virality is celebrated
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.560]   as if it's a virtue.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.480]   I know what you mean.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:52.520]   And I certainly don't like the fact that every publishing models, well, most of them
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:59.400]   other than the kind of artisanal, you know, Ben Thompson, Stretakery model, every model
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:05.440]   seems to be based on getting as huge impression numbers as you can.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.640]   All of those numbers are bogus to begin with.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:13.320]   You know, they're all based on, I mean, you can juice your impressions in any number of
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:18.040]   ways that don't actually involve people looking at your content or even being interested in
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.040]   it.
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.520]   But I mean, you know, same things happening on the video side.
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:27.160]   People are so Facebook counts a video view of someone who looks at it for three seconds.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.920]   You know, is that is anybody actually getting anything out of that content?
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:36.400]   And yet they have a gazillion video views and then ads are being sold on the basis of those.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:44.560]   Oh, we've got a one second pre-roll, you know, it's a bubble.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.320]   I'll come back in a second.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.080]   Did you hear my doorbell ring earlier?
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.280]   I love my ring.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.760]   Not only does my doorbell ring my watch goes when somebody's at my door.
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:58.880]   That's because I have this the ring video doorbell.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.520]   It's the best thing ever.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:06.280]   They just got a $28 million investment from Richard Branson of Virgin.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.880]   And the story is hysterical.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:14.040]   Branson was on his private island, Necker Island, in the British Virgin Islands.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.360]   And he vites people down there.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.640]   They have conferences and somebody was down there.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:22.960]   And all of a sudden he saw the guy take out his smartphone and start talking to somebody.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:23.960]   He said, what are you doing?
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.360]   He said, I'm answering my door.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.520]   He said, well, you're answering.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.600]   You live in England.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.680]   Yeah, I have the ring video doorbell.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.560]   I'm answering my door in England.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.960]   And Branson says, well, what show me all of this?
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.960]   Invested $28 million.
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.960]   You know why?
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:42.120]   Because this is one of those ideas you go, yes, brilliant.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:47.880]   So here's the thing, if you have a wired doorbell, which I do, if you unscrew it, it's an easy
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.880]   thing.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.880]   There's two screws holding it in.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:53.560]   You get two wires coming out of your door jam there.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.560]   Here we go.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.360]   This is all you need now to set up your ring video doorbell.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.000]   You put the mounting plate on there.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.480]   You connect up those two wires.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.120]   You put the ring video doorbell on top of it.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.120]   You pair the ring video doorbell with your Wi-Fi.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.040]   That's a quick and easy process.
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:15.040]   Now suddenly you have a doorbell that still rings your chime in your house.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.840]   Ding dong or La Cucaracha or whatever your chime does in your house.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.760]   But it also has a wide angle fisheye camera on it.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:30.120]   So you see people at your door in HD video, it has a speaker and a microphone on it too.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:33.000]   So you can talk to them.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.880]   Whoa, now things are changing because suddenly you can answer the door anywhere in the world.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:42.040]   You could say ham in the bathtub, which is great.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.720]   If it's a burglar, by the way, ring in your doorbell to see if you're home.
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.640]   Suddenly you're home, even if you're not.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.080]   If it's the UPS guy, you can just leave the package there.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:51.720]   I'll be right there.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.720]   It is awesome.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.760]   It also has a motion detector built in.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.640]   So it doesn't, not just people ringing your doorbell.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.280]   It's those kids coming on Halloween.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.480]   You could scare them.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.720]   Moo through the speaker.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.640]   It's so much fun.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:10.680]   Ring.com/twit for free FedEx shipping that in the United States, that means you could
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:13.960]   get it by Halloween and have a lot of fun from it.
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:18.040]   I tell you this thing, it's like color ID for your house.
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.080]   It's security.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.080]   It's convenience.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.400]   It is the best thing ever.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.400]   And it's very affordable.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:32.360]   200 bucks plus free shipping when you go to ring.com/twig, T-W-I-G.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.080]   By the way, it works on your smartphone.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:39.560]   The ring app on iOS or Android is awesome because you just, I can take it out and see
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:44.880]   when people arrived at my door, when my daughter got home in the middle of the night, all of
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.880]   that stuff.
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:46.880]   Ring.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.960]   Abby, I have the video right here.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:49.960]   Look at that.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.960]   Dade stamped.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.960]   Ring.com/twig.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.960]   You're going to love it.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:58.600]   Give it a try today.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:01.000]   Google has a new algorithm, the RankBrain.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.120]   That's replacing, well, they haven't replaced the algorithm in a little bit, right?
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.480]   A year or so.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.960]   We don't know a lot about it, but fortunately, there's always Danny Sullivan and he's done
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:13.960]   a FAQ.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.200]   Here's what we know about RankBrain.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:24.000]   It's using a machine learning artificial intelligence system to help sort through search results.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   Hmmm.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.920]   Bloomberg broke this story.
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:34.000]   So this is a little different than what Google, then PageRank, that what PageRank's been doing,
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   right?
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   This is machine learning.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.400]   It's getting better, presumably, over time.
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:46.880]   This doesn't replace PageRank, but it does work within PageRank.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:52.880]   Yeah, it says it's designed to focus on the types of queries that don't fit because they,
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:59.040]   either unique or they, so they're not, it's hard to relate them to previous queries.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.800]   So it works on those ones.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:06.600]   Google's goal always to get better search results in this, in the sense that give you
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:12.920]   something closer to what you were looking for when you typed that query into that window.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:18.600]   The Hummingbird algorithm is the algorithm that Google's been using since the middle
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:26.040]   of 2013, but this will be added to Hummingbird as a part of it.
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.040]   There's other parts.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:30.440]   I ended up paying when pay day to fight spam.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.920]   Pigeon improves local results.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:35.080]   Top heavy to sign to promote ad heavy.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:38.160]   I'm sorry, demote ad heavy pages.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.160]   Mobile friendly.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.000]   That's such a boring name.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   What do you think it does?
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.240]   Rewards mobile friendly pages and pirate designed to fight copyright infringement.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:56.040]   So thank you, Danny Sullivan, for explaining all of this.
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.280]   This is just crazy.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:05.080]   Google, he says, has spoken of having more than 200 major ranking signals that are evaluated
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:09.240]   and in turn might have up to 10,000 variations or sub signals.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:14.480]   In other words, there's a lot going on, or at least it's in Google's interest to make
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.520]   you think there's a lot going on.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:22.400]   One of the first and second most important signals, Danny, says Google won't tell us,
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:29.640]   even though we asked twice, it's annoying, please, but pretty pleased with sugar on the
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.240]   top.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.980]   It's annoying, Danny writes it arguably a bit misleading that Google won't explain the
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:36.480]   top two.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.560]   The Bloomberg article was no accident.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.240]   Google wants some PR about what it considers to be its machine learning breakthrough, but
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.480]   to really assess that breakthrough, it would be helpful to know the other most important
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.520]   factors that Google uses now.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.320]   Yeah, but Google hates talking about those.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.320]   It's like to see them every time.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.320]   Right.
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:57.520]   And every time it says, can't talk about that because then people will figure out how to
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.520]   game it.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.520]   Right.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.520]   I'll blame them.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.800]   Yeah, there's an up gaming that goes on already.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:09.120]   Having been forced to use Bing for a while because I got a new Microsoft Surface Book,
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.120]   I really appreciate what Google does.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.680]   Things not bad.
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.040]   It's just not as good.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.040]   Just not great.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.840]   Well, there's some and this is from day one.
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:26.600]   The first time I used Google was more than 10 years ago, 15 years ago, almost.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.600]   It was immediately and apparently better.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.440]   Just like you'd been using Alta Vista.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.560]   It was actually orders of magnitude.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.800]   It wasn't just a little bit better.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:38.100]   And it was clear.
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:43.840]   And I think it maybe it's not so much of a golf nowadays, but it's there's something
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:46.200]   ineffable about Google search results.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200]   They're just better.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.200]   Plus, they want to keep it ineffable.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.200]   Yes.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.200]   Yes.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.800]   It's ineffable forever.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:54.800]   No effing.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:58.360]   No effingeffable.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.360]   Are you ready?
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.360]   Maybe go ahead.
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.800]   Maybe Jeff could talk to the German publishers.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.800]   Probably as well.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:04.800]   He's there.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.800]   I think you're doing that.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:10.200]   Because there's still fighting with Google about whether Google should have to pay to
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.400]   display news articles.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.400]   Right.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.400]   So what are we doing?
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:23.600]   Is Jeff Kaput, as they would say, Al Fiedersehen?
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.600]   I'll tell you what.
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:28.000]   I'll show you Google Frightgeist.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.400]   You've heard of Google Zeitgeist.
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:34.480]   Well, this is Zeitgeist for Halloween.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.400]   And if you dare.
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:42.880]   So, what I...
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.200]   This is not that skull.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.720]   Top costume in Fairbanks, Alaska.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.720]   Pirate.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:49.720]   Top...
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.480]   I wonder what the top costume is around my neck of the woods.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:55.200]   Poison Ivy from Batman.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.960]   Las Vegas is Harley Quinn.
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.200]   Star Wars in the same.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.360]   My daughter's costume.
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.360]   Is she?
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.360]   She's Harley Quinn.
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.920]   It's going to be Harley Quinn yet.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:04.920]   Wonder Woman.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.400]   Well, trend...
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.400]   These are...
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.880]   Oh, and Al Pina, Michigan.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:15.600]   The number one costume is Daenerys Taguerian.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.440]   The master mother of dragons.
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.520]   And in Presque Isle, Maine.
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.520]   Clown.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:27.360]   They don't have a lot of...
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.400]   Oh, number one is Harley Quinn.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.840]   Your daughter wins the prize.
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:32.340]   There you go.
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:35.840]   What does Harley Quinn look like?
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:38.760]   Well, just do a Google image search.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:41.880]   I probably could just click this button, couldn't I?
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:47.360]   You have a frighteningly high chance of seeing a Harley Quinn costume at a party this year.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.560]   Look at the trend!
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:54.120]   My daughter went to one of those Comic-Con things.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.520]   And there were like 800 Harley Quinns, I think.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:01.240]   You know, this is very Google because lots of numbers and graphs, but not one picture
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.720]   of Harley Quinn.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:11.840]   You just should know, my daughter always wanted to be a fairy, a various variations of a fairy,
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:16.760]   a witch fairy, a superhero fairy, but there was always a fairy in there somewhere.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.960]   Very is a good go to.
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:20.800]   There's a lot of comic book stuff here.
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:23.800]   Harley Quinn's Star Wars superhero.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:29.520]   By the way, superhero's trending down, pirate trending down, Batman trending down, Minnie
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:33.640]   Mouse, which is number seven trending down.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:39.200]   Minnie's trending down, Joker trending up.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:45.600]   Well wait a second, here in North Platte or whatever it is, it says it's superhero.
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.880]   Well, what the hell's that?
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:48.880]   Generic superhero?
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:53.000]   It's not like I'm going as comic book character.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.880]   What is superhero?
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:59.160]   That doesn't mean nothing.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:05.440]   So this is based on searches.
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:08.480]   Oh, I see for costumes.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.480]   For costumes.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.680]   So people are typing in super.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.080]   I don't know which one I want to be.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.240]   Just give me a bunch of them.
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:16.240]   Superhero.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.240]   Okay.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.800]   So it says type to summon a costume.
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.560]   Harley Quinn.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.360]   In Juneau, it's chucky.
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.360]   Oh God.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.800]   It's stuck in the grass.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:30.040]   Oh, see still no picture.
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.880]   All right.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.680]   North Platte, Nebraska, Harley Quinn costume is.
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:38.760]   Oh, are these in real time searches coming in?
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:39.760]   I wonder.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.040]   There's something fun.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.240]   This seems to be dropping into it.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.240]   This is.
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.240]   Whoa, golf board.
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:46.640]   Oh, that's cave woman.
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.320]   Cave woman.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.320]   Golf port Louisiana.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.960]   I've lost it now.
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:54.600]   Cave woman.
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.600]   You're bouncing around.
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.560]   It's hard to.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:02.120]   Hippie in Grand Junction, Colorado.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.120]   Are you sure those are costumes?
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.320]   Are they just trying to find out?
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.520]   Who's Doc McStuffins?
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.800]   Yeah, good question.
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:10.800]   Disney character.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.800]   Greenville, Minnesota nerd.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.800]   No, that one word.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.520]   Yeah, they don't have a lot of nerds there.
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.920]   What is the nerd?
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.280]   Star Wars superhero.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:24.080]   Star Wars bat girl.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.080]   I don't know.
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:29.200]   Tinker Bell's big and Twin Falls, Idaho, apparently.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.200]   There's a picture.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.960]   I see a picture of Jeff Jarvis on the screen.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:33.960]   Does that mean anything?
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:36.400]   Well, I'm working on getting a call.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.400]   I'm just getting ready for the call.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.400]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.400]   A hard time with this.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.880]   Tulsa, Oklahoma, it says owl.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:43.880]   Owl.
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.440]   Yeah, that's didn't see that coming.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.440]   Owl.
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.480]   Wow.
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.440]   Is it woodsy owl or just general owl?
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.440]   I don't know.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.560]   It just says owl.
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:57.200]   Apparently Google, I didn't know this, but according to Engagic, Google's doing a second
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.480]   hunt on hub router.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.640]   The first was built by a Taiwanese company called TP Link.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:07.080]   This one's going to be built by another Taiwanese company called ASUS.
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.240]   Very well known company.
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.920]   It'll be $219.99.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:21.400]   It's still a tall cylindrical device, but this one is more tapered.
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.280]   It has something called wave control.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:30.920]   Apparently, you can wave your hand over the top of the hub to boost the speed to a particular
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:31.920]   device.
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:32.920]   What?
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:39.160]   So you're like, you're making wave in the Wi-Fi over to the device.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.320]   This way, this way.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.320]   Over here.
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.320]   Come here, Wi-Fi.
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:47.560]   So I guess you set which device you want that command to refer to, and then you wave
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:48.560]   and it boosts the signal.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.640]   Oh, so use the app.
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.240]   You select the device and then you go.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:16:01.360]   I got to think, if they don't incorporate something like Alexa into that, someone is not doing their
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.360]   job.
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:03.360]   Alexa.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:07.280]   I decided not to do it eventually.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:15.840]   I decided not to buy the on hub because my friend Ron Amadio, I think it was Ron who
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.600]   did the speed testing on it, said it was slow.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.600]   Really?
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:25.080]   So I bought a a Seuss AC3200 router.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.680]   So maybe a Seuss will do a better job than a TP link.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.680]   I don't know.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.080]   We should have Jeff back.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:33.080]   Ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.560]   I'm sorry, guys.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.120]   Oh, this is good.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.120]   Look, Dad.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.120]   He's not dead.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.120]   He's thinking.
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.120]   I'm just thinking, Dad.
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.120]   You got a show title here.
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.120]   Wow.
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:52.640]   I still have the on hub router because I didn't return it in time.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:53.640]   So I'm stuck with it.
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.960]   Have you set it up with a Jake set it up?
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.160]   Jake, Jake, I didn't really make any difference.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.160]   It didn't make a difference.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.440]   My office would be hard to work because we have two more than one router.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:04.640]   I don't want to spend 200 bucks on a router that doesn't make a difference.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:08.800]   I thought the trend in rotors was to have like 45 antennas and lines.
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:09.800]   Money is six.
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.440]   It looks like an upside down spider that died.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.440]   So Google just decided to screw it.
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:17.640]   We're going no antennas.
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.720]   And very few lights.
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:26.040]   My lights, the lights on my AC3200 are so bright that they're actually quite distracting.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:32.880]   So I ended up downloading an alternative firmware that allows me to turn off the light.
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:35.080]   So now it just looks like a dead black spider.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.560]   I love it.
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.560]   A giant.
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:38.560]   Look at that.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.760]   Could it just put tape or something over it?
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.760]   But you had to download new firmware.
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.320]   I'm all about the firmware.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.280]   It's all about the firmware, man.
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.280]   Imagine that thing.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.760]   And then there's look, look at this.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.560]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.200]   There's like 10 lights on it.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:58.240]   They're blinking furiously and they're bright white LEDs.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.320]   So I know I had to disable those.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:03.160]   That was, that was crazy.
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:06.400]   But it's a very, I will say is a very good router.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:09.000]   Yeah, mine only has three antennas, I feel.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.040]   Oh yeah, no, you're not working hard.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:14.960]   This is a tri-band router.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.160]   So somebody in the chat room is giving me the link.
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.160]   Is this to the new on hub?
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:20.160]   Goon.google.com.
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.400]   But all it does is you wave it and they can change devices.
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:27.720]   It doesn't sound like it's worth, you have another 20 bucks.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:32.400]   I'm really puzzled by the on hub plan here.
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:36.000]   I don't, I don't get what they're up to.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   Why do they need another one?
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:47.000]   It's the same software on the phone and it keeps getting better.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   Future friendly, always improving, stays secure.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   Oh, it says it has multiple antennas.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000]   They're just arranged in a unique circular pattern.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   Well, the other one was supposed to have multiple antennas too.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   No blinking lights, Leo.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   It says, yeah, they specifically address this.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000]   It says dimmable lighting.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000]   And no spider like antennae.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   Huh.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   Hmm.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   And it auto updates, I think.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   And that's something Google pioneered with Chrome and I think that's a good thing.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000]   Well, I don't know.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   I'm very happy with my spider like antennae.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   Tennis and tinnies.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   Waving is so strange.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   That's weird.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   I don't know.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   I don't, I think that that's completely superfluous.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000]   So what's going on with the, we were talking about this while you weren't here, Jeff.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   The German publishers and Google.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   So they're keeping the war on where they're going to go up to the copyright thing and they're
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   going to go into court and I don't know that they have a very good case actually.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   They've been terrible.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   They're just trying to call it continue the war.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:10.800]   They say according to Google that this is Google's Central Europe chief Philippe Joustus said on
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:19.040]   Monday in Berlin, altogether we pass on half a billion clicks a month to German publishers.
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:23.240]   That's a lot of results that the publishers are risking losing, right?
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.720]   Well, and here's the funny thing about it.
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:29.600]   So actual Springer, which is one of the two leaders of this, the Springer and Burger
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:35.000]   are the two companies, actual Springer did join in with Facebook in scenarios.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.360]   But they're not trying to charge Facebook anything.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.080]   Yeah, it's weird.
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:44.960]   Springer said a two week old experiment to restrict access by Google to some of its publications
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:50.920]   had caused web traffic to plunge for those sites, leading it to.
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:52.400]   Yeah, that's why it seems so dumb.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:58.440]   I mean, they already know what's going to happen if Google withdraws or like a Springer said,
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.600]   it was something on the order of 40% of their traffic.
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:04.480]   And Google has shown that publishers are going to go after antitrust.
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:07.280]   They're going to try to say, well, they're just too powerful.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.840]   Right.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:13.560]   Google has shown their willingness to step away as they did in Spain.
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.040]   I would worry if I were them a little bit.
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:19.160]   Jeff, can you pronounce the ancillary copyright law?
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:20.240]   Oh, yeah, he can pronounce it.
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.280]   The Leisten Schutzrecht.
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.400]   There's a maybe you don't know, Matthew.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.600]   There's an entire reggae.
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.760]   So recording of this based on Jeff's pronunciation.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.880]   You can't see me live.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.360]   You can hear me.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.000]   Oh, that's awesome.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.640]   And now I can see it ad free on YouTube.
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:39.040]   You become a meme.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:40.320]   That's when you know you've made it.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:41.360]   He's a meme.
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:46.120]   Well, it's not the hugest meme ever.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.360]   No.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.000]   Speaking of memes.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:49.640]   Yes.
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:50.600]   Speaking of memes.
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:51.720]   Have you found this?
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:55.200]   So I had two of my quotes ended up on some meme maker, right?
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:00.200]   And so now there are all these fake Twitter accounts that do nothing but throw up the meme
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.640]   and they throw up my address on it.
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.800]   So it's quite as I mentioned speed.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:05.320]   Is that happening to you?
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.080]   What's the meme?
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:09.480]   Well, it's just like two quotes that I did.
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.480]   I don't know what they were.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.040]   There was, you know, oh, here's one.
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:13.200]   One just came up.
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:17.680]   Where some see a new world disorder or others see the opportunity to bring organization.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.040]   Not a very good quote.
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:22.720]   But it's some talk to me maker and then there's fake accounts that throw them in there.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:27.720]   Another one is the only same response to change is to find the opportunity in it.
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.400]   So these are kind of nonsense quotes.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.480]   No, they're not nonsense.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:32.480]   Got it.
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.480]   I got it.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:34.480]   My bad.
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:35.480]   Not really.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.480]   I'm not.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:37.480]   Watch yourself.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:39.480]   What the burden there nonsense.
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:43.760]   Your health, French.
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:46.960]   So these are random snippets.
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:52.240]   Out of context snippets of Jarvis isms.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.640]   And it sounds like spammers might be using this.
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:23:02.920]   I've seen this before with spammers where they just take random tweets to make them
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.280]   look like a real account so that the Twitter.
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.280]   This is basically the same thing.
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:08.280]   Yeah.
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:10.120]   They go to be they go to be they will be mean makers.
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:14.560]   I presume all the spammers and throw them in there until they all the fake account.
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:17.600]   They quotes all kinds of crap and it just it just quarters it up.
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:22.080]   And again, you know, how much of Twitter's usage is this junk?
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:27.760]   Well, bots are a huge part of Twitter's like, yeah, and the same thing is they can't even
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:28.760]   manage to grow that.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:34.160]   That's a good way to do a whole show of Twitter.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.720]   I hope you can count.
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:36.720]   Let's start.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:48.640]   Sort of US users.
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:53.080]   The stock market has been punishing this week.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.840]   The shares fell 11%.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:59.880]   And I think a lot of it is that they can't keep the toward grows up.
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:02.000]   They had reported 200.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.600]   I'm sorry, 320 million average monthly active monthly users.
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:11.160]   It's up a mere four million from the previous quarter.
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.720]   Revenues are not bad.
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:14.720]   Revenues $569 million.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:16.520]   That's up 58%.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:19.720]   And grow it quite healthy growth.
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:24.600]   The problem is that they went public, you know, and people expected certain things like
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.720]   you're going to be the next Facebook or whatever.
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:33.520]   And it's so just showing healthy growth in revenue is not it's not enough.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.240]   You know, it's sad, but it's not enough.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:38.440]   Well, you saw that Jack gave away some of his stock employees.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.240]   Yeah, I gave away a lot.
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.640]   Yeah, 200 million worth.
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:42.640]   Right.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:45.640]   You know, in the sense of the generous act, the sense of the kind of thing.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:47.640]   What the hell?
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:50.920]   Well, it needs to still worth a billion and a half or something.
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:57.000]   So they ran their first TV commercial last night during the World Series.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.680]   Do you want to watch it and listen to it?
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.160]   It goes very fast.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:08.640]   And I don't know if it's as good an ad for Twitter, frankly, the McDonald's ads.
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.480]   Have you seen the McDonald's breakfast ads?
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.680]   I don't know if you have this in Canada.
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:13.680]   McDonald's?
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:16.880]   Yeah, we have McDonald's.
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:25.360]   McDonald's three or four weeks ago decided to add breakfast all day long so you can get
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.480]   your McMuffin in the afternoon.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:29.120]   Yeah, it's done well for them, I think.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:30.520]   I think it's done very well.
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:35.800]   And the ad campaign for it is brilliant and frankly is probably the best Twitter ad.
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.840]   Let me show you first the Twitter ad and then we'll compare it to the McDonald's ad which
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.160]   Twitter didn't have to pay for.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.160]   Maybe they did.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.160]   I don't know.
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:51.920]   Actually, if you're listening, you're seeing nothing.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:58.360]   It's just a bunch of basically, I would say, viral videos associated with tweets around
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.560]   the baseball world series.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:02.000]   And I'm sorry about the blue juice.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.920]   There's a heck out of everybody out there.
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:09.440]   Well, in Far Hot Minds you tweeted, was that one of my tweets in there?
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.280]   It went so fast.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.960]   You can't even read them and apparently that's the kids.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.720]   The kids love that.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:19.960]   Now let me show you the McDonald's breakfast ad because I think it's a much better.
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:23.680]   Wait a minute, hold on a second.
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:24.680]   This is something else.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.080]   I don't know what I'm getting now.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:31.280]   Those are the all day breakfast ads for McDonald's.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:36.000]   If I can find them.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.360]   TV ad.
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.320]   TV commercial.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:45.280]   Google, you suck.
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.920]   All right, here we go.
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:51.200]   This is from iSpot.tv.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:52.200]   Is this the one?
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.640]   I don't think this is the one I was looking for.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:59.080]   I'm looking for the one that has all the tweets.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.960]   Let me refine my Google search.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.440]   I'm not real good at the Google.
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.720]   Just give me a second.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.920]   You should watch a show about it.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.720]   It's pretty new.
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:14.120]   I wish there were something on this.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.920]   Yeah, because they announced this on October 6th.
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:19.840]   So it's only been a few weeks.
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:20.840]   They have three ads.
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:22.240]   Yeah, here we go.
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:23.440]   But can I play them?
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:24.760]   Yeah, here we go.
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:29.040]   I think these are better ads, frankly, for Twitter than the Twitter ads.
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.040]   #L8.
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.040]   Freet.
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.880]   Then remembered McD's all day be fast.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.880]   #BoomShakaLakaLaka.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:35.880]   @McDowndlaka.
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:36.880]   Yes!
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:37.880]   #AllDayBreakfast.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:38.880]   So good.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:41.840]   You're McDonald's serving breakfast all day now.
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:42.840]   Black Gold Hannah Moaches.
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:43.840]   #Bae.
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:44.840]   @KazgoMookie.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:45.840]   #MookiePoseShow.
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:46.840]   Here at McDonald's.
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.640]   Thank you for serving all day breakfast.
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:49.640]   Hardermo.
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:50.840]   Maybe Twitter helped pay for this.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:51.840]   retweet.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.080]   Favorite your retweet.
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.000]   It's time for #AllDayBreakfast.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.360]   Smiley Tung Face emoji.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:00.240]   But I'm guessing that McDonald's thought this would be good if we could get a viral...
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.840]   That is pretty good.
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:07.120]   And it's a better ad for the value of Twitter, the social aspect of Twitter than anything
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.120]   Twitter.
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:09.840]   The Twitter ad was terrible for that.
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:13.160]   But yeah, my fear with the Twitter ad is that it's going to be...
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:14.920]   It's just so confusing.
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:16.920]   Like one of my friends will be doing.
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:17.920]   And it's overwhelming.
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:24.920]   But it's overwhelming.
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:25.920]   Right.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:31.240]   It's an ad for the new feature of Twitter that nobody's really that interested in, which
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:32.240]   is Twitter's news.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.040]   But it looks like chaos, basically.
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.040]   Moments.
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:37.840]   Like I am so overwhelmed.
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:38.840]   Right.
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.560]   But we're old.
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.000]   So maybe it's not designed for us.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000]   I don't know.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.400]   In a way, McDonald's breakfast, All Day Breakfast is such a success that it's actually making
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:52.320]   some of the franchisees go bankrupt.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.320]   What?
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:58.720]   Because they have to keep the grills going for two kinds of meals.
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:00.240]   And they're pissed.
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:03.120]   It's actually costing them a lot of money.
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.960]   However, I think a huge success from the point of view of their customers.
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:13.120]   And by the way, you can't say that for Twitter's moments, which I think we all agree is baffling.
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:17.240]   I mean, and that's what the ad was for.
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:19.200]   And Twitter ad was for.
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:26.000]   So the thing I mentioned about the concerns me about moments that I put in this post I
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000]   did was it's great.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.680]   So you look at the moment, you're like, Oh, that's a cool image.
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:34.080]   And that's a great whatever vine or something.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:40.080]   But if you want to find the underlying link to the thing, you can't.
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:43.520]   It takes like three clicks, you have to go to the little dots and then you have to go
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:46.640]   to view tweet and then you have to.
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:50.160]   And nobody in there, no one is ever going to do that.
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:51.160]   Even I didn't want to do that.
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:53.160]   And it's my job.
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:58.280]   My first reaction looking at it was, well, this is to solve the onboarding problem that
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:02.160]   Twitter has, which is that new people come to Twitter and have no, they're not following
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:03.160]   anybody.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:06.720]   So there's nothing compelling at all on Twitter and they go, well, what's the big deal?
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.880]   And then they tell you nobody knows.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:12.920]   And one of the interesting things about moments is you can follow them.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:17.080]   And then after the news event or whatever it is is over, you unfollow it.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.280]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.680]   Oh, yeah, which is interesting.
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:24.640]   So let's say you're following the Benghazi hearings for who knows why.
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:29.000]   And then so you follow the moment and then you get updates from that.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.520]   And then once it's over, you sort of unfollow it.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.520]   Will you get tweets?
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:37.880]   Well, you get, yeah, the moment in your tweet stream or what will you.
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:38.840]   Yeah.
[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:42.880]   And so you from so updates to the moment.
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:43.880]   I don't see this.
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:44.880]   You know what?
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:46.640]   I remember that at the beginning, but I think they've taken that out.
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:49.160]   I don't see the follow button anymore.
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:51.680]   Where is it?
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:53.720]   I want to follow that runaway blimp.
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:56.360]   But all right, here's this is some.
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.360]   Oh, here.
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:58.360]   Oh, I see it.
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.360]   There it is.
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:00.360]   There's one follow.
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:01.360]   So it has to be something that's current.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.360]   Okay.
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.360]   Which is actually a handy feature.
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:08.440]   But and I think they're trying to follow the GOP debate though.
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:11.000]   They're trying to lower the barriers to entry, right?
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.720]   So if you want, if you're interested in X, then you find a moment about it and you follow
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:20.920]   it, you don't have to find all the underlying accounts and follow that.
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:23.600]   And I could see the rationale there.
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.360]   And I assume they're hoping that people will get kind of sucked into it and then they'll
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:31.800]   go through the process of actually following individual accounts.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:33.560]   Well, here's a puzzle.
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:36.120]   So I'm looking at today's moments on my feed.
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:38.680]   And by the way, it doesn't matter because it's the same on everybody's feed, right?
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:40.000]   It's not an anyway, custom.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:45.240]   I see one one follow button for the World Series game.
[01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:46.760]   Let's go to news and he follow buttons.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.280]   No, the GOP debates coming up.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:49.640]   No follow button.
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:54.120]   That's probably something I would want to follow is the tweets around that.
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:32:01.120]   Mets Royals is the only there's one story in all five pages that have a follow button.
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:02.120]   So what's that?
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:03.120]   Everyone.
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:04.120]   It used to be.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:06.120]   Is this all humanly created?
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.120]   Yes.
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:10.560]   All supposed to be created by Twitter staff.
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:14.840]   And so eventually I think there are partners they're working with who are going to like
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:20.800]   the post, Washington Post, who are going to create their own moments.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:25.520]   But the one thing the one thing that's missing for me is a little bit of personalization.
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:29.520]   Like if they could show me moments that well, that end links.
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:31.360]   This is the same problem I have with Apple's news.
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:35.040]   Well I guess following should be that level of, I mean it's like circa, it should be that
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:37.040]   level of personalization.
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:39.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.040]   You have to pay.
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.040]   Maybe that's coming.
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:44.120]   Oh, the follow are the follow buttons paid?
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:47.120]   Somebody in the shower said you have to pay to get a follow button.
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:48.120]   Really?
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:49.120]   I don't know.
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:50.120]   Really?
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:51.880]   Maybe the customer service.
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:52.880]   Hmm.
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:55.840]   So maybe they only do them for partners.
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:57.080]   So what happens to Twitter?
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:59.120]   Their stock is tanking.
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:00.760]   Growth is slowing.
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:03.360]   Back door sees come on and that was for a while.
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:06.160]   You know, he was the white knight, but he's got.
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:08.040]   You know what the best thing would be?
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:09.040]   What?
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:10.680]   Is if someone took Twitter private?
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:12.360]   Hmm, I agree.
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:13.360]   I think if...
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.360]   What's the matter?
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.160]   You're going to walk the market cap now.
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:17.160]   Hmm.
[01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:18.160]   It's getting less.
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:20.160]   TWTTR, is that the stock?
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:22.160]   It was 20 billion I think.
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:25.160]   It's 20 billion price for whatever.
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:27.160]   Yeah.
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.160]   Who's the paid problem?
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:30.400]   The way it's going to go private is a Facebook or Google.
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:32.400]   I think it was waiting for the price to come down.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.400]   Is it?
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:34.400]   Yeah.
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:36.000]   You know, Apple's got $200 billion in the bank.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000]   They got to do something.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000]   That's a 10%!
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000]   That's my fault.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:43.280]   I mean, this one mentioned is better than Apple News.
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:44.280]   Yeah.
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:47.600]   I think Apple can't use Twitter, but maybe...
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.760]   Google could, I think.
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:51.600]   Maybe Google could, yeah.
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:54.320]   We've talked about that before and I thought maybe that's why I'll need to...
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:55.320]   Well, they don't.
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:00.320]   I'm going to Twitter to be their executive chairman of the board.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:01.320]   I did.
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:04.960]   There's a story that saw the rundown today, but just amazed me in terms of the value of
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:12.300]   data, you saw that IBM bought the non-
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:13.300]   What?
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:14.300]   What did they buy?
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:15.300]   They bought all the sort of data.
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:16.300]   The analytics.
[01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:18.300]   They bought the weather...
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:19.540]   But they didn't buy the weather channel.
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:21.400]   They bought everything but the channel.
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:22.640]   Yeah, nobody was.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:30.160]   David Kenny, who's a brilliant guy, he was the CEO of Akamai.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.520]   He was a major league at executive at Publicis.
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:36.720]   And he took over the weather channel and he was like, "What are you doing?"
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:38.080]   And what's what's weather?
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:40.160]   But he really made it into a data company.
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:42.120]   And so that's what IBM just bought.
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:43.120]   Yeah.
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.520]   Was all the sensors and the analytics around that.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:46.520]   Interesting.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:47.520]   Pretty amazing.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:50.000]   So data is the new content, right?
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.800]   Well, in weather prediction, weather prediction in analytics is a huge, huge...
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:58.640]   Two billion dollar acquisition.
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:04.640]   That's what check crunch says.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.480]   Or the Wall Street Journal says the weather is worth two billion dollars.
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:12.080]   They bought weather.com.
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.080]   They're digital assets.
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.720]   Oh no, I'm being blocked.
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.080]   Okay, here we go.
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:20.360]   IBM, but not the cable network.
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.360]   Not the cable network.
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:23.360]   Not the cable network.
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:24.360]   What's that?
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:25.360]   Nobody wants it.
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:26.360]   You know, it's funny.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.360]   It's a fire sale.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:31.800]   NBC Universal acquired weather in 2008 for three and a half billion.
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:33.960]   If you looked at...
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:39.320]   I looked at some recent TV numbers for things like ESPN and, you know, in terms of loss of
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:44.440]   subscribers and at the top in double digits was the weather channel.
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:47.880]   I think it's like 26% or something.
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:49.160]   You know what's going to be worth?
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:55.560]   The next big hurricane, which will probably be this winter, it's going to be worth it.
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:56.560]   They get...
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.560]   Weather so many other places though.
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:01.240]   These are some numbers, Jeff, you could use for your number of the week.
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:05.240]   The weather company is the first, the fourth most visited mobile app in the US.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:10.360]   26 billion inquiries daily to its cloud-based services.
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:11.360]   Wow.
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:12.360]   The crap.
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:16.640]   Four gigs of data a second are generated.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.640]   Four gigs a second.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:23.640]   IBM will use Watson to tell...
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:26.920]   I'm not too sure it's a fire sale, but the channel...
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:27.920]   Yeah.
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:28.920]   ...has it...
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:29.920]   ...having carriage is worth something.
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:31.560]   And they've got carriage.
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:33.360]   Well, they didn't take the channel.
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:34.360]   That's the thing they didn't take.
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:35.360]   Well, you're saying...
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.320]   ...and we're saying that you have the value of the channel plus the value you've sold.
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:47.320]   Three billion weather forecast reference points, 40 million mobile phones, 50,000 flights per
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.320]   day.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.520]   I don't know what that...
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:51.520]   That's something...
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.320]   40 million mobile phones, does that mean they use...
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:54.320]   Does the weather channel use sensors?
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:55.320]   What?
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.320]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.320]   You know what?
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:59.880]   I have a weather app that asks me, "What's the weather like right now?"
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:00.880]   And then I tell it.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:01.880]   The 40 million...
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:02.880]   It's called Sunshine.
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:04.880]   40 million, yeah, maybe.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:12.400]   I must admit, I was a little confused when I saw the news, but then the more I thought
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:18.400]   about it, the more people we were talking about it on Twitter makes sense because weather
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:21.080]   is such a huge source of data.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.080]   That's what IBM...
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:27.840]   So presumably they were working with the weather company before to license that data.
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:28.840]   And now they just own it.
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:29.840]   And what are the license back?
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:34.840]   They're going to license back this data for the first time in a long period of time.
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:37.840]   And the other thing that the story said was that IBM...
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:39.840]   Well, this is not a weather play.
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:45.240]   This is an Internet of Things play, and a sensors play, and IBM will move into new areas like
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:47.360]   this out of this acquisition.
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:48.360]   Yes.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:49.360]   New industries.
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:50.360]   I don't know what that means.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:51.360]   Big data, baby.
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.520]   That's what it means.
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.920]   The more you know, the more you can sell.
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:59.120]   I think that is a good point about Twitter, though, which I think was Jeff's point that
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.120]   it has a lot of data.
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.120]   Right.
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:05.720]   And that's the reason why Google wanted Twitter to come back to the table and do a deal with
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:10.640]   it, which they did just recently after years and years of not getting Twitter data.
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:15.520]   One of the reasons they wanted it was that real time sort of intent, you know, people
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:20.320]   tweeting about, "I'm going to do this," or, "I'm feeling that," or, "I'm looking at this."
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:24.320]   That's hugely important.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:28.320]   Whether it's worth $20 billion, I don't know.
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:34.320]   Here's data about seven years of Google Chrome launched in September 2008 from the Google
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.320]   Operating System blog.
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:39.320]   Oh, it's been dialogue.
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:41.960]   February.
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:51.920]   It says, "Chrom's market share went from 0 to 53 percent in seven years.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:57.040]   I ease decline from 67 percent to 15 percent.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:01.760]   Chrome is now, according to Stackcounter, the dominant browser, IE and Firefox, continue
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.560]   to lose market share."
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:06.720]   Any of you use Firefox?
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:07.720]   No.
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:10.600]   Steve Gibson does, but he's a contrarian.
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:14.560]   The green line in this graph, I know it's kind of hard to see, the green line in this
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:16.520]   graph is Chrome.
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:20.080]   The blue line is IE.
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:22.560]   The orange line is Firefox.
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:26.040]   The red line is Opera.
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.480]   The gray line is everything else.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:30.280]   Safari is a gray line, I'm sorry.
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:32.360]   Safari climbing a little bit.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:35.960]   Everybody else going down, except Chrome, which is growing very steadily.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:41.800]   I did have someone tell me that they were moving back to Firefox from Chrome, because
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:44.040]   they found Chrome was crashing a lot.
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:45.480]   I go back and forth.
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:50.400]   A lot of people do, because sometimes one uses a lot of memory and the other one doesn't,
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.880]   vice versa.
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:53.880]   But I'm so invested at this point in Chrome.
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:56.920]   It has all my bookmarks, it has all my extensions.
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:01.480]   If you use Chrome OS as Jeff does, you're really invested.
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:05.360]   All your apps are in Chrome.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:06.360]   Chrome does not work.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:11.240]   I see Chrome having the login kick came in handy.
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:16.720]   It comes in handy because everything I go to, I tell Chrome to remember the password.
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:22.120]   Of course, the downside is you need some of the access to your Chrome.
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:28.720]   When I was in Italy, and my stack got stolen, the first thing I did was change my Google
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:34.160]   password, which instantly logs you out of every instance of Chrome that you have so
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:36.720]   that no one could get access to all those passwords.
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:43.040]   The important little tip, if you have syncing protected by a password, which I do, when
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:46.960]   you change your Google password, it does not change that syncing password.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:50.480]   So my sync password is my old Google password still.
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:52.680]   I didn't know there was a password on the screen.
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:54.360]   Yeah, look in your Chrome browser.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:57.800]   A little tip there.
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:00.600]   Why would you password protect the sync?
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:01.960]   For that very reason.
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:02.960]   Okay.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:07.160]   My friend, you don't want it to just sync randomly to anybody who installs Chrome under
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:08.680]   your account.
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:10.880]   That would be a bad thing.
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:11.880]   True.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.840]   The Lysone's over.
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:17.760]   It clicks over two settings.
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:19.000]   And now ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000]   The Lysone's trudstrat.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.960]   The Jeff Jarvis meme machine is inside of my trudstrat.
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:26.960]   The Lysone's trudstrat.
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:29.200]   No, who made it?
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:30.800]   Yeah, some guy.
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:31.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:36.120]   It's called regamy Jeff Jarvis.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:38.240]   German regamy is not a trudstrat.
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:43.280]   No, it's a little too perfect.
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:45.080]   The Lysone's trudstrat.
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:47.760]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:50.560]   Your picks of the week, your numbers of the week, whatever else you want to do.
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:52.640]   And final words as we wrap the show up.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:57.000]   But first a word from our sponsor, PagerDuty.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.720]   I love the tagline of the PagerDuty website.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:03.280]   Your SaaS is on the line.
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:06.600]   By SaaS, they mean software as a service.
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:12.200]   If you're running an app, a website, infrastructure of any kind, you know that there's somebody
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:13.760]   on PagerDuty, right?
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:17.720]   They may not be wearing a Pager, but there's somebody on call.
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:21.840]   One hopes 24/7 in case your stuff goes down.
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:25.200]   Wouldn't you like some software that not only makes sure that the on call people get called
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:31.760]   in appropriate fashion on time, but also that you get analytics back that help you be more
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:32.760]   reliable.
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:35.840]   That's exactly what PagerDuty does.
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:41.440]   I think it's not a stretch to say almost every business relies on software and services
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:45.000]   always that always need to be up.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.080]   PagerDuty is the hub of your operations, connects all your systems into one view where you
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:53.520]   can see critical events across all your monitoring tools.
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:57.720]   Over 100 ready to use integrations, including Nagios, New Relic, that's what we use for
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:02.000]   our metrics on the website, keynote, app dynamics, and/or rolled your own.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.240]   They got a great API too.
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:05.160]   A lot of people do that.
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:08.800]   When an incident occurs, PagerDuty notifies exactly the right team and member based upon
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:14.640]   on call schedules and personalized alerting preferences.
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:20.000]   If alerts are missed, PagerDuty automatically escalates to another team member until it's
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.240]   responded to.
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:27.800]   By the way, team members love it too because alerts are de-duped and filtered, making
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:32.960]   sure that only actionable alerts are delivered.
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:37.640]   Of course, they can use whatever method they choose, not just Pager's, but phone calls,
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:40.760]   SMS, email, push notifications.
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:43.880]   It's great for the people on call and it's great for the manager who has to decrease
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:47.040]   the noise, improve reliability.
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:51.360]   PagerDuty's analytic tools will identify common problems allowing you to proactively
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:53.880]   make system improvements and prevent future outages.
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:55.640]   So it's great in both regards.
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:59.880]   By the way, they are relentless when it comes to reliability because, of course, if your
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:05.400]   Pager system goes down and your servers go down, that's a problem.
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:09.640]   PagerDuty's fully distributed across multiple data centers, multiple hosting providers,
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:16.240]   so contact method providers for every method so you'll never miss an alert.
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:19.480]   You can even customize it to fit how you and your team work.
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:27.600]   Many, many, many companies use PagerDuty, including Microsoft, GitHub, Boeing.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:34.400]   I can't think of anything that's more mission critical than building a jet airplane, Nike,
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:37.240]   Pinterest, Box.
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:39.440]   Go there right now, PagerDuty.com/twit.
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:40.440]   You get a 14-day trial.
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:43.200]   For as little as $19 a month you can increase your uptime.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:49.720]   PagerDuty, I love them.com/twit.
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:59.120]   There was somebody did a tour of one of the subway control centers that it's still using
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:02.600]   hardware from like 1910.
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:05.560]   Where was that I saw that?
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:07.360]   Oh, I'd like to see that.
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:09.240]   I'm trying to find it.
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:11.120]   Was it the Times or something like that?
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.840]   I think it was the Times, yeah.
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:14.840]   Yeah.
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:15.840]   Really cool.
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:19.840]   I'll have to find it for you, Matthew.
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:21.160]   Send it along to you.
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:26.320]   It's the same technology that runs the internet here at the Radisson Park Inn.
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:32.800]   It's a steam-powered engine behind it.
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:34.600]   They run out of coal.
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:37.040]   Yeah, it feels like that.
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:40.600]   Well, we're glad you could join us even through the magic of the--
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:42.080]   Oh, I'm sorry to be a hassle.
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:43.160]   No, you're not a hassle.
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.600]   Jeff, you're worth it.
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:47.240]   Jeff, you are worth it.
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:50.840]   Seriously.
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:53.160]   Do you want to give us a number of the week?
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:54.560]   Sure, sure.
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:58.000]   Well, so I've got an announcement to make.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:58.720]   Oh, no.
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:04.000]   We're moving to the show Tuesday mornings, and I'm going to work for Facebook.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.880]   It's going to be just like what you're experiencing right now.
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:08.760]   Oh, I know what you're talking about.
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:18.760]   And Tuesday is going to give the staff opt-in 2G Tuesdays, where they check in to Facebook.
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:23.360]   They can see what the world sees Facebook like at 2G.
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:24.640]   Which, again, is optional.
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:25.480]   It's too bad it's optional to--
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:26.480]   It's too bad it's optional to--
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.480]   --radisson park Inn.
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:28.480]   Oh, no.
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:29.480]   It's brilliant.
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:30.480]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:31.480]   Too bad it's optional.
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:32.480]   It should be required.
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:33.480]   Yeah, 2G Tuesday.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.800]   After the setup was required, but the dollar's not.
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:39.040]   Yeah, you can't make everybody do that.
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.040]   --the one-point-to-one part.
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:41.040]   Yeah.
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:45.800]   But that's a great idea, because I think a lot of websites and certainly apps are designed
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:47.840]   for the high-speed internet.
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:52.160]   And as soon as you get-- I've been on 2G using T-Mobile in Europe, for instance.
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:55.160]   And you really realize, you know, those things are very heavy.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:59.760]   Facebook does have a low bandwidth Facebook light app, apparently, that they offer in
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:00.760]   areas where they're--
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:07.240]   I remember who someone forced their staff to use the mobile version of the site.
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:08.240]   Was that Facebook?
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:09.240]   Someone was--
[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:10.240]   Facebook did, yeah.
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:12.240]   Which is a great idea.
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:18.240]   Like, just to experience it the way someone else would on a mobile device.
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:24.240]   It makes you happy to get back and get to your high speed, I gotta tell you.
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:27.800]   2G Tuesday.
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:32.400]   Do you, Matthew, have anything you'd like to recommend or suggest any Android goodies
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:36.560]   or Chromebooks tools or anything like that?
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:38.360]   You don't have to.
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:41.040]   It's not requirement, just for fun.
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:42.880]   I don't really have anything.
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:44.680]   My gear's all sold.
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:45.680]   There's nothing to talk about.
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:46.680]   Hold gear.
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:49.720]   I kind of like that subway.
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:50.720]   Mm-hmm.
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:51.720]   All right.
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:55.720]   Well, I think this is a good time to wrap things up.
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:59.360]   It's late at night in Berlin.
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:02.160]   Jeff has to go to the Cac Club.
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:06.840]   And George Pataki on the TV with the early debate.
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:09.160]   Oh, no, they were still running.
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:10.160]   Wow.
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:12.000]   Pataki's still around.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:15.480]   It's so funny.
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:16.480]   It's so funny.
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:22.520]   But Ben Carson's going to be our new president and I couldn't be in here.
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:24.480]   Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York.
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:25.880]   He won't be back though for a few weeks.
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:27.720]   He's a traveling man.
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:28.720]   Oh, wait.
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:30.880]   One newsletter we didn't talk about.
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:32.880]   Oh, yes.
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:37.520]   Alexis O'Hanean is reportedly dating Serena Williams.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:38.520]   What?
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:44.520]   In the category of that's just that you didn't see.
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:45.520]   That you didn't see.
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:47.120]   I do not see that coming.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:49.120]   Not see that coming.
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:51.000]   Whose report is that that you just saw?
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000]   Us Weekly.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.360]   Us Weekly, yeah.
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.360]   Exclusive.
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:55.360]   They made it lunch.
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:56.360]   It's new.
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:59.800]   He's learning tennis.
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:00.880]   She was dating Drake.
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:02.920]   Did not see that coming.
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:06.000]   Now she's dating a nerd.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000]   Says an onlooker.
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.160]   He called her babe and they held hands.
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:12.160]   Don't pay.
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:13.160]   Don't pay.
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:15.760]   No, that would know.
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:17.480]   Alexis, I love Alexis O'Hanean.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:18.480]   Good for you.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:20.480]   He's a good looking guy.
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:21.480]   Yeah.
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:22.480]   Yeah.
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:25.920]   Have you ever met Alexis?
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:27.760]   Yeah, we interviewed him on "Not Trying Ulicia."
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:28.760]   We had a great time.
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:29.760]   Great guy.
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:30.760]   Okay.
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:31.760]   So you've seen him physically?
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:32.760]   Yeah, he's not exactly.
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:34.880]   The fact he's saying he's picking up tennis now.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:38.000]   But it surprised me that he's 6'5", I think.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.160]   6'5" or 6'6".
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:40.160]   He's kind of lanky though.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:42.160]   It's a lanky 6'5".
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:44.560]   I did not expect him to be that tall.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:47.040]   Well, he was sitting down when I interviewed him.
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.920]   All the time because of the show.
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:49.920]   You're lanky.
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:50.920]   True.
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:51.920]   People do recognize me.
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:53.920]   Well, I didn't know you were tall.
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:58.160]   For the size of a little little tuition on their toes.
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:59.160]   They're pretty.
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:01.000]   Even smaller right now.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.560]   I get you look a lot older.
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:06.480]   So...
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:11.720]   All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:13.480]   We've had some fun, but the fun is over.
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:14.800]   It's time to get back to work.
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:18.560]   Thank you very much, Matthew IngramFortune.com.
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:20.240]   Great to have you here.
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:28.240]   Yeah, always enjoy when you can come down and visit us virtually via Skype.
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:32.920]   We do this week on Google 130PM Pacific 430 Eastern Time.
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:35.960]   That will be 1930 UTC next week.
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:39.360]   What are you laughing?
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:40.360]   I was losing everybody.
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:41.360]   That was the last show.
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:42.360]   Oh, it's very confusing.
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:43.360]   I'm really confused.
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:45.000]   Well, because then I get...
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.040]   I know I will get emails and tweets saying, "What are you crazy?
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:49.600]   UTC doesn't move?
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:51.720]   No, but we do."
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:56.880]   So we are going to be UTC minus eight starting on Sunday.
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:01.640]   That means all the shows next week will start kind of really at the time you expect them
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:02.640]   to start.
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:12.120]   The real problem so far is that since Europeans have fallen back that we're...
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:15.360]   They missed the first hour of the show.
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:20.800]   We should talk some time about how daylight saving time is a scam.
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:21.800]   We know it's all...
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:23.720]   We all know it's a scam.
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:25.720]   And all the evidence twice the effect...
[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:29.560]   Like I told you to say there's God's time and there's FDR's time.
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.080]   Oh, was it FDR?
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:32.600]   No.
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:34.240]   I thought it was even more recent than that.
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:36.160]   I thought it was in the '50s that they...
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:37.160]   No, no, no, no.
[01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:38.160]   I think it was back then.
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:39.640]   Well, what's the...
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:40.640]   Okay, Google.
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:44.160]   When did daylight saving time start?
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:46.160]   Not going to be the same last week.
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:49.200]   It's just going to say last week.
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:50.200]   But we know that it doesn't...
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:51.200]   It doesn't save lives.
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:52.200]   Doesn't save energy apparently.
[01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:53.200]   No.
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:54.200]   Because it's a push because of air conditions.
[01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:55.200]   Who's up, people?
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:56.200]   Sleep patterns.
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:59.200]   People used in Europe in 1916.
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:13.560]   In the US it was first introduced in 1918 when the world was inside into the law during
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.280]   the World War I.
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:20.760]   Barked by Robert Garland, a Pittsburgh industrialist who had encountered the idea in the United
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:21.760]   Kingdom.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:23.200]   This is a terrible idea.
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:26.080]   A passionate campaigner for the use of DSP in the US.
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:29.600]   He is often called the father of daylight savings.
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:32.200]   A proud man.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:36.840]   And then FDR instituted a year round in 1942.
[01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:41.240]   So it wasn't year round until FDR did it.
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:42.240]   All right.
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:46.720]   In other words, it's a relatively recent thing and we could certainly get rid of it.
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:49.280]   I think we should just get rid of time zones.
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:53.280]   Whoa, now you're talking crazy.
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:55.280]   Somebody...
[01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:56.280]   Somebody...
[01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:57.800]   Let's go metric.
[01:52:57.800 --> 01:52:58.800]   Somebody...
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:01.440]   So it doesn't save energy.
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:02.680]   It doesn't do anything for you.
[01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:04.480]   It causes more heart attacks.
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:09.840]   The Monday after daylight savings time heart attacks go up appreciably.
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:11.880]   There's more auto wrecks.
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:16.520]   Actually the auto wrecks that go up appreciably on Monday, the heart attacks start on Sunday.
[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:17.800]   It's a terrible thing.
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:19.040]   Let's get rid of it.
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:23.440]   Somebody said, "I just wanted to be the sun to be over my head at noon."
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:24.440]   That's it.
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:27.400]   You know who came up with the idea of worldwide time zones?
[01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:28.400]   Who?
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:29.400]   Sir Sanford Fleming.
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:30.400]   A Canadian.
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:31.400]   A Canadian.
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:32.400]   1879.
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:37.040]   Fleming was famous for something else, wasn't he?
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:38.040]   I don't know.
[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:39.040]   Probably.
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:41.600]   I think Donaldson coffee.
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:42.600]   He invented the Tim's bit.
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:45.840]   He invented Tim Horton.
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:49.440]   Don't want to do it any more.
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:51.880]   That note I would like to say so long to you all.
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:52.880]   Thanks for joining us.
