[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   From everywhere in the world, Jeff Jarvis is here. He's home.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   So glad you're home.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I'm at school. I'm back. I have connectivity. I have a wire plugged into the computer.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Oh, I'm loving it. Works. I'm loving it.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I used off somebody on Twitter last week. I'm in Jarvis and you get me in here.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And I worked three hours to get on the darn show and you give me help.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   People just are mean. And I love the picture of you in the modeling session that was going on at the pool side.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   It looks like you had a good time.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Did you ever get to talk to Jim Jarmusch?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   No, I didn't.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I'm too bad.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   It's professor of journalism at the City University of New York. That's where he is right now.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Are you doing office hours? Are there kids there?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   No, not many. Well, our social students are here, but I haven't been here for like two weeks.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Just check the mail.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Because between, yes, I have a lot of meetings.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   But between VidCon and Mexico City.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   That's right.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   And seeing my parents in Florida, I'm back.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Good. Well, we like having you back.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I'm going to put down the shade behind me because the sun is not working.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   So I know, but I like seeing the kind of sweaty.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Should I leave with the sweaty manhattan behind you?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Should I leave Manhattan?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Sweaty. You're there on what West 44th?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   What was 40th?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   40th.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Center of the universe times where New York, New York.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Yep.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Kind of my nice locale.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Also with us from Austin, Texas, Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Not the center of the universe.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Oh, it is. Absolutely.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   The People's Republic of Texas, so you can.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Are you guys going to secede? Is that true?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   No, no.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   If Texas secedes, Austin's going to have to secede, and then we'll be like an island nation.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Oh, it'll be like, we'll have to do an airlift.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   It'll be like East, East and West Berlin.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I was going to say like Puerto Rico, but that's that.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   They'll be a wall.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   We have an airlift.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   They'll be a corridor.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So, hopefully not.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I'm going to Austin tomorrow.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I'm flying to Austin tomorrow.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   The Association, what used to be called the American Association of Alternative Newspapers.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Oh.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   But now they may be the end stand for something else.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Like the Berkeley Barb.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Right, the Bay Guardian.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Bay Guardian.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   The Boys.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Now mostly they're just classified ads and...
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Bar recommendations.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Bar recommendations, exactly.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   What's the one at Austin?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Austin Chronicle.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Barnacle.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Is it still around?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   It is.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Austin, it feels like Austin could keep an alternative paper alive.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Oh, well, some would argue that our local paper is an alternative paper.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Right.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And we have the Texas Tribune, which isn't...
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Which is amazing.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Which is amazing.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Which is awesome.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And yet, Austin's the state capital.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Yes?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Oh, I'm just saying.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I'm just saying.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I'm just saying.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And yet, and yet, well, it's kind of an interesting mix.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   It's as if Berkeley were the capital of California.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   It'd just be a strange mix.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Can you dig where I'm coming from?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Sort of Austin for a time was...
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Not Austin.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Austin was a Democrat.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Texas.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   No one had Ann Richards.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Great governor Ann Richards.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Oh.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Thought the world of her.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I'll never forget going.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   There was some South by Southwest going to visit the capital building there and the statute of slavery.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   It was great.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I'll never forget that.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Tonight's slavery, I'm in state's rights.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   What am I saying?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I am so sorry.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   They've taken some of those down and we just had a thing where we renamed a couple of our elementary schools from Robert E. Lee to something else.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Oh, God.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   So we're getting there.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Wow.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   It was problematic.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   So how was life without Uber and Lyft there, Stacy?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   You know, I just took...we just went out for a while and I took a site called...our Fassen.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And that was really nice and the driver gets most of the revenue there.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   How is that allowed though?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I mean, I thought Austin made it illegal to do that kind of thing, right, Sharon?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   So, Austin isn't...they have a month to get their fingerprinting.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And Austin actually wasn't actively pushing for Uber or Lyft to follow the regulations.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Oh.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   They just were like, "Hey, look, we want to come to terms and set something up that's tenable going forward."
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And Uber and Lyft were like, "Well, we have written some legislation for you."
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Oh, jeez.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And we were like, "No."
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   They had a sniff fit, basically.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Yes.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   That's it.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   We're out of here.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And you'll see.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   You'll be sorry.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And we are because Paul Graham keeps making some snide comments about us and it hurts.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Austin is just sad.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   So Fassen is like F-A-S-T-E-N.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Fassen.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Let's see.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   I've got to look at the app.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Oh, where'd you go?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Yeah, Fassen, like Fassen, your seat belt.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And then--
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Before you get in the car, Fassen.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   OK.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   There's Austin rideshare.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And then there is a Facebook group that I'm a member of.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   So there's plenty of ways to get--
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Yeah, there's--
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   It really-- it was really only over this background check issue.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   And it didn't seem like the state was being unreasonable about it or the city was--
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   The city.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   The city.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.640]   It was that they also wanted the ability-- there were a couple other things in the Uber written
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:57.000]   legislation like letting them stop in lanes of traffic to discard passengers.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Just get--
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Well, that seems like a bad idea.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   So there were just some things that the city was trying to negotiate.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.240]   I think Uber-- certainly, I don't know about Lippa-- Uber has certainly in other locales
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:18.080]   been chased out by the incumbents, by the taxis and the medallion owners and so forth.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:25.800]   But they use that as a mantle of good will.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:32.080]   And sometimes it's not always the case that they really should probably do what Austin asked
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.120]   him to do, right?
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.160]   I don't-- I think the city was willing to negotiate.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.720]   I don't think Uber would have liked all the things that they would have gotten.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.720]   So I can understand.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.320]   But it wasn't about protecting the taxis this time.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.320]   Oh, I'm sure there--
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.640]   --while giving the taxi companies back this?
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.760]   Yeah, the taxi companies were part of this too.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.160]   They don't get me wrong.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.720]   It's not like-- it's not a total citizen uprising or anything like that.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.720]   Right.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.720]   But you're surviving.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.720]   We're surviving.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.720]   It's a little less convenient.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.360]   If you're really trashed, you're going to have a hard time.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.160]   You're going to be like, "What is a my Uber app work?"
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.000]   But other than that, it'll be OK.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.120]   My mom, who's 83, I've set up with my credit card on her Uber account.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.360]   But she still can't figure it out.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.440]   Because I'll tell you why.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.320]   She's so used to calling for a cab.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.800]   And so she doesn't understand that's all you do is open it and you say, "Get me a car
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.440]   and you can see the approach."
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.440]   It doesn't register because she's--
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.560]   I can't get my parents to think about a smartphone at all.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.120]   How did you get your mobile app to use a smartphone?
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.280]   I just kept giving them to--
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.280]   You know what?
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   Oh, I'll tell you how.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.400]   Yeah, I got her a-- I think it was called a cricket.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.680]   One of the smartphones for the elderly.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.680]   Like the jitterbug?
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.680]   The jitterbug.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.680]   That's it.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.680]   And she was so insulted.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.200]   I said, "Oh, well, how about a Galaxy Note 3?"
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   I think it was.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.600]   And she loved it because she had a stylist and she could draw on it.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.520]   And now she's got an iPhone 6s Plus.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.880]   Bluffs it.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.880]   Bluffs it.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.440]   She's-- I think she feels like it's a way of staying connected with me
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.040]   to have a lot of technology.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.640]   Because then she can call me and say, well, I can't--
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.640]   can you help me?
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.520]   And then we get to talk.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.400]   I'm on the gadget freak.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.840]   Yeah, see?
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.160]   I don't think it has to--
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.120]   Jeff has an article.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.000]   This is what happened.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.800]   It's not quite an article.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.680]   This is right.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.720]   Everybody loves Raymond.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.720]   Is that what this is from?
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.760]   No, this should be-- oh, no, no, no.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.520]   I put it Seinfeld in.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.720]   Oh, is it Seinfeld?
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   No.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.320]   Listen, I wanted to talk to you about--
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.320]   It's great.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.320]   --every birthday.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.520]   Oh, my god, talking about birthdays.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.360]   Your birthday gift to me finally came this morning.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.840]   Did you know you sent me a box of pears?
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.760]   I'm a place called Fruit of the Month.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.240]   That's right.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.760]   That's right.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.800]   How are they?
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.080]   Oh, they're very nice pears.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.600]   But there's so many of them.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.120]   They're over a dozen pears.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.720]   What am I supposed to do with all those pears?
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.520]   I think you're supposed to eat them, huh?
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.480]   Myself?
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:05.880]   You?
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.280]   You and Dad and Robert?
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.360]   How many pears can Bob at E, don't you?
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.240]   Like, I appreciate the thought, Raymond.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.960]   But please, don't ever send us any more food again.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.320]   That's what happens when I give my parents technology.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.520]   Don't ever do that again.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.800]   That's the pilot for everybody loves Raymond.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.280]   I'm told.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.240]   Nugget--
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.080]   [SNIFFS]
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.000]   Oh.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.880]   --triggering a avalanche of searches
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.000]   for what the hell is Nugget on Google.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.720]   Android N is going to be Nugget.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.960]   That was kind of what I thought it would be all along.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.440]   I'm glad it wasn't a brand name.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:42.960]   Or not.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.040]   It was kind of ridiculous to make this whole hoo-ha.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.800]   Well, especially Hiroshi Lakhheimer
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.720]   saying, I'm not telling you, wink, wink, nudge, nudge,
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.720]   and it wasn't going to be anything with nut.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.320]   You know, maybe they could have gotten something really creative.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.240]   But no.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.040]   I liked Nugget.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.240]   What's wrong with Nugget?
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.080]   See, this is the mistake of doing what they did,
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.000]   which is making this big deal about it.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.240]   Instead of saying, it was going to be Android N is Nugget.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.320]   I mean, do you think that they got a lot of people
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.360]   contributing suggestions and, oh, poured over those suggestions,
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.840]   trying to figure out what the best one they knew
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.240]   it was going to be Nugget all along?
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:18.760]   Come on.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.000]   I think it would have been nice to have a little bit
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.600]   of diversity in this and pick something
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.480]   from some other nation other than the US.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.000]   Well, this is from a nation other than the US.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.080]   Do they call it a Nugget there?
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:31.720]   Oh, my god.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.960]   Nugget's huge.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.400]   Nugget is French and Italian.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.640]   Do they call it Nugget in the places?
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.840]   Well, they call it Toroné.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.600]   Well, you see, that's my issue.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.920]   In Italy, they do call it Nugget in French.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.480]   Well, they do.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:45.680]   They are.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:45.960]   All right.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.440]   German is Nugget.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.080]   OK, I'm going to go back.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.920]   No, no.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.520]   In fact, I remember when I was a kid in 1967,
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.640]   we went to Europe, and there was a town.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.640]   I can't remember what the town was.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.560]   It was famous for Nugget in France.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.640]   And Nugget was everywhere.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.160]   They had Nugget in the gas station.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.440]   Nugget was everywhere.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.880]   It is a European thing.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.760]   I think it's European.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.600]   I think this is very international.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.120]   Right?
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.760]   Well, it's at least European.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:15.640]   Sugar, honey, nuts, almond walnut pistachio hazelnuts,
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.600]   your choice, egg whites.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.480]   Sometimes there's candied fruit in there.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.160]   And then the fruit cake of candies.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.040]   Oh, no, it's good.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.240]   You don't love Nugget?
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:25.960]   Have you had Nugget?
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.560]   I am not a Nugget fan.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.480]   No.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.480]   Toroné is great.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.800]   We used to, in fact, the local bodega when I was growing up
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.560]   had the Toroné, and we'd go in there and get a Toroné.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.040]   The Italian Nugget.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:40.720]   Yuck.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.040]   So then can we start speculating about O?
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.200]   Ah, good questions, Daisy.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:46.720]   What do you think?
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.080]   Yes, I was next.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:48.840]   Oreo.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.200]   Oreo?
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:49.960]   No, see, brand name.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.760]   I think they learned from the--
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.200]   Kit-Kat.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.200]   Kit-Kat, that that was--
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.080]   But Oreo is an Oreo special.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.760]   Isn't it special?
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.880]   How?
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.240]   It's just an institution.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.520]   It's a wafer and--
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.000]   It's special.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.960]   Special, you know?
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.400]   Well, Nilla Vanilla Wafers would have been special too,
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.480]   but no.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.280]   Nilla Wafers are not a dessert.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.480]   We have this argument in my house.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.000]   It's a cookie.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.760]   What the hell is it?
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.760]   I maintain that it is a cracker.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.960]   Nilla-- no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.440]   It's a cookie.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.280]   It's a dessert.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.120]   This is how I did not just lunch with her school.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.320]   He doesn't let her have dessert.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.320]   There's a cracker.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.120]   She goes to a school that mandates that the lunch brought from home may not have a dessert
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.120]   in it.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.920]   They can't have cookies and sweets.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.840]   They encourage us not to bring them.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.840]   I know.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.680]   Aren't you-- you're not in Texas, you're in San Francisco.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.840]   In Texas, states, rights would say no.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.840]   What the what?
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.040]   Again, I live in Austin.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.440]   It's like the Berkeley of Texas.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   It's a public school?
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.600]   No, it's a private school.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.600]   Oh, that's why.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.000]   Is it like one of them Waldorf schools that can't watch TV or not?
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   It's an international school.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.640]   Oh, it's international.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.680]   So at least they say it with a charming French accent.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.680]   That means--
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.680]   That means--
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.680]   That means--
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.680]   That means--
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.680]   That means--
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.680]   That means--
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.680]   That means--
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.680]   That means--
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.680]   That means--
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.680]   That means--
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.680]   That means--
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.680]   You may not bring an dessert to school.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.680]   Aye, yeah, yeah, of course.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.680]   But not dessert.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.680]   I'm concerned about your accent there.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.680]   I don't know what it is.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.680]   Jase.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.680]   It's definitely foreign.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.680]   It's foreign.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.680]   I do a lot of them.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.680]   Jase.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:39.880]   In Malta, Nougat is known as kubajd and sold in village festivals.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.440]   In Greece, it's known as mandolato.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:48.200]   Cecilia Nougat is kubaita, kupaita, or taroni.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.200]   You've now passed the line that I know way too much about Nougat.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.760]   It's a traditional French candy.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.760]   Okay.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.440]   So it's a sopp to the French.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.080]   Largely associated with the Christmas season.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.080]   Nougat.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.760]   That is not news.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.160]   That's just a story.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.680]   There's nothing much to say except that now we know.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.680]   You know about Nougat.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.520]   And they got us to do it.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.400]   They got us to talk about it.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.400]   Used again.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.400]   Used again.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.840]   Google expands its ad tracking.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.840]   Of course, depends which article you read.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.920]   9 to 5 Google celebrated that it was opt in.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.840]   Wired magazine said, "Uh oh."
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.160]   Google expands its ad tracking.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.280]   But yay, it's opt in.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.960]   In fact, there's a new tool that you can use to change this.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:49.480]   It's my activity, a page at Bundles Search History, videos you've watched, pages you've
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.680]   visited that serve Google ads.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.360]   There's a setting there.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:00.000]   If you opt into the setting, always, when you visited Google pages, Google included
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.560]   what it knows about you from Search into the recommendations.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.360]   But they didn't, I did not know this, but they didn't apparently do that when you see
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.760]   Google ad words on other pages, third party pages.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.240]   I'm surprised there hasn't been a fur over this.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.240]   I mean, it is good.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.240]   It's transparent.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.240]   I think it's great.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.520]   But people are so, "Oh my God, look at all the no-bop meat."
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.600]   It does, because it's very explicit.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.600]   This is what you did.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.760]   You can erase it, and there it is.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.760]   I think it's great.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.240]   But I'm waiting for the privacy panic to ensue.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.240]   Go ahead.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:37.560]   Oh, I was going to say, they've been super proactive with the opt in, with the transparency.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.960]   This is kind of exactly what a lot of the privacy people are calling for.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.960]   So what would they complain about?
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.520]   Well, because I think that some idiots will come along and say, "Oh my God, look what's
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.520]   there."
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.400]   Oh, well, I mean...
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.400]   There was a...
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.320]   The same thing happened when people discovered Google Dashboard, right?
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.800]   Look at all the things they know about me.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.800]   They're absolutely right, Stacey.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.880]   This is exactly what they should do.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.600]   I completely agree.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.040]   But privacy panic is it easy.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:11.720]   I put up a story somewhere in here under Facebook of some stunt where you go into a star box.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.640]   You get a free coffee if you like the page.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.160]   You tell them your first name and, "Oh my God, look at all they know about you."
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.880]   Yeah, it's on your public Facebook page.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.880]   What's the big deal?
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.880]   But we can...
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.480]   Oh, we can make a panic out of anything.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.320]   So you go to myactivity.google.com.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.320]   Here it is.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.320]   Welcome to my activity.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.320]   Oh, see...
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.320]   We're going to see what Leo's done, aren't we?
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.320]   Oh, God.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.680]   Well, apparently I searched for Nougat.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.600]   This is interesting the way they've been this.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.720]   Rediscover the things you've searched for, visited, and watched on Google services.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.000]   You're going to rediscover those.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.240]   And page two, we put data to work for you.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.440]   Your activity helps make Google experience faster, smarter, and more useful.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.160]   So what could be wrong with that?
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.840]   And page three, you're in control.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.480]   You can easily delete specific items or entire topics.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.680]   You can also change your settings and decide which data gets associated with your account.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.160]   So this is kind of like the dashboard.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.000]   But very detailed.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   It is.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Oh, man.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.520]   I thought it was going to give me a timeframe for how many corgi videos I have considered.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.520]   Ha ha ha ha.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.520]   Wouldn't that be great?
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.520]   It just says eight of them.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.960]   You've watched eight corgi.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.960]   Do you have corgis?
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.840]   No, I have corgi geeks.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.840]   They are cute.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.160]   When they wag their little tails and their butt wags with it because they're so stunted
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.960]   and deformed, it's so adorable.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.440]   Yes, my daughter loves them.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.440]   So...
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.440]   No, I do two, actually.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.760]   My sister has two of them.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:43.440]   So I visited... so it's up to date because it's showing that I visited rideshare and fasten.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.520]   Fasten rideshare and com.android.yada yada yada yada.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.520]   What's that?
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.480]   I've gone there three times.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.800]   Actually, see, this is the kind of thing you'd want to explore.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.120]   Like what is that?
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.240]   It's something obviously that happened on my smartphone.
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.080]   Journal two times, Android calendar.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:05.680]   I'm kind of nervous about how deep I should go into my search history here.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.360]   You can also show how you can erase one.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.360]   Okay.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.360]   Under the three dots.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.360]   Okay, so here's the three dots.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.400]   I've been searching for free BSD workstations.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.400]   Details.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.800]   Details will show me like all of the searches.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.240]   Okay.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.200]   And then I could do...
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.200]   So I could...
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.200]   That gets pretty right.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   It gets granular.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.600]   So I could say, "Well, you know this one where I typed workstations without an O?
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.800]   Let's delete that one."
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.520]   Not that that will make any difference.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.520]   Interesting.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:40.680]   So when I played with it, there was something I'd searched for for a gift.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.440]   I wanted to think that I wanted this.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.440]   Yeah, I could think about it.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.920]   Nobody's going to go to the trouble.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.400]   Like your Amazon recommendations.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.240]   All I'm seeing on mine is YouTube stuff, which is...
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.400]   I feel like I went through...
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.880]   What account?
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.400]   Is this the main account you usually use?
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.400]   It is.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.120]   Let's see what happens when I go to my other account.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.640]   One is work, but it's Google.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.640]   It intermingles.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.820]   Oh, no, it doesn't.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.820]   Okay.
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.820]   It doesn't.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:12.820]   You're right.
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.820]   Sorry.
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.820]   I haven't.
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.820]   Much suggestion.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:16.820]   Grin.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.820]   Much to my Shrin.
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.820]   No, don't get me started.
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:19.820]   Look at me, started.
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.820]   Hey, Grifal.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.720]   He wants it to bundle it.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.280]   So some activity...
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.920]   So 35 items.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.080]   Android search now, video search YouTube voice and audio.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.320]   So those are the kinds of searches it's showing.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.760]   And then you could delete any search.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:51.320]   And if you want more details, you can see what devices you used, why this was saved.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.240]   And this is basically going to be for ad recommendations.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.920]   Yes or no?
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.880]   I mean, what also Google now?
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.880]   Right.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.640]   It'll also possibly feed into their machine learning stuff.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.880]   I mean, you could use it to make recommendations later on based on a person's individual habits.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.320]   Like Google now could say, "Hey, she really likes corgis."
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:18.320]   I wish it would tell me what Google, what calm.android.yada yada is.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.760]   It seemed to spend a lot of time there.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.240]   It's really interesting.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.680]   Can you click on it and see without us knowing?
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   Details.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.280]   What do you think it's dirty?
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.280]   No, I don't.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.280]   I just like...
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.080]   No, this is all I can get is what time...
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.840]   It doesn't even say which Android device.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.000]   App Store for...
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.840]   Is it an App Store for Android?
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.640]   Oh, it's the App Store.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.800]   Well, they should have a better name than that.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.760]   No, it's a game on the App Store.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.920]   Oh, it is?
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.920]   Oh.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.120]   I'm just looking up calm.google.yada on Google.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.120]   Uh-huh.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.120]   Huh.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.720]   Interesting.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.720]   Um, it's cool.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.240]   Tells you watch videos you watch.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:08.080]   Yeah, so on the Sunday we watched some videos from Don't Hug Me, I'm Scared.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.600]   It's showing me I saw those.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.280]   There's all Android L yada yada.apk.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.280]   I don't think I...
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.720]   I don't have to look at the see.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   So you know what?
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:24.480]   This is kind of like your browser history, but it's not kept in the browser.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.280]   It's kept elsewhere, right?
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.280]   So...
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.280]   It's your application.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:35.000]   That could bother people, especially now that we know law enforcement is allowed to
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.080]   look at your browser history without a warrant.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.840]   This simplifies things for them, because they don't have to ask me for my browser history
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.920]   or come to look at my computer.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.640]   They can just go to Google and say, "Alright.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.640]   Now I use Chrome.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.320]   Obviously if you don't...
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.120]   Well, I don't know.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.880]   If you go into a Google site, it should know that.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   If you don't...
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.760]   Yeah, if I visited YouTube from somewhere else, it would see it.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.760]   Okay.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.760]   Huh.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.760]   Boy, it goes down...
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.760]   It's day by day.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.600]   So you can see how many videos you watched on any given day.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.480]   And it's across all your devices?
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.480]   Apparently.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.000]   I love to count.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.520]   Android's search, but it's Google services.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.600]   This is interesting.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.080]   So where is the part where I can hunt down?
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.080]   That's what I need to find.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.080]   Well, don't you have to...
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.520]   You opt into using this forecast.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.520]   Right.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.520]   Here we go.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.520]   It's supposed to opting out, right?
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.520]   Right.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.520]   So I'm going to go through the next few videos.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.600]   From better commute options and maps to quicker results than search, the data we save with
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.600]   your account.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.560]   Ah, so here we go.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.400]   Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:42.120]   That's checked location history, device information.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.520]   That's a switch I can turn off, voice and audio activity.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:50.760]   This is one thing that does bother people, the fact that it has all of the voice, all
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.160]   of the things you say after you say, "Okay, Google."
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.160]   Right.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.640]   That was a big deal a couple of days ago, weeks ago.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.640]   Really?
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.640]   So fun.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.440]   Yeah, people got upset because not only does it record it, they store it and everyone
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.400]   is like, "Google can hear all of my voice texts."
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   Yes.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.320]   What did you think when you said, "Okay, Google?"
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.320]   Well, that's what I'm like.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.320]   I'm like, "Oh."
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.320]   You think?
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.840]   So but Apple's making a big deal about, "Oh, we'll do this on device.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.440]   It won't get sent back to the server."
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:19.080]   Except Siri will.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.280]   And the difference is Apple doesn't tell you all the things Siri heard.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.280]   Right.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.000]   Google's exposing that.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.640]   And that's how Google gets better at understanding and writing voices and everything else.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.640]   Mm-hmm.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.480]   Oh, the fact that they save it.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.480]   Yeah, I doubt Apple.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.480]   I don't know.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.480]   Maybe we don't know.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.160]   Apple doesn't say whether they save your Siri queries or not.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.640]   I don't know.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.640]   You two watches.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.560]   So I'm not sure.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:48.160]   I don't see the thing where you opt in the new thing, but maybe I'm just not looking
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.160]   in the right place.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:55.840]   This is often the case with privacy controls.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.840]   On the one hand, you want granularity, but on the other hand, the way it's going to do
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.840]   it.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.160]   It's so granular that you don't even know what you're looking at.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.320]   It does provide cover for them.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.920]   Hey, you want to know what we're doing?
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.920]   Here's what we're doing.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.120]   Well, if you have to opt in, it should be whatever's turned off there, right?
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.680]   I mean, it's like an on.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.680]   Yeah, but everything's on.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.680]   So.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.680]   So.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.680]   I don't know what they're talking about.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.280]   What are you talking about?
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:27.400]   They do say here, we are committed to your privacy and security and look at the people
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.880]   have little blue shields.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.880]   They're hiding behind.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.440]   They're hiding their data behind.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.440]   Yes.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.800]   Are you the not know who I am?
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.520]   I'm a because Google is hiding.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.640]   You do have to log into your account, obviously.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:45.720]   Every day data makes our say, see, she removed the blue shield and now happy.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.720]   She's happy.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.400]   Oh, my web and app activity is paused.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.160]   So mine was already off.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.920]   Ah, but I'm a pretty vigorous.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.520]   Somebody in the chat, I'm saying is it happy?
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.080]   It's in your security checkup, which I do.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.080]   I do.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:07.040]   You never once a while Google say you really ought to be doing your Google, you know,
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.880]   security checkup.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.640]   And so let me let me run through that here.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.640]   This is the.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.640]   Oh, okay.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.640]   I didn't see anything but YouTube is because mine was already turned off.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.640]   There you go.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.640]   It's by default.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.640]   Okay.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.640]   Yes, unless you'd, unless you'd turned it off.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.640]   I probably have turned it off, but I don't know if this is new or not.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.800]   Time for your security checkup.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.800]   Okay.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.800]   Let's see.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.160]   And then here is your connected devices.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.640]   Those you might want to look through.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.600]   It looks good or something looks wrong.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.600]   Okay.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.480]   And then check your account permissions.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:43.880]   Those are the thing when you, when you, you log into a Google account and a browser and
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.000]   it says, okay, remember this.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.360]   And that's the name you gave it.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.800]   That was quite a few of those.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.480]   Check your app passwords.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.480]   Okay.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.800]   Check your two step verification settings.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   Okay.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.800]   I didn't get it.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.800]   Hmm.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.800]   Hmm.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.480]   Maybe, maybe you should just turn yours off and then you'll stop seeing it.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.720]   But I thought they said it was opt in, right?
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:11.120]   So I, I, well, anyway, it may be this not turn, oh, is it privacy checkup?
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.120]   Is that the one I need to do?
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.120]   I need to check up.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.120]   Sorry.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.440]   Again, with the granularity, more privacy.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.440]   Okay.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.200]   And then it, this is your Google plus profile.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.200]   Weird.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.200]   Okay.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.200]   Next.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.200]   Ooh.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.400]   How people connect with you?
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.720]   There's all my phone numbers next.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.480]   Choose who could see my location and how well they could see it.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.680]   Manage what you share on YouTube.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.680]   Chee-bus.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:44.360]   Privacy manager, Google photos.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.840]   I probably have everything set to like just, you know, tell them every, ah, here we go.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.120]   Make ads more relevant to you.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.440]   Manage your ad settings.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.000]   Oh, look at that.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Look at that.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.200]   Oh, I've been here once before.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.880]   Does it always think I'm a guy who, it used to think I was a guy, like a really old guy.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.880]   What?
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:11.080]   Because I read in about tech and it, most of my websites that I visit skew mail.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.680]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.840]   That's interesting.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.480]   Or they thought only old men like corgis.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.480]   Right.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.480]   Right.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.480]   That's a common thing.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.280]   With that, okay.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.200]   See, the ads based on your interest.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.200]   Okay.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.400]   With it on, this is what you get.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.480]   With it off, you're still going to see ads.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.040]   That's important, but there won't be based on anything they know about you, which I see.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:40.120]   This is the thing that I always, it's my assertion that if ad recommendation engines
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.360]   worked better, people would like the ads based on your interests turned on.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:48.680]   Well, that depends upon the ads that they have to serve and how messed up they are.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.680]   Right.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.680]   Well, that's true too.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.680]   And stupidity the ads do.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.480]   The problem with retargeting when you've already bought the damn boots, you got out
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.400]   of Amazon two weeks ago and they keep on selling you the damn boots.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.200]   Well, let me ask you guys.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.200]   Right.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.120]   Because I've been seeing and I'm not sure if this is advertising or just Google trying
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:09.600]   to be helpful, but so whenever I've been searching for a computer bag and Google is
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.320]   like on Google now, it'll be like, hey, continue researching handbags, et cetera.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:19.720]   But now it's also telling me, hey, this particular bag you looked at is now on sale at 33% off,
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.120]   which is the lowest price we've seen.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.080]   And then the other day that happened to me and I was like, that's my bag that I've been
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.080]   looking for.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.160]   So I bought it.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:34.720]   And I was like, that was really helpful to me, but I'm curious if that was Google showing
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:39.920]   me, was that a quote unquote ad or was that just Google now getting aggressive?
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.920]   Was there an action you could take?
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:47.760]   Yes, I clicked on the little Google now card and it took me to Saks to buy that.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.160]   That's interesting.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.920]   That's a really because up to now I don't think anybody's ever said that Google now
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.760]   had ads in it.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.800]   Well, and that's what I, because it did.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   It's really interesting.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.600]   It felt like it's helpful.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.600]   Really nice.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.600]   Helpful.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.120]   Like a friend would do that.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.680]   I purchased something from it.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.360]   So I'm like, hmm.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.120]   And I would never know.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.480]   Because what did you say?
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.000]   Did you say?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   What did you say?
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Oh, you.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.040]   Oh, well, I started, I was changing something to speaking to what you did using the share
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.040]   of the business.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.560]   I should have done that while you were drinking.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:29.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.560]   Go ahead.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:38.560]   Speaking of which, what did you say?
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.000]   Did I hear what I thought I heard you say?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Go ahead.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.640]   Did you see the shared endorsement setting?
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.320]   No, I did see it, but I went right by it.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.320]   What is that?
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.920]   Go back to the activity controls under, under my activity.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.240]   Go to shared endorsements.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.240]   Okay.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.440]   I've forgotten trouble for this once upon a time.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.400]   This was this I don't like where this says you liked this.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.840]   So I'm going to show Jeff Jarvis because you're his friend that you liked it.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.840]   Right.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.520]   And you're and you can appear in ads.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.400]   So this is your place where you can turn that off.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.320]   And so one thing I would turn off, still put my name in an ad.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.920]   I didn't know Google was doing that.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:12.920]   I didn't either.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.920]   So go look go to that.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:14.920]   You're there.
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:15.920]   Are you there?
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.920]   It takes me a while.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.920]   I got to go.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.920]   I can't remember where it was.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.600]   So I'd go back to flyactivity.google.com.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   Go to the activities.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   I'm not going to control.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.480]   I'll go to the bottom of the page.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.280]   And besides Google plus, oh, remember that?
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.200]   It says shared endorsements.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.040]   Shared endorsements.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:39.520]   So now it says I don't mind that.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.120]   Well, now go down.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.120]   That's shared.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:47.840]   This isn't as bad as the way that we shared Facebook was doing ads.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.320]   It adds and you could turn that off.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:54.560]   But if you're looking at summertime spas and your friend Katja Klinikova says it's a
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.800]   nice spa, you would like to know that, wouldn't you?
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.040]   In your Yelp review?
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.600]   Yeah, I guess so.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.600]   I don't.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.280]   I guess if you're recommending, you are recommending to the public.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.280]   Yeah, this is finding your review somewhere.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.280]   All right.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.280]   All right.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.280]   All right.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.280]   I don't know if I'd mind that.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.280]   All right.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.280]   So a little bit.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.680]   By the way, it's off by default because mine's not checked.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.200]   On my activity, Google may show my name and profile photo and shared endorsements that
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.960]   appear in ads.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.800]   Mine is that I've never seen this before.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.160]   I don't think I've turned it off.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.160]   Mine was unchecked.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.200]   Oh, people would be livid if that happened.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:35.680]   Imagine if you had a sponsorship deal with Nike, but you could cost me money.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.040]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.080]   If you're under 18, you may see shared endorsements from others, but your own name and profile
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.760]   will not be paired with shared endorsements and ads and other contexts.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.640]   So yeah, I guess on the ad settings, it says that.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.640]   It does that on mail.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:54.600]   Age is his question mark and it gives me no chance to tell them how old I am.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   That's funny.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   Wouldn't you want it?
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.600]   Wouldn't you want it to have that?
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.240]   That was a Google plus setting.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.400]   It looked like it was because when I went.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.400]   Hmm.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:09.000]   It's related to Google plus.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.800]   Oh, well.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.240]   All right.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.240]   There you go.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:22.360]   Everything you never want to know about Google ad tracking, but we're afraid to ask.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:27.680]   Rumor persists that Google is going to do not a new Nexus, but it kind of its own phone.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.600]   I'm not sure exactly how that differs.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:36.680]   The Nexus devices have all along been built by other companies, LG and Huawei.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.480]   The Nexus 5.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:44.960]   I think the last time the telegraph had a prediction, it was all messed up.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.960]   This is wrong.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:51.360]   James Tittcomb says Google's planning a shake up of the smartphone market, but releasing
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.120]   its own handset.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.480]   Now there are some arguments for this.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.280]   I mean, I can see why Google might want to do that.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.680]   We have even seen leaked shots of the new Nexus 5.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:07.880]   I think Ron and Mario and ours, Technica had some leaked shots.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:12.840]   Google wants to control its own destiny a little bit, I think, right?
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:23.040]   And if it does its own phone, from security point of view, its own phone and having an
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.560]   Nexus phone.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.280]   That's a little unclear in my mind.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.720]   Apple has the manufacturing done by another company.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:30.720]   What's the big deal?
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.720]   Yeah, they would.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.560]   Obviously, Google's not going to have a factory and mountain view.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.560]   No.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.960]   But in the past, it sounds like it's a little bit of a looser connection like LG with the
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.640]   5X or Huawei with a 6P.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.240]   Google would say we would like to design it like this.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.880]   But those are very different looking phones.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:53.360]   I mean, the 6P very much looks like a Huawei phone and the 5X very much looks like an
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.160]   LG phone.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:00.440]   So does Google give them specs and have them let them source the hardware?
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:05.880]   And this could be a way for them to control specifically what chips and firmware and everything
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:06.880]   else on the device?
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:12.120]   Possibly, I get the feeling that Google lets this company's design it themselves.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:16.720]   That's why the distinctive design.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.120]   I think this would give Google 100% design control.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:28.560]   Because they've been working with a chip company called Movidius to put certain, so
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.840]   the embedded vision in their phones.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.000]   And as you start working towards VR, that could be...
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   There you go.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.400]   Well, and clearly Google has some influence because then most recent Nexus phones have
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.360]   the fingerprint reader on the back.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.440]   That's kind of unique to both of them.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.960]   And that's a Google thing.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.680]   But on the other hand, they have other things that look more like Huawei or more like LG.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:55.600]   This is the Ron Armati article on the 2016.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.680]   Now he still calls it a Nexus.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.440]   Kind of two-tone.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:05.440]   We're not sure if that's shiny plastic, but people seem to think it's glass up top so
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.000]   that the radios can get through and the camera can get through.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.200]   Notice no camera bump, which people are applauding.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.440]   Android police has created a render.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.960]   So this is a render from the Android police based on the leaks.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.280]   Five-inch device called Sailfish.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:29.160]   Five and a half-inch device called Marlin.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.160]   And Ron notes...
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.160]   This is saying...
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.160]   Go ahead.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.600]   Oh, this is saying HTC is going to design it?
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.200]   Yeah, but it doesn't have an HTC logo on it.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.200]   Okay.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.880]   Because I love HTC Sense.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.880]   Which you...
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.880]   Yeah, well, we'd definitely not have sense to...
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:46.880]   It would not have sense to...
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.520]   Yeah, I mean, clearly that's not going to happen.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.520]   Do you have an HTC 10?
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.520]   Is that your current?
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:56.200]   No, no, I've got a Nexus 5X, but I had an HTC.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.560]   I miss it still.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.400]   I really like the Sense UI.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.800]   Yeah, I thought Sense was pretty nice.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:07.840]   Yeah, and I like the Moto X, you know, they had that like, shake to fit a flashlight on.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.840]   Mm-hmm.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.120]   Those are all things you're not going to see, I think, in a Google phone.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.120]   I know.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.000]   I'm like, I want to design my own phone with all my favorite features.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.360]   I'm really loving the OnePlus 3, the more I use it, the more I feel like this is the
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.800]   phone, especially at that price.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:25.440]   And I'm not even price sensitive because I have to buy them all no matter what.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.440]   But boy, it's easy for me to recommend this to anybody who's spending their own money.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.480]   What's your favorite bit of it?
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:37.960]   Well, it's just a clean, it's very pure, clean Android phone that's very fast, has an excellent
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.040]   camera.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.840]   I like a metal body.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:46.480]   It's got an HTC style aluminum body.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.160]   I would not recommend the plasticy shells.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:53.320]   I bought one and I thought, this is terrible, I don't use it.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.480]   People were complaining about the screen.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.120]   It's an LCD screen, but it's very good.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.320]   I don't think it lacks anything compared to my Galaxy S7.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:03.720]   And it's an equivalent?
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.800]   It's what equivalent?
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   An equivalent?
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:10.960]   Yeah, they're OS, which is oxygen, which is as far as I could tell, virtually indistinguishable
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.680]   from M, Android 6.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:18.520]   And it even says Android 6.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.560]   So in fact, there's a new update that's just coming out right now.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.560]   I haven't got it yet.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.800]   It's Android 6.0.1.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.760]   There was some question about whether they were going to keep up with the security patches.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.000]   Mine is currently the security patch through June 1st, which is pretty common.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.120]   If I get the July security patch, then that will reassure me that they'll let me know
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:40.360]   that they're one plus plans to keep it up.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.360]   I can't.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:45.000]   There's no reason not to recommend this phone at $400.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Okay.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.360]   Let me know if you get your security patch and that I might go get it.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.440]   I will, for sure will.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.520]   There's no reason why they wouldn't do it, especially since oxygen is such a pure version
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.880]   of Android 6 gigs of RAM.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.120]   And apparently the one of the things a patch does is allow full use of that.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:06.440]   It doesn't right now use it or seem to use it.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.080]   I think this is nice.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.080]   I'm very happy with it.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.320]   But it's supposed to be released fall with probably with these new Nexus is.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.320]   Exide.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.320]   Exide.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.320]   Exie.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:21.080]   Is it Latin?
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:25.480]   I guess it is.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.680]   I'm a product of the Texas public school board.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.680]   I don't know.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:33.600]   But hey, on the bright side, you got dessert in your lunch.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.600]   What do you think about evolution there, Stacy?
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.600]   What?
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.040]   So you grew up in Texas?
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.040]   You're a Texan?
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.600]   I'm a straight up Texan.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.600]   Nice.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.040]   I even moved to New York and moved back.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:48.440]   Yeah, because those New Yorkers, they got New York values, if you know what I mean.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.640]   Yeah, we do.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.080]   Yeah, we know.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.640]   We know what you mean.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.800]   Our show today brought to you by the Ring Video Door.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.600]   Bell Stacy knows all about these.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.800]   But you never did install one.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:00.800]   You had a different companies.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.280]   I did install the Ring.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.520]   I didn't do the Ring Pro.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:08.560]   Well, the Ring Pro, so the Ring Pro is cool because it's essentially the same as the Ring.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.880]   But if you already have a wired doorbell, you don't need the battery that's in the original
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.360]   Ring, which makes it compatible in any environment.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.680]   You could put it on a bedroom door, which is what I was thinking.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.080]   But what this does replaces your existing door, huh?
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.520]   Wait, you're going to put it on your bedroom door?
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.520]   Like, honey?
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.520]   Who's there?
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.120]   Knock before coming in.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.880]   Ring the doorbell, kids.
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:37.760]   Mommy and Daddy are having nap time.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:43.000]   And that way you can see who's at your door.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.440]   We have it on a front door, but I can think of all sorts of applications.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.320]   Actually, one of the things I want to do is put it in the back door, too.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.680]   But now they've got the Ring, what do they call it?
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.160]   The Stick Up Cam, which is kind of a weird name.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.160]   I thought so too.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.920]   I think it's like the Stick 'em Up Cam.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.960]   Not the Stick 'em Up, but the reason is it doesn't need any wires.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:07.120]   In fact, if you get the solar panel, it doesn't need power even.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:12.280]   And it has not the same camera, but also a speaker and a microphone.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.400]   So you can talk to people in the backyard or wherever else.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.760]   So this way you get full coverage.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:21.800]   You get the front door with a Ring video doorbell, get the back door with a Stick Up Cam.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:27.280]   And with their chime, you're never going to miss a doorbell Ring ever again.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:30.920]   They have optional cloud video recording for all their devices, which means you can capture
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:36.360]   and share video with family and friends or law enforcement.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.880]   There's a robotic dog at my door.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.880]   I love this.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:45.160]   I'll tell you what, I was mentioning this earlier, the UPS guys have just decided in our neighborhood
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:49.960]   to stop leaving packages on the porch because they say there's too many robberies.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:53.120]   I guess there's been a slew of robberies.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.160]   But that's okay because I got the Ring video doorbell.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.080]   So if they left it on the porch, I could monitor it.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.560]   But better yet, when he comes to the door and I'm not there, and that what they were doing
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:05.280]   is just leaving and taking the package with him and saying he can get it at the UPS store.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.480]   So now what I do is say, "No, I'm in here.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.480]   Just leave it there.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.480]   I'll be right out."
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.400]   Or put it in the bushes.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.400]   It'll be safe, whatever.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.680]   But I don't miss packages anymore.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.520]   And I can keep an eye on them.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.400]   It is a great, great idea.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.400]   The Ring video door.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.880]   But we've got a kind of a bundle here for you.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.720]   The Ring of Security bundle kit or the Pro bundle kit, if you don't need the battery.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:30.200]   But both kits come with the stick up cam, the solar panel, the chime.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.360]   So you get everything you need.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.360]   They call it their Ring of Security bundle.
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:40.240]   $50 off when you go to ring.com/twig, r-i-n-g.com/twig.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:46.600]   $50 off for a limited time for this week in Google listeners.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.960]   This is the one that Richard Branson put.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.800]   He led a $28 million investment into Ring.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   He must have known not just about the door, but he must have known about the other stuff
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.880]   they were doing like the stick up cam.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:05.880]   There's a cool story.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.200]   Jamie, the CEO of Ring, actually met Richard Branson several years before he had the doorbell
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.200]   company.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.400]   Jamie pitched it in the shark tank.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.400]   Or pitched something in the shark tank, right?
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.400]   He did.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.400]   This is a shark tank thing.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:18.480]   But Jamie pitched before he was even at Ring when he was like a 20-something-year-old baby
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.480]   entrepreneur.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:25.320]   He ran into Richard Branson in a hotel in Germany or some crazy place.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.920]   And was like, "Oh my God, you're my hero.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:28.920]   You're great."
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:33.520]   And Richard Branson was like, "Hey, send a note to my room.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.160]   I'd love to talk to you when I get back to it."
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.080]   But it was a total misconnection.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.680]   So Jamie was telling me about this when they got the funding for Richard Branson.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.680]   That's so cool.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.640]   I was like, "Yeah."
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.200]   Google Chrome now comes with Google Casting baked right in.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.000]   That says a 50-minute last.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.960]   I was done ages ago.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:54.960]   Right.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.960]   Right.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:56.960]   Crazy.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.960]   Did you -- Chrome 52, I'm sorry.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:02.960]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:03.960]   It is 51.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.760]   Chrome 52, which is already on the horizon.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.880]   It's in the beta channel.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:13.760]   Looks like you'll be able to cast a tab into a video Hangout, which would be really cool.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.360]   Here's what I'm watching.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.360]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.240]   That would be it.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.160]   You'll have to enable cloud services.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:25.600]   Cloud services allow you to share the contents of your browser tab of your desktop with other
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:31.960]   users through services like Google Hangouts, but you must sign into Chrome and turn that
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:35.600]   option on.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.560]   Nice.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:43.600]   So I think Chromecast is awesome.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:51.000]   I don't have much else to say about it.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.600]   So do we want to talk about -- Yes, will we?
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.600]   Something.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.600]   Anything.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.600]   Anything.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.600]   Anything.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.600]   I feel the loss.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:03.600]   You want to talk about the Wi-Fi kiosks from sidewalk labs and sensors?
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.600]   Shoot, yes.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:05.600]   What is it?
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:06.600]   Sure.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.600]   Because, well, okay.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:13.720]   So this was from Recode and a bunch of other stories this last week because Alphabet's company,
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:23.320]   the sidewalk labs, is applied to put in smart city infrastructure in Columbus, Ohio.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.760]   This is not like the ones in New York, though.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.760]   Well, so it is.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.600]   So that's -- Those are cool.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:35.320]   This is part of a consortium that -- part of a consortium that backed a company that
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.320]   put those in.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.320]   It's really complicated.
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:38.320]   Okay.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.320]   Enjoy that.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.320]   So they've got a hundred -- have you used these yet, Jeff?
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.320]   They have a hundred -- Yeah, I do.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.320]   I do.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.320]   I do.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:44.320]   I see kiosks.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.840]   I should remember I did a speed test on it.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:46.840]   It was very good.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:47.840]   I can't remember what it was.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.680]   But again, you're standing on the street corner with your phone out.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.160]   Are they old public phone booths?
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.160]   Is that what they're converting?
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.160]   No, not the booths.
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:58.960]   They're the old connectivity to them, but they had to rerun five urnals to them.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:02.400]   So they're basically a hole in the sidewalk where they can put them.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:08.680]   The hundreds more are on the way this summer and they plan to have 7,000 to 10,000 in
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:09.880]   the next five years.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.120]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.120]   Five years.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.920]   They're going to 2024 and the next seven years.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.920]   It wasn't.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.480]   They weren't wired up when I was in New York last, but I did go over it.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:23.040]   On 8th Avenue, for example, now they're working.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.320]   They have a keyboard, but can you imagine this is going to be the scuzziest keyboard
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.120]   I've never -- I'm not touch.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:30.600]   That's the knuckle typing.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.680]   But what's cool about them is the sensors.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.840]   So the New York ones don't have the sensors.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.040]   They have the cameras in them, but people were like, "Oh, no, no.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.440]   Do not record me on the public street," which I totally get.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.280]   But the new ones they're pitching have air quality sensors.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.280]   They have vibration sensors.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:51.400]   They have a bunch of sensors.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:57.400]   And so I'm really keen on the idea of adding all this super granular data about, again,
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.560]   air quality in things cities want to know.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:07.080]   And I actually saw this demo of vibration sensors on a street light from Busan in South
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.200]   Korea.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.200]   And they actually had it.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:14.880]   So if someone hit the street light, it would send a vibration signal and a camera would
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:18.240]   turn on and it would show if someone was injured or hurt.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.680]   So it was kind of like, instead of those police call boxes, you could just hit a piece of
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:26.560]   street furniture.
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.480]   These have big 911 emergency buttons on them.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.600]   What I didn't know is it also gives you free calling to any number in the country.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:38.240]   So it's a phone booth with free long distance.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.760]   You've got to touch that keyboard.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.760]   That's pretty cool.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.680]   Two USB charging ports, in case you want to just hang out.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:49.640]   An audio jack for headphones and I'm limited.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:50.640]   They were saying Gigabit.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.440]   I don't know if it is Gigabit Internet, very fast Internet.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.200]   Somebody's going to stand there and watch a movie with the headphones on.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.200]   And charge their smartphone.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:03.000]   By the way, if you're going to make a phone call, then it's going to be a, you're going
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.560]   to hear your call.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:05.560]   Right?
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.240]   Well, you put on your headphones.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:11.280]   What about, I mean, that, what about all the people who, well, it's a scam, but they're
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.880]   also legitimate people who are like, my phone's out of battery.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:14.880]   Right.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.080]   Can I use your phone to make a call and you're like, you have to make the.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.640]   Go use a kiosk, buddy.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.640]   Exactly.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.120]   Now you can be a jerk without being a jerk.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:27.520]   And I remember looking into the security they're using and it's actually, no, I'm not
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.720]   Steve Gibson, but it looked to me to be very good.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:37.720]   When you first join it, it sends you a token that you use to join it that makes your connection
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:38.720]   unique.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.880]   Nobody can spy on your connection.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.200]   You have a token that you're sharing.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.760]   So like no man in the middle attack?
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.760]   No.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.960]   Well, that was the design whether, you know, again, I'm not a Steve Gibson.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:53.280]   So, and I'm sure I will, I'm willing to venture these are going to be the most hacked or people
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:58.760]   will attempt to hack these quite a bit given the capabilities.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:03.120]   So the reason I thought this was interesting is because at the bottom of the recode story,
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:05.320]   they talk about this being a hard sell.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:10.160]   And I met with the CIO of the city of Chicago and we actually started talking about Kias
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:17.160]   and she is totally not sold on them because they feel like a very temporary like two or
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:22.440]   three year solution and they're concerned about, you know, vandalism and having all
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.680]   this infrastructure to maintain.
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:30.720]   And so I was just kind of curious to see all his thoughts about kiosks and is really that
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:34.680]   the way that we want to usher in the 21st century?
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:39.480]   Well I'm going to defer to Jeff because he's a New Yorker here.
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.680]   I see the thing that gets me Philadelphia.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:46.720]   You remember back about, oh God now, six years, seven years, Philadelphia was going to do major
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.320]   Wi-Fi around the whole city.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:53.040]   Yeah, Comcast and Verizon went to the state legislature and gave them a bunch of money
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:57.040]   and said, can you overturn, can you make a rule against that?
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.040]   Right.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:02.040]   And it was going to power communications and emergency vehicles.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.520]   It's amazing.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:09.840]   The thing about it is that if you want to bring people online, let's say in a poor neighborhood,
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.800]   do it on the street, doesn't really do them any good.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:15.480]   You've got to do it somehow into their home.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:20.360]   And I think this is like not such an altruistic venture.
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:25.760]   Because the recode article points out, they estimate each kiosk will generate $30,000 in
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.240]   advertising revenue.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.720]   Yes, that's at the city opt-ins.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.400]   Ops into it though.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.560]   And that's another reason why I think these are kind of a weird, is it basically like a
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.400]   billboard that has extra sensors at the high level?
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.400]   I love the sensors.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:47.440]   I mean, not only can they monitor air quality, but they can monitor street noise.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:51.760]   You can see how much bike and car traffic is, pedestrian traffic.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.120]   I mean, I think I don't think that's an intrusion.
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:58.600]   I think that that's potentially very useful for the city, right?
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:04.200]   I wrote about, I did a story on medium, are we ready for naked transparency?
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.960]   And this was again from Busan.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:11.600]   They actually measured on streetlights noise pollution.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.960]   And they made the data very open.
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:19.080]   And apparently all the people who had property and noisy districts complained because they
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.560]   were like, it was lowering their property.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.600]   We can't sell our house.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.600]   Too bad.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.600]   Oh.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.080]   That was my reaction.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:30.720]   But the city actually decided that they needed to make that data harder to get to.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.640]   And so they changed the data formatting.
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.720]   So these people would feel better.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.320]   Oh, there's the streetlight.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:41.640]   See if you hit it, it will send a message to police.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.760]   That's really interesting.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:49.600]   I just thought that was really kind of fun because I can see my neighborhood being like,
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:53.640]   oh my God, we're too noisy or there's too many coyotes being tracked.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.240]   No one will want to live here anymore.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.760]   Well, but sorry, but that's factual.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.000]   So I really don't.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:10.080]   I think if it's factual and it's city owned information, I think the public has a right
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:11.080]   to know.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.080]   It should be open.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.080]   Yeah, it's we have a right to that.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:16.960]   There's all kinds of terrorist related air sensors in some ways in New York.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:19.120]   I wish that data were public.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.120]   Maybe it is.
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.120]   I don't know.
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.120]   I haven't seen any of that.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.120]   Yeah, it's it's data.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:24.120]   It's public.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:27.400]   This is my as long as it's occurring in the public, the public.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.120]   And the public's paying for it.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.120]   I think you could make a case though.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:36.000]   There's some things like information about terrorist activity that need to be kept secret
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.520]   for security reasons.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.480]   Well, but I think I think cameras.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:44.320]   I mean, listen, if you look at some of the horrible Turkey, the horrendous tragedy of
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:50.520]   the Turkish airport and Istanbul, the security cameras, the fact that there are security
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:53.000]   cameras, you can see the people that that matters to our security.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.640]   I mean, I'm okay with that.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:58.240]   Around New York, there are amazing systems that if a bullet goes off, the police can
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.560]   zoom in on it right away.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.560]   And I'm okay with that.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.560]   It's public.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.560]   It's in the public.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:07.640]   If you do something in the public, the public has the right to know it.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:12.600]   I think the shot spotter, I don't know if they're using shot spotter, which is the gunshot,
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:16.720]   they've got sensors measuring gunshot and they tell police where the gunshot.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.080]   To triangulate it.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.320]   Thank you.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:24.480]   That data isn't always available because that's one of the things the Chicago CIO is telling
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.240]   me is they don't have access to some of that data.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.640]   Only the police department gets it.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.640]   Not necessarily.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:34.160]   I mean, I can understand making an argument that that's not a good idea.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:42.000]   There's some stuff for reasonable security purposes should be kept.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.560]   Maybe after the fact later or something.
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.560]   Right?
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:53.640]   I mean, the point is once we start having this information, it's going to change a lot
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:54.720]   of things.
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:57.680]   And the question is, does it change things for the better?
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:58.680]   Like it promotes action.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:03.080]   Like everyone's like, oh, look, the air is really polluted over in our poorest, saddest
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.080]   district.
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.240]   Maybe we should do something about that.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:09.000]   Or is it just going to create a bigger divide?
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.840]   You also ask to come at Stacey.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.920]   My argument Stacey is that we should never try to control knowledge.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:19.880]   That more information and more knowledge is we should assume is a good thing.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.480]   But you have to balance that with privacy and security.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.840]   What you do with that knowledge is a different matter.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:29.880]   But to control the knowing of something is antithetical to a modern society.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:33.520]   And balancing with privacy concerns of individuals.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:35.560]   That's the issue of what you do with it.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:37.040]   And security.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:42.560]   So if you have bomb sniffing sensors in the subway, you may not want everybody to know
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.320]   that.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:53.080]   If you know something about individuals, you may want, if you have a kiosk out front of
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:57.880]   an adult theater, you don't want to necessarily publish the video of everybody going into
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:54:58.880]   the adult theater.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:54:59.880]   Or maybe you do.
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:00.880]   I don't know.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.680]   I feel like you should now that you can just watch the porn on the kiosk.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.680]   Nobody could.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:06.680]   What a moron.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:07.680]   Why are you going to adult theater?
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:08.680]   Come on.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:13.680]   I feel like this is very Blade Runner, the idea of these kiosks.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:16.120]   You see, but that's an emotional and creepy argument.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.280]   No, I like it.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:22.440]   I mean, that's I just read it's emotional, but I like it.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.880]   Before had far-hut module, just wrote a piece at the time of the day that just had me
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:26.880]   gritting my teeth.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.680]   He's becoming quite the lead.
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.880]   Oh, well, so, so is my good friends at the Guardian.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:36.680]   I got to say at the times, all the major publications are it's now the vogue to be against technology.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:40.360]   So in recognition of Alvin Toffler's death, we need futurists.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.600]   We need futurists because the future is coming too fast.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:46.200]   Who says it's not coming fast enough, man?
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.720]   Let's get that future here.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:48.720]   Now.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.840]   Let's cure for a few more diseases.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:52.360]   Let's spread more information.
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:53.600]   Let's educate more people.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.040]   Let's connect more of the world.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.040]   Jeez.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:01.000]   And just the whole of the future is bad.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.160]   Let's make America great again.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:04.160]   That's what that means.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.160]   Don't email me.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:13.280]   How much does as a professor of journalism, I'm asking you, how much does the public
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:16.240]   zeitgeist inform what the journalist is writing about?
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.440]   It is far-hut.
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.240]   Yes, right.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:20.640]   And lost by that?
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:25.640]   Right.
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:30.480]   I think that at a cynical level, Leo, I have seen publications, news organizations now,
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:35.640]   that at a very literal level, watch trends and then go and rewrite articles based on all
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.640]   those trends things.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.240]   I think that's a demand media.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.240]   That's just a...
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.240]   Right.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.120]   Well, that's happened all over in ways that are more subtle now.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.120]   That's what worries me.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:46.360]   A is the more subtle thing where you let the...
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.520]   I guess it's always the case.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.520]   So, right?
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.960]   You're trying to generate traffic and views or...
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.000]   You also get feedback loops of another sort, right?
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.520]   You write a Luddite piece like that, you write a Technopantic piece like that.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:00.280]   And I guarantee there'll be lots of tweets and emails saying, "Yeah, yeah, good."
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.920]   And then you can say, "Well, this is the most Republican public wants."
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:03.920]   It's said.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.600]   What kind of reaction I got?
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:07.000]   I guess it's obvious.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   It's obvious.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.840]   I've been in media long enough to know that there's certainly a great temptation to do that.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:16.240]   I always argue against doing it because I feel like it's the tail wagging the dog that he
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.240]   does.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:18.240]   It's boring, too.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:19.960]   It's boring because it becomes uniform.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.560]   It's just telling people what they already think.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:28.600]   In some ways, don't you want media that challenges your beliefs and...
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:29.800]   Well, maybe not that.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   No, no one reads that.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:31.800]   No one wants that.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:32.800]   I'm serious.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:34.560]   Like, no one wants.
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.880]   They want something that will either validate their thinking.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:38.880]   Yeah, no, you're right.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.680]   In many cases, I shouldn't say every...
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:46.880]   No, I subscribed to magazines of political thought that are completely opposite of mine.
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.840]   Because I want to be challenged.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:55.280]   I don't want to just...
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.360]   Sometimes it makes me mad.
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.360]   But that's okay.
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:02.840]   I was with my parents the last two days and helping them pack and all kinds of things.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:06.960]   And plus, they watch Fox News, so we don't want the TV on at all.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:07.960]   At all.
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.480]   So there's no TV news.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:11.440]   Nothing we're busy for three days.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:14.240]   I did really enjoy the rest of it.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:19.720]   Well, this is a bad year for politics, so I don't plan.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:24.300]   Our 13 year old doesn't, he just goes no no no no no.
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:28.840]   He does not want to hear the word Trump, he does want to hear the word Clinton, he's
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:32.440]   going no no no, and I could completely understand that.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:36.760]   It's kind of, it becomes overloaded.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.620]   I'm a, I'm a political junkie though.
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:40.960]   I like, and I love these conversations.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:44.920]   I really love the, you know, a lot of times I want people on triangulation, I disagree
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:50.600]   with and I love the conversation because I want to hear the other people's points of
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:51.600]   you.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:52.600]   I too.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:57.160]   Yeah, but we're in the, we're the few, I guess.
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:58.520]   Maybe, maybe it's an American thing.
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:01.800]   I've got a friend of mine from Germany.
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:06.120]   We go out sometimes and he's like, every time the conversation gets interesting, everyone
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:08.160]   skirts away from them and talks about something else.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:11.360]   Politics, religion, sex.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:15.600]   Those are the three most interesting things you can talk about.
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:19.320]   But it's, I was talking to a professor at MIT and they're looking to do a conference.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:22.280]   I'm not sure when on what you can't talk about.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:23.280]   Oh, it's really frightening.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.280]   What a great conference.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:27.040]   It is a great, great idea.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:30.840]   And let's, let's, let's talk about what we can't talk about and what's the impact of
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:35.760]   that in, in discussion and in the academe and in politics.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:41.640]   Tonya Chatham says, I want to construct a belief system that's robust enough to face
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:42.640]   its critics.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:45.560]   I like that.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:48.160]   And maybe modify it.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:51.400]   If you can't back down on the internet, no.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:59.800]   When I find myself kind of knee jerk reacting to something, I actually, I take note and
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:00.800]   say, wait a minute.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.880]   Well, you also, you, you, this is part of what drives some of your fans crazy.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:08.280]   They don't see when you were doing the contrarian piece to have a better discussion.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:14.000]   Partly, that's because I'm capable of seeing also many sides to an argument, I think.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.920]   But you also do a full of the show.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.840]   Well, I do it for the sake of the show, but it's also my, it's also kind of my bet.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:24.400]   I mean, to a fault, I, I, you know, if you say, you know, I'm, I'm a murderer.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:29.520]   I'm, you know, there may be some justification for that, you know, and, and I don't know
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.960]   why, but that just to a fault.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:36.360]   I, I, I, I, but it's, it's a unique property.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:39.320]   Not only that, not only do you see it, but you're not afraid to argue the devil's epic
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.320]   position.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.840]   No, the show, but I can do it with shows.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:47.720]   I can do it with often with, with at least empathy.
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:51.040]   Some, yeah, with some real empathy for the, for that position.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.040]   And you do a very good job with that.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.040]   And that's what makes the shows special, I think.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.640]   But some, you know, so you and I will go at it sometimes.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.640]   And I know what you're doing.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.600]   So we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll both play our part.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:04.200]   And you'll have to learn this too, Stacey, that sometimes I might, I might say something
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.360]   that you think reprehensible.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:11.560]   Oh, I would just leave it on, leave it on that every time he does it.
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:12.960]   Oh, that was a Leo.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.760]   And you may, you just will never know if I believe it or not.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.760]   Right.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.760]   That's basically everyone on the internet.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.760]   So we're good.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.560]   And it's normal.
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:29.120]   Fearing surveillance, man shot at Google and set a self-driving car ablaze.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.120]   Oh, no.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120]   Okay.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:36.120]   Now this is, okay, my empathetic instinct says the guy's crazy.
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.200]   It's called Paranoids Gets a Frenic.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.840]   He told police he feared surveillance by Google and he's been arrested and charged
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:48.440]   with arson after one of the company's self-driving cars was destroyed in the attack in June.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:54.400]   And then he was started, he was hanging around the campus in Mountain View after midnight.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:03.240]   In the car, he had homemade explosives and Lord, a pipe bomb in the firearms and, oh, my goodness.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.960]   I think if you will, never go into the dentistry business because people will think that you've
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:07.960]   installed transmitters.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:08.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.960]   I mean, that's a sad situation.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.600]   But it's dangerous too.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.600]   But very dangerous.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.240]   We're lucky nothing more serious happened.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.960]   Well, it was his third time.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:21.840]   What I thought was, it kind of proved his, well, it proved him wrong in some ways because
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.440]   it was his third attempt to, and they never knew to blow up in cars.
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:30.200]   So they caught him on surveillance video, but if they were truly stalking, they probably
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.360]   would have stopped him sooner.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:35.560]   If we're that good, why didn't you know that was going to happen?
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:39.040]   It's an old psychic joke.

[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:51.280]   Do you use no one tap?
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.280]   Only by accident.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.600]   I don't think only for the show if I used it.
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:01.960]   That's when you're on a page and you hold the home button down a little extra and a
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.160]   little screen comes up.

[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.040]   You can even do multiple languages at once.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.040]   Which one?
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:22.040]   German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.120]   Although the example they're giving is in Japanese.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:27.800]   So I don't know what that means.

[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:36.840]   Tap the discover icon and get a stream of visual content related to what's on your screen.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:42.120]   So they're showing an article Earth may have a second moon according to NASA.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.520]   You do now on tap press and hold the home button.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:48.120]   Of course you have to have marshmallow for this and you'll get a whole bunch of looks
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.120]   like probably obvious.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.920]   Yeah, they're not all YouTube though.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.200]   There's some Yahoo videos in there.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.720]   That's good.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.280]   This looks like some but I would have the worst time with this.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.480]   I'm the type of person who used to go to the dictionary to look up words and end up reading
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.480]   up everything else.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.000]   Yeah, it's for you.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.440]   I would never get anything done.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.280]   This features for you.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:12.360]   Search by image, barcodes and QR codes.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:17.400]   So you can use now on tap to search via your camera app for objects like famous landmarks
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.440]   and now they're including barcodes and QR codes.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:24.840]   So the next time you're shopping, if you see a QR code or a barcode, you point your
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:29.400]   camera at it and you'll get helpful cards related to that object such as user reviews.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.000]   It will work with package products, books, DVDs and more.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   Let me see.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   Is there a barcode on this?
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   I'm going to try this.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   So what do I do?
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   I just do I.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   Okay.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.280]   Here's a barcode.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:48.760]   Do I have to have the camera going and then press and hold now and tap?
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.840]   And yes, it did.
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.840]   It's looking it up.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.320]   Oh my gosh.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.320]   That was cool.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.320]   What's the look like?
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.320]   Do you have the over the shoulder because we can do it again?
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:57.320]   I can do it again.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.480]   I can do it again.
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.600]   So I say, oh, there's a barcode.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.360]   Let's press and hold the home button.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:06.960]   You see now and tap and circled it and it looked it up and there it is.
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.400]   That's what I'm looking at.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.840]   Can you scroll up and see like lower pricing or anything else?
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.600]   It offers Google Discover Shopping, YouTuber Share.
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:20.480]   Let's tap the shopping icon and then it's going to pull up Google Shopping and yes, I
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.600]   can shop for it.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.400]   So Leo, go for example, the New York Times site.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.400]   Okay.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.400]   Let's try that.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.400]   Hold down the button.
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.400]   Okay.
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.400]   I'm going to hold on.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.400]   You're trying to figure out the logic of this.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.400]   New York Times.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.400]   I'm on the New York Times site.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.400]   Okay.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.400]   So now hold down the button.
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.400]   Okay.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.400]   Let's hold down the button.
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.400]   Hold down the now.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.400]   I'm going to discover.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.920]   No, I've never seen Discover really before.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:45.400]   So go to Discover and it's kind of a somewhat related but random story.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:51.840]   I was looking at Hillary Clinton, rough day for Clinton sends wave of regret through
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:57.040]   the GOP and I got Bill Cunningham's obituary after I pressed Discover.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:03.400]   So I go to Twitter and I get Hillary Clinton because the story is about Hillary.
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.040]   Okay, fine.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:09.120]   This seems to be just random New York Times stories.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.120]   Maybe.
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.120]   Okay.
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:13.160]   So let me actually go into a story.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.120]   This is open with the New York.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:18.800]   Oh, now I'm going to, should I do it in the New York Times app or a Chrome?
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.800]   You can see what happens.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.680]   Otherwise, all I see, oh, maybe you could do it in the end.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:22.680]   I think I can.
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.040]   That's the whole point of now on tap, right?
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.040]   Right, exactly.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.320]   So wouldn't that be kind of cool?
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:31.160]   You're reading an article and you say, I want to see some opposing points of view.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:34.640]   Now it gave me, now on tap gave me Hillary Rodham, I'm Clinton.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:37.200]   You'll click on Twitter, you're going to get her Twitter account Twitter account.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.200]   What is that?
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.200]   What am I going to get?
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.200]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:44.000]   Well, that's a nice way to quickly find somebody's account.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.200]   I think that could be useful.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:49.520]   As with a lot of this stuff, you've got to be trained to think of it.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.400]   Yeah, I was trained.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.840]   I like the barcode thing.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.840]   That's great.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:55.840]   That is.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.840]   That's super helpful.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:01.360]   And if it's image search, I'm curious because you know how Pinterest just did their whole
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:07.560]   image search stuff where you can hold your phone up and take a picture of something or
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:11.440]   sorry, search by image for similar things in Pinterest.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.440]   It's not with your phone.
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.160]   That would be very useful actually.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.160]   It is.
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:18.280]   If you think about it, it could give you, you know, it could.
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.280]   Does it too?
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:24.040]   Let's say, all right, I'm going to look at this mouse.
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.960]   I mean, this is a very distinctive mouse.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.960]   If it does image recognition, no, see nothing.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.960]   Nothing.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:33.480]   Okay, because I was like, if you could do image recognition, then think about all the
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.280]   cool stuff you could do with that.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.880]   Well, they say for landmarks, you can do that.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:42.120]   So if I'm standing in front of a landmark in the Washington Monument and do it, it'll
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.480]   say, you know, but that's a database thing as opposed to like actual computer vision.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.480]   But they're getting there.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.480]   I'm like, come on.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.480]   It's progress.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.480]   It's progress.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.480]   Come on, future.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.480]   Hurry up.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.480]   Forget Monju.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.480]   Don't listen to Farhad.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.480]   Hurry up future.
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.480]   Future future.
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.480]   Come here.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.480]   Come here.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.480]   Tell me.
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:04.840]   Was it eel trip or Google goggles where you could, I mean, this is like years ago where
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.960]   you could hold up your phone and see where you were in the way like Google would give
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:09.960]   you data about.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:10.960]   Yeah, Google goggles did that.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:11.960]   Is that not?
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:12.960]   Is this still to that?
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.120]   I don't think they even have Google goggles anymore.
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.480]   Yeah, but that's what this sounds like, right?
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.480]   All right.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:20.480]   They said, let me try it with your face.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:23.560]   Somebody said, try it with a face.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:24.560]   You think it would do.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:28.280]   No, it's not going to do that because that would just that would enable creeping.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.280]   It doesn't do that.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.280]   But you know what?
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.280]   You know it could though, right?
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.280]   Oh yeah.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:34.720]   It could easily say, oh, that's Stacy Higginbotham.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.280]   I have her picture in her Google+ profile.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.280]   Right.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.280]   Could he?
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:41.440]   I wish it would do that to be honest with you.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:42.440]   Yes.
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:45.320]   Speaking as an old man with no memory, I would be very useful.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.960]   Hold on a second.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:47.960]   Just stay there.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.960]   Oh, hi, George.
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.800]   We went to school together.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.880]   I see you have two children.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:56.880]   That would be so useful.
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.120]   That was a problem.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:01.120]   You most know all the time.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.120]   And you don't know what you believe.
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:05.640]   You wouldn't believe how many people come here and with all, you know, mind this and
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:10.200]   say, do you remember I was at the cottage five years ago?
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.000]   Happens to me almost every day.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.560]   And I always say, oh yeah, it's nice to see you again.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.560]   Right.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:20.360]   Can I tell you how the affectation, when I was a columnist in San Francisco and God
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:24.240]   bless them, they have my face on newsboxes and news trucks for a while.
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.240]   Right.
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.240]   Wow.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.240]   And no size.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.840]   So people won't come up and say that when you worked at the examiner.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:30.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.040]   I remember that the examiner trucks ago around with a columnist.
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.040]   Wow.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.040]   That's a fame and glory.
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:42.360]   So the problem was that that if you say hi to someone, it contains an ellipsis.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.120]   Like hi, Leo.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.120]   Right.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:46.120]   Right.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.120]   So I can't say hi.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.120]   So I started saying howdy.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.920]   Because you don't say howdy.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.920]   Very California.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:53.720]   You just say howdy.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.720]   What do they do?
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.920]   They say howdy in Austin.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.920]   Howdy.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.320]   Howdy y'all.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.840]   By the way, goggles is still around.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.840]   I apologize.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:01.840]   It is.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:03.840]   And it does.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.840]   Wow.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.840]   It does the same thing.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.280]   It has search from camera.
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.440]   Get goggles results for pictures you take.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.480]   If you've enabled location in the settings app as well as in Google settings, they will
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.480]   send location data.
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.480]   Okay.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.480]   So now it does.
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:21.760]   It's it's you take a picture or something and it'll it'll it'll figure out where you recognize
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.760]   your logo.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.760]   That's a good question.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:25.760]   That's exciting.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.760]   Oh, that's good.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.760]   It's not even doing anything.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.760]   Oh, baby.
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:33.760]   Maybe it's really gone.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:41.760]   Maybe it maybe it doesn't work.
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.760]   It just pretended to work.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.760]   Oh, analyzing activate camera light.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:47.760]   Oh my God.
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.760]   It worked.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:49.760]   Oh, you're kidding.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:52.760]   It says this week in tech MP3 edition, Petaluma landmark.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.720]   Oh, you're landmark.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.760]   Oh, MG.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.600]   Thank you goggles.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.600]   Welcome to the landmark.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.760]   We're going to do Stacy's face.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.760]   Okay.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.840]   Now we're going to do Stacy's face because she's a landmark in Austin.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.840]   Oh, yes.
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.240]   Well, they're cute smile.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.240]   All right.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.240]   Let's see.
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.240]   We have it.
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.240]   Now what happened there?
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.240]   Okay.
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.240]   Activate camera light.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.240]   I'm going to do it again.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:23.640]   What's going on?
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.240]   It's kind of slow.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:27.040]   It's rejecting my face.
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:31.000]   It's not going to like this at all.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   I now know why Google thinks you're a boy.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.600]   Oh, dear.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.480]   Oh, that's so mean.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.480]   I apologize.
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:44.480]   Oh, I apologize for Google.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.520]   Oh, that's so sad.
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.520]   That is so mean.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:51.200]   Oh, it's you know, it's the short hair, I think.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.200]   It's the short.
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.200]   I'm not wearing lipstick.
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.800]   There's a lot of things wrong here from a Google perspective.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.720]   Although, did it put me in glasses?
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.720]   It did put you in glasses, which is really weird.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:01.720]   It's really weird.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:02.720]   It's really weird.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:03.720]   It's really weird.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:04.720]   Your own face.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:05.720]   Your own face.
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:06.720]   I'm installing it now.
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:07.720]   Should I do it?
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:08.720]   Okay.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:09.720]   I'll do my own face.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:10.720]   Why not?
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:11.720]   It's for yourself.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:12.720]   We are such idiots, Scott.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.280]   People turn in the show to learn something instead.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:20.160]   We're going, hey, here's this five-year-old program we've just rediscovered.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.160]   Liquid it'll do.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.160]   Yeah, Leo.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.560]   We did that five years ago.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.560]   You knit with it.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:29.520]   Next show, we'll stick hats and funny filters over our faces.
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.360]   Done been there, done that.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:33.840]   I should do it to you, Jeff, because it probably--
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.840]   Do it to me.
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.000]   Would you think it would think you're a woman?
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   Probably.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.440]   I think I know it'll think I'm dead.
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.600]   I was like, not with that beard, I hope.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:46.720]   He used to be on the side of a-- of an examiner.
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:49.720]   Oh, no.
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:50.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:56.520]   It thinks you're a terrorist, apparently.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:57.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.160]   I have Oat Leonardo Decaprio.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.160]   That's good.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.160]   George Clooney.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.160]   Hey.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:05.720]   Oh, what's his name?
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:06.720]   Gyllenhaal.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:07.720]   What is the label above that?
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:08.720]   What does it say?
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:11.360]   It says, "No objects recognize brows similar images."
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:14.280]   There's-- there you go.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.280]   There you go.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.280]   We found you, Jeff.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.640]   Oh, that's impressive facial hair right there.
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:21.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.640]   I think that would be a good look for you.
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:26.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.640]   I like that.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.640]   I'm a chef.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.640]   I'm a chef.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.640]   This is very odd.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.280]   I'm going to-- wait a minute.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.280]   I'm going to do you against this.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:37.640]   I don't think we did-- I don't think we did you justice.
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:40.120]   I think I'm about to be humiliated again.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:44.200]   I just feel we can do better.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.200]   I don't know.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:50.600]   You know, maybe if I just took it straight on instead, you know, like that.
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.640]   I like how it does-- it does is analyzing.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.640]   Analyzing.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:55.840]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:57.960]   Oh, I'm still a boy.
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:58.960]   Worse.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.320]   Oh, am I an animal?
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:06.880]   That's going to be my new Google profile.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:11.280]   I don't-- it's just really decided that you are a freak, apparently.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.600]   It's the blue in the hair.
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.160]   That's got to be what it is.
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.160]   What?
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.160]   What?
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.160]   Google?
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.160]   What?
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.600]   Oh, not at all.
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.680]   What the hell?
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:26.680]   This is just not-- this is mean.
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:30.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.840]   I was worried about this being creepy, but this is just something.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.600]   That was just weird.
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.600]   Oh.
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:38.880]   Yeah, are you worried about Google search results?
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:39.960]   I don't think so.
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:40.960]   Can I do a picture of me?
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:41.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.200]   Let me--
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.480]   That's hard to do.
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.960]   OK.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.280]   Do you have to use the rear camera?
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:47.640]   Can you--
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.840]   Yeah, it doesn't seem like I could turn it around.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:52.400]   It's not made for selfies.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.480]   Oh, that's good.
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:55.080]   Oh, that's really good.
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:57.360]   I think we're going to retire this application.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:58.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:04.320]   [GROANING]
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.160]   OK.
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.080]   Yeah, that's me.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.800]   That's me right there in a nutshell.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:14.560]   Yeah, that's me.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.440]   All right.
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:16.400]   So Google goggles.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.560]   Not so great.
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.560]   That's so great.
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.560]   That's so great.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.560]   We're just not landmarks.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.760]   That's the kind of--
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.240]   What's weird is it works with the Twit logo?
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:26.320]   Yeah, I think you have to be a landmark.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.760]   Or maybe I wonder, I should take a picture of a famous person
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:32.000]   with this and see if they're recognized.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.400]   Well, George Clooney, and it will put up me.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.960]   That would be pretty impressive.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.640]   And I don't know how George would feel about that.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:40.360]   I'm like, screenshot that and give it to Jeff who'd make his day.
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:44.360]   Google did recently buy an image recognition company
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.600]   from France.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:50.960]   Two weeks after Twitter acquired Magic Pony
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.600]   in a little bit of confusion over the name,
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.280]   because I think Twitter probably thought it was a Magic Pony.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.360]   That was for machine learning.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:02.000]   Google has announced it's acquired mood stocks, which
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.120]   is a startup out of Paris that develops machine learning
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:08.920]   based image recognition for smartphones.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:13.440]   Shazam for images, they call it.
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.080]   Kind of interesting.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.600]   Mood stocks.
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:20.320]   That would give it the AI ability to have you
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.720]   take a photo of something and be like, oh, bam,
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.480]   here's other things that are this.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:26.520]   I mean, it's kind of what we were just doing,
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:30.400]   but maybe Google realized they could do a little bit better.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:32.200]   That's like, mood stocks.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.760]   We'll make sure I'm not the person with monster tattooed.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:35.480]   And I'm going to ask you.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:40.000]   Wow, that is just wow.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.880]   Here's that wonderful Euro cookie privacy statement
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:47.640]   that appears everywhere I go.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:48.480]   That's really-- you know what?
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:54.280]   I feel so much better now that all those sites have those.
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.200]   Let's see.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.160]   Wi-Fi kiosks.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.120]   We did that 10 million Android devices
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.760]   infected with Chinese malware.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.120]   Well done.
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:08.280]   Mostly not in US, but can I guess something to be aware of.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:13.200]   You have to go to a third party store, I believe.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.120]   The malware called Hummingbird actually
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:18.360]   comes from a Chinese ad company.
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:23.160]   Let me turn off my audio.
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.000]   I don't know.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.880]   I hate auto start videos.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.800]   Thank you, CNET.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.600]   It's a team of developers at a company called Ying Mob,
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.280]   which is an otherwise legitimate advertising analytics
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.400]   agency based in Beijing.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:40.800]   But they apparently have a team responsible
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.520]   for developing malicious components.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:47.400]   The development team for overseas platform, 25 employees,
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.080]   Hummingbird-- not Hummingbird, I'm sorry-- Hummingbird,
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:53.040]   it was a drive-by download in which phones were infected
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.360]   when people visited websites.
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:56.520]   So I guess you didn't have to install intentionally.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.720]   The first component attempts to gain root access
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.800]   on a device with a root kit that exploits
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.920]   multiple vulnerabilities, probably the stage fright,
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:05.960]   I would guess, vulnerability.
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.720]   But I'm not sure if successful attackers
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:09.960]   gain full access to a device.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.400]   If that fails, a second component
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.440]   uses a fake system update notification,
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.600]   tweaking users into granting Humming bad system level
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.960]   permissions.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:21.080]   It generates fraudulent advertising revenue
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:26.400]   through the forced downloading of apps and clicking of ads.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:29.400]   And researchers say, checkpoint, which
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:32.120]   discovered this said they're making about $300,000 a month,
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.440]   they would guess on doing this.
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:37.120]   Most of the victims in China and India--
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.840]   1.6 million in China, 1.35 million in India,
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:43.160]   Philippines, and Asia, Turkey, the US, though,
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:47.280]   has 228,800 infected devices.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:51.160]   The UK and Australia fewer than 100,000.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:51.660]   Wow.
[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:56.720]   And coming from a legitimate company,
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.840]   that's what's really interesting.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:01.160]   They actually have a division to do this kind of stuff.
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:04.400]   So what are the best practices right now for security
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.120]   on my phone, for example?
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:09.000]   Getting a phone-- and you nailed it, Stacey, when you said it,
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.320]   that does the Android monthly security update.
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:13.400]   OK.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:16.640]   And Samsung does it, LG does it.
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:19.040]   I'm pretty sure HTC does it.
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.440]   That was one of the-- in fact, pretty much the only question
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.640]   mark on this OnePlus.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.240]   OnePlus has not yet said whether they planned to.
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.800]   There was some question about it.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.920]   But I noticed I'm up to date through June.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.920]   I'll let you-- I mean, I would guess in the next week,
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.120]   I'll get the July update.
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.400]   If that's the case, then this would be another one.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.880]   And the reason is there are issues.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:42.320]   I would almost guarantee most of those affected phones.
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.760]   And the reasons so big in China and India
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:47.800]   are inexpensive phones that have not been updated ever.
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:51.760]   And they're running older versions of Android.
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:57.720]   Although there is a way to tell if you have Humming Bad.
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:05.720]   CNET has a article, "How to Kill Humming Bad."
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:10.480]   How can I turn this off?
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.440]   Auto Play Off.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.520]   Thank you.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:14.680]   Thank you, CNET.
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.520]   I want to watch your video.
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.640]   Is there not an app that lets you just stop, like, kind
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:20.760]   of like Adblocker only?
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:21.680]   No, and the reason--
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:22.560]   --floss auto auto play.
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:25.120]   No, and the reason-- oh, no, no.
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.520]   No, in fact, you know what's funny?
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.280]   I have.
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:31.120]   You block Origin running and Adblocker.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.120]   And this is still auto running.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.680]   Because it's a legit--
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:35.920]   --it's first party site.
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.840]   It's coming directly from there.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.840]   I thought you were going to ask if there was an app--
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.520]   anti-virus app you could run on Android.
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.600]   And there really isn't anything that's effective.
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:47.680]   Google does the most effective thing, which is scan downloads
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.240]   every time you download something,
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.200]   unless you disable it.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:51.320]   Google will scan it.
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.960]   There are third party apps that do something similar.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.960]   Lookout is a very well-known one.
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:58.600]   But the way mobile devices are designed,
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.760]   you really don't--
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:03.440]   generally, you don't let apps kind of snoop around
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.520]   on the hard drive.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.360]   Scanning for things, stuff like that.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:12.400]   It's so much better than the old days when I had a Windows
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.520]   machine 10 years ago, 15 years ago.
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:19.040]   And the hell you'd go through with that and your father.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.040]   It's got a good situation.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.880]   It's much better.
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:27.440]   But unfortunately, there are much more malicious bad attacks
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.160]   out there, like ransomware attacks.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.240]   I think we saw the first ransomware attacks
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.080]   on smartphones this week.
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:33.600]   Oh.
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:33.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.960]   I think there's an Android.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.160]   Let me just check real quickly.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.520]   Ransomware.
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:39.560]   Ransomware is really nasty, because what it does
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:43.080]   is it gets on your system and encrypts your files,
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.160]   and then says, if you want to ever see your files again,
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:45.920]   you've got to pay us.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:51.000]   We've been talking-- this is aggressive Android.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.080]   Ransomware spreading in the US-- actually,
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.000]   this is from last year.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.320]   Sorry, that's not an up-to-date story.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:02.080]   Cyber police Android ransomware.
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.760]   It's been in the wild for some time,
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:05.760]   but it's using a new technique.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:11.160]   So ransomware would be the thing you really don't want to get.
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.800]   Well, isn't there also some sort of--
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.120]   I guess this would be ransomware.
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:17.080]   It's not encryption, though.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.880]   It takes your photos and threatens
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:19.880]   to send them out to everybody.
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:21.080]   Bad enough.
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:23.040]   That would be bad.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.640]   That would be a bad thing.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.080]   Happened to a friend of mine.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.080]   Did it?
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:28.560]   Yeah, it was--
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:29.920]   I mean, it wasn't a terrible photo,
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:33.920]   but she was a little sexier than she probably wanted to.
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:37.000]   It found a provocative photo?
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.160]   I mean, like, it was looking for provocative photos?
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.600]   I don't know if there was a person behind it,
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:45.440]   and they got all of her photos and picked the most embarrassing
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:45.800]   one.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:47.840]   But they found the most embarrassing one.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:48.560]   Yeah, well--
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:49.080]   Wow.
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:52.320]   It was embarrassing enough, so--
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.000]   She said, OK.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:54.600]   Send it out.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.240]   No, she actually-- she did not pay the rent.
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:56.920]   They sent it out.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.320]   That's how I know about it, because I
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.360]   got a copy of my friend--
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.160]   That's horrific.
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:01.880]   Right.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.040]   That's what I like.
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.040]   I'm like--
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.120]   That's terrible.
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.680]   So-- but I don't know what that was,
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.400]   and I looked for more information about this,
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.800]   because I was like, holy cow.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.920]   That's--
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:14.560]   That-- you know what?
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:17.520]   That-- see, with ransomware, if you have a good backup--
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:20.720]   and the truth is, most Android devices are probably backed up.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:23.000]   There's nothing on there that you can't afford to just wipe
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.080]   the phone and start over.
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.720]   But that bypasses that.
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:31.280]   If it can find a compromising photo and send it out.
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.480]   This is why I have no compromising photos on my phone.
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.120]   Wow.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:35.600]   Wow.
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.440]   Nordewa.
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:36.920]   My wife--
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:37.480]   No, when she had--
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.040]   My wife put the kibush on that.
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:42.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.800]   Oh, honey, stay right there.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:46.640]   No!
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:47.320]   Don't move.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.640]   I love that.
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:56.760]   So the ransomware that is reported in this article,
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:00.240]   and it's called Cyber Police because you get a pop-up that
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.640]   says, this is the cyber police.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.400]   And you've been up to no good.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.360]   All actions are illegal.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.280]   Our fixed history query stored in the database
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.440]   of the US Department of Homeland Security.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.600]   Attention, your device has been locked.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.400]   Reasons indicated below.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:20.000]   And then if you have 71 hours on this screenshot
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.960]   to give them money to get your thing unlocked,
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:27.080]   the ransom-- $2, $100 Apple iTunes gift cards.
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:28.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.560]   Jesus.
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:32.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:34.400]   And by the way, it doesn't do anything.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.640]   But the thing is, this gets on your machine
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:40.400]   the same way that previous one did by a side load
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.720]   from a web page.
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:45.680]   This takes advantage of older Android devices.
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:48.240]   This is not going to impact you if you have an up-to-date Android
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:52.520]   device, in my opinion.
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:53.760]   Oh, OK.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:56.280]   So they're saying--
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:59.560]   I can never say-- Kaspersky Labs did a report at the end of June
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:02.560]   saying, yes, there's a fourfold increase
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:05.840]   in the number of users attacked using Android ransomware.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:06.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:08.520]   Terrible.
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:09.520]   Terrible.
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:12.320]   All right.
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:15.440]   All right, well, I feel kind of sad and dirty and bad.
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:18.240]   But no, but have an up-to-date device.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.920]   I think you probably are right, because these take advantage,
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:24.000]   basically, of flaws in the operating system.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.120]   The problem is that because Google--
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:28.920]   of the way Google has done Android,
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.200]   there are a lot of phones that are not being patched.
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.600]   And Google's doing the best they can to fix that.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.800]   They're moving a lot of the components
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.240]   that were part of the updated operating system out
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.560]   into Play Store, where they can be updated automatically
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.880]   via Play Store mechanisms.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.800]   They've instituted these monthly security patch
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.720]   fixes, which are really, I think, important.
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:54.920]   But there's nothing they can do about low-cost Android devices
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.960]   that were sold and have never been updated by the carrier
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:02.920]   since with older versions.
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:05.040]   A lot of them are vulnerable because of the stage
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.560]   of vulnerability.
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:11.920]   Google now is trying to twist the knife in its victory
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:12.920]   against Oracle.
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:18.440]   They're asking for sanctions against the Oracle attorney.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.320]   You sue us.
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.600]   We will murder you and your children.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:26.920]   And what this was interesting, it
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:29.400]   plays Apple a billion dollars to be on the iPhone.
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.160]   What?
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.760]   That's an interesting-- this is Joe Mullen writing in ours,
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:34.720]   Technica.
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:37.600]   What's the deal there, Stacey?
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.240]   With-- oh, OK.
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:43.520]   The attorney basically shared the details of this deal,
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.000]   the billion dollars on that.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.240]   So and they're like, dude, that was under people--
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:48.040]   Confidential.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:48.560]   --infected.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:49.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:52.640]   So this was during the discovery procedure.
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.920]   And that burst to the Oracle attorney
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:57.080]   said that Google's Android operating system had generated
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.400]   revenue of $31 billion.
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:00.760]   That's $22 billion of profit.
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:03.360]   I remember when this came out.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:05.360]   Yeah, I mean, it was big.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:06.440]   And for the Google search bar on iPhones,
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:09.120]   they pay Apple a billion dollars.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.840]   So they want her to be censured.
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:12.680]   And the figure to be struck from the record,
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:13.480]   a little late for that.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:15.440]   That's Google's right to be forgotten.
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:21.480]   That percentage just stated that should be sealed.
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:22.560]   We are talking--
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.160]   This is just sour grapes.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.440]   This is like, OK, fine.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:29.280]   We're just going to make your life a little bit harder.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:32.040]   Well, why not?
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:32.760]   Exactly.
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:35.840]   If you've got the lawyers and the question, why not?
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:37.480]   Go for broke.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.480]   Scorch that earth.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:40.000]   Yes.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000]   You'll never sue us again.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.840]   And actually, to add insult to injury,
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:47.360]   a jury has just ruled that Oracle's
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:51.160]   going to pay $3 billion to HP Enterprise for some patents.
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:56.440]   They-- the itanium-- actually, it wasn't patents.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:02.160]   It was titanium systems that Hewlett Packard stopped
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.480]   making, I guess.
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:05.640]   Actions that contributed to the decline
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:09.000]   of a once lucrative line of high-end computers.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.040]   Oracle violated a contract when it
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.520]   decided to stop creating new versions of its database
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:19.480]   software for the itanium chip, which HP was still selling
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:22.120]   into Enterprise.
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.520]   Ah.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:24.520]   Amazon Robot.
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:29.320]   What?
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:30.200]   I was like, what?
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:30.720]   What?
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.220]   Amazon Robot.
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:36.320]   Now, Robot Challenge, deep learning AI, a robotic arm
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:39.040]   that could do the work of a warehouse worker three times
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.120]   faster.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:41.640]   That will not take long.
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:42.360]   Yeah.
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.040]   They'll be aiming for that.
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:46.240]   Well, they already-- you know, it's already somewhat automated,
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:46.240]   right?
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:50.560]   Because the pick and hold system that moves you around.
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.320]   And yeah.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.720]   So it's just really the arm.
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:57.680]   It's the one thing that humans contributing at this point.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:00.880]   And these robots are getting better.
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:04.060]   They could get the dog from Boston Dynamics, the new one,
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:05.860]   that empties the dishwasher for you.
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:06.500]   What?
[01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:07.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.540]   I'm buying that.
[01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:10.860]   That's not what it's a sold job.
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:13.500]   A dishwashing emptying dog?
[01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:14.220]   Yeah, go look.
[01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:15.740]   I mean, this was a couple of weeks ago.
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:17.420]   It's the latest version of the--
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:20.100]   That's not so scary anymore, yeah.
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:21.420]   Oh, it's still scary.
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:22.420]   That thing is--
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:24.500]   God, it haunts my dreams.
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:26.380]   No, but it empties your dishwasher.
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:28.740]   And it brings you cokes.
[01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:30.220]   Oh, it is scary looking, though.
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:32.140]   You're absolutely right.
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:37.260]   It kind of looks like a dinosaur, a raptor.
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:38.560]   OK, there it goes.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.480]   Oh, these are the Boston Dynamics dogs.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:42.120]   They're not as noisy either, right?
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:42.820]   They're not battery.
[01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:43.900]   Maybe you got rid of the hydraulics.
[01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:44.900]   Yeah.
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:47.220]   [HONKING]
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:49.180]   Oh, this isn't the video where they do the--
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:50.420]   I thought it was.
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:52.340]   They've just taken a walk.
[01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:53.180]   They're walking the dog?
[01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:53.660]   I don't know, babe.
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:54.660]   Look, it can go under it.
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:55.660]   I see.
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:57.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:00.700]   Dog-- dog tricks, robotic dog tricks.
[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:01.520]   Isn't that cute?
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:03.160]   Stupid pet tricks with the dog.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:06.400]   No, I think he's going to go in and help that in the--
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:09.160]   God, you would just be terrified if you looked behind you
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:10.880]   and that was walking around, wouldn't it?
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.600]   Oh, I don't know where--
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:16.200]   what show I was at, but I was next to the original one,
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:17.000]   like the real version of it.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.520]   Oh, you've seen it in person?
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:21.600]   Yes, it is just as scary as you would imagine.
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:22.040]   Like if that--
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.440]   Look at that head.
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:24.200]   What's it doing?
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:25.400]   Push-ups?
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.880]   Showing how it can keep the head in one position
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.360]   while the body changes.
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:32.560]   And the lack of hydraulics.
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.760]   Is there a sound on this, Karsten?
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:35.280]   Here we go.
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:36.200]   It needs a tail.
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:42.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:48.680]   That's not how you load a dishwasher spot.
[01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:51.520]   That's how my daughter and my husband load the dishwasher.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:51.560]   Right.
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.280]   They just throw stuff in.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.280]   They're like, it's in there.
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:54.840]   It's in there.
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:55.720]   All right, let's get all get clean.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:56.720]   Look.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:57.240]   Look.
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:57.640]   It's recycling.
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:58.760]   It is recycling.
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:01.360]   Good job, Spot.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.120]   Oh, god.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:04.960]   It slipped on banana peels.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:05.960]   Literally.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:06.960]   There's banana.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.240]   They're eating it, Boston.
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:10.560]   I'm telling you, they're remembering all this.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:14.040]   Look at all the marks against the wall of robots falling.
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:17.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.000]   Oh, this is terrible.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000]   This is terrible.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.120]   It will chase after you.
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:22.920]   Oh, Far-hod is OK.
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:24.920]   This is Far-hod's right.
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:25.800]   Oh, bring it back.
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:29.800]   Now what it's got, it's head stored on top of it.
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:32.200]   It's trotting.
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.040]   Answer version.
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:36.280]   Why do they make them so scary looking?
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:38.280]   If they made it like cut a layer,
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.480]   they need a tail that wags.
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:43.320]   So glad Google sold that company.
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:45.320]   Oh.
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:47.520]   Like, OK, I'm done.
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:50.960]   Here's a-- here's a cinder blocks.
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:54.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:58.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.520]   How do these guys not laugh?
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:01.000]   Oh, whoa.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000]   Oh, my god.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.440]   It just threw a cinder block.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:08.560]   I don't think you want a dog that'll do that.
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:09.560]   No.
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:11.360]   Holy cow.
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.320]   What's disturbing is that same little clicking
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:14.880]   dance that it does before it throws it
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:18.320]   is the same thing my dog does when she's excited about a treat.
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:22.760]   Scary juxtaposition there.
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:24.680]   Oh, my god.
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:26.760]   Now, I guess the point of this is this
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:30.000]   could be digging out people out of--
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:30.520]   Rubble.
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:32.160]   Rubble.
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:35.240]   But you better hope you're not behind it.
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:36.880]   Or that you're not like--
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.920]   it's not owned by police and you're trying to get away.
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:41.920]   Yeah.
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:45.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.320]   Stacy, have you been being badly
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:48.560]   for thinking that way?
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:50.480]   No, but every-- I mean, as a journalist,
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.440]   I'm always like, how can the state use something like this
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:52.960]   against--
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:53.720]   You're right.
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:55.480]   Well, she lives in Texas, Jeff, remember.
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:55.920]   Oh, that's true.
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:57.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.240]   How can I buy it and use it for my own defense?
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.960]   Exactly.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:02.400]   Can I help fit this with a gun?
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:03.480]   Yeah.
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:03.960]   So--
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:05.240]   Well, pardon me for this, but Texas
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:08.200]   could use it for executions.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:10.880]   Stone him to death.
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:11.920]   The machine did it.
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:12.680]   Oh, guys.
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:13.180]   No.
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:14.000]   No, that is--
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000]   you mean.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.400]   Stacy, do you-- do you conceal carry?
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:18.880]   No.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:19.480]   No, I don't.
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:20.520]   OK, just checking.
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:21.360]   For him.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.280]   I can't take that.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:24.760]   To upset you.
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:27.600]   But you see how this preserves the piece?
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:30.960]   If I know you're armed, I'm not going to do anything too
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:33.160]   challenging.
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:34.880]   I can take you-- Leo.
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:35.600]   Totally.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.440]   You don't know I'm not armed.
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:39.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.440]   Like, what about my martial arts training?
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.600]   You probably could take me.
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.120]   I'm sure you could.
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:46.000]   I always told my kids that don't yell at people
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000]   as we drive down the street.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.640]   You don't know if they're armed or not.
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:51.160]   So my parents used to tell me this.
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:53.400]   And it was kind of nice when I lived in New York,
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:55.520]   because I could yell at anyone down the street.
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:57.480]   And I felt pretty good.
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:00.480]   But in Texas, that's actually true.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:01.720]   And--
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.000]   So it makes us a more civil society.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:04.800]   It does not.
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:05.280]   It's--
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.720]   This is an example of Leo doing the double zap.
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:08.720]   No.
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:09.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:11.800]   I just say, you know, Stacy, don't worry.
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.200]   Don't go to--
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.920]   Why bother show with this guy?
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:17.400]   You're on with Leo's alter ego right now.
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:19.120]   But Leo will come back.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:22.080]   Leo will return.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:24.760]   If everybody in that nightclub in Orlando
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:27.280]   had care-- it was carrying a gun.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:29.400]   There would be more people dead.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:30.480]   No.
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.160]   Just the one.
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:34.360]   Yes, more people dead.
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.840]   Probably also the shooter, which makes people feel good.
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:37.520]   But--
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:39.880]   Others-- well, collateral damage.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:41.680]   Friendly fire.
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.440]   That doesn't belong in nightclubs.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.960]   No, I agree.
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:48.160]   Finally, Yahoo is going to get sold.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:49.560]   Finally.
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:50.640]   Maybe.
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:52.640]   Finally.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:56.600]   A third round of bids comes in today.
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:02.240]   And then the final selection process in about two weeks.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:08.160]   Verizon's still, according to recode, the leading bidder, Tim
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:14.040]   Armstrong, the head of AOL, is leading the negotiations.
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:17.480]   The founder of Quick and Loans, Dan Gilbert.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:24.040]   And private equity firm, TPG, also, apparently in the running.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:27.160]   Current bids estimated to be around $3 and 1/2 billion
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:30.760]   to $5 billion for Yahoo's core business.
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:33.400]   That's down a lot from the $8 billion.
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:36.160]   I think it was that they were talking initially.
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:38.360]   And this article in C-- why don't we keep getting--
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:41.160]   How much was Microsoft going to spend on it?
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:42.080]   Oh, was it $21?
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:43.240]   I was just looking that up.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:46.400]   I'm like $21 billion, $31 billion, some huge amount.
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:47.200]   It was crazy.
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.320]   It was huge.
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:51.160]   And it was about this time, because it was around Sun Valley,
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.040]   that they had their little billionaires sleepover.
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:55.840]   And so trying to do all that.
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:57.560]   By the way, Dan Gilbert, the Quick and Loans founder,
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.320]   also owns the Cleveland Cavaliers,
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:01.040]   the world champion Cleveland cabinet.
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.760]   Poor Marissa didn't get invited to Sun Valley this year.
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:04.400]   Really?
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:07.120]   They said they say, oh, that's a burn.
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:08.600]   That's where she's not there.
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.320]   I thought she's had twins.
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:11.680]   Maybe she said, I don't want to go.
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:12.640]   I'm busy through the same.
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:14.640]   Yeah, just like I don't want to go to Apple events.
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:16.840]   I don't want to go to this.
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.080]   I don't want to go.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:18.440]   It's OK.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:19.480]   You don't have to invite me.
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:20.080]   I don't want to go.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:28.160]   So we'll just-- I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.760]   Meyer will get a pretty big payout.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:36.560]   I think it was something like $53 million her buyout.
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:39.680]   But she's the kind of person who could sit back on her Google
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:39.880]   money.
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:41.400]   She gets a better agnontated restaurant life.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:41.880]   No.
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:42.720]   She'll go to something else.
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:45.320]   It's in a front.
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:47.920]   And I don't think it's clear that she didn't save Yahoo,
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:50.440]   but I don't think it's clear that she could have saved Yahoo.
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:51.640]   I agree.
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:54.360]   I think someone told me this, and I thought it was actually
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:57.240]   a really astute point, is that she was brought in
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:58.400]   as a product person.
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.200]   And what Yahoo really needed at the time
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:04.760]   was a financial engineering person who could basically monetize
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:06.600]   what it had and get out.
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.640]   I think that's probably true.
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:11.840]   So Microsoft's bid in 2008 was $31 a share
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:14.720]   worth $44.6 billion.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.360]   That's where the $31 came from, the $31 a share.
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.520]   $44 billion.
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:22.120]   Now, did Yahoo turn that down?
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:23.280]   Yes.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:23.800]   Yes.
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:25.280]   Yeah, it was like--
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:27.720]   And now, you know, Microsoft's been $20.
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:31.280]   Who were they asked for $40 a share?
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:34.360]   And Steve Bomber went, oh, wow, we just dodged a bullet.
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.800]   Wow.
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:39.240]   They bought Nokia, not for as much.
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:41.480]   Not nearly as much, yeah.
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.800]   Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront,
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:46.440]   time to invest, time to save, long-term savings,
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.960]   so important to your financial future.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:51.840]   If the kids are going to college, they're important.
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:54.440]   If you plan to retire, ever, it's important.
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:57.120]   Maybe you want to buy a house or just a rainy day fund.
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:00.120]   But the question is, once you start building your nest egg,
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:02.120]   how do you keep it growing?
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:03.720]   You're not going to put it in your mattress
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:06.480]   or your savings account, which is about the same thing
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:07.160]   these days.
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:08.720]   Interest rates are so low.
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:10.120]   So you're going to invest it, right?
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:10.960]   Are you going to do that?
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:12.680]   Are you going to do the work, the reading, the research?
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:13.560]   I did.
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:15.720]   Problem is, you also then have to pay attention,
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:20.040]   like every few months, readjust, reassign, reinvest.
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:22.440]   I did that for a while, and then I forgot about it.
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:23.560]   And 10 years later, I went, oh, I
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:25.480]   wonder how those investments are going.
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:27.480]   That was not a good plan.
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:28.920]   You could go to an investment advisor,
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:31.120]   go to the guy down on the strip mall here.
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:32.200]   And he'll charge you.
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:33.080]   Oh, yeah, he will.
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:37.160]   Between 1% and 3% of what you have under management.
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:40.480]   Every year, that means you'd have to make 3% more
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:43.600]   just to break even, not to mention the hidden fees,
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:44.840]   the transaction costs.
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:46.480]   I got a better way.
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:47.840]   Wealthfront.
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:50.480]   Because it's a computer managing, you may say,
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:51.600]   well, I don't want a computer.
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:53.080]   Yes, you do.
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:57.440]   Because the computer software has the best, most intelligent
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:00.320]   thinking about investments already built into it.
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:05.040]   It monitors your investments not weekly or monthly or yearly,
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:07.240]   but constantly.
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:09.520]   So it does things like tax loss harvesting
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:12.840]   and rebalancing every minute.
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:15.680]   Constantly adjusting to get you the best return
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:18.040]   and the lowest tax bill.
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:19.600]   You can do this for college savings, too.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:22.120]   They just introduced their 529 college savings plan.
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:25.840]   So like a Roth IRA, it lets you invest after tax dollars
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:29.080]   and save for a child or a grandchild's college
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:31.760]   and other higher education expenses.
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:32.880]   They've got retirement.
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:35.440]   They've got long-term investments of all kinds.
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.280]   If you go to Wealthfront right now,
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:39.640]   at wealthfront.com/twig, if you will,
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:42.560]   you can get a sample portfolio based on the few questions.
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:44.760]   It's not a big questionnaire they ask you.
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:46.200]   But they've really boiled it down
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:48.120]   to just a few simple questions.
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:49.560]   They'll make a portfolio for you.
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:51.560]   You can see what they would invest in for you.
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:52.920]   You can really get a sense of the idea.
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:55.400]   You can even bring your existing portfolio
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:57.680]   and have them automatically.
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:39:58.600]   No human.
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:02.640]   Take a look at what your costs are, what you're losing
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:06.000]   to expenses and that kind of thing.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.480]   If you do decide to invest, it starts at $500.
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:10.560]   That's the minimum investment.
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:12.160]   And we're going to do something really nice.
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:13.360]   Actually, they do it.
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.880]   They're going to manage your first $15,000,
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:18.720]   absolutely fee-free forever.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:22.400]   So not only is it only one quarter, one percent a year,
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:25.880]   but it's on the assets above the first $15,000.
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:30.040]   And you never pay commissions or transaction fees.
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:32.560]   It's really a good way to do this.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:36.040]   It's just, you said it and you forget it and it's fantastic.
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:37.760]   Wealthfront, find out more.

[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:43.360]   Answer the question so you can really get a sense
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:44.320]   of what's involved.
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.480]   I think you'll be very impressed.

[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:57.200]   Senator Warren says, "Apple, Google and Amazon
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:58.920]   "have too much power.
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:01.560]   "Competition is dying in America.
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:02.880]   "It's all because of mergers."
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:03.800]   You agree?
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:06.880]   I really like Elizabeth Warren,
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:09.920]   but I think maybe that's not the best message
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:11.680]   to send right now.
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:13.320]   No, it's not.
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:17.120]   But it's the European view of antitrust.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:20.400]   That big is bad, as opposed to the American view
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:25.400]   of antitrust is does it pass the test of harming competition?
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:29.400]   And that's the law, by the way, in the US.
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:33.040]   In the US antitrust law says you have to use your,
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:35.480]   nothing wrong with monopoly unless you use it
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:38.680]   to enter new markets and harm competition.
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:42.040]   Nothing wrong with being big.
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:44.680]   So she's arguing for different definitions of antitrust,
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:46.320]   which is just big as bad.
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:48.080]   But then...
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:50.600]   I don't disagree with her that we maybe have a few
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:53.360]   too many mergers, that the oversight hasn't been great.
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:57.080]   Although they've stopped a few sprint and T-Mobile remember
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:01.720]   and AT&T and T-Mobile.
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:02.920]   That's, yeah.
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.240]   And...
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:06.160]   There've been a few, I think,
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:07.880]   good news there.
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:08.880]   Protect first.
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:12.080]   What's called the cable one, right?
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:14.440]   Time Warner and Comcast.
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:15.800]   But that was, that went through.
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:16.680]   Would they allowed charter?
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:18.000]   No, they allowed charter and contractor.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.960]   Charter and contractor. That's right.
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:23.440]   So, was that the FTC who was going for that
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:24.640]   or was that the FCC?
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.360]   It would have been FCC, right?
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:27.560]   Well, they both have to agree.
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:28.400]   They both have to agree, yeah.
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:29.960]   I can't remember who actually made the call.
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:32.920]   I think the FCC said it was any competitive.
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:34.080]   Yeah, they were not wrong.
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:34.920]   Yep.
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:36.760]   I'm trying to...
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.720]   Airline mergers have been a mess, right?
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:42.160]   Continental United American, US Air.
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:44.560]   And as a result...
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:47.000]   No, as a United customer, I've got to say,
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.160]   I was a Continental customer, no United customer.
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:52.720]   And I have benefits because I fly a lot
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:55.880]   and I'm better off at more routes, I've got to say.
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:59.080]   Ms. Warren voiced potential concern
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:00.440]   about three major tech companies.
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.200]   This is from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.560]   Google, Apple and Amazon because they control
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:08.840]   essential tech platforms that other smaller companies
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:10.680]   depend upon for survival.
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:14.240]   So, please, can the problem is, what have they done?
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:15.320]   Go ahead, to say something.
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:17.720]   Oh, I was just going to say, this is the same argument
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:20.880]   that actually has been made in the past about,
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:22.360]   like, the broadband people.
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:24.720]   And that's what net neutrality kind of was trying to solve
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:27.120]   because there's a lack of competition there.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.600]   It's really interesting to actually see it
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:31.200]   move up a layer in the stack from like,
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.760]   the access layer to the application layer.
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:34.760]   That doesn't make it right.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:38.880]   I'm just like, I see where the temptation to do this
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.880]   comes in and...
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:46.320]   I just don't see a way for her to justify it.
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.640]   I mean, God bless America.
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:50.920]   You can become very successful.
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:55.480]   And one could absolutely argue that Google has taken
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:57.840]   the money it's made and instead of, you know,
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:43:59.400]   plowing it into...
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.160]   Well, Ireland.
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:06.560]   But instead of plowing it into, you know, savings bonds
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:09.920]   has invested it into new markets, new sectors and new...
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:12.360]   And fostered innovation in areas that, frankly,
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:13.720]   wouldn't have been...
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:16.640]   Look at Google Fiber, would not have seen that kind of innovation.
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:17.560]   Exactly.
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:20.360]   On the other hand, I think that there is a lot to be said
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:25.360]   for the fact that if you're an entrepreneur
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:27.480]   and you want to start a business,
[01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:31.560]   you probably hope that Google doesn't sign
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.120]   that that's a good business for it to be in,
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:34.680]   because that's it for you, right?
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:36.040]   Unless they are...
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:37.040]   That's true. That's true.
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.440]   But on the other hand, there's all kinds of businesses
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:41.600]   that you can start now that you couldn't have started.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:42.680]   I agree. Google didn't exist.
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:44.640]   Well, in Amazon too, with Amazon Web Services.
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:45.600]   Exactly. You're right.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.200]   And eBay and name them.
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:49.200]   She said...
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:50.200]   I would like to see happen.
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:51.160]   You know, here's a merger.
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.280]   I just thought about this as we can.
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:53.840]   We're talking about the show.
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:54.920]   You know what I want to see happen?
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:56.880]   I want to see...
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:58.520]   I'm a customer of Fios.
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:01.400]   I've had problems with Verizon Mobile, don't you know?
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:03.920]   But I'm a very happy customer of Verizon Fios.
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:05.120]   It works wonderfully.
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:06.320]   But it's orphaned, right?
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:09.240]   I'm always nervous that they're going to decide
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:10.080]   to get out of this.
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:12.920]   They'd be years ago, they didn't expand anymore.
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:14.640]   They're just getting more customers
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:16.080]   in the markets where they are.
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:18.800]   Google Fiber should buy Fios.
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:19.800]   Ah!
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:21.280]   That would be great.
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:22.720]   Wouldn't that be wonderful?
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:25.760]   And you're bringing the Google quality and guarantees.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:30.160]   So instead, they're selling it, Verizon sold Fios in LA to Frontier.
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:31.440]   Well, they did.
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:32.440]   Well, okay.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.840]   No, they sold their DSL lines to Frontier.
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:35.840]   Oh, not the...
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:36.840]   I thought it was Fiber.
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:37.840]   No.
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:38.840]   Let's double check that.
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:39.840]   But...
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:41.360]   So Verizon needs its Fios lines
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.560]   because it's actually going to become the basis
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:46.960]   of its next generation for the small sales networks.
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:49.480]   It needs the dense fiber coverage in areas.
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:53.000]   So it's actually expanding Fios in Boston for this.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.240]   But they stopped building.
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:56.040]   I mean, they really stopped a lot of the build-ups.
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:57.440]   Yes, they really did stop a lot.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:58.440]   So what's going to happen?
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:45:59.440]   What we're going to see is...
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:00.440]   You're right.
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:01.880]   Verizon sold landlines to Frontier.
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:02.880]   Right.
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:06.360]   Wouldn't that be beautiful?
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:12.560]   So Google's going to stop building out Fiber to the home in a lot of places too, I think.
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:16.240]   Because what we're about to happen is gigabit wireless.
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:19.680]   So you're going to have Fiber to a node, basically.
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:22.960]   And then you're going to have the 5G spectrum.
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:27.120]   So the FCC classifies that in any of the gigahertz spectrum.
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:29.600]   So that's actually what we're about to see.
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:30.600]   Google just...
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:31.600]   Google just...
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:34.240]   Google just went into six new cities, those days.
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.240]   Right.
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:36.240]   No, it is.
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:39.040]   And it has to have Fiber in the ground to build out the back-
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:42.920]   So for instance, it's in Austin, but you're not getting it because you're not in the specific
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:43.920]   geographic region.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:48.200]   But now that the Fiber is there, you may well get high-speed wireless via Google.
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:49.200]   One day.
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:51.200]   Because they have the Fiber into the...
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:54.120]   Which goes back to our discussion about the kiosks on the street.
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:47:00.320]   That's kind of stupid and worthless, whereas if you could turn that into building, pursuing
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:03.480]   wireless, then it's really bad.
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:04.480]   Yeah.
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:06.520]   So the kiosks on the street are probably...
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:10.800]   They're an information gathering device as opposed to an information delivery device.
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:13.800]   So you want to have as many of those kind of edge things as possible.
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:17.520]   And if you can get a city to actually pay for it and share that data with you, you're
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:18.520]   like freaking...
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:21.800]   It's like a gold mine.
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:27.160]   If you think strategically about what's happening with that.
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:28.800]   So that's less about delivering...
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.160]   I mean, I know it's free Wi-Fi.
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:34.160]   That's your carrot, I think.
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:36.760]   Did that make sense?
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:37.760]   Yes.
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:38.760]   Okay.
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:39.760]   No.
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:40.760]   And I'm thrilled.
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:41.760]   Like long silence.
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:42.760]   No, you make me think Stacy.
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:46.440]   I'm really glad you're on our team now because you're really so well informed.
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:50.560]   And I think you're exactly right.
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:55.800]   But getting back to Elizabeth Warren, I feel like...
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:56.800]   It's going to be...
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:57.800]   This is interesting.
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:00.080]   This is that same thing that's going on in Europe, isn't it, Jeff?
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.080]   Yep.
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:02.080]   Yep.
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:03.080]   It's anti-big.
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:04.080]   Anti-technology.
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:12.720]   And you know, I just didn't interview this morning with KGO Radio in San Francisco.
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:18.480]   Because I tweeted the contemplation of a tech tax in San Francisco.
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:19.960]   Are they fanning about that?
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:20.960]   Yes.
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:25.960]   And I just said, you know, enough of fighting the hand that feeds you enough of looking
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:26.960]   to get towards the mouth.
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:27.960]   Fine.
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:28.960]   All those tech companies come to New York.
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:30.480]   You'd be welcome here.
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:31.480]   Yeah.
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:33.280]   So we tried to make a New York versus San Francisco thing.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:35.360]   But it's a real problem, I think, in San Francisco.
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:39.160]   And it's what we said before about the New York Times and the Guardian, which I love,
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:46.280]   in other papers, the contrarian anti-technology attitude that's spreading across liberal
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:47.280]   worlds.
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:48.640]   This is Elizabeth Warren.
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:49.640]   Right.
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:50.640]   This is Europe.
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:52.880]   Well, thank Bernie Sanders for that.
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:58.800]   This is a real problem for our industry, for the things that we care about, for the galloping,
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:01.320]   like a mechanical dog future coming our way.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:02.320]   Right.
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:04.640]   It's not a huge tax, by the way.
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:08.000]   And it was only proposed by three members of San Francisco's board of supervisors.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.520]   But it's a native of an attitude.
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:10.520]   It's an attitude.
[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:13.520]   One and a half percent payroll tax just on tech companies.
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:15.520]   And why single out the tech companies?
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:16.520]   Right.
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.640]   I could see if you want to do that citywide.
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:19.720]   That's a different matter.
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:23.160]   But to say, oh, tech companies, because you caused our homeless problem.
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.920]   Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:25.920]   Fine.
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:26.920]   Fine.
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:29.280]   And take away all the tech companies tomorrow, and where are you San Francisco?
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:33.320]   You're a cute little boutique with some good restaurants that won't be able to afford to
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:34.320]   live anymore.
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:36.320]   You have to be very careful.
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:40.040]   Look, we all want income equality or better.
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:41.760]   We don't want as much income inequality.
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:49.240]   We don't want companies to use their power to strip mine to the American economy.
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:57.000]   But at the same time, these companies are adding so much value and innovating so greatly.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.080]   It's a balancing act.
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:49:59.080]   It's a balancing act.
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:04.560]   But the scales should not swing too far against these tech companies.
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:05.560]   I don't think.
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:12.920]   We're going to be over and over again now, and throwing crap at the buses.
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:15.400]   San Francisco's probably the housing is scarcity.
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:21.040]   As long as San Francisco wants to be low-rise, scarce little cute city, the housing prices
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:22.040]   have got to go up.
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:23.040]   Welcome to capitalism.
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:24.960]   You want lower housing prices?
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:27.360]   Authorize more building of housing units.
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:29.040]   So this is a failure of the city.
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:30.040]   And they're--
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:31.920]   And it's just these three superplaces.
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:32.920]   It's just--
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:35.520]   I think it's ultra-liberal social.
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:38.080]   It's just a socialist's leaning.
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:46.200]   I think there is-- so people-- there is a failure to communicate well to people about
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:48.680]   and maybe even to allocate resources.
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:55.640]   I mean, if you want to fight income inequality or you want to have lower-cost housing for
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:59.160]   people, the city has to make some decisions.
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:01.280]   And they have to decide to build more.
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:06.520]   They can decide to institute all kinds of taxes.
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:08.920]   I mean, having a discussion about this isn't bad.
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:11.320]   We can mock these people for trying to do it.
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:14.960]   But I don't know.
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:16.760]   These are discussions that need to be had.
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:19.520]   Homelessness is a huge problem in every city in the nation.
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:21.280]   It's not unique to San Francisco.
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:22.280]   San Francisco's unique--
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:23.520]   San Francisco's very different.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:28.360]   It's unique problem is that it's seven miles by seven miles and it bounded by water and
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:31.520]   you cannot build anymore.
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:35.320]   So there's a scarcity of housing.
[01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:38.760]   You could go into the south of the city and build high-rises if you chose to.
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:39.760]   But it wouldn't be a city.
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:40.760]   It wouldn't be a city.
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:41.760]   The other issue.
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:44.280]   Well, that's what they said when the Trans-American Pyramid went up.
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:47.000]   It was ruining the city.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.880]   Diane Feinstein was accused of ruining the city by allowing more buildings to go in,
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:55.680]   which allowed more offices, which allowed more jobs.
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:58.360]   The other problem with San Francisco is that it is--
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:01.360]   Sorry, lights.
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:03.680]   I've got the-- I've got just the motion sensor for you.
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:05.760]   You need to get him hooked up, Stacey.
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:06.760]   Yeah, Stacey.
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:10.000]   Stacey does an IoT podcast, has an IoT website.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.320]   She's an expert on the motion sensors.
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:14.160]   Where was I?
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:15.320]   San Francisco problems.
[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:16.800]   I'm not saying that.
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:18.760]   Damn.
[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:20.520]   Diane Feinstein, Trans-American Pyramid.
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:24.920]   Oh, the other problem is, of course, it is a magnet for people looking for a dream.
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:25.920]   Yeah.
[01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:29.240]   Not just cukes, but I'll be nicer than that.
[01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:31.480]   People who think that it's going to solve their problems with wonderful places.
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:33.080]   On Earth Earth Earth, San Francisco is a wonderful place.
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:34.080]   I loved it.
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:35.080]   Oh, I love it.
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:36.080]   I was there.
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:37.080]   I still love it.
[01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:38.080]   It's Shangri-La.
[01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:39.080]   Yeah, but that's the problem.
[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:40.080]   It's Shangri-La.
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:41.080]   And people are drawn to that.
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:44.360]   And so San Francisco's almost problem, I think, is-- it says he's right.
[01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:46.760]   It's materially different from other cities.
[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:47.760]   Really?
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:49.760]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:54.760]   New York, even with complaints of late notes, nothing like this in New York.
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:55.760]   Where are the city I go to?
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:00.840]   No, San Francisco is absolutely-- I don't want to say worse than the judge.
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:01.840]   Yeah, well, I'll say worse.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:02.840]   Yeah, it's worse.
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:03.840]   It has--
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:04.840]   Absolutely.
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:11.520]   Yes, that in Seattle has probably most obvious and maybe most aggressive homeless population.
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:16.240]   Well, the only reason it would be germane to the conversation in San Francisco is if those
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:22.560]   people were made homeless by raising housing costs, surprising housing costs.
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:23.560]   Which is not the case.
[01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:24.840]   I don't know if it's the case or not.
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:27.520]   I mean, but that's the only way it would be germane to this conversation.
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:28.520]   Not the homeless.
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:29.520]   Right, the homeless.
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:34.600]   See, there are other people who can't afford what you do have also, I think, is a real
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:35.600]   problem.
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:40.160]   It's how can you be a teacher on the peninsula teaching these incredibly rich people's children?
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:41.960]   Well, that's a problem statewide.
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:42.960]   That's a problem statewide.
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:43.960]   Yeah.
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:45.400]   I can say a problem in Austin, too.
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:46.400]   Yeah.
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:49.680]   I wouldn't be surprised if it's a problem in the entire country because we're so under
[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:51.800]   value or education.
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:56.760]   New York has built, we're from the way real estate is not expensive, but it's not as high
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:57.840]   quality.
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:02.000]   They built a housing complex for teachers.
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:05.080]   That's the way to think.
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:06.080]   But we need more.
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:11.720]   You do this the same argument I had about taxes in the UK with Google and Facebook and
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:18.440]   I'm sorry, Google and Amazon is this is government's job.
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:22.040]   You shouldn't blame or expect the tech companies to solve these problems.
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:24.840]   They're doing what they should do as companies, which is make products and make money.
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:25.840]   Right.
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:27.760]   Well, the government is looking for a solution.
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:30.960]   I mean, that's what this payroll tax is a suggestion for.
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:33.800]   That's government going, Oh crap, we have all these people.
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:37.800]   Yeah, it's government, but it's government demonizing that one sector.
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:40.320]   There's plenty of evil bankers in San Francisco believe.
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:41.320]   Well, you can't.
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:42.320]   Yeah.
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:45.720]   What you don't want to get as a situation is well, whatever the most successful sector
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:49.400]   of the economy is right now, let's blame them for our woes.
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:50.400]   That's the problem.
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:51.400]   Right.
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:53.240]   That that isn't that isn't going to fly.
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:58.880]   By the way, Verizon did sell its fiber businesses in Texas and California to frontier.
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:54:59.880]   We did.
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:04.040]   They sold landlines all over the country, but they sold the fiber business.
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:05.040]   Oh, please, please.
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:06.040]   Oh, let's forgive them.
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:10.360]   And frontier, by the way, is not from what I hear from all of my callers in Los Angeles
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:13.080]   a very good steward of the business.
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:15.680]   So, so, so, so, Googlers were watching.
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:19.240]   I'm telling you, I buy us, please Google.
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:22.520]   I would be a great, what a great solution that would be.
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:25.440]   Would they be, would there be antitrust issues there?
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:27.600]   Well, that's back to the discussion about a little bit of war.
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:31.200]   And so, so that would be something that we as customers would die for.
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:32.200]   Die for it.
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:33.840]   But you bet your bippy right now.
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:39.640]   But you know why we want that because there is the internet service in this country is
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:43.960]   so is uncompetitive that we want to see more competition.
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:47.360]   So, you'd have to, again, you can't, there's no formula.
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:48.560]   You can't do it mechanically.
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:53.120]   You have to look at the situation and say, this would be good for competition, even though
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:54.880]   Google is a big incumbent.
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:57.080]   It's not a big, it isn't a big ISP.
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:02.880]   It would be a big company coming along to become a big ISP to make competition for Comcast
[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:04.880]   and Verizon and AT&T.
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:05.880]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:09.640]   It's okay is because Fios is only at overbuilt situations.
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:10.640]   Right.
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:16.080]   And in no cases, Fios, the monopoly player, Fios came in to create the competition, Google
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:17.800]   constrains in that competition.
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:21.440]   So it wouldn't heart hangs, no, not heart hangs.
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:23.480]   What is the antitrust?
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:26.800]   Ah, there's an antitrust ratio.
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:28.640]   German, oh, there's a ratio.
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:33.640]   That's the, there's a ratio that the F2, anyway, yes, Verizon buying Fios would not,
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:39.040]   sorry, Google buying Fios would not mess with that ratio.
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:42.920]   It's popular in telecom mergers to look at competition.
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:44.880]   I wish I could remember what it's called.
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:46.840]   But I can't.
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:49.320]   Anyway, it would totally pass.
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:53.280]   I think the biggest question actually would become from vertical integration, kind of like
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:55.640]   when Comcast bought NBC Universal.
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:57.520]   Yeah, that didn't bother anybody.
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:02.080]   Yeah, so they put some conditions on that and they went, they went forward.
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:04.880]   So I think that's probably how that deal would be viewed.
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:08.480]   What do you think of Comcast putting Netflix on its set top box?
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:10.000]   Is that a big deal?
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.640]   Cara Swisher says it's a very big deal.
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:14.840]   It is because Comcast has been.
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:16.640]   I hate each other.
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:17.640]   For years.
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:18.640]   Or years.
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:20.160]   Just like, how can we screw over Netflix?
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:26.000]   I once wrote a story about seven ways, you know, Comcast is trying to like, I don't know,
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:32.000]   it was Comcast is doing something devilish or evil to over the top service providers.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:37.440]   So it is a big deal that is putting it on its cable box because that's, that's its flagship
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:38.440]   platform.
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:41.120]   I should point out from the consumer point of view, there's 800 ways to get Netflix
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:42.800]   already in your house.
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:46.240]   This doesn't add in any way consumer choice.
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:52.400]   What it does add though is if I'm buying something that's on my cable box, I expect it
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:54.480]   to work and to be awesome.
[01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:55.480]   If I buy something.
[01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:58.640]   You obviously do not have a Comcast X1 cable box.
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:02.240]   The worst.
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:04.080]   That's their state of the art technology.
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:08.160]   And it is the only thing worse than it was the previous Comcast cable box.
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:09.960]   I thought the X1 was better.
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:10.960]   It's supposed to be.
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:14.280]   You must be seeing those ads, those great ads from Comcast is a piece of crap.
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:15.480]   It's the worst technology.
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:20.720]   It's very, it's exactly what you would expect from a company that doesn't have to innovate
[01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:26.440]   because they dominate and, you know, basically have a monopoly in markets.
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:29.760]   So they don't have to make something better because what is your choice?
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:30.760]   Zero.
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:34.760]   Until the FCC does force them to a name lost by our own cable box.
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:35.760]   I hope they do.
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:36.760]   I hope that has been better.
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:38.560]   X1 had a lot of promise.
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:40.600]   This was a great idea.
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:45.280]   But I own them and I've, and I had a whole X1 setup and slowly of trading them out for
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:50.960]   Tivos, even though it's hideously expensive transition to make.
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:53.440]   It's just unusable.
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:59.120]   But would that FCC move change the DOCSIS standard that is holding things back?
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:02.880]   Or do you start to hold the DOCSIS standard and hold things back?
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:05.480]   DOCSIS just, I mean, I don't know.
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:08.560]   That's a physical layer thing.
[01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:09.840]   DOCSIS is.
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:10.840]   That's a good thing.
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:11.840]   That's fine.
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:12.840]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:13.840]   That means every way.
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:14.840]   It is.
[01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:15.840]   Oh.
[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:16.840]   Because that's like Wi-Fi.
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:17.840]   It's kind of like the equivalent of Wi-Fi.
[01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:21.920]   It means you can buy a cable modem that lives to the standard and doesn't have to be from
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:23.400]   Comcast and plug it in.
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:26.000]   And that is a very good thing.
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:32.640]   What the FCC wants to do is make cable boxes more like the internet, make you able to access
[01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:35.160]   anything that's on the internet via a cable box.
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:40.080]   And right now cable companies run their own software and control everything that goes
[01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:41.080]   through a cable box.
[01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:42.080]   Right.
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:43.080]   Well, that is why this is a big deal, right?
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:47.320]   Because now you've got an over the top service on your cable box.
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:52.640]   This is Comcast basically saying, wait, wait, wait, before you regulate us.
[01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:55.040]   Let me show you how we're being nice here.
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:56.600]   By the way, that's what this is.
[01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:58.440]   It's the Herfindel Hirschman index.
[01:59:58.440 --> 01:59:59.880]   Oh, there you go.
[01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:00.880]   See, no wonder I didn't.
[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:01.880]   How could you forget that?
[02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:02.880]   Thank you, Gardner.
[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:03.880]   Thank you, Gardner.
[02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:05.640]   Gardner in the chat room says, I'm the answer.
[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:08.320]   As a matter of fact, it's the Herfindel Hirschman index.
[02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:09.880]   There ain't foreign index.
[02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:12.000]   I like him because Gardner's great.
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:16.280]   Actually, he comes up with these are the things that, you know, I've spent years reading
[02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:18.560]   about and then forgetting their names.
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:22.320]   Well, there's only so much room in that head for information.
[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:23.320]   That's true.
[02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:24.320]   And then he had.
[02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:25.320]   Google.
[02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:26.320]   Google is my ultimate.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:27.320]   Exactly.
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:29.520]   We don't need to know this stuff anymore.
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:35.760]   So anyway, so this is actually the in Comcast actually also with their data cap.
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:40.520]   Remember a couple months ago, they boosted it to a, I was going to say a terahertz.
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:42.360]   I think it was one and I have terabytes.
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:43.760]   It was a huge amount, right?
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:44.760]   I think it's one terabyte.
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:45.760]   One terabyte.
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:46.760]   All right.
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:50.840]   And that was because they saw the FCC putting conditions on time order cable and charter.
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:54.520]   So Comcast isn't stupid.
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:56.280]   They're big, but they're not stupid.
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:58.560]   Yeah, they do what they have to.
[02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:01.920]   I'm not saying they're like going out.
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:03.080]   They're not altruists.
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:04.080]   Yeah.
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:06.720]   No, they're not altruists.
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:11.920]   And I wonder what the economic relationship, what the business deal is, right?
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:15.120]   Does Comcast get a buck from Netflix now from forever?
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:20.680]   So does Comcast favor Netflix?
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:21.680]   Is this a net neutrality?
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:26.560]   Well, I think the whole point of this is so Comcast get pointed that and say, what do
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:27.560]   you mean?
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:28.560]   We're net neutral.
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:29.560]   Look at that.
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:31.320]   We actually put Netflix on our box.
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:34.720]   So don't do that thing FCC with the net neutrality and the cable box.
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:35.720]   Don't do that.
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:36.720]   Oh, that's true.
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:38.720]   This could be a way to get around the data caps.
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:40.880]   So if Netflix is all over the class.
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:41.880]   That's what I'm saying.
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:46.160]   And because they're their cable bought stuff shouldn't be no.
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:48.440]   X one does not count against your caps.
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:50.280]   So then this is a way to grandfather.
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:52.920]   So this zero basis that's zero rating.
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:53.920]   Yeah, there's zero rating.
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:55.600]   I mean, that's great.
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:58.160]   So Netflix sold us out.
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:01.600]   What's the Hirschfeld Heinfengel ratio on that?
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:03.360]   I ask you.
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:05.880]   Yeah, they'll must be right.
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:06.880]   That must be the deal.
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:07.880]   Yeah, that's what it is.
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:10.200]   Don't you think Netflix is paying for that a little bit?
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:11.960]   A little bucks a month?
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:13.800]   Or maybe they just sold their soul.
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:17.560]   I'm serious because they were the biggest advocate for net neutrality.
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:18.560]   Right.
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:19.560]   Yep.
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:21.560]   They've been moving in that direction, I think, for a while.
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:24.240]   As Susan Crawford said anything about this.
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:25.840]   I was about to say, let's call Susan.
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:28.240]   We'll have to go check.
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:30.520]   She usually takes a day or so to write.
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:33.160]   Yeah, because she actually thinks, geez, we're no fun.
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:35.800]   Oh, I was going to say she has a real job.
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:36.800]   File, Susan.
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:37.800]   File.
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:38.800]   Well, I'll check.
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:41.640]   I'll ask Comcast.
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:42.640]   Next week I can tell you.
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:43.640]   If it counts against caps.
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:46.480]   Yeah, because we are making an assumption here.
[02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:49.840]   The journalist in me is like, wait, we can't actually say this here.
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:50.840]   All right.
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:53.320]   So I'll shoot anything.
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:54.480]   Oh, Stacy.
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:55.480]   I know.
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:56.480]   You're all fun out of it.
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:57.480]   I do.
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:00.720]   I suck the joy out of our tirades.
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:04.320]   You know us as a second, the joy out of Snapchat, grownups.
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:05.320]   Yep.
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:11.560]   Teams are not happy as their mom and dad are starting to use Snapchat.
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:18.880]   According to the Wall Street Journal, 14% of US smartphone users, 35 and up, you snap
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:22.920]   chat, 14% that was up from 2% three years ago.
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:26.360]   70% of all smartphone users are on Snapchat.
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:28.520]   Everybody uses Snapchat.
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:31.320]   I bet you use Snapchat, don't you, Stacy?
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:33.720]   So I have it, but I don't actually use it because--
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:34.720]   Yeah.
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:36.720]   I'm not giving your child a place to--
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:38.280]   My child does not have Snapchat.
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:39.920]   No, we're all too old.
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:40.920]   I'm all--
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:42.480]   Oh, how can you be too old for Snapchat?
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:43.800]   Over to old.
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:47.520]   I've got so much stuff that is going on in my life.
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:49.040]   I'm like, do I really need Snapchat?
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:53.960]   I post less on social media than ever before, really.
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:54.960]   I don't know why.
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:56.320]   When you quit Twitter?
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:57.720]   I practically quit Twitter.
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:03:58.720]   I mean--
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:03:59.920]   Oh, I love Twitter.
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:01.200]   Do you post or you just read?
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:02.200]   Oh my god.
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:03.200]   I post.
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:04.200]   I read.
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:07.640]   I put pictures of weird things that my dog does.
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:10.800]   I had to-- I put pictures of the hedgehog on Twitter.
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:13.640]   It's super fun.
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:14.520]   I'm following you.
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:17.280]   But see, this is a problem with it.
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:20.440]   Why do you have the Sydney Opera House on your Twitter?
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:21.840]   Oh, I thought it was a nice picture.
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:22.600]   Oh.
[02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:23.680]   I don't post a lot of things.
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:26.960]   But make one think that you are Australian.
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:27.720]   I'm Texan.
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:30.000]   It's like the same thing.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.200]   Our accent isn't as cool, but that's basically--
[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:34.080]   with the same mentality.
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:36.120]   Yeah, that might be true, actually.
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:38.080]   Yeah.
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:39.760]   And I love Australia.
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:41.720]   We went down to--
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:42.360]   Oh, I do too.
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:43.520]   I love Australia.
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:45.920]   And the Sydney Opera House is gorgeous.
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:47.720]   Just gorgeous.
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:51.000]   Have you been over the bridge, the Sydney Harbor Bridge?
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:51.760]   Yes.
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:53.000]   Yes, I thought-- oh, yeah.
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.000]   Me.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.400]   And then Harbor.
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:56.560]   But you can actually--
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:58.960]   Jeff, I think you'd really enjoy this.
[02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:00.400]   Oh, no, clear on yourself.
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:02.320]   No, no, what did you say?
[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:04.920]   They put you in jumpsuits and give you--
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:07.720]   and they attach you to a wire.
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:11.640]   And you can go-- you can climb the cable all the way up and over.
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:14.360]   Oh, Leo.
[02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:15.080]   We would have done it.
[02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:18.360]   We were there with Michael, who was at the time
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:21.360]   one week short of his 13th birthday.
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:23.560]   And you have to be 13 to go on it.
[02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:24.060]   Wow.
[02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:24.960]   So we couldn't do it.
[02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:26.480]   But next time I'm in Sydney, I'm deaf.
[02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:27.000]   Save for yourselves.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000]   No, Leo, no, don't do it.
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:30.520]   Definitely doing that.
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:31.020]   Where?
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:33.800]   Literally, my palms are flowing with sweat right now,
[02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:35.680]   with a mere mention of it.
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:37.120]   Are you afraid of heights?
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:37.620]   Jeff?
[02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:38.120]   Bridges.
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:39.520]   Bridges, just bridges.
[02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:45.600]   Somebody added some smart-ass Twig fan added that to my Wikipedia
[02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:45.960]   profile.
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:47.460]   [SIGHS]
[02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:49.660]   Oh.
[02:05:49.660 --> 02:05:52.220]   They should add that you come to it honestly,
[02:05:52.220 --> 02:05:55.600]   because I don't know if you had it before 9/11.
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:56.240]   But it just--
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:58.520]   It got a lot worse after 9/11.
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:01.180]   He was-- Stacy, you probably don't know this.
[02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:05.300]   But he was coming into the PATH station when 9/11.
[02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:06.900]   Oh, OK.
[02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:07.900]   Yeah, that was--
[02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:11.740]   And was covered with--
[02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:12.500]   asbestos.
[02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:14.020]   --spestus and all sorts of crap.
[02:06:14.020 --> 02:06:22.220]   Any other stories you guys see that you really want to--
[02:06:22.220 --> 02:06:23.460]   Oh, open cellular.
[02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:25.820]   But wait, do you have another ad, or was that all your ads?
[02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:26.300]   I have another ad.
[02:06:26.300 --> 02:06:27.220]   But do the open cellular.
[02:06:27.220 --> 02:06:30.420]   And I'll do another ad, one more ad, before our picks of the week
[02:06:30.420 --> 02:06:31.480]   is what I'll do.
[02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:34.540]   So Facebook, since we've been talking a little bit about wireless
[02:06:34.540 --> 02:06:38.560]   and access to the internet, they put out today, actually,
[02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:42.220]   this thing called Open Cellular, which is a--
[02:06:42.220 --> 02:06:44.500]   they have this telecom infrastructure project, which
[02:06:44.500 --> 02:06:49.540]   is basically designed to make telco infrastructure cheaper.
[02:06:49.540 --> 02:06:51.620]   It's kind of the way to think about it,
[02:06:51.620 --> 02:06:53.420]   easier to implement everywhere.
[02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:57.220]   So with Open Cellular, they're doing--
[02:06:57.220 --> 02:06:59.060]   it's like an access point.
[02:06:59.060 --> 02:07:00.780]   It's what it kind of looks like.
[02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:02.580]   It's got processing.
[02:07:02.580 --> 02:07:05.780]   It's got ways to make backhaul easier.
[02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:08.620]   So instead of just using fiber, you can use other things.
[02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:11.580]   This is what Facebook did with their network operations
[02:07:11.580 --> 02:07:13.860]   centers and their servers.
[02:07:13.860 --> 02:07:16.900]   They just published this back and said, here's how you can do that.
[02:07:16.900 --> 02:07:19.540]   Yeah, and so this isn't open source yet, but it's going to.
[02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:23.700]   And the cool thing about Open Cellular or Open Cellular
[02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:25.500]   or their telecom infrastructure project
[02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:30.700]   is it's got Deutsche Telecom, EE, and some other telecoms
[02:07:30.700 --> 02:07:33.340]   actually really interested in implementing this.
[02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:35.780]   And I'm not sure if they're going to do it in European
[02:07:35.780 --> 02:07:37.100]   and high-cost markets or if they're
[02:07:37.100 --> 02:07:39.220]   going to do it more in Africa and other places.
[02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:44.580]   But anything that makes your telecom infrastructure
[02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:47.620]   operate efficiently and at scale like your computing
[02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:50.860]   infrastructure is awesome because it could potentially
[02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:52.820]   lower the cost of data.
[02:07:52.820 --> 02:07:55.420]   And that would be great for everyone.
[02:07:55.420 --> 02:07:57.940]   This would only-- I mean, the problem is I have with this
[02:07:57.940 --> 02:08:01.100]   is that if you're AT&T Verizon Sprint or T-Mobile,
[02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:02.820]   you probably have--
[02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:03.820]   Yeah.
[02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:07.140]   You already have your designs that you use.
[02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:11.740]   So AT&T is actually moving to a--
[02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:13.140]   on their back-end infrastructure,
[02:08:13.140 --> 02:08:14.580]   they're actually moving to more of what
[02:08:14.580 --> 02:08:17.820]   looks like a compute core as opposed to like a traditional--
[02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:19.740]   Yeah, I went into one of their--
[02:08:19.740 --> 02:08:22.820]   they have a test center here in Texas
[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:24.020]   for their wireless networks.
[02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:27.380]   And it's really like if you're a super nerd like me,
[02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:30.220]   it's awesome because you can see their 2G network takes up
[02:08:30.220 --> 02:08:32.460]   like two aisles of data center space.
[02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:35.380]   Their 3G network is like a full--
[02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:36.980]   or actually it's also like two aisles.
[02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:39.500]   And then their 4G is one aisle.
[02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:42.780]   And then their 5G, which is their next generation,
[02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:45.020]   it's called Domain 2.0.
[02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:49.740]   It's like one chassis with like a rack of servers.
[02:08:49.740 --> 02:08:50.380]   And that's it.
[02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:54.220]   And that's like-- it's just crazy to me.
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:55.580]   Software radios, baby.
[02:08:55.580 --> 02:08:57.100]   That's what's happening, man.
[02:08:57.100 --> 02:08:58.940]   It's happening in every business.
[02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:00.180]   You don't really need the hardware.
[02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:01.540]   You do it all in software.
[02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:03.420]   Yeah, so it's a software-defined network.
[02:09:03.420 --> 02:09:05.700]   And then this particular open cellular thing
[02:09:05.700 --> 02:09:07.180]   does have a software-defined radio
[02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:10.060]   so it can cover more bands or you could just do it
[02:09:10.060 --> 02:09:11.860]   in SOC that is dedicated for--
[02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:12.360]   Sure.
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:15.360]   It would just have basically the same software just built
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:16.100]   into the firmware.
[02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:16.940]   Wow.
[02:09:16.940 --> 02:09:17.440]   That's cool.
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:19.140]   So yeah, this is really awesome.
[02:09:19.140 --> 02:09:21.700]   I'm super optimistic.
[02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:23.360]   I'm trying to think who would use this.
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:24.700]   I mean, would there be--
[02:09:24.700 --> 02:09:25.380]   So you could--
[02:09:25.380 --> 02:09:28.620]   Amateur cell networks springing up.
[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:30.220]   It does power over ethernet.
[02:09:30.220 --> 02:09:31.420]   And look, I'm getting so excited.
[02:09:31.420 --> 02:09:32.580]   This is like the key for a time.
[02:09:32.580 --> 02:09:35.020]   You're such a nerd.
[02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:37.440]   But with power over ethernet, and you still
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:38.960]   have to get a license for the FCC
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:40.860]   if you're going to start broadcasting like crazy.
[02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:45.920]   But Facebook could build their own networks if they wanted to.
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:48.120]   They just have to--
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:49.360]   that's what's compelling.
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:53.000]   So if you Google-wise the home and Facebook has your phone.
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:57.840]   Well, Google has efforts to bring more network connectivity.
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:00.240]   Is Project Loon Google or is that Facebook?
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:02.560]   Loon is Google and Facebook has the drones.
[02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:06.640]   But the problem is, in the US, this is a highly regulated area.
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:09.280]   You can't just put up your own cell towers.
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:10.800]   Right.
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:13.220]   I mean, I guess in the developing world,
[02:10:13.220 --> 02:10:14.140]   this would be amazing.
[02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:16.420]   And it's probably the intent for this, right?
[02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:18.020]   That's my guess with the carrier partners
[02:10:18.020 --> 02:10:18.900]   where they would put this.
[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:20.700]   But you never know.
[02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:22.860]   And anything that makes this stuff cheaper,
[02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:25.300]   I mean, I could see Sprint or Timo, which
[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:29.100]   has nothing to lose, like trying to adopt a lower cost radio
[02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:30.300]   access network.
[02:10:30.300 --> 02:10:34.580]   And all four of the big carriers have spectrum
[02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:38.740]   that they've purchased, they leased, and they have access to.
[02:10:38.740 --> 02:10:39.240]   Yes.
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:41.700]   There's lots of people who have spectrum.
[02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:43.780]   Is there kind of spectrums available somebody
[02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:44.780]   could use?
[02:10:44.780 --> 02:10:45.780]   And there's no--
[02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:46.280]   Oh, right.
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:47.280]   You wouldn't do it on 2.4.
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:51.500]   You wouldn't do it on an unregulated spectrum.
[02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:55.620]   You couldn't define and control quality that way as well.
[02:10:55.620 --> 02:10:57.460]   But there's spectrum.
[02:10:57.460 --> 02:10:59.700]   So the economics and the math around spectrum
[02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:01.060]   is super complicated.
[02:11:01.060 --> 02:11:08.220]   But what's happening is we're able now with better silicon
[02:11:08.220 --> 02:11:14.000]   and software to use spectrum that previously
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.080]   was unavailable to us.
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:17.680]   So that's what a lot of the gigahertz spectrum that people
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:18.720]   are excited about is about.
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:23.520]   So I don't know what these radios would work on.
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:28.160]   But there's a lot of companies that have spectrum.
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:31.720]   And they even-- like Dish has both spectrum,
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:34.600]   and they have rooftop access to places where something like this
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:37.320]   could be really interesting.
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:40.120]   And that's a play that a lot of people don't think about
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:46.280]   is that a company like Dish could basically put up little mini
[02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:48.640]   cell towers on people's roofs.
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:50.240]   Although AT&T owns Dish right now.
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:53.420]   So AT&T's probably thought about that.
[02:11:53.420 --> 02:11:56.400]   There is a big spectrum auction just wrapping up right now,
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:57.000]   by the way.
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:02.840]   They expect it will be around $33 billion.
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:05.880]   This is a reverse auction.
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:07.480]   That thing is so crazy.
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:10.440]   600 megahhertz spectrum.
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:12.160]   I cannot wait to see what happens there.
[02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:14.160]   Yeah.
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:17.520]   So during this process, the FCC and television broadcasters
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:18.760]   go through several rounds of bidding
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:21.440]   until the agency is able to purchase
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:25.360]   the most amount of spectrum at the lowest price.
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:26.920]   It's too complicated for mine.
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:30.280]   Oh, oh, AT&T owns Direct TV, not Dish.
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:30.880]   Thank you.
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:31.800]   That's right.
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:32.680]   Thank you, nice people.
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:33.800]   That's right.
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:34.920]   Yeah, the reverse spectrum--
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:36.840]   Oh, sorry.
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:40.120]   Oh, that auction format is so nuts.
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:41.360]   I don't get it.
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:46.040]   So the FCC is trying to buy spectrum
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:49.800]   from the television broadcasters, which they will try to run
[02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:50.800]   and sell.
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:51.120]   Right.
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:55.400]   The FCC had to convince the broadcast owners
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:58.160]   that it was worth giving up their spectrum.
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:12:59.560]   Because at first, the broadcast owners
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:00.320]   were like, no.
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:00.840]   No, it was--
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:03.320]   Well, they made them give up 700 megahhertz, right?
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:05.280]   They made them all go digital.
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:06.280]   Yes, that was that.
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:07.960]   But the digital analog transition,
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:11.120]   what happened with this one is a little bit different.
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:13.880]   We won't get into rebanding and all that crazy stuff.
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:16.560]   But basically, what the FCC has done
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:21.120]   is the broadcaster said, I will give up my spectrum for $10
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:22.240]   if you pay me $10.
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:24.680]   And so the FCC was like, OK, we'll give you $10
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:29.120]   because we think the carriers come around and give us $12.
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:30.120]   20.
[02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:31.200]   Yeah.
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:33.040]   The question-- so the FCC has done
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:35.720]   the half where the broadcaster said, we want this much,
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:36.960]   the FCC negotiate with them.
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:38.320]   And they came to--
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:40.440]   I thought it was like an '86.
[02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:41.520]   It was a crazy number.
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:44.480]   But I don't know it off the top of my head.
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:46.000]   And now they're going to go--
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.560]   now that they've got that chunk in--
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:51.320]   They're going to commitment from broadcasters.
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:54.720]   Now they're going to telecom and saying, what will you give us?
[02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:58.480]   And that's where they're going for the $30 to $33 billion target.
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:02.160]   And if this works, if they bid that, then we're all good.
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:04.040]   But the telcos may be like, eh, you know what?
[02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:05.200]   We don't think it's worth that much.
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:07.760]   Chimobel has committed $8 billion.
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:11.040]   AT&T has committed $10 billion.
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:13.240]   Don't know what Verizon is bidding,
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:15.080]   but they're expected to participate.
[02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:16.680]   Sprint is sitting out the auction.
[02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:22.480]   But Comcast and Dish Network will also be bidding for this.
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:24.040]   Oh, see, there's that Dish thing again.
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:25.120]   Yeah.
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:26.240]   Owning the rooftops.
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:27.240]   Yeah.
[02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:28.840]   Good for gigabit wireless.
[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:32.000]   So the first half may be over--
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:33.240]   any day now.
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:37.520]   And the next half will begin at the end of the month.
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:38.400]   So here's the thing about this.
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:44.320]   In New Jersey, where I live, the government, Chris Christie,
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:49.280]   owns the public broadcasting licenses.
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:52.080]   And when he decided to get out of that business, basically,
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:55.720]   he handed over the licenses to W&AT in New York,
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:58.920]   and WHOI in Philadelphia.
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:01.880]   And-- but he should loan them.
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:03.320]   They're licensed.
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:07.280]   And so estimates say that the state could get anywhere
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:11.120]   from $1 to $2 billion out of this.
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:13.200]   Now, the fear is that our dear governor
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:16.560]   will use this to plug the many holes he has in his Swiss cheese
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:23.320]   budget, where some of us believe that this was an asset that
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:27.280]   was meant to inform the state, and that there are those of us
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:29.440]   who believe that we should be able to get at least part
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:32.640]   of that money as a trust fund for news and information
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:34.200]   in the state.
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:37.040]   And there's some efforts going on to push that in the legislature.
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:43.360]   Have you Stacey seen the new Alexa skills?
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:44.400]   I guess you don't--
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:46.640]   I don't have to enable a skill anymore.
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:47.280]   I can tell--
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:48.200]   You can just tell it to you.
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:51.840]   Tell Amazon, echo, I want the FART skill,
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:52.680]   and it'll do it.
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:53.680]   Right.
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:54.720]   What was the FART--
[02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:56.200]   I've actually played with that.
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:59.040]   Ask for-- you used to have to say ask for a FART.
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:00.760]   Ask for a FART, OK.
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:04.320]   Just in case you keep your track.
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:08.280]   So yes, Alexa, play my seven-minute workout.
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:10.680]   I love that one.
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:11.760]   I only used it once.
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:12.840]   It was very exciting.
[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:13.280]   Once enough.
[02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:14.800]   No, it's seven minutes in your whole life.
[02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:16.160]   That's all you need to do.
[02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:16.680]   That's it.
[02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:17.280]   I've got it.
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:17.800]   No more working.
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:20.400]   Miracle of fitness.
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:22.640]   I have seen that.
[02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:25.000]   And the new dash buttons and the new organization
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.520]   was really nice too.
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:28.240]   So tell me about that.
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:31.080]   So they reorganized the way Alexa skills--
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:31.600]   and I should stop there.
[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:33.000]   Which was the worst.
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:33.480]   Echo.
[02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:34.280]   Yes.
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:37.080]   The echo-- well, it's hard to say it with the app.
[02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:40.840]   Anyway, they reorganized the way the skills are set up.
[02:16:40.840 --> 02:16:43.560]   So now you can-- they're organized by smart home or--
[02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:44.320]   It was terrible.
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:48.480]   You have to just go through page after page of random skills.
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:51.320]   And now, I mean, there's more than 1,400 of them.
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:53.760]   So at a certain point in time, you're like, screw it.
[02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:54.720]   I'm done.
[02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:55.220]   Yeah.
[02:16:55.220 --> 02:16:57.520]   I never got the past page 5.
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:16:58.520]   Yeah.
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:01.040]   I found one I liked and I stuck with it.
[02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:01.540]   Yeah.
[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:03.200]   I didn't even know they had a Jeopardy skill.
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:03.400]   But now--
[02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:05.920]   Oh, I do that one all the time.
[02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:07.200]   I love that one.
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:10.160]   So this is more like an app store now, which is nice.
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:12.400]   They have highlighted skills.
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:14.000]   They have trending.
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.240]   And then they have categories get entertained.
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:17.280]   That's the Jeopardy one.
[02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:19.320]   Make your home smarter.
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:20.680]   Business and finance connected car.
[02:17:20.680 --> 02:17:21.200]   This is good.
[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:22.600]   This is a lot--
[02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:24.440]   they needed to do this badly.
[02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:24.940]   Yes.
[02:17:24.940 --> 02:17:26.040]   But they were probably just waiting.
[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:29.680]   I mean, they have 1,500 plus skills now.
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:30.840]   A Yomama joke.
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:34.120]   So all you have to do is you say, echo, open Yomama joke,
[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:36.440]   and now it'll do it.
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:39.360]   Presidents picker.
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:41.840]   Ask Doc Rogers why I'm happy today.
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:45.840]   OK.
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:46.120]   I don't know.
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:48.840]   That's under the novelty category.
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:53.480]   Oh, I should say-- oh, let's see if it's Fred Wilson.
[02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:56.360]   They actually did a thing.
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:58.360]   He did a blog post because one of his partners
[02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:00.960]   did the implemented an echo hack that
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:02.800]   lets you play your Sonos over your--
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:04.000]   Oh, control your Sonos.
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.520]   Oh, I want that to work.
[02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:09.440]   I want that to work so badly.
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:12.520]   Although I have my dot hooked up to a very nice speaker
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:13.160]   system now.
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:19.440]   So in the bedroom, at least, I have good echo audio.
[02:18:19.440 --> 02:18:22.800]   Also, you can buy anything on Prime now.
[02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:25.840]   It doesn't have to have been something you bought previously.
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:26.800]   Oh, yeah.
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:29.720]   So I accidentally bought some emergency underpants
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:31.480]   the other day.
[02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:33.120]   I was too accidentally to do that.
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:34.960]   What are emergency underpants?
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:36.440]   Didn't know.
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:36.920]   Didn't know.
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:38.240]   But apparently, I got them.
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:39.960]   And they come in-- I meant to bring them in.
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:42.640]   They come in a roll in case you need them.
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:45.360]   And so what I thought-- this would be funny.
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:49.200]   On the radio show, I said echo by some underpants.
[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:53.040]   And then nice lady says, I found emergency underpants.
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:54.240]   Would you like to order it?
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:55.200]   And I had the demo.
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:55.840]   And I was demoing it.
[02:18:55.840 --> 02:18:57.960]   So I said, I gave it my magic number.
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:18:59.120]   And then they arrived.
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:00.960]   They arrived the next day.
[02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:02.880]   I guess they really thought I was an emergency.
[02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:04.480]   Least against the mail and just shout out.
[02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:05.320]   Really?
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:07.240]   She didn't wonder.
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:09.240]   I guess they just realized when you need an--
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:10.280]   when you need an emergency--
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:12.040]   Did they know what a size size?
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:13.920]   I think it's one size fits all.
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:15.640]   Oh, I see.
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:17.040]   I don't even want to know.
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:17.400]   All right.
[02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:18.320]   Actually, I do.
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:20.000]   Boxers are tidy whities.
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.160]   I didn't try them on.
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:23.280]   I just have them in a box.
[02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:26.160]   But I'm guessing they're tidy whities.
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:29.720]   But again, don't know.
[02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:30.240]   I'll tell you what.
[02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:31.000]   I'll do some research.
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.440]   And I'll tell you next week.
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:34.840]   OK.
[02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:36.520]   You'll find out.
[02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:38.280]   No, I'm really pleased.
[02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:42.480]   I keep meaning to study up on how to write echo skills,
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:44.160]   because it'd be so useful to have--
[02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:47.520]   like, we ought to have a twit skill.
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:50.200]   I mean, it's crazy that I don't have a twit skill.
[02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:50.880]   It is crazy.
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:53.800]   And I put under my Stacy's thing, the Sonos hack
[02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:54.640]   from Fred Wilson.
[02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:55.400]   Oh, thank you.
[02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:56.400]   See the blog post?
[02:19:56.400 --> 02:19:58.000]   That could be your thing.
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:19:59.520]   Oh, I have another echo related thing.
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:00.240]   OK.
[02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:01.440]   Two things.
[02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:02.360]   Two things.
[02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:04.280]   Does Fred Wilson own--
[02:20:04.280 --> 02:20:05.840]   is he an investor in Sonos or echo,
[02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:07.360]   or is he just like an interested party?
[02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:08.240]   He's a huge fan.
[02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:08.760]   I guess so.
[02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:09.280]   Huge fan.
[02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:10.840]   Huge fan for years.
[02:20:10.840 --> 02:20:12.880]   And there's a lot of Sonos hacks out there.
[02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:15.560]   Like, if you Google that, you can find some of them.
[02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:19.800]   They're just-- they're not easy, which is why people don't do it.
[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:24.400]   So his friend Steven used the skills interface, which is really--
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:25.280]   it's open to anybody.
[02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:26.760]   Use Amazon's Lambda Cloud.
[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:29.440]   And if you don't do a lot of requests,
[02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:31.080]   it doesn't cost you anything.
[02:20:31.080 --> 02:20:34.760]   If you publish it, then it can cost you something.
[02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:37.840]   And then it sends instructions to a server on the laptop.
[02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:39.960]   Oh, see, that's what you need.
[02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:43.240]   That runs the code that controls the Sonos on his home network.
[02:20:43.240 --> 02:20:45.680]   So you have to have some intermediate system that
[02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:48.680]   can access the Sonos network and do the work for you.
[02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:53.400]   You know, Raspberry Pi could probably do this pretty well.
[02:20:53.400 --> 02:20:55.200]   So it feels like somebody's already done that,
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:57.600]   for some reason.
[02:20:57.600 --> 02:20:59.080]   Yeah.
[02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:02.160]   Why Sonos hasn't done this is beyond me.
[02:21:02.160 --> 02:21:04.080]   Oh, they're still trying to figure-- they still
[02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:06.320]   have them published in API for their smart home stuff,
[02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:07.800]   even though they've promised them a lot of them.
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:08.520]   I need to do that.
[02:21:08.520 --> 02:21:11.080]   They need to do that.
[02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:11.880]   All right, let's take a break.
[02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:15.640]   So we will get your picks, your tweets, your numbers,
[02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:18.600]   whatever it is you want to end this show with--
[02:21:18.600 --> 02:21:22.640]   we call it the back of the book coming up in just a second.
[02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:23.560]   Smart things.
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:26.000]   Dr. Mom is saying smart things works fine with the echo
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:26.560]   on the Sonos.
[02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:28.640]   So that could be the thing that intermediates.
[02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:30.160]   OK, I didn't know that.
[02:21:30.160 --> 02:21:31.840]   It does.
[02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:34.480]   You can only, though, play your favorites.
[02:21:34.480 --> 02:21:38.520]   And I think, can you do volume up and down?
[02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:40.600]   It's been so long since I've played with the smart things
[02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:41.440]   Sonos.
[02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:45.320]   I just have my dot paired via Bluetooth
[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:48.600]   to a very nice JBL speaker powered speaker system,
[02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:50.280]   stereo powered speaker system.
[02:21:50.280 --> 02:21:52.400]   I can do all the commands.
[02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:53.160]   It's great.
[02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:53.800]   It's in the bedroom.
[02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:54.880]   I can rock out.
[02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:55.760]   It's wonderful.
[02:21:55.760 --> 02:21:58.200]   I think I can do playlists from Pandora and Spotify
[02:21:58.200 --> 02:21:59.400]   and listen to books.
[02:21:59.400 --> 02:22:00.200]   And it's just great.
[02:22:00.200 --> 02:22:01.440]   I love it.
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:03.000]   Yeah, you just can't-- with smart things,
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.480]   you can't play an exact song.
[02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:05.680]   Because I've got my Sonos.
[02:22:05.680 --> 02:22:10.880]   Sonos is set up on my echo.
[02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:11.840]   But you just--
[02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:17.000]   No, see, like the other day, we had the day off.
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:18.800]   It was the 4th of July, I think.
[02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:20.760]   And I wanted to dance naked.
[02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:26.840]   And I said, echo, play Madonna, celebrate.
[02:22:26.840 --> 02:22:27.560]   Or holiday.
[02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:28.880]   Holiday, that was it.
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:29.920]   And I danced naked.
[02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:33.280]   And that's what you need the echo for.
[02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:34.920]   She doesn't judge.
[02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:35.800]   She doesn't.
[02:22:35.800 --> 02:22:38.160]   Instead, she sends you emergency underwear.
[02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:40.440]   She's getting her messages, actually.
[02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:42.040]   Can't get that out of my head.
[02:22:42.040 --> 02:22:45.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:49.720]   Holiday, it would be so right.
[02:22:49.720 --> 02:22:52.600]   Oh, I think it was at the 25th or 30th birthday for True Blue.
[02:22:52.600 --> 02:22:54.640]   Because it wasn't Holiday and True Blue.
[02:22:54.640 --> 02:22:56.160]   That was my first cassette tape I ever bought.
[02:22:56.160 --> 02:22:57.360]   Wow.
[02:22:57.360 --> 02:22:58.480]   Wow.
[02:22:58.480 --> 02:23:00.680]   I've touched a nerve.
[02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:02.040]   Touch the touchstone, basically.
[02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:03.000]   Touch the touchstone.
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:03.680]   Yep.
[02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:04.160]   Yep.
[02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:05.160]   Yep.
[02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:08.000]   Let's kick things off with the Stacey Higginbotham
[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.680]   By the way, can I just make a recommendation
[02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:15.520]   that you subscribe to her newsletter?
[02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:17.920]   You know, if everybody listening to this show--
[02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:19.440]   it's free, right, Stacey?
[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:20.760]   It is totally free.
[02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:23.280]   If everybody listened to this show right now
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:25.040]   went to Stacey on IOT--
[02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:26.720]   well, first of all, we bring the site down.
[02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:28.560]   But then after the site came back up
[02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:34.960]   and subscribed to the newsletter, I bet maybe we wouldn't.
[02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:38.240]   You would triple your audience.
[02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:39.440]   And it's instantly-- and you should.
[02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:42.200]   You deserve it.
[02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:44.320]   You can tell what a brilliant analyst Stacey is.
[02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:46.720]   She really knows your stuff.
[02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:48.080]   So sign up.
[02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:50.480]   It's the free weekly IOT newsletter.
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:52.880]   And you'll find it at Stacey on IOT.com.
[02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:53.800]   I want to give you a big plug.
[02:23:53.800 --> 02:23:56.000]   I don't plug it enough.
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:56.920]   Thank you.
[02:23:56.920 --> 02:23:59.640]   And you can see she's doing all the research you're doing,
[02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:01.640]   all the reporting.
[02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:03.840]   And this time, you're doing it for yourself, which I love.
[02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:05.600]   It's true.
[02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:07.200]   This is how I'm going to make my money.
[02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:08.280]   No, I support it.
[02:24:08.280 --> 02:24:09.520]   No, I think it's great.
[02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:10.480]   I want to support it.
[02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:13.200]   And then, of course, the podcast is IOTpodcast.com.
[02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:15.160]   You do that with Kevin Tofol.
[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:17.480]   Also, must listen.
[02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:20.960]   In fact, you did a whole episode on the new Alexa skills.
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:21.960]   Yes, we did.
[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:23.880]   And the wink.
[02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:27.480]   And this tomorrow's-- tomorrow, my episode coming out
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:29.640]   has a cool thing on insurance in the smart home.
[02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:30.080]   And--
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:31.080]   Right.
[02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:32.040]   Super fun.
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:34.440]   So you're using-- did you ever get a Luma?
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:35.920]   You're using the Iro.
[02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:37.120]   I'm using the Iro.
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:38.760]   And then the Luma is delayed.
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:42.120]   I have an order, but no shipping yet.
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:45.000]   And then there's Plume, which is later this year,
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:46.960]   and is the least expensive of the three.
[02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:48.280]   But I think similar.
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:49.680]   Totally different architecture.
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:50.760]   Oh, it is.
[02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:51.920]   You're like, not similar.
[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:52.680]   It's not similar.
[02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:54.240]   It's not a mesh thing.
[02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:55.840]   It's not a mesh.
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:24:57.280]   It's controlled in the cloud.
[02:24:57.280 --> 02:25:02.360]   So you get like six radios with no intelligence in them.
[02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:03.200]   And the radios--
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:03.200]   Oh.
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:04.760]   --all the intelligence lives in the cloud.
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:05.320]   OK.
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:06.680]   Well, let's-- where's the try?
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:07.640]   I'm going to review all of them.
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:10.560]   By the way, you said you were getting great results
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:12.320]   with your Iro, and I've set the Iro up.
[02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:12.680]   I don't know.
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:13.760]   Did I mention this last week?
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:15.160]   It's been working great.
[02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:15.640]   Oh, it has.
[02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:15.840]   OK.
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:16.640]   Yeah, you said it was bad.
[02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:19.640]   I had a very bad experience with two.
[02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:20.480]   They sent me a set.
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:21.000]   Didn't work.
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:21.640]   sent me another set.
[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:22.720]   Didn't work.
[02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:24.480]   Must have just been-- it was very early.
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:26.440]   I don't even know if they were in production yet.
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:29.200]   But the production unit I have now
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:31.520]   is easily the best Wi-Fi we've had in the house.
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:33.040]   So which one do you guys recommend?
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:35.520]   Well, the problem with the Iro is it's really expensive.
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:38.440]   It's $500 for three units.
[02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:40.120]   But that's what you're using, Stacey, right?
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:41.600]   That's what I-- well, because beforehand,
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:42.840]   I had all these access points.
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:45.680]   And every time I tried to mess with my router,
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:49.280]   my husband would get mad at me because my network was held
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:50.640]   together by duct tape and purring.
[02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:51.200]   No, me too.
[02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:53.320]   Lisa did the ultimate insult.
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:56.400]   She said, well, we could just bring Russell in and do it.
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:59.000]   And that was like, oh, just stab me in the heart.
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.960]   You're married to the tech guy and you want to bring in Russell?
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:05.000]   Just kill me now.
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.640]   So I wouldn't let her because I have too much pride.
[02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:09.240]   But it also put the pressure on.
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:11.720]   I had a fine solution that worked.
[02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:12.560]   Yeah.
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:14.080]   But the Euro works great.
[02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:15.160]   I'm really--
[02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:17.040]   And the speed is very good.
[02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:19.880]   Not hugely better, but very good.
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:22.400]   And the coverage is a lot better.
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:22.840]   Yeah.
[02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:25.080]   We've got coverage all the way from our garage
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:26.400]   to our rooftop deck.
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:27.480]   And we've only got three.
[02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:27.880]   So--
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:29.280]   Yeah.
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:31.800]   But they're 200 bucks each.
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:33.040]   Very expensive.
[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:36.160]   I mean, the best routers you can get are 200 bucks.
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:36.600]   So--
[02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:37.040]   Yeah.
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:40.440]   But as you start connecting more crap into your house,
[02:26:40.440 --> 02:26:42.520]   you're going to be like, you need Wi-Fi.
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:45.360]   I had AirPort Express and the AirPort extremes.
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:45.880]   That didn't work.
[02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:46.600]   Took those all out.
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:49.320]   Got a Asus AC3200, which is an excellent.
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:49.800]   Really.
[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:51.520]   My favorite Wi-Fi router.
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:54.360]   But it didn't cover far enough.
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:58.240]   So then I was using TPLink Powerline adapters
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:00.360]   to get the Wi-Fi out into the edges.
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:01.320]   And oh my god.
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:03.200]   It was just a nightmare.
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:04.280]   This just worked.
[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:04.680]   It's great.
[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:06.280]   So thank you.
[02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:07.840]   I apologize to Euro for--
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:10.280]   but I just could never get it working now that it is.
[02:27:10.280 --> 02:27:11.120]   I'm very happy with it.
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:12.640]   E-E-R-O.
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:14.960]   But Luma is very similar, right?
[02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:17.800]   That's because similar, but I think under bucks less.
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:18.320]   It is.
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:19.880]   It's a 100 bucks less.
[02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:21.280]   Similar mesh network.
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:21.720]   Yeah.
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:27.520]   Their angle is security and parental controls,
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:30.360]   although Euro just announced parental controls.
[02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:30.800]   You know what?
[02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:32.680]   They have a really kind of nice parental control
[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:35.720]   where you could say this MAC address, this one right here.
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:39.480]   This is off during dinner and after it's 9 PM.
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:41.080]   Love that.
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:42.840]   I wish-- I will say though.
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:44.920]   Here's my complaint.
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:46.440]   I want to know what my devices are.
[02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:48.400]   And right now, when I look--
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:50.920]   just god, people name your freaking devices.
[02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:52.040]   I agree.
[02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:54.320]   And you can, by the way, if you figure it out,
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:55.680]   you might have to use the MAC address.
[02:27:55.680 --> 02:27:56.440]   You can name it.
[02:27:56.440 --> 02:27:58.720]   You can reserve an IP address for it.
[02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:00.440]   I do port forwarding with it.
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:03.040]   It's not as sophisticated as like the AC3200.
[02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:04.760]   It doesn't have nearly the number of settings.
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:06.440]   Doesn't seem to have QOS.
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:08.360]   A lot of the stuff is done in the cloud,
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:10.520]   which means you don't know if it's being done or not.
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:13.000]   They say, for instance, that they're
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.080]   noting what kinds of devices you have
[02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:18.520]   and tuning your network to work best with a Roku or Apple TV
[02:28:18.520 --> 02:28:20.720]   or whatever you have attached.
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:22.880]   I have to take that on faith.
[02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:25.640]   But it works quite well.
[02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:27.200]   And I'll be curious about the Luma.
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:29.400]   And then I'll get a plume too.
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:31.520]   I'm sure you will.
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:32.600]   We'll keep you up on this.
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:35.120]   But I'm still-- you have to answer the question.
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:35.800]   Get the euro?
[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:36.840]   It's a big, which one do you buy?
[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:38.640]   Well, you can only buy one right now.
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:40.280]   That's the only one available is the euro.
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:41.320]   I know that.
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:42.040]   It works.
[02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:48.200]   I think the two negatives are price.
[02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:50.400]   Three negatives are price.
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:52.640]   The fact that you have to give them a real phone number
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:56.000]   or email address, you have to have an account with them.
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.880]   They say that so that they can keep it up to date, right?
[02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:02.600]   No, they said it because it's in lieu of a password
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:07.760]   because the CEO noted that everybody was using Wi-Fi 1, 2, 3,
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:08.560]   4.
[02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:10.040]   And that was crappy security.
[02:29:10.040 --> 02:29:11.560]   So they changed their setup.
[02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:12.060]   OK.
[02:29:12.060 --> 02:29:12.960]   So it required a number.
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:14.840]   So it is more secure that way.
[02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:18.080]   They say they update constantly, which
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:21.800]   is unlike any router you've ever used before.
[02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:25.480]   And the third negative is it doesn't have as many fiddly bits.
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:27.440]   That may be a positive, depending on who you are.
[02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:30.400]   But it does all the things I have a server running inside
[02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:33.400]   the network, and it works fine with board forwarding.
[02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:35.680]   And the fact that I can do a reservation
[02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:39.360]   so I can lock in an IP address and do port forwarding is nice.
[02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:43.680]   So anyway, I think I would not hesitate to recommend it
[02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:45.960]   if you don't mind spending $500.
[02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:47.320]   And you can add more, by the way.
[02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:48.360]   $500 gives you three.
[02:29:48.360 --> 02:29:51.800]   But if you want to add a few more, you can, because it's mesh.
[02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:55.160]   And Stacy's using it in a better way, which
[02:29:55.160 --> 02:29:56.760]   is she's got ethernet to all of them.
[02:29:56.760 --> 02:29:58.440]   But I'm using it Wi-Fi.
[02:29:58.440 --> 02:29:59.960]   Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi.
[02:29:59.960 --> 02:30:00.280]   Yeah.
[02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:01.760]   And if you use it Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi,
[02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:05.000]   you're going to see a slight drop in your speeds.
[02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:06.880]   That's true of all repeater setups.
[02:30:06.880 --> 02:30:08.000]   Yes, I would bet.
[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:08.040]   Yeah.
[02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:10.720]   That's how that works.
[02:30:10.720 --> 02:30:11.800]   So you're pick-- I'm sorry, Stacy.
[02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:13.080]   I didn't mean to interrupt your pick,
[02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:19.720]   but I just wanted to thank you and apologize for dissing your euro.
[02:30:19.720 --> 02:30:22.840]   I don't take my tech as personally, I think, as you do.
[02:30:22.840 --> 02:30:24.720]   I take it very personally.
[02:30:24.720 --> 02:30:25.920]   I'm like, yeah.
[02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:26.800]   You can hit my routers.
[02:30:26.800 --> 02:30:27.360]   That's the word.
[02:30:27.360 --> 02:30:30.400]   I hate your router.
[02:30:30.400 --> 02:30:36.360]   My pick is an app called Lexa, which is kind of like EchoSim.
[02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:39.840]   But what it does, the cool thing is you don't have to have
[02:30:39.840 --> 02:30:43.840]   your own Echo, you just have to have an Amazon account.
[02:30:43.840 --> 02:30:46.120]   And you can treat it like an Echo.
[02:30:46.120 --> 02:30:51.200]   So let me do this because I got to make my--
[02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:56.480]   And don't confuse this with the Dutch Lexa dating war singles.
[02:30:56.480 --> 02:30:57.680]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[02:30:57.680 --> 02:30:59.400]   That's also a Google play.
[02:30:59.400 --> 02:31:01.120]   This is what it looks like.
[02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:02.480]   I can't do first stuff.
[02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:04.120]   Yeah, it's got a big button.
[02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:05.360]   And when you press the button--
[02:31:05.360 --> 02:31:06.360]   Yeah.
[02:31:09.320 --> 02:31:10.320]   Oh, she didn't hear me.
[02:31:10.320 --> 02:31:10.820]   Sorry.
[02:31:10.820 --> 02:31:11.720]   I was like-- I was like--
[02:31:11.720 --> 02:31:12.220]   I was like--
[02:31:12.220 --> 02:31:13.120]   You pushed the button, but you didn't say anything.
[02:31:13.120 --> 02:31:13.720]   Exactly.
[02:31:13.720 --> 02:31:14.840]   I was like, I froze.
[02:31:14.840 --> 02:31:16.320]   I didn't know what to ask her.
[02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:18.080]   Because I realized I don't have any lights or anything
[02:31:18.080 --> 02:31:20.120]   that could turn on and off in here.
[02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:22.720]   It's from UCIC, if you're searching for it on the app store.
[02:31:22.720 --> 02:31:26.120]   Is it only Apple or is it Android?
[02:31:26.120 --> 02:31:27.600]   Android and iOS.
[02:31:27.600 --> 02:31:28.960]   And the company that--
[02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:30.000]   Yeah, it's hard to find.
[02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:31.040]   That's the problem.
[02:31:31.040 --> 02:31:34.160]   Search for UCIC.
[02:31:34.160 --> 02:31:36.120]   Lexa, UCIC, I think.
[02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:38.800]   I actually went to an article about it.
[02:31:38.800 --> 02:31:41.240]   And then click the link.
[02:31:41.240 --> 02:31:43.680]   So it's basically an echo in your pocket.
[02:31:43.680 --> 02:31:46.200]   So you could use it, again, I showed you an app a couple
[02:31:46.200 --> 02:31:49.480]   weeks ago called Rogers that you could
[02:31:49.480 --> 02:31:50.800]   turn that into a remote control.
[02:31:50.800 --> 02:31:55.080]   But here, they say-- and because I have my Amazon account
[02:31:55.080 --> 02:31:57.360]   tied to my echo and dot, I can't try this.
[02:31:57.360 --> 02:31:59.880]   So I'm curious if someone who doesn't have one can try it
[02:31:59.880 --> 02:32:01.040]   and see.
[02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:02.840]   I doubt it would control your smart home stuff,
[02:32:02.840 --> 02:32:06.120]   because that needs the radios and stuff in your house.
[02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:10.120]   But you could ask it all the things you ask, the echo.
[02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:11.720]   Huh.
[02:32:11.720 --> 02:32:14.760]   Lexa, L-E-X-A by UCIC.
[02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:17.840]   They just used the API that was put out.
[02:32:17.840 --> 02:32:19.320]   I assume so.
[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:20.440]   This company's kind of cool.
[02:32:20.440 --> 02:32:21.640]   It's been around for a long time.
[02:32:21.640 --> 02:32:23.920]   They started out building something that was almost
[02:32:23.920 --> 02:32:26.080]   exactly like the echo.
[02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:28.680]   But Amazon did it way better.
[02:32:28.680 --> 02:32:29.920]   And so--
[02:32:29.920 --> 02:32:32.680]   Give me a fart noise.
[02:32:32.680 --> 02:32:34.400]   No, ask for a fart.
[02:32:34.400 --> 02:32:38.880]   But you have to first say, add the ask for a fart skill, right?
[02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:40.720]   Add the ask for a fart skill.
[02:32:40.720 --> 02:32:46.440]   She's not quite sure how to help you with that.
[02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:48.920]   Yeah, maybe that's interesting.
[02:32:48.920 --> 02:32:50.560]   That's a really interesting idea.
[02:32:50.560 --> 02:32:53.000]   But of course, Amazon should just build this into the Alexa
[02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.040]   app and it'd be a game over.
[02:32:55.040 --> 02:32:55.680]   Right.
[02:32:55.680 --> 02:32:59.440]   This company is probably-- this is what they've encountered
[02:32:59.440 --> 02:33:00.840]   their entire life.
[02:33:00.840 --> 02:33:01.200]   So--
[02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:02.680]   Yeah, right.
[02:33:02.680 --> 02:33:07.240]   Maybe they should try to find some greenfield technology
[02:33:07.240 --> 02:33:09.320]   they could get involved in.
[02:33:09.320 --> 02:33:11.400]   So maybe this is the one that--
[02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:13.720]   This is the one.
[02:33:13.720 --> 02:33:18.040]   And maybe Amazon will buy them, but I kind of doubt it.
[02:33:18.040 --> 02:33:19.640]   I use it as a remote for--
[02:33:19.640 --> 02:33:21.760]   Add the ask for a fart skill.
[02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:28.040]   I can't find the answer to the question I heard.
[02:33:28.040 --> 02:33:29.320]   That's even her voice, isn't it?
[02:33:29.320 --> 02:33:29.960]   That's kind of cool.
[02:33:29.960 --> 02:33:33.200]   OK.
[02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:34.120]   Buy underpants.
[02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:42.280]   Based on Leo's order history, I found a coderman's emergency
[02:33:42.280 --> 02:33:44.000]   underpants dispenser.
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.800]   It's $7.57 total.
[02:33:46.800 --> 02:33:49.160]   To order it, tell me Leo's voice code.
[02:33:49.160 --> 02:33:51.200]   Never.
[02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:52.600]   No.
[02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:55.160]   I already have a pair.
[02:33:55.160 --> 02:33:56.160]   There you go.
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:33:57.080]   There you go.
[02:33:57.080 --> 02:33:59.600]   It's an emergency underpants dispenser.
[02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:01.520]   Yes.
[02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:02.840]   So you don't have the underpants.
[02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:04.160]   Underpants, Leo.
[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:06.640]   [SCREAMING]
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:07.400]   It's at home.
[02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:08.120]   I don't know.
[02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:08.760]   I didn't really--
[02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:09.880]   Do you really hang it on the wall?
[02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:10.400]   Oh.
[02:34:10.400 --> 02:34:10.920]   Yes.
[02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:12.240]   Reach over and hold on.
[02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:13.360]   I'm a pair of pants.
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:18.800]   It's possibly a joke app, but I didn't get that joke novelty.
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:19.800]   But I didn't get that feeling.
[02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:22.200]   I had the feeling it was really a response to it
[02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:25.040]   perceived me.
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:27.200]   Oh, maybe it's for like depends.
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:27.960]   Maybe it's like--
[02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:28.480]   Yeah.
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:29.880]   Or you have an accident or something.
[02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:34.960]   And you need something in an emergency.
[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:36.680]   I really want to know more about that.
[02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:38.000]   I'll just look it up on Amazon.
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000]   Here's--
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:43.920]   Here's in our chat room, they have an article apparently
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:44.400]   about it.
[02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:49.040]   Here's a picture anyway.
[02:34:49.040 --> 02:34:51.280]   Always ready to use.
[02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:53.160]   Do I have underwear that's not ready to use?
[02:34:53.160 --> 02:34:54.160]   Just grab and go.
[02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:55.840]   A little Kleenex box.
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:34:57.200]   Oh, actually, yeah.
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:34:58.200]   Basically, kind of pricey.
[02:34:58.200 --> 02:34:59.840]   It's 13 bucks for one pair.
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:02.480]   Great gag gift useful as well.
[02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:04.440]   It's a gag gift that's useful.
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:05.520]   Oh, no, there's five pairs.
[02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:06.520]   There's five pairs.
[02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:07.600]   And a two are insecure.
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:09.920]   Well, there's also a one pair.
[02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:11.080]   Archie McPhee's--
[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:11.560]   Uh-oh.
[02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:14.600]   Oh, if it's from Archie McPhee, it's not serious.
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:16.160]   Oh, OK.
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:20.160]   [SIGHS]
[02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:21.800]   Jeff, you're number of the week.
[02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:22.720]   Oh, sorry.
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:28.520]   I was trying to figure out how to dispense underpants
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:32.040]   or dispense with them, as the case may be.
[02:35:32.040 --> 02:35:36.800]   So in 1995, Kurt Van Vanniket gave a lecture in which he said
[02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:38.680]   that you could take all the stories that are over war,
[02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:40.800]   put them in a computer, and figure out the shape of them.
[02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:45.840]   Indeed, now Andrew Reagan at the Computational Story Lab,
[02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:49.200]   the University of Vermont in Burlington, and a few pals,
[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:55.120]   analyzed 1,700 stories, and found six core trajectories,
[02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:55.800]   which I love.
[02:35:55.800 --> 02:35:56.840]   So here they are.
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:01.080]   One, a steady, ongoing rise in emotional valence
[02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:03.600]   as it erects to riches stories such as Alice's
[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:06.160]   Underground Adventures Underground.
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:09.400]   Two, a steady, ongoing fall in emotional valence
[02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:11.680]   as in a tragedy such as Romeo and Juliet.
[02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:16.080]   Three, a fall then a rise such as the man in a whole story
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:17.520]   discussed by Vanniket.
[02:36:17.520 --> 02:36:22.840]   Four, a rise then a fall such as the Greek myth of Icarus.
[02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:26.560]   Five, rise, fall, rise such as Cinderella.
[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:30.960]   And six, fall, rise, fall such as Oedipus.
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:31.760]   So that's it.
[02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:33.120]   There are no news stories.
[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:34.800]   There are only six.
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:35.760]   Wow.
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:37.600]   That kind of makes sense.
[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:38.200]   It does.
[02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:40.560]   Yeah.
[02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:45.720]   And it really all has to do with the rise in the fall.
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:46.320]   Yeah.
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:48.040]   That would be that narrative arc.
[02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:48.560]   Yeah.
[02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:49.920]   It's called the art.
[02:36:49.920 --> 02:36:51.080]   It's called the art.
[02:36:51.080 --> 02:36:52.120]   Yes.
[02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:52.560]   Wow.
[02:36:52.560 --> 02:36:53.720]   Which is very cool.
[02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:55.040]   There's a video as well apparently.
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:55.840]   I didn't watch it.
[02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:59.920]   What's interesting is that it really did it.
[02:36:59.920 --> 02:37:00.920]   I mean, it's real.
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:02.080]   It's not--
[02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:02.600]   Yeah.
[02:37:02.600 --> 02:37:05.000]   Huh.
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.400]   My tip comes from Tech Republic.
[02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:09.240]   I love you, Tech Republic.
[02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:11.600]   Jason Heiners publication.
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:14.160]   And I was going to kind of do it.
[02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:16.880]   But I think I'll just refer to the article.
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:19.320]   It turns out-- and I did not know this-- that Google Keep
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:21.520]   has transcription capabilities.
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:23.520]   It can OCR an image.
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:26.160]   Did you know that?
[02:37:26.160 --> 02:37:26.520]   It did.
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:29.920]   Google did keep the world's worst voice transcription
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:32.200]   I've ever had.
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:34.080]   I cannot make any sense of it.
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:35.120]   Well, it's famous for that.
[02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:37.480]   I don't have any images, unfortunately, in my Google Keep.
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:41.880]   But the idea is if you have an image that has text--
[02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:43.880]   I used to use Evernote for this.
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:47.720]   And Evernote raised their fee about 40% on Evernote premium.
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:49.320]   And I'm probably going to stick around because I haven't
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:51.880]   found anything anywhere near as good.
[02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:53.800]   But I have been looking at alternatives.
[02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:56.240]   And Keep would be one of the obvious alternatives.
[02:37:56.240 --> 02:38:00.320]   Keep is a Google's free note keeping.
[02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:01.120]   There it is.
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:03.880]   Free note keeping app.
[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:06.040]   The problem is it's all in one page.
[02:38:06.040 --> 02:38:08.560]   It doesn't really have the kind of organizational features.
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:10.120]   I use it.
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:13.440]   In general, I use it just to do the most--
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:15.480]   like shopping lists and the most recent stuff.
[02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:18.360]   But if you have an image in there,
[02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:21.280]   it turns out that once you've got the image,
[02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:25.360]   you can open the note, click on the three dot menu.
[02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:29.600]   And from the pop up, there is a menu item grab image text.
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:31.440]   And it will do it instantly because, of course,
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:35.200]   Google has more CPU cycles than God.
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:39.200]   And you can quickly get the text from an image using Google.
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:39.560]   Keep.
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:41.480]   And here's the tech republic demo.
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:44.680]   They had some poster from iZombie.
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:47.440]   If you scroll down a little bit there, Carsten,
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:49.360]   you can see that it adds the text.
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:53.360]   And it does at least at this example, pretty credible job.
[02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:55.280]   Unfortunately, I don't have any images in my Keep.
[02:38:55.280 --> 02:38:57.000]   And I meant to do that before the show today.
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.600]   But just thought I'd pass it along as a useful tip.
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:02.000]   There is there in the menu item on your notes.
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:07.240]   If you have images with text, try the OCR free and built in
[02:39:07.240 --> 02:39:08.160]   to Google Keep.
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:08.680]   - Play it.
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:09.360]   - It's great.
[02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:10.800]   Yeah.
[02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:12.720]   So let's see here.
[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:15.200]   So I thought it's like, when you wake up in the middle of the
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:16.920]   night, you think you have a good idea, I was driving.
[02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:18.360]   And I had to make a note.
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:19.480]   I'll use Keep.
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:20.840]   Yeah.
[02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:21.760]   And you transcribe it.
[02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:24.280]   You see, first level three practices, one transparency,
[02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:26.720]   a salute transparency, about 10 smartest people
[02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:29.640]   to accessibility 3,000 new expression of the value
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:30.680]   to both parties.
[02:39:30.680 --> 02:39:32.240]   And resume before I'm watching that,
[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:34.520]   thought you were asleep to write a review about relation
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:38.240]   and said he was working Christmas wishing well.
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:40.520]   Well, I understand perfectly.
[02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:41.520]   - Exactly.
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:42.720]   - Anything I write.
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:44.040]   - Yeah, would I wake up?
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:47.080]   - In the middle of the night, that makes perfect sense.
[02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:49.120]   - Exactly.
[02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:52.520]   - Ah, my friends, I hate to do it.
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:55.120]   But it's time to say good night.
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:55.920]   You guys--
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:39:56.760]   - Why Lassie?
[02:39:56.760 --> 02:39:57.600]   - You guys is great.
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:01.040]   I am really thrilled to have Stacey Higginbotham,
[02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:02.560]   part of the team.
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:04.520]   Now this is the core team.
[02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:08.000]   We've been talking to Dan Lyons, and he's been traveling
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.040]   as much as you, Jeff.
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:11.760]   So we're hoping to get him on the team as well.
[02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:13.320]   And that'll be a lot of fun.
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:16.360]   He's, of course, the former fake Steve Jobs,
[02:40:16.360 --> 02:40:19.320]   one of the funniest guys in tech reporting.
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:24.880]   And most recently worked at the TV show Silicon Valley,
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:26.400]   where he was a staff writer.
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:29.560]   And he has a book called Disrupted, which is wonderful.
[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:31.640]   So we hope to get him on very soon.
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:32.160]   - Cool.
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:35.520]   - Meanwhile, you can find Stacey at Stacey on IOT.com.

[02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:43.520]   I say, every week.
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:45.000]   Thank you so much for being here, Stacey.
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:46.800]   We appreciate it.
[02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:52.240]   Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com.
[02:40:52.240 --> 02:40:53.360]   That's his blog.
[02:40:53.360 --> 02:40:57.560]   Don't forget, if you are looking for a good journalism school,
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:41:00.320]   there's none better than CUNY.
[02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:04.600]   You can find him there during the season.
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:07.000]   Professing, that's what he does.
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.040]   Also, regular contributor to Medium.
[02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:10.320]   Thanks, Jeff.
[02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:11.280]   Thank you.
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:14.120]   - I'm going to argue with you in the journalism school.
[02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:15.800]   - Oh, yeah, you got a better one?
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:17.600]   - I got my Alma Mater.
[02:41:17.600 --> 02:41:20.200]   - Hey, hey, is that U of T?
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:21.800]   - It is U of T.
[02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:22.600]   - What did you think?
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:24.320]   - Hook 'em horns or those two.
[02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:25.800]   - Hook 'em.
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:27.640]   - It's in New York here.
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:29.160]   - Oh, I don't know.
[02:41:29.160 --> 02:41:30.880]   See?
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:33.880]   - Did you study with the wonderful Rosenthal Elvis?
[02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:34.760]   - I did.
[02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:36.720]   He taught my favorite class.
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:37.800]   What was that?
[02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:39.240]   - It was international reporting.
[02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:41.720]   He used to tell us to meet him outside,
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:44.040]   and he would pretend to be a Colombian dictator,
[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:45.720]   and he would hold a press conference.
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:47.080]   - Oh, fun.
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:48.600]   - It was awesome.
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:51.120]   I had him, and let's see, Rusty Todd,
[02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:52.840]   who, whenever we would come in,
[02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:54.160]   he used to work at the Wall Street Journal,
[02:41:54.160 --> 02:41:55.520]   and he did financial journalism,
[02:41:55.520 --> 02:41:59.040]   and the class was held at the end of the closing
[02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:00.600]   of the Wall Street.
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:02.920]   And we'd have to come in and write an earnings story
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:04.880]   or a stock market story.
[02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:07.320]   - We had 20 minutes, go.
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:08.960]   - Real world experience.
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:11.800]   - So, not all of you two was that way,
[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:12.840]   but those were guys.
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:13.680]   Those were good.
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:16.480]   - Jeff, I'm sure--
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:17.320]   - I'm sure you're--
[02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:18.160]   - You're the best journalism school in the world.
[02:42:18.160 --> 02:42:19.000]   - I was best at the day.
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:20.840]   - You're still a journalism club.
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:22.480]   - I'm coming to CUNY.
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:26.680]   I'm just odd.
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:29.360]   I'm working with two professional journalists here,
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:30.760]   and I am a mirror amateur,
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:32.640]   but I'm glad we could have you
[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:35.600]   to add some gravitas to the show, both of you.
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:38.000]   We do Twig this week in Google every Wednesday,
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:42.440]   1.30 p.m. Pacific, 4.30 Eastern time, 20.30 UTC.
[02:42:42.440 --> 02:42:43.840]   Hope you'll join us live.
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:45.160]   Be in studio with us.
[02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:48.920]   We got a pair of fathers and sons, which is so, so cool.
[02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:51.040]   All you have to do is email tickets at twit.tv.
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:54.320]   We'll make a seat ready for you, available for you.
[02:42:54.320 --> 02:42:56.120]   And of course, you can join us in the chat room as well.

[02:42:58.000 --> 02:42:59.840]   always available after the fact,
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:04.440]   you'll find it at twig, I'm sorry, twit.tv/twig.
[02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:07.200]   Twit.tv/twig, or wherever you get your podcasts,
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:11.200]   you can just subscribe and give each and every week.
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:12.160]   Thank you for being here.
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:14.680]   We'll see you next week on This Week in Google.
[02:43:14.680 --> 02:43:15.520]   Bye-bye.
[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:18.100]   (upbeat music)
[02:43:18.100 --> 02:43:20.680]   (upbeat music)
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:23.260]   (upbeat music)
