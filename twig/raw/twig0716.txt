[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   It's time for Twig this week in Google a wide-ranging conversation.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.200]   As usual this week with Stacey Hickenbotham, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.120]   and Pruitt will play Mike Masnick's new moderator,
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.360]   Mayhem Game, and tell you what you learn about moderating from it.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.360]   We'll talk about AI regulation, who watches the watchers,
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.360]   and then Stacey with a warning about an IoT device you really should not buy.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.800]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.560]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.360]   Podcasts you love.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.880]   >> From people you trust.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.600]   >> This is Twig.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.720]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.320]   >> This is Twig.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.800]   This week in Google, episode 716 recorded Wednesday, May 17th, 2023.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.520]   It's pronounced papayri.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.440]   And a brief note, a portion of the show contains conversation about suicide.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.480]   So I wanted to give you a little bit of a trigger warning.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.120]   And of course, if you're struggling with thoughts of
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.800]   suicide or worried about a friend or loved one who is called to suicide in crisis lifeline.

[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.080]   Well, was that a Topo Chico or a La Croix?
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.720]   The suspension is just cracking out the beer already.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.680]   Oh wait, here, there you go.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.680]   Spindrift.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.000]   Best moment in succession this week.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.800]   And Darwin, the guy who predicts election results, gets with Sabi in his eye.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.080]   He's going, "Ah, smart."
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.240]   And cousin Greg puts a La Croix in his face.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.360]   And Tom Wamskin says, "This has got lemon in it.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.200]   It's only a trace of lemon dough."
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.160]   It's just eight drinks.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.320]   Just a hint.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.080]   So you're watching it.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.080]   Yes, it's good.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.080]   It's not good.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.080]   I love succession.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.720]   Well, that episode, Sunday night's episode.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.360]   I haven't watched the rest of it yet.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.520]   It made me queasy.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.520]   It was too close to reality.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.240]   It was scary as hell.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.000]   I said this on Mastodon.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.960]   Sometimes fiction can be closer to the truth in fact.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.960]   Amen to that.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.200]   Such a good show though.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   Let's play.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.480]   Can you have any game show music?
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.480]   Game music.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.560]   Da da da da da da da da.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.520]   Hey, I'm Leo LaPorte and it's time to play moderator mayhem.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.520]   This is the latest--
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.520]   For your host Mike Masnick.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.520]   The latest--
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.520]   Wait, we haven't introduced ourselves.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.520]   Oh, sorry.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.520]   Can you realize that?
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.520]   That is--
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.520]   I distracted us.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.520]   That is my home.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.520]   I just didn't know if you cared.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.520]   Higginbotham.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.080]   Stacy on IOT.com in the IOT podcast.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.080]   Hello, Stacy.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.080]   Hello, all.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.920]   Great to see you and your La Croix.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.600]   Say hello to Aunt Prud who's sitting next to me, which I like.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.680]   We did the thing that you're not supposed to do in business.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.760]   I made everybody come back to work.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.400]   Oh, you over tabbed on the bad guy.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.080]   I said we want all those editors and producers in studio from now on.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.560]   So that's how it used to be.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.600]   You know what the laptop-- what was-- laptop la-la's?
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.400]   Elon's laptop la-la's?
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.840]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.840]   I don't agree with Elon.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.240]   I don't agree with him on that at all.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.240]   I don't agree with him.

[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:31.240]   There's different places where AI is going to be used.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:37.840]   If AI is in a decision-making body, I think every single regulatory agency right now needs
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:43.240]   to have an AI bureau where they start evaluating.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.240]   If it's medicine, they need to be evaluating medical programs.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.240]   When we say regulate AI, what the hell are we talking about?
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.240]   It's so broad.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:59.240]   Remember the call for ethicists in medicine and other areas?
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:04.240]   I think the medical ethicists exist and some hospitals have them.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.240]   Insurance companies need them for sure.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.240]   They have IRBs.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.240]   Is that where you're talking about?
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.240]   Well, yeah.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.240]   I mean, this whole notion is--
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.240]   They also hire ethicists on staff.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:19.240]   But even things like the Homeland Security and the Internet Research--
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.240]   No, institutional review board.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.240]   Oh, this is a movie board.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.240]   Thank you.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.240]   Is there any other--
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   Is there any other--
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.240]   Yes, I was like, your IRB is different than my IRB.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.240]   Oh, man.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.240]   Every eye stands for Internet.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:38.240]   Would it be adequate to do what we did with medical ethicists to do that?
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   Should we have AI ethicists?
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:47.240]   No, I just think you need to create a regulatory system that's part of every--
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:52.240]   That does the auditing functions that handles complaints so you haven't--
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.240]   Like a weights and measures.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.240]   Like if you get it-- if your gas station doesn't give you the right amount of gas, you complain to the states.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:02.240]   So if your algorithm gives you some crappy result and you feel hard done by it--
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.240]   The problem is--
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.240]   Then you have a place to go and see restitution.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.240]   You can have a bureau weights and measures because a leader is a leader.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.240]   It's a little bit harder to say--
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.240]   I don't--
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.240]   That AI is off.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.240]   Here's--
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.240]   Well, do you--
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.240]   You have to be--
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:22.240]   Yeah, you have to-- so here's what we're dancing around and we need to stop dancing around.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:28.240]   We need to stop thinking that AI is technology that is neutral.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.240]   It isn't.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:37.240]   And then government needs to say, okay, we also have to recognize that it's the government's role to set parameters.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:44.240]   So we have to say, hey, as a government, we actually don't want AIs that, you know,
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   disproportionately affect black people.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.240]   And this is a hard conversation.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.240]   This isn't easy.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:58.240]   But historically, we've been able to throw the actual decision-making over the fence by saying it's a technology thing.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.240]   This isn't actually a technology thing.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:07.240]   This is why I brought up medical ethicists because instead of government regulation, what ensures--
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:13.240]   And of course, they have a big lobby, so they went to Congress and said, you better not tell us what we can and cannot do.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:19.240]   And health insurance, you know, there's no standard for whether they're going to allow that procedure or not.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:25.240]   But that's why they said, but we're going to have these ethicists who are going to help us make the decisions of who gets a heart
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   when you have one heart and two people who need it, that kind of thing.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   You can't make--
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.240]   Okay.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.240]   That's hard to make a regulation.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.240]   All right.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:40.240]   In fact, I wouldn't want government to say, well, these are the 23 criteria that you have to use to judge who gets that one heart.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.240]   I'm not sure I'd want that.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.240]   Is that the right way to go?
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:42.240]   No.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.240]   I'll give you another one.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.240]   Yes.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.240]   That's tough.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.240]   Yes, it is.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:54.240]   So the heart example is actually a really good one because you have an ethics board, actually.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.240]   You have-- I don't know who-- I think for hearts, and I don't know if this is a hundred percent.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.240]   You have transplant boards, yeah.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.240]   You have a transplant board who looks at cases on an individual basis.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.240]   Now, here's what's important.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.240]   It used to be.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.240]   Sometimes the transplant board members are public, right?
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:17.240]   So you can actually see if you're going to investigate a particular heart donation, you can actually see, like, did that person have secret ties to them or not?
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.240]   Or who these people are?
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.240]   Right.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.240]   So there's an accountability metric there.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.240]   Both-- who's on the-- like, the board itself is an accountability metric for the hospital.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.240]   Like, we've reviewed this, and here's the decision-making.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:34.240]   There's accountability for who's making the decision, so we know what their interests theoretically could be.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.240]   I think that's important.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:49.240]   And having something for that-- to evaluate an algorithm, because they're going to be in every organization and throughout society, you need to have those stationed in the appropriate places.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:57.240]   So a hospital review board, you may have a review board deal with medical AI, and it would evaluate the outcomes.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.240]   And this is what's important.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:04.240]   The outcomes of the AI, and see if those align with what the hospital itself wants to promote.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:15.240]   Or maybe it's at the FDA level, and the FDA is going to say, on a-- it'll have a-- it'll audit the AIs and say, these are the decisions it's making.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:21.240]   These are not in line with the outcomes we want to promote as the United States of America, right?
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.240]   So we have to establish those at different levels where AI is going to be implemented.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:33.240]   You need to have it at, like, maybe your-- I don't know, your attorney general at your state should be looking at police.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:38.240]   And it's like, AI is used in the criminal justice system.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.240]   Like, this is hard.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.240]   That's the sort of system.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.240]   Yeah, no.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:49.240]   One is-- and you start to get to a Stacy-- is that it's not about the AI, it's about the use.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.240]   Right?
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.240]   We talked about this in the show a lot.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:58.240]   That if you use facial recognition to arrest someone with no other facts, that's a misuse of the data and so on.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:02.240]   The other thing I would say, and I'm about to write this up, I think it's time for us to demote the engineering.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:11.240]   I think it's time for us to bring in other-- not just ethicists as the ghetto of ethics, but to bring in the humanities,
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:16.240]   to bring in anthropologists and philosophers and sociologists and psychologists.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:21.240]   If you were going to start a newspaper today, you wouldn't put the pressmen in charge.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.240]   If you were going to start a TV station, you wouldn't put the camera operator in charge.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.240]   No, Jamerby would be a very good head for the company, I might add.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.240]   But the thing is--
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.240]   Mr. Jarvis, we've been saying this for the last couple of years now.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.240]   Why hasn't that changed?
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:46.240]   It's been put out there in the public that, hey, the people that are in the business of training these systems need more diversity within the departments.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:51.240]   That's been preached over and over and over again, and it hasn't changed as of yet.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.240]   Well, I think this stuff, the stuff we're talking about today is still new.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.240]   We haven't seen this.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.240]   And again, it so much depends on the use.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:10.240]   If you have this system that maps the relationships of all words that we have available, you could use that to query it and say,
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.240]   what are the biases in society?
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.240]   In that case, you don't want to clean up the biases.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.240]   You want to know what they are.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.240]   You want to know what they are.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   Or if you say, I want to use this to train children on their career opportunities.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:26.240]   Well, then you have a completely different use, and you're going to judge the output completely differently.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.240]   So it's not about the AI is good or bad.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.240]   It's what was the intent?
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.240]   How was it trained to what end?
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.240]   And is the output beneficial and useful or not?
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.240]   And then how do humans use it?
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.240]   Do the police use it badly?
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.240]   Do mortgage companies use it badly?
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.240]   Do doctors use it badly?
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:52.240]   The bad stuff is going to come with misinterpretation and misuse from the humans after the fact.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.240]   So it's not about fixing the AI.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:05.240]   It's going to be a pen and pencil thing, is the AI doesn't know the bias society does, or the training set did, or the prompt did, or our own vision does.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:11.240]   And so Stacey's right, it's not simple, but it also isn't limited to this thing we call AI.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.240]   Oh, you can't regulate AI.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.240]   That's so stupid, and I wish we would stop talking.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.240]   We have to regulate the AI.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.240]   Aren't you saying, Stacey?
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.240]   Oh, what's the difference between regulating AI and regulating the use?
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.240]   You're saying we should regulate it.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.240]   You have to regulate the use of it already.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.240]   We're seeing things where we're...
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.240]   Who uses it?
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:38.240]   Like you would say it's okay for me to use mid-journey to generate pictures of professors even if they're biased.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.240]   I would point that out to you.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.240]   But it's not going to be regulated, I would hope.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.240]   Right, no, you can't regulate that.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.240]   There's also the regulation of regulatory capture, and I think that's what Sam Altman wanted.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.240]   Yeah, but you know what, regulatory capture is going to happen regardless.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:01.240]   And we see, they're just pissed because if you have the option of regulatory capture, then they have to spend money on lobbyists.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:14.240]   I mean, I hate... I get that regulatory capture exists, but I hate that as an argument for not regulating anything because then you're in this free fall, like everybody does whatever they want.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.240]   Yeah, you just should just pay attention to who's asking for the regulations.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.240]   Right, you totally should.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.240]   And then when you see the regulations...
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.240]   And who's benefiting from the regulation.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.240]   Right, right.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:30.240]   But what we're talking... I mean, and Jeff, you know, you brought up...
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   Jeff is right in the sense that you have to regulate the use of it, and when you see use cases, and you have to have regulations in place so you can actually demand that a company is telling you when they're using an algorithm to make a decision.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.240]   So there's two...
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.240]   To demand that you have access to it.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.240]   There's two what abouts that I would raise.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.240]   One is what about other nations?
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.240]   What about China, for instance, who...
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.240]   We can't do anything about China.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.240]   Well, but they're not going to be governed by regulation.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.240]   They're going to develop AIs.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.240]   They're going to get increasingly powerful while we are hobbling.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.240]   Or they're going to over-regulate it, which one of the senators was basically using it as a model.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.240]   Say, "Well, China regulates this output.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.240]   Maybe we should."
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.240]   Well, yeah.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:22.240]   We have regulatory capture as an issue here, which is that the incumbents influence... because they care, influence legislation, and it ends up benefiting them.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:27.240]   In China, the incumbents are the People's Republic of China, the government, the CCP.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:33.240]   So they were going to have it be influenced in such a way that it's to benefit them.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.240]   So that's their version of regulatory capture.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.240]   But that's the first one about...
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:50.240]   The other one about which concerns me also is regulation can keep us from making progress in a tradition.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.240]   This is one of the reasons they didn't regulate the internet initially.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.240]   Maybe we should have, I don't know.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:04.240]   But because it was a new and exciting, innovative sphere, they felt that it's too soon for government to intervene.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.240]   And that could hurt our development of AI.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.240]   So we're not talking about regulating the development of AI.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.240]   Well, they were in the Senate.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.240]   I know.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.240]   You're not.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.240]   I know.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.240]   But that's what...
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:24.240]   So you're throwing your what abouts in some... I'm proposing concrete regulatory steps that we can take to prevent actual harm.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:32.240]   And then you're in response to that, you're throwing me what abouts that actually don't relate to that at all.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:38.240]   So if you want to ask me like, what about regulatory capture, I would say, yeah, that happens.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.240]   And we're going to have to look out for it, but that's not an excuse to not regulate.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:50.240]   If you're going to ask, what if that stops us on innovation, I would say none of the steps in concrete proposals I've made actually stop our ability to innovate.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.240]   Stacey, but now, now, put on your Senator hat.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.240]   I know Leo is normally the Senator here.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.240]   Now, I would like you to be in the Senate because the Senate is not a diverse body.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.240]   So I should look like an old white man?
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.240]   Yes, you should.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.240]   Yes.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.240]   Or act like one.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:09.240]   So, I mean, you know, as Lindsey Graham said, all right.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.240]   Oh, no, you got to look up here.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.240]   You could be an old white woman like Diane Feinstein.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.240]   Oh, then you don't know where you are.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.240]   Okay.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.240]   Keep going, Judge.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.240]   I know.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.240]   Thank you.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.240]   So, so Lindsey Graham said, you know, should we should we license and Sam Altman said yes.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:44.240]   So this idea that that's part of what I think we're talking about here is not just the sensible things you're saying and I'm saying, but where it's headed is the reflex was just say, it'll be okay if we license this now then it's pure regulatory capture because then Sam Altman said, well, just for us big guys because I can handle it, right?
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.240]   I do not think we should license companies to explore AI.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.240]   If that's the question you're asking.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.240]   Yes, that's the question.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.240]   I just, that is a silly idea.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:34:03.240]   I understand that the premise of how is it how is that doable to license you license you can create a licensing regime to stop like I can't put up a nuclear power plan if I want.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.240]   You can't be a barber.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.240]   All right.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.240]   Well, it depends.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.240]   Now, however, get a gun and kill lots of that.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.240]   Yeah, but you can't make an algorithm.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:22.240]   It can't be a barber, but you could also be someone that sells fruit on the side of the street in front of a business that had to go through all of their little regulation.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.240]   It's true.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.240]   But I mean, if this is the same premise.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:33.240]   If Queen Pruitt wants to be an esthetician, she's going to have to go to the state board and pass exams and take classes, pay a lot of fees.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:39.240]   That, by the way, that is another form of regulatory capture because that keeps the number of estheticians low.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.240]   Right.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:55.240]   And actually, that's something Shoshana Weisman, who's a regular on some of our shows, is very involved in is this whole idea of licensing that really ends up just being, you know, keeping everybody out so we can keep our salaries high.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.240]   Hey, you know what, I introduce Shoshana to the network.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.240]   She has much to shine.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.240]   She has much to shine.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.240]   Well, she goes on a big show.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.240]   She's been in the past on the big show.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.240]   She's too big for you.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.240]   She's passed you, sir.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:11.240]   You know what?
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.240]   Somebody's taken time off the next couple of weeks.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.240]   I can't remember if it's you or Stacy.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.240]   Yes, we can get Shoshana on.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   I think we have a list of people.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.240]   We're trying to get Chris Messina, who said he would be on.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:26.240]   We're hoping we can get him on the inventor of the hashtag.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:34.240]   And one of the people who was a real stalwart at Twitter, who just recently said goodbye to Twitter.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.240]   He did work for you.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.800]   Oh, Chris Messina is also an actor.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.440]   This is why I get different Chris Messina.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.440]   Different Chris Messina.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.440]   Yes.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.440]   But Chris is a great guy.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.800]   I've been a fan for a long, long time.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:51.240]   Not the guy, not Danny Castellano in the Mindy Project, not Dad.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.240]   Dad Chris Messina.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:57.240]   He's in the new Air Jordan movie, the Ben Catholic movie.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.240]   Air.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.960]   I saw somebody on Twitter today said they had deleted all of their tweets and all of this
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:08.240]   and all of that that evidently Twitter brought back some hosting site they weren't using
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.600]   and they were all back.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.880]   Twitter has so many bugs in the software.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.840]   Oh, you can't delete anything.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.560]   Yeah, you can't delete it or then you don't have any choice or then you get it all deleted
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.960]   or you just don't know what's it's kind of you never know from day to day what you're
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   going to get.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.960]   Oh, boy.
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.320]   The latest thing is they said they're going to delete people who have not posted in a
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.320]   certain amount of time.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.320]   So I'm watching.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.320]   It's scary for dead people being taken over and listening.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.320]   This is a Google story.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.360]   Let's take a break because this is a Google story I want to talk about because Google
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.760]   has announced something similar.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.160]   And there's some real concern about that, but we'll get to that in a moment.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.560]   I will argue for it.
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.560]   Okay.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.560]   Oh boy.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.080]   Then I'll argue against it just because that's what makes a show and I will put on a striped
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.160]   shirt and encourage you both to fight.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:57.240]   But first, we're heard from our sponsors, the AWS Insiders podcast.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:02.240]   Have you heard this?
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.240]   It's great.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.240]   Fast-paced, entertaining, insightful look behind the scenes of Amazon Web Services and
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.240]   cloud computing in general.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.680]   AWS is the dominant platform for cloud.
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.040]   And I imagine there's so much to talk about.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:13.040]   We're not.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.640]   This is not your typical tech podcast.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.000]   Not like us.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.680]   High production value, high energy, high entertainment and full of anecdotes and stories from the
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.360]   early days of AWS to today.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.920]   The hosts, of course, Rahul Subramanianam is great.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.640]   Subra Maniyam is great.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.360]   Hillary Doyle, but I'll call him Rahul, if you don't mind.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:39.800]   Rahul and Hillary dig into the current state in the future of AWS by talking with the people
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.120]   and companies that know it best.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.160]   Rahul has been an AWS pro for over 15 years.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:50.760]   He's managed more than, get this, 45,000 AWS instances.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.440]   He doesn't work at Amazon, but he works with Amazon.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:38:00.680]   He's known for pushing AWS products to their limits and for believing AWS is literally the
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.520]   operating system of the future.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:07.280]   So he's a great guy to hear and listen to because he's got the vision for what AWS could
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.280]   become.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.440]   AWS Insiders is not just one-sided though.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:16.600]   It's full of opinions, takeaways, untold stories about the challenges and innovations
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:21.240]   and the mind-blowing promise of cloud computing.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.920]   How to avoid the pitfalls of IAC?
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:30.760]   Season two, episode one, you've seen it right there, filling the cloud talent gap.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:37.920]   If you have a company and you're using the cloud, staffing that cloud team is not easy.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:42.920]   Rahul and Hillary discuss ways to find, retain, and level up cloud talent.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.120]   I was very interested in episode three of this most recent season.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:50.040]   They talk about Moderna.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:57.560]   Did you know Moderna, which of course makes one of the two very successful COVID vaccines,
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.120]   Moderna was born in the cloud in 2010.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:03.840]   AWS was brand new, about four years old.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:10.600]   And it's one of the kind of secret recipes Moderna had to become a premier biotech company.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.280]   It's episode three of the new season Moderna.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.640]   Highly recommend it.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:19.840]   If you're interested in the cloud, you've got to look for AWS Insiders in your podcast
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.240]   player.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:28.960]   You can also just go right to the web cloudfix.oria.com cloudfix.oria.com/podcast.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:35.400]   We'll put a link to it in the show notes at twitter.tv/twig.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:43.600]   But you know, the easiest thing to do, get your podcast client and look for AWS Insiders.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.640]   I don't give a lift and shift.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.840]   That's one of the great episodes.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:56.480]   Cloudfix.oria.com/podcast or search for AWS Insiders in your favorite podcast player.
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.880]   And we thank them so much for supporting our podcast.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.880]   I like that.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.880]   Thank you.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.880]   Thank you.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.360]   I like doing ads for podcasts.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.600]   I like growing the podcast club.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.000]   All right.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.720]   I am it's time for a blood sacrifice in the words of Logan Roy.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:19.160]   I will put on my striped shirt.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:25.200]   And in this corner, weighing in at 110, it's Stacy Higginbotham and the red trunks and the
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.160]   red hair.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.480]   On that corner, it's a professor of journalism.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.840]   You know what that means.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:34.640]   And now I forgot completely what you're going to debate.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.720]   Oh, I can do this story first.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.080]   So Google announced and it doesn't matter.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.440]   It will just just obey.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.760]   Well, you just debate fight over fight.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:51.240]   I think this scared me when they said it that they are going to start deleting accounts
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:57.160]   of that aren't active, kind of like two years Twitter said.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.040]   But then what's now so at first people go, not YouTube.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.560]   What about all those great YouTube videos that were posted once and that nobody's still
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.560]   doing it.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:11.360]   And then I know that our friend, the creator liaison at YouTube, Mr. Renee Richie said,
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.280]   no, no, don't worry.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.080]   We're not talking about YouTube.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.080]   Oh, okay.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.480]   Are you sure?
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:24.800]   I'm going to presume Renee has the insight about Gmail, but they will be Gmail.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.800]   It will be.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   I don't care about Gmail.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.400]   I care about the public square and I'm more concerned about blogger sites.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:36.880]   Because aren't there sites that have been inactive for years that are still but important
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.880]   historically?
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.840]   Aren't they not on an internet archive?
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.840]   At this point.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:45.840]   Yeah, but we shouldn't have to rely on internet archives to preserve our history.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:50.480]   And it would be dead links and internet archives incomplete.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.480]   So if only, but afraid not.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:42:00.320]   The great Google account purge starts December 2023.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.800]   It will slowly happen.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:09.000]   But you know, for instance, if you've been inactive for two years and you're already over
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.760]   that mark, your cat's not going to be deleted immediately.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.880]   You'll get, well, Google says you'll get lots of warning.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.840]   Don't don't worry about that.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.680]   I can understand Gmail that I guess.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:26.800]   Why should Google hold onto accounts that were created by mistake?
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.720]   Someone created an account and forget the password within an hour.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.640]   So they go and create a new account.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.440]   Yeah, no, I understand that.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:37.960]   Or not to mention the buyout accounts that were automatically generated.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.760]   And they say if you want to, if you have an account, you want to keep it active.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.160]   Just sign in once every two years.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.160]   That's not a lot.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.160]   That's not a lot.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.640]   But that's enough to say I'm here and the lights on.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.160]   You go ahead and defend it too.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:53.120]   OK, the internet is not free.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.280]   There are resources and energy devoted to all of this stuff.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.680]   And if you're not using it, you should get rid of it.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:03.800]   Now, the best way to do this is to provide the warning that Google says it's going to
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.800]   provide.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.800]   So, yay.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:11.280]   Two, it should also, I think this would be an awesome time to either Google makes a
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.320]   big donation to like the Wayback Machine or the Internet Archive.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:22.200]   Or we actually talk about creating some sort of publicly funded or company funded infrastructure
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.760]   for things of value, for the public.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.440]   Maybe library of Congress, right?
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.440]   Maybe that's what.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.760]   Yeah, I mean, our tweets are there, right?
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.800]   So we should like, yeah, well, I mean, but that's the thing.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.880]   We think the internet is free and it's cheap.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.080]   It's way cheaper than paper, but it's not free.
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:42.080]   So, and then if you think about the environmental costs of saving all of this stuff on these
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:45.160]   servers and even YouTube, y'all, I know that there's a,
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:49.920]   billion, like, I don't know how many hours they'll tell you how many, like more hours
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.120]   than one person could ever watch.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.040]   And I don't think it's wrong of them to get rid of it, especially if they try to do it
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.400]   in a responsible manner that's, you know, let you know.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:03.720]   I don't know how responsible it's going to be because the blog post said, quote, "If
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:07.120]   a Google account has not been used or signed into for at least two years, we may delete
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:12.480]   the account and its contents, including content from Google workspace, Gmail Docs, Drive,
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:19.560]   Meet Calendar, YouTube, and Google Photos, to which, of course, a lot of people who said,
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:23.200]   there's, you know, one of my favorite things is five years old on YouTube.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.760]   There's a lot of tech TV stuff that somebody posted.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.720]   They're long gone, but that stuff's there.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:33.000]   I understand Stacey, you know, it's a shame that Google has to pay the freight to keep
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   that up there, but that was kind of the deal they made.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   It's a responsibility.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.280]   And any event, Google then back down.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.600]   This is why I'm not sure I trust them because then they said, "Wait a minute.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.760]   No, not YouTube."
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.760]   It says YouTube.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.760]   This is a dialogue.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:54.680]   They also, when they originally posted it, they also said that it wasn't good that it
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:58.040]   would be discretionary or they would look at things.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:02.800]   So not going to be what I saw as it mentioned, something about videos having potential historical
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:03.800]   value, not just cat.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.800]   How are they going to judge that?
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:11.560]   But you know what, if you want your five years of tech TV, Leo, host it yourself and stick
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.920]   a link on the internet.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.880]   Well, let me, let me, let me try to argue now, man.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:18.240]   Well, first of all, I don't have access to it.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:23.320]   So that is in fact the only place that that exists outside of NBC's vaults and they won't
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.320]   let us access it.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.320]   We tried very hard.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.320]   Oh.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.080]   So that is the only place that exists.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.200]   Well, NBC uses their two accounts.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   So it ain't going anywhere.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.200]   This is a good reason to talk about changes.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.960]   It's not official NBC accounts.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:42.880]   It's just somebody who VHS did and has put their VHS tape on YouTube and literally recorded
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.600]   their screen with the camera.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.600]   Well, yeah.
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.600]   Can I argue?
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.600]   Okay.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.600]   I was, can I just make one?
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:51.600]   Give me more.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.600]   Are you with?
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:53.600]   That's fine.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.600]   Yes.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:58.480]   We have lost billions of records over the last millennia.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:02.160]   I mean, if we even just look at books that are out of print, yeah, it's sad.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.160]   So sad.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.480]   But it's gone and we keep making stuff.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.480]   I'm not a central point.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.880]   Nobody expects a publisher to keep a book in print.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:10.880]   That's a good point.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.880]   That's a very bad reason.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.880]   So don't want to.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:17.920]   But one thing the publisher doesn't do is then burn the existing copies of the books.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:18.920]   They don't make new ones.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:19.920]   That's what happens.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.680]   That's why the internet's so cheap, y'all.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:26.080]   I mean, this is, this is, this is what defines the internet.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:30.600]   Take, take, take, take, all in our, in our Discord says, how the hell is Elizabeth Holmes
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.840]   going to prevent her Gmail account from being deleted?
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.840]   She's going to go to jail for 15 years.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:35.840]   What is she going to get?
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.120]   She can tell someone to log in for her.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.480]   They'll have a conversation.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.000]   We'll give you a few scenarios.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.320]   Let me give you a few scenarios here, right?
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:47.840]   One is include Twitter in this, right?
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.520]   What is impersonation of a, of a dead person, right?
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:55.280]   Or someone who's well, for instance, if Twitter kills my account, there's nothing to stop
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.520]   somebody else from being Leo LaPorte on Twitter.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.520]   Exactly.
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:59.520]   So that's the first problem.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.520]   So log in every two years.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:01.520]   Where are you?
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.520]   No, you're dead.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:03.520]   I can't.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.520]   You're dead.
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:05.520]   You don't get your name.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.440]   Let me, what if Leo, what if there's another Leo LaPorte?
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.440]   I don't know.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.440]   Too bad.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.440]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.440]   And they want me.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:17.760]   There is, there is a whole linkage to a Leo LaPorte that says that's a Leo LaPorte.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.440]   That's Leo LaPorte we know.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.840]   And Leo may rest in peace.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.600]   Was a wonderful guy, sometimes grumpy, but we liked it.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.600]   Sometimes.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:31.080]   And now along comes Jason Calicana's acting like he's Leo LaPorte, which is probably what
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.080]   happened.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.480]   And so there's impersonation publicly.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.480]   That's one.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.640]   Two, there's a business problem.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.120]   I'll use my father because he never had a Google account.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:44.480]   So DV Jarvis, may rest in peace is gone now.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.560]   Well, people know that because there's no bits and stuff out there.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:51.760]   And they know they can grab that email address that exists in a Gmail and then they can go
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:55.360]   around to banks and all kinds of places and say, oh yeah, yeah, I'm DB Jarvis.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:00.000]   That's where the password recovery is, is that the account and DB Jarvis is Gmail.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Send it to DV Jarvis.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.920]   So you can recover all kinds of stuff from people who aren't going to know that they're
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.160]   dead or whatever.
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.360]   There's a business problem.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:13.240]   And three is your right Stacey about the expense, but you have an obligation when you
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:20.120]   say we're going to be this repository of culture, then you didn't make clear at the
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.120]   very beginning.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.840]   Well, but only for two years.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.520]   And then it's gone.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:28.080]   Then it's the problem of Google in general is what can you trust?
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.760]   Now you're right that culture is not everything.
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.880]   Roberto Echo says the culture is what we choose not to forget.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.600]   So I agree with that.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:41.680]   But there was a compact that occurred in the early days of all of these platforms that
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.680]   said, no longer.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.840]   I mean, you're going to be there forever.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.320]   WordPress, YouTube.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:50.720]   And I guess that's the real question.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:57.440]   Is there a implicit promise of eternal representation on the net?
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.720]   So I don't think there is really.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:02.760]   I mean, you lose tech TV.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.440]   What do we lose as a culture?
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:09.000]   If if people do want it, but there's no way to save it.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   That's too bad.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   Life is on.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   I love it.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   I love this.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   I love this.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:20.720]   And the other thing to note is if you see what's happening right now, Google announced
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.520]   this and already they're like, uh, not YouTube.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.200]   If that's the case, they're renegotiating the compact.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:31.200]   Look at it.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.600]   To me, this feels like, yeah, I mean, you all do stupid things when you're young.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   Maybe you promise something like, like you'll tell your brother, like, man, if you ever
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.000]   need a kid, and you all give it to you, man, because I love you.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   And then maybe your brother, like cheats on your wife or some or cheats with your wife.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   Rose is going stacy.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.480]   No, I actually think Stacy.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.920]   You can't be held responsible.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.000]   I'm going to adjudicate your favorite.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   Life changes.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.120]   I'm going to adjudicate your favor.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:03.880]   And what happens in pre-internet world is if something is valued by the culture, like
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.320]   Shakespeare, the culture preserves it.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.320]   Yep.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.520]   Uh, but they're, but you're absolutely right, Stacy.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.720]   Think of all of the things that we have lost.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:17.280]   Now would I have preferred that the library of Alexandria did not get burned to the ground?
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.280]   Yes.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.760]   Yeah, we all probably would have.
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.360]   So it knows what we lost there.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:28.400]   The thing is this is the library of Alexandria and Google's about to light the match.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.760]   Um, that I don't agree with.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:36.000]   The truth is, you want to write Alexandria is that every, I forget how many years papyrus
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.400]   would have disintegrated.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:42.240]   You would have had to put the investment into rewriting things and copying the scrolls.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.240]   Otherwise, otherwise, it was not.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.600]   Oh, so it's actually very analogous.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.600]   That effort is enough.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.800]   So the money that Google pays to keep the servers going.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.000]   So, maybe, maybe in the Gutenberg parentheses.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   Is it?
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   Oh, nice.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.440]   One thing that's kind of interesting lately, scientists, they've recovered a huge number
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:03.920]   of papyrus from Pompeii after the eruption.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.480]   You can't obviously unroll it.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:12.560]   Scientists are using technology to scan these papyrus and then using AI to reassemble the
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.560]   texts.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.360]   That was so Yale of him to use the whole papyrus.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.920]   I think we don't agree.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:18.920]   We don't have papyrus.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:20.920]   Very good.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:21.920]   Very good.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:27.320]   People of Pompeii.
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.600]   So yeah, so I thought that was kind of interesting.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.600]   So you're right, Jeff.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:34.840]   But I mean, there is a loss to the culture.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.360]   Another example that's gone is a shame.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.880]   Well, let's not use tech TV because it isn't.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:43.280]   But I want to see my dev doll.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:49.400]   I'll give you an example that's kind of related, which is video games.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:52:00.800]   These are artistic creations that if it can't really be played once the last N64 crumbles
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.040]   into dust.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:05.160]   And there is an effort to preserve these.
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:10.480]   Sometimes an effort that is thwarted by the copyright holders of all things.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:17.120]   But I think we do want to preserve, we want to preserve even the fact that it's digital.
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:21.200]   If the Mona Lisa were a digital creation, we would want to have saved that, right?
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:25.080]   Just because it's oil doesn't make it somehow better than a digital creation.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.080]   Yes.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:30.520]   So I think there are two things that could like this is a good converse.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:34.400]   It's like a good point in time to say, oh my God, the internet doesn't work quite like
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.800]   we thought, right?
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:36.880]   It's not.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:41.920]   It's not this permanent record of infinite cheap access.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:48.840]   And then also, there's value in preserving this access that is protected under laws that
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:52.040]   really protected things that were physical in paper.
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.800]   So then two things we should take away.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.840]   One, maybe we should create some sort of digital library of Congress or funding for something
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:02.040]   that keeps us able to capture that we.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:05.600]   And then two, what about our copyright laws?
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.160]   Let's say we want to put something in this library.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.000]   Can we rework copyright?
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.680]   Well, that's Google books, right?
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.600]   Stacey, that's exactly the one challenge that.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:18.080]   And that's a little bit of a book, but that's not video games.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:19.080]   So that's not.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.080]   That's right.
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:22.760]   That's what Bruce C. Cale is doing at the Internet Archive.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:27.360]   In fact, he's archived those video games and creating emulators so that you can play them
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.760]   after the N64 is wrong.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.920]   He didn't get a little bit of trouble for that, didn't he?
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:36.480]   Of course, that was over lending those books, scanning books and letting them out.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:41.760]   You want to see an analog for this?
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.840]   This is the universal short title catalog.
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:44.840]   I'll repeat that.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.840]   They always use the USTC.AC.UK.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.800]   Andrew Pettigree, who's a brilliant historian of books, established this and it catalogs
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:57.000]   everything known that was printed, everything, whether it still exists or not, between Gutenberg
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   and 1700.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.360]   You search on something in the catalog.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.360]   Wow.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:06.800]   If it exists in a digital form, you can click on it and look at it.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:11.280]   But even if it doesn't exist, the fact that it existed is interesting.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:16.480]   And what Pettigree says is that it's the things that we used most that we didn't value.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:19.480]   It's the books that we didn't care about that we left on the shelf that nobody took out
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:20.480]   that didn't get ruined.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:26.080]   The things that we used every day and cared about and mattered in our lives got destroyed
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.960]   through use.
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.960]   The weird things about this is the things that you can't find are the things that matter
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:32.960]   most of the time.
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:36.680]   And you have some standing because I know you're a professor of journalism, but really
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.200]   you're a historian at this point.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:44.240]   And these original documents are the first draft of history.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.680]   You need this stuff, right?
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:46.680]   Absolutely.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.240]   It's fascinating, fascinating stuff.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.320]   You also look through one of the things I love doing this and I recommend this in the
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:57.600]   Gutenberg parenthesis on sale soon, is that you look through and you see the progression
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.440]   of print, right?
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:04.720]   And in the 1400s there were no indexes or title pages or page numbers and so on.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:10.600]   And you see it, you lost its color, it gained its standardization, the fonts changed.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.760]   You see something that occurs.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:17.680]   And there was little talk, Pettigree also has a book out called The Library of Fragile
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:22.840]   History, where the aim wasn't to preserve.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:29.520]   So what I want, Stacey, is just as we had Ephesus before, I want librarians to be part of this
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:30.520]   discussion at Google.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:34.280]   Yeah, and I think librarians are museum curators.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.440]   I mean, all of these...
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:39.560]   I've been to dozens of museum exhibits that are all digital.
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:44.960]   And so curators are already thinking about how to preserve things over time and as digital
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:48.760]   formats fail and protocols die, blah, blah, blah.
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:53.400]   So I mean, again, I feel sad.
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:55.200]   I don't think this is Google's...
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:59.000]   It's totally right that Google said, "Oh, I'm going to start deleting stuff."
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.480]   So I think it's sad, we'll do stuff.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:07.760]   Ruth Porat got a hold of the bill for the server and said, "We'll wait a minute here."
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:14.440]   But why would you trust a private or a site to public company with your cultural assets?
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:22.160]   I'm not sure about the infrastructure side of it, but what about accounts that are used
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.960]   just for forwarding emails?
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:26.320]   I saw someone in our Discord talking about it.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:31.120]   I had an old Google account that they would dump stuff in it to forward to their personal
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.640]   email, based on some type of filtered disaster.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:43.200]   Well, Patrick Delahandie's dad, who was a federal prosecutor, I think he was Massachusetts...
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.800]   I don't know, Patrick, you'll have to film me in.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.120]   But he passed away a couple of years ago.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.680]   Patrick says he's been keeping main US attorney.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:50.680]   Thank you.
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:56.280]   He's been keeping his Gmail account alive for the last two years.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.280]   That's historic.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.280]   Mm-hmm.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.280]   Well, you're right.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.280]   You're right.
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:04.280]   It's also an email that a lot of people would want access to.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.280]   Right.
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:10.560]   The right thing to do would be to have some sort of...
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:13.720]   Maybe Craig Newmark has said a saving pigeons.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:17.600]   Cajons of journalism, gosh, man.
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.960]   It could save me plenty expensive.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:20.960]   Yeah, no.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:23.440]   I think it's probably something a government should do.
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:26.000]   Libraries, it's amazing we have libraries.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.040]   What a great contribution to our public wheel libraries have been.
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.040]   Thanks, Ben Franklin.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.040]   Thanks, Ben.
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:39.920]   And thank you to all those states and local governments and federal governments who financed
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:41.040]   this because...
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.480]   And taxpayers ultimately who financed this.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:44.640]   Because Florida kills them.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.640]   Yes.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.560]   Yeah, but we decided that this was something important.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:49.560]   And that's...
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:53.680]   I think what we need to extend the concept of library to digital goods, I guess.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.480]   I mean, we already have a structure for that.
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:57.480]   Well, we asked...
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.440]   Stacy would say we need a discussion.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:04.560]   We need a discussion about what's important to save and what the ethic of saving is.
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:07.160]   What does it say to future historians, to our children?
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.720]   Well, and this is problematic because...
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:11.240]   As long as discussion never because no one's going to agree.
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:15.540]   Yeah, if you were alive at the time of Shakespeare, would you say, "Oh, no, that Christopher
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:18.680]   Marlowe, let's save all his stuff, but Shakespeare...
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:19.680]   He sucks."
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:22.080]   And we don't know what we're missing.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.080]   We don't know.
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.080]   That's the other thing.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:25.080]   We don't know what the good stuff is.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.040]   Well, interesting Leo about that.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:30.560]   So it's now the 400th anniversary of the first folio of Shakespeare.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:34.920]   What happened was there were a bunch of really crappy editions of Shakespeare.
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:39.880]   There's really funny speeches that were an awful printings of it.
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:45.160]   And it was after he died, it was friends of his from the stage who said, "We must preserve
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.840]   the true Shakespeare."
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:49.600]   And that's why they printed the first folio.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:50.600]   Interesting.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:51.600]   So there was...
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:52.600]   There's two...
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.480]   The Gutenberg brothers on sale.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:57.600]   Yeah, they curated it basically.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:58.600]   Yes.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:58:59.600]   Yeah, they...
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.600]   But contemporary...
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:01.600]   The point is...
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.520]   It's the function two to fix the good stuff.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.280]   The point is contemporaneously people recognized his value.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.920]   And that's probably why we have it today.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.600]   But maybe there was also another guy...
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:11.600]   Oh, there was.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.600]   That wasn't recognized.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:17.280]   Sir Vontis wrote 40 plays.
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.720]   He considers himself first...
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.600]   Consider himself first to playwright.
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.240]   And most of that is all lost.
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.240]   We know him for Don Quixante.
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.240]   But...
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.240]   Is it so?
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.240]   We don't know where his plays are.
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.240]   But he didn't.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:30.240]   Well, those Euripides Euripidean plays.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.240]   The plays by Euripides.
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:32.240]   It's dastly.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.240]   I don't know how to say it.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.240]   He's pronounced...
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.240]   Popiry.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:39.560]   But yeah, there's tons of stuff we've lost.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:40.560]   Like all of...
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:43.640]   There are no intact saffo poems out there.
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.560]   But we're all like, "Yeah, yeah, she was amazing.
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:46.560]   Great poet."
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:47.560]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.560]   I didn't know that.
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.560]   We talk about saffo all the time.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.800]   None of her poems survive.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:51.800]   Thank you.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:52.800]   Well, I do.
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:53.800]   There's fragments of it.
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:54.800]   I'm like a good smacking.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:55.800]   Okay.
[00:59:55.800 --> 01:00:00.040]   No, I didn't have no idea that the poetry does not survive.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.840]   Fragments of...
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.840]   It's fragments of things.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:03.840]   The reputation...
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:04.840]   The people have reported it.
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:05.840]   Exactly.
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.200]   Her reputation is from the other people talking about it.
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:13.840]   Let me quote, if I may, from the bad quarto of Hamlet, the speech you all know.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.480]   To be or not to be, there's the point.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.480]   Ah!
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.240]   No, to sleep, to dream.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.160]   I marry, there it goes.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:27.640]   In that dream of death, when we awake and born before an everlasting judge, from whence
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:31.360]   no passenger ever returned, the undisturbed country, that's like...
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.520]   Who's sight, the happy smile, and the accursed dance?
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:39.080]   That's like some guy who went to the play, and then somebody said, "What are you saying?"
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.520]   No, it sounded like this.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.520]   Something like this.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.520]   A fear not to be.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.680]   That's the point I'm trying to be.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.680]   That's the point.
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.400]   To be or not to be, that is the question.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:51.680]   Whether it is nobler in the mind, it's suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.000]   Very different.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.240]   And it doesn't even mean the same thing, which is his style.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.240]   No, it doesn't.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.240]   Exactly.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.240]   That's the point.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.120]   Maybe the guy who was playing Hamlet that time, he forgot his accent.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.560]   Maybe he didn't know his accent.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.560]   This is a great conversation.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:12.000]   And maybe I really think this is the kind of thing this Google announcement should stimulate,
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.520]   which is, "Okay, fine.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.520]   You're right.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.600]   It's not Google's job to maintain all this, but culturally we want to.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.040]   What should we do?"
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.960]   And I wish members of Congress would think about stuff like this.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:22.960]   It won't.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.080]   Yeah, it won't.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.080]   This is why you have a private statement.
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.120]   I also want to give, right credit is the quote I mentioned before.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.200]   So it's Jean Philippe de Tonac in a wonderful book.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.120]   So one thing is certainly said, what we call culture is in fact a lengthy process of selection
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.920]   and filtering.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:44.640]   Now more than ever, we realize that culture is made up of what remains after everything
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.280]   else has been forgotten, which is a wonderful quote.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:52.480]   So, but the choice of what to remember is ours.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.880]   What do we do?
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:56.880]   What are we going to do?
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:57.880]   That's not the conversation.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:58.880]   What are we going to do?
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.280]   Oh, I should let you know, by the way, there are actual Sapho poems that exist in fullness,
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.680]   but not very many.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:07.720]   And most of what we see are fragments.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:13.640]   So I think that's not at all uncommon in the ancient world that we don't know, well,
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.520]   Aristotle, right?
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.720]   We only know, or is it Socrates?
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:18.720]   One of them.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:19.720]   I know, it's what it's called.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.720]   How about the Bible?
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:21.720]   You want to use the Bible?
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.600]   Well, the Bible we got, right?
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:29.160]   Well, it's translations on translations on scroll.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:33.880]   I mean, well, actually finish making your point and I'll see if that works.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:40.480]   Well, I think there's a lot of people of the ancient world that we only know of by
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.480]   reputation.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.280]   Is that correct?
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:54.160]   This is far too much Google for a show called this weekend Google.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.000]   I know we should talk about Twitter.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.200]   Let's talk about Elon actually have other stories.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:03.200]   I have other stories.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.760]   There's breaking TikTok news.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:12.320]   This just in the governor of Montana has signed into law the TikTok ban and it's spris.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:19.360]   So now saying, whoo, now we know, take your finger off the button, whoever.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.480]   I don't have any audio.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.480]   There we go.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.200]   Thank you.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.200]   The ear people wanted me to hear.
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:33.600]   So Montana is now officially the first state to ban TikTok.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.600]   Why?
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:41.120]   Governor Greg Jen 40 signed the bill, Senate bill 419 into law today.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:45.000]   We have some time to go into effect until January 1st.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   He signed the bill.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:52.840]   He said to quote protect Montana's person, private and sensitive information from being
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.400]   gathered by China.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.480]   That's that's China.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:01.760]   That's a Chinese Communist Party using TikTok to spy on Americans, violate their privacy
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.080]   and collect the personal private and sensitive information as well documented.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.080]   Okay.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.080]   Sure.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.080]   I can't say this.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.080]   Not true.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:13.120]   I don't know if they're going to be in the election.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.320]   I don't know if they're going to be in the election.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.320]   It's not going to be in the election.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.280]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.080]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.080]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.080]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.080]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:25.080]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.080]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.080]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.080]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.080]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.080]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.080]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.080]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.080]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.080]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.080]   It's going to be in the election.
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.880]   $10,000 a day for each day.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:40.080]   The violation continues.
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:45.080]   I guess it's Apple and Google will have to drop TikTok from the App Store in Montana.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.080]   Right.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:51.080]   So could you download it on your phone if you left it on Tana?
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.080]   When you came back, you could run it?
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.080]   Yes.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:58.480]   Otherwise, they'll have to go to every Internet service provider, mobile phone carrier in
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.080]   Montana and say you need to block TikTok.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.080]   It's not going to happen.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:12.480]   I mean, I understand there was a recent TikTok story that implied TikTok was collecting
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.080]   more information than we had thought.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.080]   Right.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.080]   I saw that.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.080]   Or that the company had more access to it than we thought was going to have more of the
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.080]   story.
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.080]   Right.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.080]   And was happy to hand it over.
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.080]   So.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.080]   Sorry.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:32.080]   So I kind of understand I'm kind of sympathetic.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:38.200]   I would much prefer to see legislation against data brokers like Kachava, which just recently
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:44.920]   got away with tracking your location because the judge said, "Well, it's the harm in that."
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:48.080]   So the FTC can come back and make a stronger case.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.080]   I hope they do.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.080]   It's unlikely too.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.080]   But they could.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.080]   The judge said you haven't proven harm.
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.080]   Right.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:57.640]   Substantial injury is what the judge said you haven't proven.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:02.040]   And if you come back to me and can show that, well, I'll reconsider, but yeah, we'll see.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:07.320]   So we need someone who gets arrested because they were near an abortion provider or a
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:13.000]   women's health care provider and or someone who was beaten up by a stalker after their
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.480]   stalker purchased data from a data broker.
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:21.240]   Now, the Wall Street Journal says TikTok banned sign in Montana paving the way for First
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.120]   Amendment legal battle.
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:27.160]   And I guess that's the question is who suits?
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.800]   Does TikTok sue?
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:32.200]   I think the TikTok has some creators to sue.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.200]   Creators would be the right one.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.200]   Right.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:39.520]   If Henry, if you want to sue Montana, I'll wear a hat and and a wave of flag.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.320]   Yeah, but that's the thing with TikTok.
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.240]   TikTok has the data on the biggest TikTok.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:47.520]   The people from Montana who have the greatest TikTok following.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.080]   Those are the people if you're TikTok you reach out to.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.840]   Yeah, you already got it.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.280]   That's good.
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.280]   Use that evil.
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.480]   You already got it to protect yourself.
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:03.760]   But would it matter if someone outside of Montana lobbies against this?
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:08.760]   Well, the governor was lobbying to broaden it to your point, Ant, so that it would apply
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:14.400]   to all social media apps that provide data to foreign adversaries.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:19.720]   I mean, you can I mean, you can Google the top TikTok influencers from Montana.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.720]   Oh, just Google it.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.720]   Google it.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:28.520]   Montana Tucker has 6.9 million followers at Montana and Ryan.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.520]   That's probably a lady.
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.440]   But is Montana Tucker saying anything about this?
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:39.640]   Oh, Montana Tucker might be a lady's name because do people named Montana exist?
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.960]   Oh, she may not be from Montana is what you're saying.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:45.960]   Let me see.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:46.960]   TikTok can tell you who those people are.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:48.960]   TikTok knows.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.800]   Let's see.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.480]   Here's Montana Tucker.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:56.400]   Senior dancer, actress, I think that's her real name.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.880]   Montana Jordan, Montana Coles, French Montana.
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:07.640]   Oh, here's the visit Montana account for it's got a hundred thousand followers.
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:09.960]   Guess you'd be shutting that down.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.920]   That's the great, great gifts there.
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:12.920]   The third one.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:13.920]   I want to see what that looks like.
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.920]   That was really good.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:17.160]   Locally loved gifts in Montana.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.440]   Let's turn on the sound.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.400]   Back if he just.
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.400]   That's the perfect place for holiday shopping.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.640]   I hate that voice.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:24.640]   Me too.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.640]   And fresh espresso.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.200]   Oh, it's a cloth.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:31.440]   They have lots of fun gifts for the whole family.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.000]   I'm not going to Montana.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.520]   It's so boring.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.800]   How about you great, great gifts?
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:44.240]   Great, great gifts is not the most enticing of names.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.040]   How about Huckleberry Bear Claws?
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.440]   You got to try those.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.440]   Oh.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.520]   Paul Bridge Mercantile.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.880]   You had me at Fried Fred.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.880]   Famous for it's Huckleberry Bear Claws.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.120]   Sorry Paul Bridge.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.680]   No more promotion for you on the old TikTok.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.680]   They should sue.
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:01.680]   They should sue.
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:02.680]   I mean, yeah.
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.680]   I want those.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:04.680]   Well, that looks very dry.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.680]   Have you tried them?
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.680]   That's like a gigantic Rugola.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:08.680]   It's a giant Rugola.
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:09.840]   It's a American sized Rugola.
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:14.680]   Yeah, you figure like you New York types would call it a Rugola.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:17.280]   Yeah, this is kind of sad.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:20.520]   I, you know, know what to make this.
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.680]   My son, I'm going to have breakfast with him tomorrow.
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:23.920]   I'll ask him how he feels about it.
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:27.440]   But I don't think he really, he's not focused anymore on TikTok.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:31.440]   I don't think I think it's to another places in his book.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:32.440]   In his book.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:35.240]   In fact, his latest is burnt potato chips.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:40.440]   Seems like he's given up on the whole premise of cooking.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:43.480]   Actually, a little lobster.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.680]   The lobster.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.680]   Oh God.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.680]   Henry.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:47.680]   Oh, your son.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.680]   Henry.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:53.680]   Oh, is he making a lobster sandwich with kettle crisps?
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.680]   Oh, see, yeah, he crisped an extra crispy.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:58.680]   Three sticks of butter.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.680]   I don't like that.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:00.680]   That's it.
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:01.680]   I don't like that.
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.680]   Three sticks of butter with his lobster.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.680]   Oh, yep, it is a lobster roll.
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.680]   That's what I have for Mother's Day.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.440]   Oh, I love lobster rolls.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.120]   You put crunchy chips on.
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.080]   Oh, no, you need chives.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.680]   Not shallot, Henry.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.680]   You lost me at shallots.
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:23.960]   2.3 million followers on TikTok, all of whom.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:24.960]   I wonder what percentage.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.680]   It'll be funny to find out, like, well, how many Montana followers?
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.760]   Like, if you have 100,000, that's a loss.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.760]   I don't know.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:37.760]   I'll ask him how he feels.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.760]   My guess is he can say, what do you mean I don't care?
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:40.760]   He's gonna like work with the man.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:41.760]   Who cares?
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:42.760]   What band?
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.240]   Yeah, how many people live in Montana anyway?
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.280]   Montana, if it's California, maybe.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.960]   Probably more than more Texas.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:50.960]   More than Wyoming.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.960]   Weird document.
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:52.960]   Amazon in the more.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:53.960]   1.1 million.
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:54.960]   Okay.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:55.960]   That's not insignificant.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.960]   That's almost as many.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.960]   Oh, he says many is living Wyoming.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:10:59.960]   Right.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:00.960]   How many?
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.800]   1.1 million as of 2021.
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.200]   Wyoming only has like half a million.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.760]   Wyoming has like half a million half of that.
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:11.760]   Half a million half of that.
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.760]   Half of the state.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.760]   Wow.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:19.560]   Um, Amazon launched new devices this morning.
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.560]   What?
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.560]   What?
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:22.560]   Yeah, they don't care.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.560]   They're silly.
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.560]   You're Stacy.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.560]   I thought you would.
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:26.560]   I put this in because I thought you would.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.560]   This echo.
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.520]   This echo is Stacy bait.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:35.320]   This echo pop for $40 is an Euro beacon as well as everything else.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.320]   That's kind of cool.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.400]   You know, I turned on the Euro beacon.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.960]   I have been very dissatisfied.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:45.040]   So Amazon has a service that lets you turn certain echo devices.
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.320]   If you have Euro routers in your home, it adds that as another Euro router.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.320]   This is one of them.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.320]   The new echo pop.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.800]   This could be one.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.040]   I turned mine on.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.480]   It is literally next door.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:57.720]   Like I have an Euro right behind me.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:01.960]   And then I have an echo next door.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:02.960]   It never works.
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.920]   It's always like, I can't get a signal.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.920]   This is frustrating.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.560]   And I'm like, never mind you suck.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.960]   That is disappointing.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.120]   These are 40 bucks.
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.120]   It's cheaper.
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:12.120]   They're cute colors.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.360]   If you want it, go ahead.
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.680]   They just look like speakers.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.200]   That's the funny thing.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.200]   The dots were kind of ugly.
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.560]   It looked like hockey bucks.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.360]   These just look like little speakers and they're pretty colors.
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.960]   Well, the dot is now a sphere.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.800]   It's a full-on sphere.
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:26.800]   It looks like a little.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.120]   I kind of like this form factor.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:31.120]   Anyway, they snuck that out.
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.120]   Let's see.
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.120]   What else?
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.120]   What else?
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.120]   Uber.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.120]   Google tablet.
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.680]   The docking station had had that functionality.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:39.680]   You'd be happier.
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:40.680]   I would be.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.680]   You had a speaker on it.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.920]   Amazon can produce this echo.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:47.680]   It's probably, I don't know if it's a loss leader or just even.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.920]   40 for 40 bucks.
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:49.920]   Speaking dollars.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:50.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:56.160]   And Google's charging me $129 for what is essentially a speaker that only works if there's a tablet
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.160]   stuck on it.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.160]   Thanks.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.160]   Mmm.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.760]   Did you order when I ordered one?
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:03.640]   500 bucks, including the dock.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.640]   We'll see.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.640]   I'm getting mine.
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.640]   Soon?
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.640]   Is that when they come?
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.640]   I didn't order it.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.640]   I didn't care.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.640]   Yeah, I know.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:11.640]   I have to.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.640]   It's my job.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.640]   You know, June 21st.
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.000]   When it comes to tablets.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.920]   A week after Father's Day.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:18.920]   When it comes to tablets.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:19.920]   What's your use case?
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:23.720]   Are you a consumption person or productivity person?
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.240]   So I have an iPad mini, which is a really good size.
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:29.880]   Little eight or seven or eight inches.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.760]   That I keep next to my bedside table.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:32.960]   That's my reading consumption.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:33.960]   Okay.
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:34.960]   So that's pure consumption.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:37.240]   Although, you know, sometimes I'll text stuff like that.
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:39.640]   But yeah, pretty much pure consumption.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.840]   And then I have an iPad Pro.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:44.840]   And you know, down the road, that might end up being when you put Final Cut Studio on
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:45.840]   there and yeah.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:46.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:47.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.880]   That comes out May 23rd about a week.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.040]   That may end up being more of a productivity thing, but right now it's basically a FaceTime.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.000]   I used to FaceTime my mom.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.040]   I use it as a second screen with my Mac because you can move the mouse over.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.360]   And so I'll have Discord running there or some other messaging client or whatever.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.680]   And it's kind of there all the time in the background.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:12.600]   It's really a subsidiary device.
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:15.000]   It's not a primary device.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   But that's just me.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.600]   You know, Captain Tofel works on his iPad Pro quite a bit.
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:21.600]   Yeah.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.080]   We have people come in and do the show.
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.000]   Aaron McCracken is going to be on Twitter on Sunday.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   He only brings his.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   He brings it iPad.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   That's what he'll be on.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   That's true.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   He is Chromebooks.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   Hey, oh no.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.840]   Hey, I don't know.
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.960]   At least iPad has a decent CPU in it or chip.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:41.960]   It does.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:42.960]   It has an M1 or an M2.
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:45.480]   I mean, those are pretty dang fancy.
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:52.240]   I did a note that the HP, the pretty HP Chromebook is back in stock.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.400]   I thought I mentioned this to you, Jeff.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.160]   You guys should get it.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.320]   I think HP may is pretty nice ones.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.320]   What's the name of it?
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.320]   Maybe it's not here.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:07.400]   It's the Elite or Elite Crowe HP Dragonfly.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.400]   Dragonfly.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.400]   Yeah.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.400]   Fly Pro.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.360]   Now the Dragonfly is beautiful.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:18.480]   Paul Therat said on Windows Weekly, he doesn't recommend it for Windows.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:23.040]   It's a London powered, but I think it'd be fine for a Chromebook.
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.960]   I mean, it's a really, let me see if I can find the Chromebook version.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:28.760]   It's a really slim and beautiful.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:29.960]   You got to say Chromebook.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:30.960]   You got to type in Chromebook.
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.960]   You got to type in Chromebook.
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:33.960]   Search for Chromebook.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.720]   Search for Chromebook.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:38.720]   Dragonfly Chrome.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:39.720]   Chromebook.
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:40.720]   Chromebook.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:41.720]   Papayrai.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.720]   There it is.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:44.720]   Limited stock hurry.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:45.720]   Last few remaining.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:46.720]   Yeah, I think these are pretty.
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:54.920]   Look at the price though, a thousand bucks for a Chromebook.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:55.920]   It's a little heavy.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.800]   And the battery is not perfect.
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:15:59.800]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:00.800]   Maybe not.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:01.800]   That's where we're on.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.600]   Kevin was very good about that, he believed.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.760]   What does he like these days for a Chromebook?
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:09.840]   Oh, if you wait like 20 seconds, he's going to tell you, but he does say Jeff that he's
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.840]   a review of the HP Pro Chromebook.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:14.560]   Yeah, I read it a few weeks ago.
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:15.560]   Yep.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.560]   Hang on.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.560]   I had Kevin.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:18.560]   He's typing right now.
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.560]   He's typing right now.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.560]   We're back.
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.560]   We're about to find out.
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.560]   We're about to find out.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:28.280]   And I also support, I haven't, does it renew automatically by support of Kevin or do I
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.280]   have to do it?
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:35.520]   Ben Scoon writing two days ago in nine to five Google said the Dragonfly Pro is the
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:38.960]   best of Chrome OS, the best.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:41.000]   So it's a flagship, but it's flagship price.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.360]   That's the my current, my, my, my, my, a little bit of a few times.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:46.360]   Ben Scoon.
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:47.360]   Mm hmm.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.360]   Shoon.
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.360]   Shoon.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.000]   I think it's scoon.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.800]   I hate to tell you, Ben.
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:54.800]   I think it's papayre.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.680]   If he knows, I'm going to say papayre.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.600]   You don't, you don't sail around in a shooter.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:03.320]   Then again, maybe I'm wrong, but I know, I know he's been a network a few times.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:06.080]   I pronounce it as the original Dutch.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.080]   Oh, okay.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.440]   I stand corrected, says.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.440]   Oh.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.440]   Okay.
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:13.640]   Kevin's, Kevin has told me he likes his spin 7.1.0.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.480]   He's still with the answer.
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:16.480]   He's still with the answer.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:17.480]   He's still with the answer.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.480]   But for, okay.
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.480]   He's loyal.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.680]   But it, but for $1,000, the HP Dragonfly Pro is nicer.
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.040]   He didn't want to spend the money.
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.680]   Jeff would like the HP.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:31.560]   Yes, because Jeff has loaded 14 inch, we know journalism professors are very well paid.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.160]   That's why that's why you get the hands.
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.160]   Yes, so much money.
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.160]   Hands to the jackets.
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.160]   The 14 inch.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:39.400]   I always wear black cheap, unicorn, but black t-shirts.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.400]   That's all I have.
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:45.400]   That's why he's, that's why his dinner is frozen food from the death pictures.
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.600]   The 14 inch 2560 bites.
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.400]   Did I tell you how to catch you a pepe in Rome?
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.400]   I did.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.400]   You did.
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.400]   You did.
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.400]   Quite good.
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.400]   The 14 inch 20.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.400]   So tick tock now knows that I like to catch you a pepe.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:56.400]   So they're showing me a pepe.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.800]   The rest is constantly maybe trying to get me off.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:01.080]   There's no recipe.
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.520]   It's spaghetti and pepper.
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:03.520]   Noodles cheese and pepper.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:04.520]   I don't know.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.560]   Go down to the rest of the lines.
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.120]   Noodles cheese and pepper.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.120]   Noodles cheese and pepper.
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.120]   160 and 161.
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.120]   Good job.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.120]   That's the, you could do.
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.120]   You could do.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:18.120]   You could be a tick tock stuff.
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:19.120]   160.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.120]   Good Lord.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.120]   There's something at line one.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.760]   Oh, this was your going to be your pick.
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.760]   Well, no time.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:24.760]   That's okay.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:25.760]   Okay.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.760]   Here we go.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:32.480]   When your Italian husband finds an authentic pasta dish here in America.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.360]   Are you crying?
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.360]   No, I'm not crying.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.280]   But I want to, that's like a japé.
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.280]   Is he crying?
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.840]   He's actually crying.
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:42.840]   Gratier.
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.880]   That's the real ketchup pepe.
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:47.880]   Vero kachoy pepe.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:48.880]   All it is.
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:49.880]   But Italy.
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:50.880]   That's Italy.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:53.960]   Noodles cheese and pepper.
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:54.960]   It's in the name.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:55.960]   Okay.
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:59.680]   But the next guy does a whole complicated thing.
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:00.920]   I'm sorry, Italians.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:01.960]   Please don't get upset with me.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.000]   I went to, it's delicious though.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:13.280]   A wonderful like 200 year old restaurant famous in Rome for its kachoy pepe and its carbonara.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:18.200]   And they, the, the, the makers and it'll make us sit in the window rolling out their
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.200]   noodles.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.200]   So good.
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:22.200]   All that's going.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.200]   So cheese pecorino.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.200]   We're going to put this stuff.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.200]   Parmesan.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.200]   Romano.
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.000]   Yeah, this is, yeah, he's, he's not.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.560]   Butter nice and foamy here.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.560]   Foamy butter.
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.560]   Okay.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.560]   You didn't mention foamy butter.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.560]   Oh, butter and butter.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.720]   You don't see peppercorns.
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.360]   Not your pepper recipes.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.360]   Noodles.
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.360]   Uh oh.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.560]   Stream a little pasta cooking water.
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.920]   Oh, that's so you get a nice thick of sauce.
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.920]   The science here.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:49.600]   And now we have a Karima sauce.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.560]   Dreaming sauce.
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:52.560]   Between the pasta water.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.560]   So what was in there?
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:58.000]   Let's just review a new noodles and a little bit more cheese.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000]   Cheese and pepper.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.000]   Pepper.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.200]   A little butter and butter and a little butter.
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.200]   Butter is understood.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.800]   That's just the key from stutters always in there.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.680]   Nothing you can do.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.680]   See their butter.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.840]   I forget what Leo was going to talk about.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:13.840]   Where were you back up?
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.240]   The, the guy you remember?
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:16.840]   We were talking about dragonflies.
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:21.480]   14 inch 25, 60 by 1600 IPS touch screen.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.480]   And it's been shown.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.480]   1200 minutes.
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.560]   Corrected by the way.
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:25.560]   What?
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.560]   It's been shown.
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:27.560]   It's been shown.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:28.560]   It is shown.
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.560]   Showed.
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:30.560]   Showed.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:31.560]   Is it really wrong?
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.560]   Mr. Howe has corrected us.
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:33.560]   That's a completely wrong.
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:34.560]   It's shown.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:35.560]   It's too old.
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:37.560]   There's no way that's shown.
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:38.560]   Showed is S-C-H-O-E-N.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.560]   That's not shown.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:40.560]   That's shown.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:41.560]   That's schooled.
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.560]   S-H-O-N.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:43.560]   And your Leo forgot it.
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:44.560]   Showed.
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:45.560]   I thought you would leave.
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:46.920]   1200 minutes is very bright.
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:47.920]   That's good.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:49.840]   This looks like a nice light up.
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:50.840]   That's but sure.
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:53.080]   And it's got I-3 and I-5 in it.
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.000]   It's very heavy duty.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.360]   It's using the same delightful deck says been shown.
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:00.360]   Shown.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:05.320]   As was on the Elite Dragonfly, if that's his real name.
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.320]   He liked it.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.320]   So this is what you'd get on the Windows machine.
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:12.560]   What do you think about a haptic instead of a real click?
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.560]   Mal's pad.
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:14.560]   That's fine.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:18.320]   If it's done right, which Apple does, by the way, you wouldn't know the difference.
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:19.320]   You would not.
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.800]   They absolutely not know the difference if it's done right.
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:22.880]   And H-G is going to do it right.
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.880]   It's got a fingerprint sensor.
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:25.880]   That's nice.
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:28.880]   Well, look, we're phoned on my current machine and broke.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.760]   It's hard to justify $1,000 for Chromebook unless that's your main machine for Chrome
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:33.760]   all the time.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.280]   For Chrome OS, just get an Acer.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:38.960]   Don't spend $1,000 for Chrome OS.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.960]   I got what wasn't like that but I hate it.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:41.960]   Don't.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.960]   Well, you can spend $1,000 for the spin.
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:44.960]   Pardon me?
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.960]   He says it's what?
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:46.960]   Kevin says it's done right.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.960]   He's done it's done right.
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.960]   Kevin's the expert.
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.200]   Kevin is checking on Kevin every week.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.880]   Are you in the mood for a new one?
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.080]   Are you ready for a new one?
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:57.720]   You said your microphone's broken.
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:00.360]   Some people would celebrate that I'm silent.
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:05.200]   But you could use the microphone in front of you right now instead.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.200]   So here's a...
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:08.760]   Oh, the haptic trackpad has done right.
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:10.760]   It is done right.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:11.760]   Oh good.
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:17.720]   So this is an i5, 16 gigs of RAM, 256 SSD, all of this overkill for a Chromebook.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:22.720]   But that's exactly what Google would offer you if they had a Pixelbook.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.920]   It would be this price, $1,000.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:33.120]   I mean I wouldn't buy it because it's a Chromebook but if you only use Chromebooks, absolutely
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.120]   did get it.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.520]   How many years now I've been doing this?
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.520]   It's amazing.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.520]   Yeah, I've been doing this.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:38.520]   It's amazing.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.520]   Where did it come out?
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:40.520]   Jesus.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.520]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:42.520]   It's been eight, at least eight years.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.520]   Yeah, I've been pure Chromebook that long.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.520]   Good man.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:46.520]   I admire your tenacity.
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.520]   Uh huh.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.520]   All right.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:49.520]   So we'll show you the stoners.
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.680]   Uber had an announcement too.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.920]   They had their new, what do they call it?
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:58.880]   They have a cutesy name for their Uber thing.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.800]   Let me see.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.880]   Here's the tech crunch story.
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:06.120]   Uber's annual Go Get event.
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.520]   That's what it's called.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:09.320]   The Go Get event.
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:11.200]   Who knew they had an event?
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:12.200]   We didn't.
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.200]   Otherwise we had covered it.
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.200]   Everyone was an event.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.200]   It was today.
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:20.280]   The slew of new products and features aimed at attracting a new set of customers from teens
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:22.360]   as young as 13.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:28.560]   You can now, so this was always an issue for us because we wanted our kid to take Uber.
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:32.320]   He would take the train down to his high school and then take the last mile.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:39.120]   We got him to call an Uber and we always had a lie because he wasn't 18 yet.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.120]   They wouldn't pick him up otherwise.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.120]   It was unreasonable.
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.680]   I said, it's a tall guy so he could get away with it.
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:44.680]   That's right.
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:46.680]   They never asked how he did.
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:47.680]   They never asked.
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:48.680]   He's also tall.
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:50.800]   I've done it a couple of times.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.240]   He looks all over the place.
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:53.240]   It seems appropriate.
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.640]   By the way, Chromebooks are 12 years old, says mashed potatoes.
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:56.640]   12 years old.
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:05.520]   I'm a journalist and professor.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.280]   Stacey said it earlier.
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.760]   I heard Stacey say it.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:10.760]   It is true.
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:11.760]   You should have heard.
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:12.760]   Still sad about it.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:16.000]   I heard Amy Webb, who, by the way, says you hate her.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000]   She can say that.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   She says that.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000]   She says that.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   She says that.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.800]   She and Phil live it on and they were swearing up a storm.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:25.800]   Yes, it was so funny.
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.720]   You're talking about AI and it was like, "Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop."
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:29.720]   We had to bleep it.
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:32.320]   If you listen to Twit on Sunday, it was so funny.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:36.080]   At one point, I think it was Benito who said, "Don't worry, swear all you want.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.080]   We have AI."
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:44.920]   Uber now, if you sign up as a for a family account, you can have your teenager age 13
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:48.200]   to 17 request rides.
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:50.400]   Here's the biggest thing.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.120]   Uber is adding a phone number.
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:25:01.200]   If you want to use Uber, but "aren't as familiar with navigating a smartphone," you
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:04.280]   can call 1-8-3-3 "use Uber."
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.280]   Grandma.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:06.760]   It's for grandma.
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:09.120]   It's not just grandma.
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:14.120]   We've had people ask me, "Can you call me an Uber?"
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:16.680]   Because I don't have an Uber account or whatever.
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:19.680]   Yeah, what if you don't want to download the app?
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:22.120]   That's not an...
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:27.120]   Some people don't want giving Uber access to as much as they want on your phone.
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.120]   That's a commitment.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.800]   I went to this Grammarly event last night.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:30.800]   Grammarly is a sponsor.
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:31.800]   It was a very interesting event.
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:32.800]   It was fascinating.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.840]   It was in Brooklyn and it was far away from the subway.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:38.440]   They offered people Lyft.
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:41.160]   That's another thing Uber had done before and it worked really well.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.440]   That's another thing Uber's allowing.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:43.440]   You can buy an Uber.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:48.600]   You can always buy a prepaid Uber ride car, but now you can say when it should be delivered.
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:52.880]   Because so you could say, "Oh, Jeff, I know you're coming to our conference on the 11th.
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:54.040]   Here's your car to ride.
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.040]   We'll arrive on the 11th."
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.640]   That's pretty cool.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.000]   With the Lyft, it also said it has to go here.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000]   Yes.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000]   No, that's right.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.560]   They've had things where actually, I think it was on Lyft, not Uber.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:07.160]   Because I know I've had credit codes that they give you.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.720]   There was a credit code to get to their port.
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.320]   We used to do ads for Uber that would advertise that as a feature.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:17.600]   That you could set people up with Uber rides as part.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.120]   You have a business account, I think.
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:24.720]   Company did actually, interestingly, not that I would have predicted this, Uber's first
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:29.200]   quarter earnings beat forecasts across the board.
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:32.000]   Did they actually make money though?
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000]   Oh, that's another question.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.840]   Uber's gross bookings rose 19%.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:43.080]   $31 billion in the first quarter revenue up 30%.
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:45.000]   Okay, but did they profit?
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000]   No.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.000]   I'm sure not.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.280]   Have they ever turned to profit ever?
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.280]   No.
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:52.200]   Uber eats has been very successful.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.200]   That's why we're one to know.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.200]   All right.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:55.200]   Let's see.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.560]   Revenue $8.82 billion.
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:58.560]   Gap loss.
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:26:59.560]   Nope.
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:00.560]   No.
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:04.440]   They're narrower than expected.
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:06.600]   Adjusted profits.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:09.600]   It beat $761 million.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.200]   That's profit.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.200]   No.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.200]   Is it in parentheses?
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:19.080]   Because if it's in parentheses, it's a loss.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:20.080]   That's negative.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:22.080]   It's negative.
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.080]   No.
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:24.080]   Is it in parentheses?
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:26.880]   Adjusted profits came in better than the street wreck in $761 million.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.880]   It's a terrible statement.
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:31.400]   They compared to the estimate.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:34.040]   Shares of the company spiked.
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:40.480]   So did I guess part of this is Uber and Lyft did not do well in the pandemic, right?
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:41.480]   Nobody went anywhere.
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.480]   No.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:43.480]   No.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:44.480]   Well, people were sued.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:45.920]   Man dates and stuff too.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:51.880]   But yeah, Uber eats has really helped propel Uber's earnings.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:58.840]   Did they do any like, well, did they do any sort of reorganizing of their statements?
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:03.080]   Because it is a fuzzy number in the sense that you can do a lot to EBITDA to make it
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.080]   look nice.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:12.440]   Earnings before income tax and depreciation adjustments or something.
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:15.400]   Now they don't have, I mean, they don't have a lot of assets to depreciate.
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:16.400]   Right.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:17.400]   Because they don't own the cars.
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.400]   This is the poor drivers who.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:21.400]   Well, I don't know.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:24.120]   Don't they have a program where you kind of rent the car from Uber?
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.120]   Where Uber would not then have title to it?
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.120]   I don't know.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.120]   I think they might.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.120]   It seems like a taxi cab.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.040]   Anyway, Uber announcements.
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:35.440]   Let me just see here.
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:37.240]   This was in February.
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:41.040]   They announced the results.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:48.760]   Gross bookings, revenue, net income attributable to Uber technologies, $595 million.
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.560]   That's a $756 million net benefit pre-tax primarily due to net unrealized gains related
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:57.000]   to the reevaluation of Uber's equity investments.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.840]   So, you know, not from the operating of the business.
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:03.280]   It be to have $665 million.
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.000]   That's up $579 million year of year.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000]   I guess they're profitable.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.480]   Bida or Ibida.
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:08.480]   I've heard you.
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.480]   Ibida.
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.320]   I say Ibida.
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.040]   And when you're on earnings calls, J.C.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.560]   Just because you got Pompeii.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:16.560]   What did I say?
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.560]   Ibida.
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:18.560]   Ibida.
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:19.560]   Ibida.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:20.560]   Just because you got like a Hyrus.
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:24.360]   Like the wife of the Chilean dictator or Argentinian dictator.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:27.880]   I fall me, Bida.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:31.160]   You know I never loved you.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.400]   The truth is I never loved you.
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:34.760]   I don't know the song in this name.
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:35.760]   Not Ibida.
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:38.880]   You're calling a bad quattro there.
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:41.080]   All right.
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:42.600]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:43.600]   Here's some parentheses.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.800]   Oh, but this was 2021.
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:49.640]   So no, they've been doing, they've been profitable since last year.
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:50.640]   That's really interesting.
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:52.240]   It's not what I would have thought.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.240]   I didn't know that either.
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.240]   We all assumed that they're not making.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.760]   Why do we not know that?
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:57.760]   I believe you hold on.
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:03.600]   We have a picture of an Uber driver counting the bills as he drives you to wherever you're
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.400]   going.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.200]   Thank you to our Discord.
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.200]   We love our Discord.
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:09.200]   Nicely done.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.400]   We love our Discord.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:15.600]   If you are not yet a club Twitter member, you can improve our Ibida.
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.520]   Please and thank you.
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:23.200]   Like from negative numbers, perhaps to positive numbers, by paying seven bucks a month.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.600]   It really does help us.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.600]   It seems like not much.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.160]   And we give you, I think, a very nice value for your money.
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:30.800]   You get ad free versions of all the shows.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:35.480]   You get shows we don't put out in public on the Twit Plus feed like Hands on Macintosh
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:41.200]   with Michael Sargent, Hands on Windows, Paul Therrot, the new home theater geeks, Scott Wilkinson.
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:44.240]   By the way, you'll love our community manager.
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:48.720]   He's a good looking, fancy fella named Ant Pruitt.
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:51.280]   Not sure about fancy, but good looking.
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:52.280]   Yes.
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:57.440]   And he ends up putting together some great events in our Discord including Stacey's Book
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.720]   Club, which is coming up next month.
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:02.840]   The Terraformers, Annalynnewitz, his new book.
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:05.240]   Plus you get access to the Discourse.
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:06.600]   That's where all those events happen.
[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:09.600]   I think it's a really good deal for seven bucks a month.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:10.600]   Yep.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:11.600]   It was indeed.
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:13.360]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.440]   There are individual plans.
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:15.680]   There's family plans.
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:19.120]   That's something new and corporate plans as well.
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:25.360]   And we like to promote it because I really think it's important for our long term survival.
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:29.200]   There's a friendly bunch who say, "Come on in."
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.360]   "Come on in," says Wayne Brady.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.040]   "Come on in."
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:38.600]   Okay, what else?
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:39.600]   Is it a democracy?
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:42.360]   Okay, Hoover lost money.
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:45.200]   What are your services?
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:51.680]   I'm looking at their financials for last quarter, which were issued on their website
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:53.200]   on May 2nd, 2023.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.680]   Right, bro.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:32:02.480]   And if you look at their net loss, it was $157 million.
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:04.840]   Well, it's getting there.
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:11.120]   Now there even was positive, but, and I would have to look at actual 10Q.
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:13.320]   No, that's not confusing.
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:15.160]   That's how accountants get you.
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:16.160]   Yeah.
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.760]   It's because you don't look at what your support is always.
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:19.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:25.400]   Because remember, they've lost so much money for so long, they can actually budge the numbers
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:27.920]   and be like, "Oh, we're not paying any."
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:30.000]   Anyway, sorry.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000]   Net cash.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.440]   I fell at $606 million free cash.
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.640]   So they lost, yeah, I see this.
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:39.040]   Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, $157 million.
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:47.880]   That's much less though than the same period a year ago when they lost $5.9 billion.
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:49.880]   Wow, grief.
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:50.880]   Wow.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:57.280]   So do it a lot better, but they still reported a net loss.
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.280]   And their revenue is up considerably.
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:01.120]   That's impressive, though.
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:05.520]   And their beat is up 353%, which is a little suspicious.
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:07.240]   How's Lyft doing?
[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:08.720]   Lyft just laid off a ton of people.
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:11.040]   I don't know if Lyft's doing all that well.
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.040]   Are you going to make me look up Lyft's place?
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:14.040]   Yes, please.
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:15.040]   Thanks.
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.040]   What's the stock?
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:17.040]   You're going to have a backstacy.
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:19.320]   You're just trying to keep us on the back.
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.320]   No fun.
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:23.920]   Well, I just, I trained originally as a financial reporter.
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:24.920]   I know.
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:26.520]   That's why we're making you do this.
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:29.080]   Like none of this being nonsense.
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:31.200]   And I actually use Lyft.
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.400]   I don't use revenue, $1 billion.
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:36.720]   Net income minus $187 million.
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:40.240]   So they also improved over Wall Street's expectations.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.240]   So that's good.
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:45.240]   Both of the ride sharing companies are doing all right.
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:48.400]   I was in one last night from this Grammarly event, Grammarly
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:49.920]   the sponsor.
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:52.720]   And the driver, I dropped off my friend J. Rose.
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:56.760]   And then we wrote up town and started on as the driver.
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:58.720]   My friend J. Rose, from New York University.
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:33:59.720]   Yeah, I've been--
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:00.720]   Frift is also--
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:01.720]   I have friends.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:02.720]   Yeah.
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.720]   Their loss was $187.
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:06.720]   Sorry, $187 million.
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:07.720]   Very similar, isn't it?
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:09.720]   So, yeah.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.720]   So the driver speaks Spana.
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:13.720]   He's born elsewhere.
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:14.720]   He's not only speaks--
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:18.240]   Oh, I just want to say that one of my favorite kind of stories
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:19.720]   in anecdotes is Lyft--
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.720]   His driver Uber driver stories.
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:22.720]   Right.
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:27.720]   But he speaks-- he's been 10 years studying chemistry in China.
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:28.720]   Wow.
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:29.720]   They're amazing.
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:30.720]   They're amazing.
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:34.480]   Yeah, my daughter takes a lot of Uber and Lyft writes.
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:36.800]   And I hear a lot of stories about drivers,
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.520]   because she gets in a conversation with every one of them.
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:40.520]   She could be--
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.640]   You should, as a journalist, Jeff is doing the right thing.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:43.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:43.880]   Always talk to you.
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:44.280]   Stories.
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:45.720]   Human stories are fascinating.
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:48.440]   Fascinating.
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:49.760]   The other shoe dropped.
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:52.560]   Vice has filed for bankruptcy after 29 years.
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:54.720]   It's Chapter 11, though, right?
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:55.960]   That's reorganization.
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:56.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:01.200]   They've got a presumptive sale to the lenders.
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:03.200]   The SORO.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:04.200]   The-- oh, SORO.
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:06.480]   SORO, Fortress Investment Group, SORO's Fund Management
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:08.920]   and Monroe Capital, will buy the company, which
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:14.760]   was high-flying at $5.7 billion six years ago for $225 million.
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:15.760]   That's amazing.
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:20.120]   About 4% of their peak valuation.
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.600]   Unless they can find a higher bidder,
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:25.400]   but I'm thinking that's probably not going to happen.
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:28.720]   Does this say vice was overvalued back then?
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:30.960]   I think it's really--
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:31.960]   Maybe not.
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:35.760]   It's a common on the failure of online journalism, right?
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:36.920]   Well, no, no.
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:39.800]   I think it's a common on stupid investors.
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.640]   Or were they laundering?
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:42.320]   Sorry.
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.520]   Oh.
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:44.280]   No, you're right.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:46.160]   I also think my argument is--
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:49.240]   I was on CBC talking about just this--
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:52.560]   that it's the last gasp of old mass BDS
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:55.040]   seeking traffic for traffic's sake.
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:58.360]   And they had new ways to do it, but they
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:35:59.880]   had new competitors who came in.
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:02.200]   And there was no barrier to entry.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:04.640]   And they weren't that cool after all.
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:08.000]   So I don't think we've invented what follows.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.560]   Did you-- have you finished Ben Smith's book now?
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:11.160]   Traffic.
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:11.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:11.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.000]   I wrote about it on Medium.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:13.520]   You like it?
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:14.560]   Top post on Medium.
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:15.120]   Yes, I do.
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.680]   I think it's very well written.
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:18.440]   It's quite interesting.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.920]   And comparing Nick Denton's gocker, who I was a friend
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:26.080]   of Nick's and was around much of that with BuzzFeed,
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:26.960]   is really interesting.
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.560]   And Ben's book is really good.
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:35.080]   He goes on about this quest for traffic,
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:39.240]   realizing in the end the traffic was a commodity.
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.920]   What I didn't include in my write-up on Medium
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.760]   was an interesting chapter he had on Jezebel.
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:48.640]   And how, in his view, Jezebel was really the preamble
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:49.640]   to so much.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:51.680]   Jezebel was a print magazine, though.
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:52.280]   Yes?
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:52.800]   No.
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:53.440]   It was not.
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:53.840]   It was a web--
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.920]   Jezebel was a feminist blog that was owned by Gawker.
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:57.960]   It used to be awesome.
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:58.960]   Now it sucks.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:36:59.960]   Yeah, OK.
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:02.240]   It's not.
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:05.760]   Yeah, well, we see it's been up and down.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.480]   It's been difficult.
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:09.080]   I mean, podcasting is kind of struggling, too.
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:11.440]   It's just been difficult.
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:13.600]   What I didn't know was MTV News is dead.
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:17.320]   They just fired 25 staffers.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.640]   Another end of the line, although was MTV News on MTV?
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:23.360]   Or was it just web only?
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.600]   I didn't even know it existed.
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:25.920]   I know.
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:26.680]   Yeah.
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:30.600]   I thought MTV was just reality shows now and not even music.
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:34.520]   That's true.
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:38.440]   A lot of people are trying a lot of different things
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:43.680]   in the internet era to make news work.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:44.800]   Not just news.
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.880]   Kind of informative content.
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:47.440]   Is that fair?
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:49.040]   Because I think we're not a news--
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.920]   exactly a news podcast.
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:51.520]   But we--
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.640]   No, because then you would want to be right about things
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:54.480]   like net losses.
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:56.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.480]   Oh, zing.
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:04.320]   I said what I said, man.
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:05.320]   We're right.
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:07.240]   My goal is to be right eventually.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:10.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:14.080]   I don't expect to be right all the time.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:17.040]   I like to be right eventually at some point.
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:20.080]   And thanks to Stacey, I think we do pretty well there.
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:20.920]   Yes.
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:21.960]   I was going to say eventually.
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:22.560]   Keep an assignment.
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:23.200]   She keeps an assignment.
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.280]   She's a great might to her to profit.
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:28.240]   Keep an assignment.
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:30.160]   OK.
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:32.360]   OK.
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:33.400]   This is a sad story.
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:37.520]   And I meant to talk about it last week.
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:39.200]   And I forgot.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:43.240]   But I'm sure, Jeff, you have something to say about Deuce.
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:44.320]   I followed her.
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:45.400]   I loved her blog.
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.440]   She was the first mommy blogger.
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:51.000]   But that's really diminishing to call her a mommy blogger.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:51.680]   No, no.
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:53.200]   I don't think it's-- I don't think it administers her
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:56.240]   at least because I think there were the stages of bloggers.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:57.040]   There were tech bloggers.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:58.080]   There were political bloggers.
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:58.760]   War bloggers.
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:38:59.280]   We were called.
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:00.320]   I was one of those.
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.240]   And then came mommy bloggers, women bloggers.
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:04.840]   And Deuce was really a leader of that.
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:08.680]   With a unique voice, she got fired for her blogging.
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:09.680]   So that became a verb.
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:12.440]   If you got fired for your blogging, you'd been Deuce'd.
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:13.560]   She was amazing.
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:17.360]   She had a lot of trouble in life, a lot of anxiety,
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:18.880]   a lot of difficulty.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:22.400]   And in the end, it defeated her really tragically.
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:24.480]   She also went off the rails in other ways.
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:27.920]   But we've got to give her credit for what she built.
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.240]   And I think there was a lot of talk about Jezebel
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:31.280]   in the Bedsmith book.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:33.600]   But Deuce was far before Jezebel and really--
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:36.520]   She started blogging in '97.
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:37.520]   So Stacey, did you--
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:40.800]   Actually, Deuce's blog started in 2001.
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.920]   What I liked-- I didn't care about the subject matter.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.480]   She was a great writer.
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.760]   Yeah, she was.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:47.080]   She was like Jenny Lawson.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:57.480]   And she wrote about her life in a genuine, authentic, real way,
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:01.080]   which in the early days of the internet was so refreshing.
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:02.240]   Because--
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:03.240]   You were sharing in some of this.
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:07.400]   Yeah, but we were so used to this kind of polished presentation
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:08.560]   of mainstream media.
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:11.440]   And it was really refreshing to see people authentically.
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.880]   Now we're tired of that.
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:14.560]   Yeah, maybe now we want to go back to polish.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:14.920]   I don't know.
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:16.080]   Influencers.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:16.600]   Yeah.
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:18.520]   But see, that's polished again.
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:19.360]   Right?
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:20.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.080]   What is?
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:26.120]   Influencers, the stuff that's big now in social is all, you know,
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:30.960]   yolo, poly-- you only see-- you don't see their real life.
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.160]   You don't see the end of the kids.
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.000]   Well, you can simulate it.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.720]   I'll say they simulate it.
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.200]   They try to make it look real.
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:38.960]   Yeah, but it isn't.
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:40.400]   And that's even worse.
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:40.640]   We know it.
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:43.080]   Because people go, oh, I can't live up to that.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:43.560]   Right.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.320]   And then you feel bad.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:46.960]   Heather's life was all too real.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:49.240]   Heather, you never read her stuff and said,
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:51.360]   gosh, your life is better than mine.
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:53.240]   It's quite the opposite often.
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:54.520]   He said, I'm not alone.
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:56.120]   I'm saying that's what you said.
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:57.240]   I'm not alone.
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:00.240]   I'm not the only one who feels this way.
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:02.440]   Eight and a half million readers a month at the peak.
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:08.120]   Which is a time of a much smaller internet.
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:08.680]   Oh, that was--
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:09.200]   --told one.
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:09.240]   --at the time.
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.240]   That was huge.
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:10.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:11.240]   That was huge.
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:11.740]   I was huge.
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:14.040]   People didn't go on the internet to show what she did.
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:16.440]   Yeah.
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:21.080]   And of course, as we probably should always say when we talk
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.200]   about such things as if--
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:23.520]   What is the new number?
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:25.440]   Yeah, there's a new number.
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:28.680]   If you feel like you are worried about yourself
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:30.120]   or you need help--
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:30.800]   988.
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:32.160]   --there's somebody to help.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:36.120]   And it is now 988, which is great.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:38.240]   The suicide and crisis lifeline.
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:41.160]   There's somebody there who cares who you can talk to.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:42.400]   And I wish she had.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:44.360]   I really wish she had.
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:45.960]   Because that's a huge question.
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:46.960]   She was precious voice.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:47.520]   She was a precious voice.
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:49.600]   She was a precious voice.
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:53.200]   And I meant to bring this up last weekend.
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:54.240]   I spaced it out.
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:55.080]   But there was a very--
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:56.880]   It's all those early days of blogging.
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:57.400]   Yeah.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:01.200]   I interviewed Dave Weiner a week ago.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:03.800]   And we were reminiscing, which is the point of the interview,
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:07.640]   from my book, about the blogger cons.
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:09.840]   This was pre-Loving bloggers, a pre-dos,
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:12.720]   this is back in the tech and political days.
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:14.160]   But it was a wonderful time.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:15.000]   It was amazing.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000]   Oh, it was.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000]   It was.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000]   We were with each other.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000]   And we talked with each other.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000]   And we got along.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000]   I would say that--
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000]   What happened?
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.640]   Some of the same thing for early days of podcasting in the mid-2000s.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:26.640]   There was really--
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:29.240]   Well, legal podcasting has only been big in the last two years,
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:30.240]   don't you know?
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:33.000]   Well, but the same thing happened to podcasting.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.360]   It happened to blogging, which is the big publishers came in and said,
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:37.640]   OK, we'll take it from here.
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:39.160]   And then they got bored with it.
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:41.560]   And then they're bored, right?
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.320]   For a while they thought, oh, we've got the formula.
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:44.960]   It's a crime through crime.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.440]   And every podcast is true crime.
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:50.440]   I even thought I thought we should launch a true crime podcast.
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:53.440]   If we really wanted to sell, we should have at least two or three
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:54.440]   two crimes.
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:58.880]   True crime and a companion podcast based on whatever the hot show is
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.280]   of the month.
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:04.760]   Yeah, the "Gather-Omes" session, " Companion" podcast.
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:09.240]   I actually think that would do well on your social thing.
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:12.760]   Pick a show and just get some stuff about it each week.
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:14.520]   We tried that.
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:17.680]   We've tried all of the obvious things, except true crime.
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:20.960]   I just never could bring myself to do scripted stuff.
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:22.280]   And those are scripted.
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:23.200]   You have to have writers.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:24.400]   Oh, boy.
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:29.280]   But nobody wanted anything from us, but tech news and information.
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:30.240]   Hell and how to.
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:31.160]   That was really what our--
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:32.880]   That's because you're not as cool as like--
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:33.720]   Well, you already tech that.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:36.880]   --and while rounded.
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:40.040]   Did I do something to hurt you?
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:41.480]   Over the years?
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:43.680]   Yes.
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:44.920]   Today or--
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:46.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:52.160]   He hags his head.
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.560]   I don't have my punch Leo button, so now I'm just
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:55.640]   going for the verbal jazz.
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:56.640]   You really don't need it.
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:57.400]   You're getting me--
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:58.760]   Oh, you're getting me a psychic button.
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:43:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:03.240]   You're hitting me where it counts right up here, right
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:04.480]   in the old noggin.
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:08.040]   Microsoft, this is weird, has inked a deal
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:11.520]   to use fusion energy by 2028.
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:13.360]   Now, correct me if I'm wrong, Stacey.
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:14.360]   You did talk about this talk.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:15.280]   Oh, shoot, never mind.
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:15.780]   Yeah.
[01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:16.880]   Yeah, you brought that up.
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:18.080]   It's a sucker makes you right now.
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:19.160]   That's right.
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:20.280]   Forget I mentioned it.
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:29.000]   Are you worried about lithium battery fires on airplanes?
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.800]   Why suddenly is this happening?
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:31.920]   Yeah, really.
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:33.240]   It's been happening.
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:35.800]   Apparently, we didn't even know about it.
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:40.040]   Well, so I guess CBS did an investigation,
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.760]   and they found out that there are, as on average,
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:47.160]   an incident every week on an airplane.
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:47.660]   OK.
[01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:52.000]   Chew to a lithium ion battery, either catching fire
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.000]   or exploding.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.440]   And it's very-- it's problematic.
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:59.320]   Now, we talked about this on Ask the Tech Guys on Sunday.
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:02.920]   And the guy who does the airplane geek podcast called in,
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:05.520]   he's an airplane aficionado.
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:06.920]   Oh, main man, Micah?
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:08.400]   Yeah, Micah from Maine.
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:10.200]   Maine, man, Micah.
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:14.960]   He said, all commercial flights now have bags for lithium ion
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:17.280]   fires that are self-extinguishing.
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:18.440]   Oh, he's going to ask.
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:21.760]   So that's the good news, is they are at least prepared
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:22.260]   for this.
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:23.840]   And that's maybe why we haven't heard
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:25.560]   of any really terrible things.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.320]   This is why you're thinking with them in your luck language,
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:27.760]   too, right?
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:29.440]   According to-- the other thing I learned
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:31.920]   is there is something in the Department of Transportation
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:35.160]   called the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration,
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:37.360]   or Fusa.
[01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:39.520]   Say it again, Fusa.
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:41.000]   And he knows how to pronounce them.
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.200]   So we know that's the right way.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:45.800]   According to Fusa, from March 2018 through March 2023,
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:48.640]   five years, there were 5.3 incidents
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:53.480]   on 5,319 incidents on all airplanes in the United States,
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:56.400]   700 of them on passenger planes.
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:46:00.160]   That averages to be one hazmat incident on a passenger plane
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:04.200]   every two and a half days.
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:05.880]   Yikes.
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:07.880]   And it's probably actually greater
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:11.200]   because remember, so many flights were canceled during COVID.
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:14.480]   And that was bright smack in the middle of that data set.
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:17.800]   A lot of these are not your laptop or your smartphone.
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:19.680]   A lot of them are-- in fact, it seems like--
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:21.160]   Probably like e-cigarettes.
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:22.160]   It's e-6.
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:25.880]   It's the cheesy, cheap e-sigs that you buy.
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:28.080]   Well, and they stopped letting you
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:30.200]   check all of your luggage with the batteries
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:32.320]   and bringing your luggage with the batteries in one place.
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:33.520]   Well, that was the stupidest thing
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:35.000]   was the batteries built into the luggage.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.400]   That was just so dumb.
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:39.600]   Well, I remember when that law changed
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.840]   because I had checked a ton of stuff with batteries
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:44.360]   and I got pulled out of the airplane.
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:45.840]   They actually came and got me.
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:48.840]   They said, you need to take all of the batteries out of this.
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:50.040]   I said, what do you mean?
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:51.120]   Listen, you can't put it--
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:53.560]   You mean you had about 47 of them, right?
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:56.440]   I had carried so many lithium ion batteries.
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:02.360]   Every laptop, iPad, cameras, drones, microphones.
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:03.600]   This is the 360 cameras.
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:07.320]   Probably a dozen lithium ion batteries on every trip.
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:11.600]   There are companies working on batteries that won't burn.
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.600]   That's one solution, right?
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.200]   But the other one is to have airplanes
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:18.960]   prepared and personnel trained
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:20.960]   when things start smoking.
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:24.440]   And do not put batteries in the checked luggage
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:25.960]   because you can't tell it's smoking.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:26.480]   Right.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:27.880]   And keep an eye on your stuff.
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:30.200]   And if you see smoke coming out of the overhead bin,
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:32.160]   immediately notify the flight team.
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:34.320]   Let someone know, don't be a hero.
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:36.320]   Yeah.
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:37.920]   The staff and team, they're trained on this.
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:39.920]   The good news is, as far as I know,
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:42.320]   no planes have gone down because of this.
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:45.120]   But it's certainly scary.
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:48.120]   Can you-- you don't use water to put out a lithium ion battery?
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:48.120]   You can.
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:49.640]   It's chemical expulsion, right?
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:49.640]   Yeah.
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:50.920]   It's like a grease fire.
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:54.160]   So these bags, you can see one right here,
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:55.120]   these aviation sites.
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:56.320]   Digital grease fires.
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:57.920]   I think they do have water in them,
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:01.120]   but that's mostly to hold the smoke and stuff inside, right?
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:01.640]   Yeah.
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:03.520]   Because, yeah, the problem is the lithium ion--
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:06.080]   that's Pete Buttigieg, our Department of Transportation
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:09.320]   Secretary-- the problem is-- so these are the bags.
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:11.600]   They put them in.
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:16.000]   The problem is that the oxygen that supports combustion
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.480]   is in the battery.
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:19.840]   So there's-- you can't smother it.
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:21.400]   All right.
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:21.880]   Oh.
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:22.400]   OK.
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:23.480]   Think of that asplo-ish.
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:26.520]   So it's a self-feeding fire.
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:28.240]   And that's why they're difficult.
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:30.880]   We've heard for years about problems at recycling.
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:32.320]   Pretty much every recycling plant
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.760]   ends up having a lithium ion battery fire.
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:35.640]   It's a good one.
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:38.040]   They get punctured, and once they're punctured,
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:39.040]   exposed to air, they burn.
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:40.640]   See.
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:43.800]   Cities are having this issue with the electric scooters.
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:45.800]   A lot of them are randomly catching on fire at space as well.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:46.760]   Yeah, they're all over.
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:47.760]   They're littering.
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:48.240]   Yeah.
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:49.880]   And they're cheap, crappy.
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:51.960]   That's true.
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:53.560]   It was a very bad-- now, you're going
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:55.800]   to have to look at the balance sheet, Stacey,
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:59.240]   and verify this number.
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:05.520]   But according to a variety, cord cutting hit an all time high
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:10.800]   January through March 2023, US pay TV subscriptions
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:15.200]   fell to their lowest level since 1992.
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:18.880]   2.3 million customers turned away
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:23.080]   from cable satellite and internet TV providers.
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.240]   Interesting.
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:24.760]   Mm-hmm.
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:27.760]   Yeah, I get it's Bruce Lechman's data, right?
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:28.560]   I don't know who's--
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:30.080]   Like, I think it is.
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:32.000]   And internet?
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.040]   So Bruce Lechman does--
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:38.320]   it's Lechman research group, and he's
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:41.800]   been calculating this stuff for the last 20 years.
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:46.280]   Well, this one is a report from Craig Moffatt of SVB Moffatt
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:47.440]   Nathanson.
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:51.120]   In any event, they all agree, because as Craig said,
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:54.920]   we're watching the sun begin to set on the pay TV business.
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:57.720]   Couldn't happen to a nicer bunch of people, right?
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:58.720]   One of how this is going to be--
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:01.840]   Wow, so here's what?
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.800]   With the writers' guild, and I'm
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:06.840]   one of those numbers of coming up in their negotiations.
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:07.880]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:08.840]   That's interesting.
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:09.880]   Because where are people going?
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:11.560]   They're going to streaming, right?
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:14.120]   I don't know why I'm pointing at you.
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:16.520]   Because your children says IT Pro TV and Chill.
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:19.240]   IT Pro and Chill.
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:22.560]   No, the reason they say internet is because of the streamers
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:25.240]   like YouTube, TV, and Hulu.
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:25.880]   They're awesome.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:26.880]   I thought that was the alternative.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:27.880]   That's the people we're going to do.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:32.280]   No, the alternative is Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu.
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:33.120]   Not Hulu streaming.
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:34.120]   No bundle.
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:34.960]   Yeah, no bundle.
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:35.800]   Hold on.
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:37.080]   Hold on.
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:38.240]   So I'm just looking at--
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:39.760]   There's no fact check.
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:40.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:41.680]   No, don't hold on.
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:42.880]   Actually, I'm not sorry.
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:45.160]   No, don't be sorry.
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:48.800]   So the pay TV providers--
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:50.560]   so this is Lakeman's research.
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:53.640]   So Moffatt is a Wall Street analyst.
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:56.440]   It says, according to Moffatt's calculations in here,
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:57.880]   in this variety, article.
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:00.160]   So what is your calculations?
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:00.760]   I know.
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:03.920]   In Moffatt's calculations and Lakeman's calculations
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:06.760]   are both based on the financial reports
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:09.840]   issued every quarter by the big cable company.
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.640]   So it's roughly the same numbers.
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:13.320]   OK.
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:14.240]   Sorry.
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:17.000]   So I'm just seeing-- because Lakeman also
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.520]   pulls out other like dish TV and--
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:24.720]   sorry, other things like over-the-top things like YouTube TV.
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:28.520]   So those guys--
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:30.880]   very-- they actually also lost--
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:34.440]   so the bundled guys like Sling, Hulu, Plus Live TV,
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:41.440]   YouTube TV, and Fubo also lost 394 subscribers this quarter.
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:43.960]   So everybody's losing things because of--
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:46.440]   so it's not just the cable guys,
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:48.280]   which everyone is cutting the cord.
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:50.720]   But it's also probably an economic issue too,
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:51.400]   because people are--
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:52.800]   Right.
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:55.920]   So Comcast, the largest pay TV provider in the country,
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:52:01.880]   dropped 614,000 customers in the first three months of the year.
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:03.960]   That's not insignificant.
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:06.680]   YouTube TV was the only provider tracked by Moffatt.
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:08.480]   Nathan said that picked up subs.
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:10.320]   They added 300,000 subscribers.
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:12.600]   In fact, at this point, it looks like YouTube TV
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:17.400]   is going to be the winner in terms of internet TV--
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:18.120]   live TV.
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:21.880]   They are the top one with 5.7 million subscribers.
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:22.880]   UI is good.
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:25.360]   It says 6.3 million here, but that's--
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:26.840]   anyway.
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:30.800]   They netted over the past year 1.4 million subscribers.
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:33.440]   Hulu has barely grown.
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:35.760]   In fact, they lost 100,000 subs in Q1.
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:37.640]   ABC is about to buy the rest of it.
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:38.720]   Disney is about to buy the rest of it.
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:41.600]   Disney--
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:43.640]   Comcast is getting out of it, basically.
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:45.960]   Comcast owns a quarter of it.
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:47.960]   Disney has the right to buy it off of them.
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:49.920]   They're talking right now.
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:52.560]   Comcast is happy to give it to them.
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:53.400]   And Disney said that--
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:54.360]   Well, they have a pair.
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:55.000]   --was just roll it in Disney Plus.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.440]   It'll all be one streaming thing.
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:59.080]   Yeah, because once they launched Peacock,
[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:02.280]   it really made no sense for them to have Hulu.
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:02.800]   Right.
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:03.640]   Fubu.
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:07.480]   Fubu TV lost 160,000 subscribers.
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:10.840]   It's worse, Corday lost in record.
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:17.160]   So it's a big change in the way TV works.
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:17.920]   Pay TV floor.
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:19.680]   When did John cut the cord?
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:21.120]   I still have the cord.
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:22.560]   I am corded.
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:23.760]   I can't remember.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:26.440]   It's been a long time.
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:26.960]   Long time.
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:29.440]   I think I did it in 2010.
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:30.360]   We're old.
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:31.000]   I still have--
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.600]   And the thing is lots of cords.
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:34.440]   Gosh, man.
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:35.960]   It's got a corded phone.
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:38.360]   Hey, you know, it's like Battlestar Galactica.
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:41.440]   If ever the silence come, we know Jeff will still
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:43.880]   be able to place a couple of pizza.
[01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:46.680]   I would temporarily attack the cord.
[01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:48.000]   I guess I should correct myself,
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.320]   because I would get back on cable for football season
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:53.040]   and then call and yell at the cable company.
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:53.880]   You don't need to anymore.
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:54.760]   You're going to get off.
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:56.120]   Get YouTube TV and get Sunday--
[01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:56.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:58.120]   Yeah, that's what I've--
[01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:00.840]   I'm in 150 bucks for Sunday ticket for the new season.
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:01.840]   I'm not doing that.
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:02.320]   That's a lot.
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:04.400]   That's a ticket.
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:07.600]   Anyway, according to Nathanson, I'm sure your guy
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:08.480]   has other numbers.
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:15.680]   But Moffat Nathanson says, the pay TV floor, the bottom,
[01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:18.520]   the subscribers who have ever quit.
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:24.000]   50 to 60 million US homes, which is still a lot of folks.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.280]   So they still have--
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:28.440]   there are still 73--
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:32.560]   so top-- the big cable providers that were thinking of not
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:35.800]   the virtual NPV, the virtual internet guys.
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:38.040]   That's 73.
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:39.680]   Roughly 7 million left.
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:42.200]   So we can still see 20 million.
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:44.280]   Dikes.
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:48.320]   US-- as of the end of Q1, US pay TV services at 75 and 1/2
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:51.280]   million customers down 7% year over year.
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:52.920]   And everybody agrees that number's
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:56.080]   going to get bigger and bigger as more and more people leave.
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:57.200]   I still have a cable.
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:58.760]   I have YouTube TV.
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:02.480]   I have-- I subscribe to Hulu and--
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:04.480]   No, all the extras.
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:05.320]   You get all the extras.
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:06.680]   I got more money than cents.
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:07.520]   And I just--
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:08.920]   I want to watch everything.
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:09.680]   And I don't want to be told--
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:11.480]   I'm going to give you some cents for some of your money.
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:13.680]   I don't want to be told I can't watch something.
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:14.680]   I want to watch.
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:16.480]   So I just watch it.
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:17.800]   Damn it.
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:21.840]   I think it's a bit of a thing.
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:23.280]   But I think we are--
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:24.680]   Lisa and I are going back and forth.
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:27.240]   They're probably going to turn off the cable subscription.
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:29.760]   YouTube TV scratches all of our edges.
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:32.240]   It's gotten more expensive.
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:33.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:35.760]   It's a cable bill.
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:37.920]   So yeah, so cable saw this coming.
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:40.720]   I think I wrote this in 2012 or 2010.
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:42.400]   Cable was like, oh, crikey.
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:45.440]   Everyone's getting rid of their landlines, except for Jeff.
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:47.680]   Everyone's getting rid of the triple play.
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:49.840]   Remember how we used to talk about the triple play?
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:54.760]   And your bill for all of those was roughly $150 a month.
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:56.880]   And now, if you look at your broadband bill,
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:00.600]   a lot of people are paying roughly that amount.
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:01.880]   So that's all this.
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:03.400]   It's just happened gradually.
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:07.040]   The price didn't change the mix of what you were paying for.
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:09.480]   But the other big thing that has happened here--
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:12.600]   and I write about this basically in every book I do now--
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:16.560]   is it's the death of mass that the huge audience that
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:18.720]   existed goes away.
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:23.600]   Broadcast, a linear TV is long dead.
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:27.960]   AM radio is about to die as cars get rid of it.
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:29.560]   Mass is what goes away.
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:30.920]   And you have a lot of niches.
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:33.040]   And I think that's more natural state for media.
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:34.120]   It was a temporary--
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:35.480]   Yeah, we are, right?
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:38.440]   We've been a niche player since 2005.
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:39.640]   Very happy in here.
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:41.600]   It's not huge.
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:44.160]   It's not 100 million people watching.
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:45.080]   You don't want it to be.
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:45.600]   But it's not--
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:47.440]   I don't want it to be actually.
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:48.200]   I don't want it to be.
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:51.040]   I like having a kind of qualified, small audience.
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:51.920]   We love you all.
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:53.320]   Everyone who's watching, we love you.
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:54.400]   Yeah, we love you.
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:56.040]   Well, I figure if you're watching us,
[01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:58.000]   they're interested enough to watch us.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:58.840]   I think that's good.
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:02.480]   If you're listening later, we also love you too.
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:06.080]   We especially love the ones who make it all the way through.
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:08.560]   We are amazed and happy.
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:12.760]   You know, our completion rate is about 80%.
[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:13.400]   You're kidding me.
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:14.360]   No, that's freaking awesome.
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:15.200]   Oh, that's great.
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:15.960]   That's freaking awesome.
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:16.960]   Wow.
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:17.120]   That makes sense.
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:18.440]   Pretty high.
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:19.560]   You know, maybe it's tech people,
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:23.880]   because the completion rate on my show is about 85%, 80% too.
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:26.400]   And I'm like, dang, you guys are--
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:28.080]   I think you know what the difference is.
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:29.120]   Yours more than ours.
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:32.280]   But people are listening for information, right?
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:34.600]   And so they're going to keep listening to the whole show.
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:36.200]   It's not entertainment where you turn it off
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:38.520]   when you're done washing the dishes
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:39.800]   and you go to the next thing.
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:41.080]   They're listening for content.
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:43.040]   And I do prefer that.
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:44.880]   I think we're a little less than you.
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:46.920]   That number would make sense.
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:48.520]   Because we don't have much content.
[01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:49.480]   It's mostly just our personal--
[01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:50.000]   And you're a hell of a--
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.440]   --and we go on forever.
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:54.040]   God, we do.
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:55.520]   Hey, what's our next story?
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:56.480]   Let's do this.
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:57:59.160]   Let's take a break and come back with your picks of the week.
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:00.160]   How about that?
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:00.800]   How about that?
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:02.400]   Well, I'm only-- we're not doing change log?
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:03.080]   No change log?
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:03.960]   No a-all log?
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:04.480]   Wow.
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:05.160]   Sure.
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:06.360]   She's freaking--
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:08.040]   My God, did we add an AI log?
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:10.520]   I just hate you guys so freaking much.
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:12.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:15.760]   She busted my chops here.
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:17.920]   We're just trying to keep us on--
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:19.400]   There were three AI stories.
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:20.520]   We kind of did them already.
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:21.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:21.440]   We have to.
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:21.800]   That's true.
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:23.120]   That's true.
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:25.000]   Let's see what the change log has.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.080]   I'll give it to you real quick.
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:26.840]   Change log.
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:32.960]   The Google change log.
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:34.640]   The theme is going to take longer than the change log.
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:35.600]   Yeah, pretty much.
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:40.800]   The Pixel 7A's free Pixel Buds and case offer ends this weekend.
[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:42.720]   Buy your phone now if you were going to get one.
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:44.800]   That's actually a good deal, the Pixel 7A.
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:45.400]   I like it.
[01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:48.720]   Although the 6A is even less expensive and still
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:49.560]   a pretty good deal.
[01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.520]   Google Docs is adding--
[01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:52.880]   No.
[01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:53.560]   I put this in.
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:56.240]   I even put this in collapsible headings.
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:59.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:03.880]   You had it up in the main feed and demoted it.
[01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:06.880]   I can't believe you even for a moment had it in the main feed.
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:09.600]   Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook are sinking up.
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:11.240]   Kind of.
[01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:12.840]   Really?
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:13.920]   Kind of.
[01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:15.800]   Now this is a story from Mashable.
[01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:17.920]   I didn't even know they were still in the business.
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:18.920]   So--
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:19.920]   Oh.
[01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:20.600]   I hear that.
[01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:22.080]   I got a question for you.
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:24.360]   People sent me calendar invites and they're at ICS.
[01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:26.200]   And of course, I'm in Google.
[01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:27.280]   And you can't import them.
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:27.800]   Why?
[01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:28.320]   What?
[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:29.040]   You can't open up.
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:30.040]   I see.
[01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:31.040]   I see.
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:32.120]   I want to click on it and save.
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:32.640]   Yeah.
[01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:33.120]   You go-- yeah.
[01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:34.800]   You got to go through all that McGilli.
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:35.720]   You can just--
[01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:37.880]   There's somebody who puts up a save this to Google
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:39.440]   and you're just clicking his thumb.
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:40.480]   It's so much better.
[01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:43.640]   We'll get ready because on May 15th--
[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:44.840]   that was two days ago--
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:48.480]   Google and Microsoft set it up to their calendar apps
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:49.520]   allow for more integration.
[01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:54.440]   They call it get this calendar interoperability.
[01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:54.960]   Catchy.
[01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:55.480]   Catchy.
[01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:56.000]   That's awesome.
[01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:56.520]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:59:56.520 --> 01:59:58.320]   It allows you to productively schedule time
[01:59:58.320 --> 01:59:59.720]   and manage your schedule collaboratively,
[01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:03.000]   regardless of your calendaring platform.
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.000]   Now, people who use Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.840]   with the same email address can receive both Google Calendar
[02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:12.840]   invitations and RSV's and Outlook for the same calendar.
[02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:15.800]   Outlook will remind you about events created in Google Calendar
[02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:18.640]   and recurring events from Outlook will update in your Google
[02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:19.600]   Calendar.
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:21.840]   So I think what it is, honestly, is there
[02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:23.640]   starting to support.
[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:24.960]   ICS is the standard.
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:27.640]   Google Calendar did their own little thing,
[02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:28.520]   so it was a little more automated.
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:29.720]   It was better.
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:30.280]   Yeah.
[02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:32.000]   More AI in the workspace.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.480]   We kind of saw this at I/O last week.
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:38.200]   Gmail, Inbox, Meet Notes, Slide, Soundtrack, Maker.
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:39.760]   All has AI now.
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:42.440]   Android TV has a live tab with free channels,
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:44.760]   just like Google TV.
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:46.840]   Those free channels-- actually, you know,
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:49.240]   there's one free channel I don't normally-- because I want
[02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:50.280]   to see ads--
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:55.720]   Free V has the remarkable jury duty show.
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:58.080]   Have you watched that yet?
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:00:58.640]   Oh, boy.
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:00.720]   This is a reality TV show.
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:01.920]   Oh, what ad for it, though.
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:03.400]   I was a bit in kid or watching it.
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:04.480]   I saw an ad for it, though.
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:05.160]   They love it.
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:05.640]   Yeah.
[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:07.040]   So it's legit, huh?
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:09.560]   So you know, I don't know if I'll
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:12.560]   watch all the episodes because it's kind of repeating
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:13.840]   a little bit repetitive.
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:16.000]   But the idea is here, I'll play the trailer for you.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.200]   This is an Amazon product.
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:17.840]   I'm muted, though.
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:20.040]   But you have to watch it on Free V, right?
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:21.320]   They're channel.
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:22.560]   When I say jury--
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:24.160]   So the idea is--
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:24.520]   I don't know.
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:25.200]   Why do I have to mute it?
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:26.080]   It's a trailer.
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:27.480]   No, they're going to dingus.
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:29.400]   OK, don't dingus.
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:32.480]   So the idea is that guy--
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:34.040]   this guy here--
[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:35.400]   is a real person.
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:38.440]   Everybody else on the jury that judged the bailiff,
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:42.200]   the lawyers, the defendants are all actors,
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:45.560]   including James Marsden playing himself
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:49.680]   as the biggest egotistical buffoon ever.
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:50.180]   And--
[02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:50.800]   That's compelling.
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:51.960]   But here's the thing that happened
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:53.640]   that they didn't expect.
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:54.360]   It's funny, right?
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:57.360]   Because it's like--
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:01:58.920]   you're getting punked, right?
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:01:59.960]   It's like can a camera.
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:00.680]   He doesn't know.
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:01.680]   He's not in on it.
[02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:03.720]   And so the jurors do all sorts of dopey things.
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:05.200]   They hang on each other.
[02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:07.600]   There's one juror who's in the movement
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:10.080]   of the enhanced body movement.
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:14.800]   So he has one of those bags where you water on it.
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:15.600]   Oh, camel back.
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:16.120]   Camel back.
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:16.880]   Like a camel back.
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:18.720]   But he says, well, the idea actually
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:21.480]   would be if I could have a bladder or some sort of bag
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:24.400]   inserted in my body, I would never have.
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:26.320]   And then he has another nozzle.
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:28.720]   And he says, well, that's a liquefied food.
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:30.120]   You see, I have water.
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:30.600]   And I have food.
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:33.320]   And then he comes to the jury with crutches strapped
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:36.640]   to his ass because he doesn't want to have to sit down
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:39.120]   or keep people waiting so he can sit down at any time.
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:40.320]   But doesn't work with the jury box.
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:40.920]   It's funny.
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:44.520]   Like in this guy, this poor guy doesn't know it's all fake.
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:46.480]   He thinks, wow, I'm with the weirdest--
[02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:48.720]   But here's the funny thing.
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:50.600]   And the producers didn't expect this.
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:52.320]   This guy, he's like a sweetheart.
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:55.600]   Instead of getting angry or frustrated,
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:58.240]   he shows the guy sits on the crutches
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:02.520]   and has a bug's life to show him that you could be an outcast.
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:05.160]   But really, you're also uninnovated.
[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:07.280]   He's like a sweetheart.
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:08.000]   It's a saint.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.760]   Nothing throws him.
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:10.760]   Outstanding.
[02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:13.120]   And all of a sudden, this guy, by the way,
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:14.360]   is going to be a star.
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:15.040]   He's all of a sudden.
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:17.720]   The question is, did he have to quit his--
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:19.600]   He thought he was on a jury.
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:20.120]   He thought he was--
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:22.000]   Did he have to leave his work and not be paid
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.040]   and then come to a jury?
[02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:23.920]   And how did they--
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:24.920]   Like you do in a jury.
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:25.480]   What do they do?
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:27.520]   And the funny thing is, Marsden is there,
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:29.360]   and he wants to get out of it.
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:31.120]   So he stages fake paparazzi.
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:33.680]   They come and they're at the door and stuff.
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:36.440]   And instead of getting out of the jury, he says,
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:38.200]   yeah, no, see, judge is going to happen all the time.
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:39.760]   I should probably not be here.
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:40.440]   Just says, that's fine.
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:42.120]   We're just going to sequester you all.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:45.600]   So I'm saying, this is terrible.
[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:49.240]   We're all staying in a motel together.
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:50.960]   It's actually very funny.
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:51.480]   OK.
[02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:51.960]   I'm in.
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:53.640]   Yeah, I would watch it.
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:55.800]   I would watch it.
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:57.600]   It's pretty wild.
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:03:58.960]   How many episodes?
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:01.800]   I don't know, because I'm just kind of losing steam on it.
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:03.800]   It's certainly the premise is, well,
[02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:05.720]   it's good enough to have the first few episodes.
[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:06.800]   I'll probably watch a few more.
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:07.640]   I have been seeing ads.
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:08.800]   OK, I'll give it a shot.
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:10.600]   That's jury duty.
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:13.920]   It's a really interesting concept.
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:17.560]   And I think it got out of the producer's control,
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:19.840]   because this guy turned out not to be reacting.
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:22.000]   They thought he'd be like, oh, pissy.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:29.440]   And instead, this guy's like a saint doing his civic duty.
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:30.440]   John's asking a good question.
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:31.600]   Aren't the cameras a giveaway?
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:36.000]   No, he's told that we are making a documentary about jury duty.
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.320]   And we have chosen your jury, so they
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:40.720]   have documentary style and interviews of the entire--
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:42.600]   of everybody, the actors and the real guy,
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:45.440]   they pretend everybody's real, and they interview him after.
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:46.000]   And they have--
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:46.000]   And they have--
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:46.600]   --and stuff.
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:48.800]   So they're pretending-- yeah, oh, yeah, we're filming it.
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:50.280]   It's for a documentary we're doing on jury duty.
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:54.360]   But they have to go through hours of like real boring court
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:56.680]   stuff to prove that it works real like--
[02:04:56.680 --> 02:04:56.680]   Right.
[02:04:56.680 --> 02:04:57.840]   --or like court stuff.
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:04:58.320]   --or like court stuff.
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:04:59.640]   The judges are the ones that journey.
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:00.140]   They do.
[02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:02.080]   The judges are journeying all the time.
[02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:03.080]   That's enough.
[02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:06.200]   I read one story where they don't show that to you.
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:08.800]   They'll do four hours evidence.
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:11.600]   Well, the case is terrible.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:12.680]   The case is terrible.
[02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:13.640]   It's a civil suit.
[02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:15.920]   This woman is claiming that this employee
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:18.080]   ruined her business and her reputation,
[02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:21.680]   because he got drunk and urinated on all the products.
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:24.960]   And the plaintiff has this really beautifully created
[02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:29.360]   3D animation of what happened.
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:32.760]   And the defense attorney got his nephew
[02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:35.080]   to make something--
[02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:39.200]   anyway, I'll leave it to you to watch.
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:41.960]   It's funnier if he is compressing than like that.
[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:42.320]   Anyway--
[02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:44.440]   Have you watched the diplomat?
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:47.080]   Yeah, I started and I thought, this is so good.
[02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:48.480]   I'm saving it for Lisa.
[02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:49.400]   It's very good.
[02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:49.880]   It looks good.
[02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:56.120]   Episode six and seven, when they're off in a meeting,
[02:05:56.120 --> 02:05:58.600]   it's at a place called Ditchly, where I've been twice.
[02:05:58.600 --> 02:05:59.880]   Ditchly in England, yeah.
[02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:00.480]   Ditchly.
[02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:02.280]   Ditchly, yeah.
[02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:06.640]   They-- I thought this is like fake Aaron Sorkin.
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:08.280]   Turns out the showrunner is a guy
[02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:09.360]   used to write for the West Wing.
[02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:11.400]   So there's a connection.
[02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:11.960]   Yeah, it's very--
[02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:13.360]   It kind of feels like that West Wing thing.
[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:14.160]   It does.
[02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:17.760]   Finally, Pixel phones are gaining a new ringtone,
[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:22.000]   inspired by Kenny G. Oh my god.
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.120]   Shall I play it for you?
[02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:26.920]   You go to sleep instead of answering the phone.
[02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:28.360]   I wonder if it's on my phone.
[02:06:28.360 --> 02:06:29.600]   Here, I'll play a little bit of it.
[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:30.920]   Will they take us down for this?
[02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:32.240]   They will.
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:33.480]   Screw up music.
[02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:43.880]   I swear, you always know when it's Kenny G on the whole line.
[02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:45.360]   Yeah, it really has a sound, doesn't it?
[02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:50.840]   Get ready for the name of this.
[02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:53.720]   This is the Kenny Jingtone.
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:55.720]   Oh.
[02:06:55.720 --> 02:06:56.560]   And that--
[02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:58.880]   There's a bigger change.
[02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:00.280]   And that's the--
[02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:01.280]   Oh, wow.
[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:02.280]   Oh, gosh.
[02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:04.280]   That's horrible.
[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:07.040]   God.
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:11.220]   Our show this week brought to you by our wonderful, wonderful
[02:07:11.220 --> 02:07:14.560]   studio sponsors, ACI Learning.
[02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:17.440]   Really, the reason ACI Learning wanted a sponsor studio.
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:19.800]   We're here in the ACI Learning Studios.
[02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:21.200]   It's because they wanted you to know the name,
[02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:25.320]   because ACI Learning, ITPro, is now part of ACI Learning.
[02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:27.000]   We know you know ITPro.
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:28.800]   Since they started 10 years ago, they've
[02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:30.080]   been a part of our family.
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:32.040]   We've been talking about all their great training.
[02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:34.240]   Well, now ITPro is that much better
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:37.120]   by merging with ACI Learning.
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:44.800]   They are now able to give you all kinds of valuable training
[02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:48.520]   in IT, in cybersecurity, in audit.
[02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:50.480]   They've got expanded practice labs.
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:54.320]   They're now up to 7,000 hours of content.
[02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:57.080]   All of this, because the ACI Learning
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:58.880]   is empowered them to do so much more.
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:04.080]   In fact, thanks to ACI Learning, the days of boring, archaic training
[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:06.160]   methods are finally over.
[02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:10.120]   Lack of meaningful impact shows up as low engagement.
[02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:11.400]   We were just talking about that.
[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:13.160]   That's a suboptable performance.
[02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:16.680]   The industry training industry's completion rate
[02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:20.200]   on their videos averages around 30%.
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:21.360]   That's because people get bored.
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:22.000]   They drift off.
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:23.200]   It's just not good.
[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:26.600]   ACI Learning is 80% completion rate.
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:27.680]   I think the same thing.
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:28.400]   It's entertaining.
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:28.840]   It's fun.
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:30.640]   And you are learning.
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:31.280]   You are learning.
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:33.800]   And what this means is your team is
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:40.080]   going to love the training they get from ITPro and ACI Learning.
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:42.360]   In today's IT talent shortage, whether you operate
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:45.080]   as your own department or you're part of a larger team,
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:47.240]   your skills have to be up to date.
[02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:48.680]   That's table stakes, right?
[02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:53.520]   94% of CIOs and CSOs agree attracting a retaining talent
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:56.960]   is increasingly critical to their roles.
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:08:58.400]   If jobs are not getting filled, there's
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:01.480]   a dearth of people with the skills they need.
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:05.000]   This is why it's such a good time for you to go to ACI Learning.
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.600]   Whether you've got a team that needs to get up
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:10.960]   skilled, that needs to learn more, that
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:14.640]   needs to thrive and invest in the security of your business,
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:17.800]   or you're an individual who wants to get into IT.
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:20.160]   You can keep your skills up to date or get those certs
[02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:22.000]   with 7,000 hours of content.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:23.280]   New episodes are added daily.
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:25.800]   They've got seven studios running Monday through Friday
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:27.600]   all day.
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:31.240]   That's partly too because this stuff never sits still.
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:34.320]   There's always new tests, new questions, new certs,
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:37.560]   new versions of software you've got to keep up to date.
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:39.480]   You do and they do.
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:41.680]   And for training for your enterprise,
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:44.640]   there is no better way to keep your team compliant
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:46.240]   ahead of the pack.
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:48.280]   You could choose an existing course and let ACI
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:51.400]   learn and combine modules for a tailored solution
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:53.400]   or let them custom design a course to address
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:54.200]   your specific needs.
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:55.680]   Yes, they do that.
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:58.360]   In fact, ACI Learning's private boot camp will train your team
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:01.640]   alongside the most passionate, the best subject matter
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:05.480]   experts certified in the latest version of each individual
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:06.600]   cert.
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:08.040]   And when you do that private boot camp,
[02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:10.480]   you get full access to advanced reporting.
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:12.440]   Actually, anybody who's doing the team training
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:15.280]   does with ACI Learning's pro portal.
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:17.360]   Track and manage your team's results manage seats
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:20.400]   assigned on assigned team members for customized courses
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:23.160]   relevant to their position, access monthly progress
[02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:24.360]   and usage reports.
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:25.440]   And they're very visual.
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:28.320]   That's helpful if you're justifying the spend of the higher
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:30.880]   ups, you get immediate insight into your team's viewing
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:34.280]   patterns and progress over any period.
[02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:38.160]   ACI Learning trains thousands of aspiring tech
[02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:41.120]   and cyber professionals every year.
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:43.600]   And I am so proud of them because they also
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:46.920]   provide scholarships to individuals from diverse backgrounds.
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:48.480]   Yes, you can get a scholarship.
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:51.040]   If you're transitioning out of military service
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:53.400]   into a civilian career, they're there for you
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:55.840]   with special deals for vets.
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:58.360]   Join the always on tech training solution
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:00.400]   in a rapidly changing world of technology.
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:02.600]   ACI Learning is in the studio every day
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:05.400]   to record and share relevant content that impacts your business.

[02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:57.120]   It's time for Stacy's thing.
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:01.840]   - Okay, my thing this week is not a thing.
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:04.080]   It's a dump your thing, burn your thing,
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:06.360]   get rid of your thing, recycle it.
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:10.440]   This thing is the WeMo Smart Plugs this week.
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:13.800]   - I just bought those T&T Beelink Smart Plugs.
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:16.320]   And I have even those on the box.
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:17.320]   Those are different.
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:18.160]   - Oh, okay.
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:19.880]   These are made by Belkin WeMo.
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:21.160]   - Yeah. - Okay, calm down.
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:22.440]   Calm down.
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:24.600]   - You mean the ones that the series vulnerability
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:26.440]   was recently uncovered in?
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:27.600]   - Yes, that was the one.
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:29.520]   So here's the issue.
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:32.520]   One, it's actually not that there was a serious vulnerability.
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:35.800]   Although it is very serious, it could be remotely executed.
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:38.480]   It also allows the device to execute code,
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:40.960]   which means like someone who's not in your house
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:43.000]   or has physical access to the device
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:47.000]   could theoretically use this buffer flow vulnerability
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.720]   to get access to your device and stall code
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:52.000]   that could then get access on the rest of your network.
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.640]   So it's not great. - But there's a butt here, right?
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:55.480]   - Hold on.
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:12:56.320]   It's not great.
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:57.400]   So this is terrible.
[02:12:57.400 --> 02:12:59.000]   And the researchers was like, this is terrible.
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:00.440]   We should tell Belkin WeMo.
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:01.280]   So they did.
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:04.000]   And Belkin WeMo said, eh, they're not gonna fix it
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.520]   because they're literally saying burn these.
[02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:09.760]   Not buy them, don't buy them, burn them.
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:11.520]   - Oh, I said burn recycle, get rid of.
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:13.440]   - Oh, wow.
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:14.680]   Okay, nice pick. - Yeah, Joe.
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:16.160]   - How about those T&T Beelink ones?
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:17.360]   Is there okay, yes?
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:18.200]   - So those are fine.
[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:21.400]   Well, here's the next part of this, right?
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:22.920]   Belkin decided not to do this
[02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:25.680]   because the device was sold starting in 2019.
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:27.160]   They're like, ah, it's close to the end of life.
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:28.360]   We're not gonna update it.
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:31.520]   This is actually the second or possibly the third time
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:33.960]   Belkin WeMo has decided when faced with
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:36.680]   the security vulnerability to be like, eh,
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:37.520]   that device is old.
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:40.160]   - But they're still selling them, aren't they?
[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:43.920]   - Yes, to me, that says they do not care about you,
[02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:45.080]   do not buy.
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:46.640]   I mean, this is exactly--
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:49.160]   - Do not buy anything from WeMo, I think, right?
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:51.680]   - Right, Belkin WeMo, don't buy.
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:53.800]   They got purchased by Fox kind of while back.
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:56.280]   But so now you know-- - Oh, goodness.
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:57.120]   (laughs)
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:13:58.040]   - Oh my goodness.
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:00.080]   - Yes, the T&P Leing Surfine and T&P Leing
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:02.080]   when faced with vulnerabilities has historically--
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:03.560]   - They patch 'em. - Yeah.
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:04.400]   - Yeah.
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:06.520]   - You know, it's funny, we were talking on security now
[02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:09.160]   about a router vulnerability
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:12.800]   and how most routers don't auto update their firmware.
[02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:14.880]   And you've, I actually quote you all the time, Stacey.
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:15.720]   You've always said,
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:18.720]   do not buy any IoT device that doesn't have
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:20.360]   auto update capability.
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:23.880]   And somebody wrote to us and said, hey, good news,
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:26.840]   I have a T&P link, it auto updated, it fixed it,
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:28.480]   it patched the vulnerability.
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:29.320]   - Oh, good.
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:31.160]   - I think T&P link is a good company, yeah.
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:34.880]   - A lot of the new ones too, but yeah, so--
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:35.720]   - Yikes.
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:38.280]   - So yeah, WeMo, don't ever buy their stuff, period.
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:42.120]   If I've ever shown you them, just say, Stacey, you are wrong.
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:43.560]   I may a culpa-- - You didn't know.
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:44.920]   - No, you didn't. - I'm just not being you now.
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:46.600]   - You didn't know, but they are still selling them,
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:48.760]   which is a little bit disappointing.
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:50.840]   - Yeah, people show you who they are, believe it.
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:54.520]   - So it's not Belkin anymore, it's now Foxconn or?
[02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:56.520]   - Well, let's see, someone bought them,
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:00.120]   but I think it was Belkin, WeMo, purchased.
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:05.000]   Foxconn purchased an agreed purchase Belkin International
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.900]   that controls links this. - Oh, oh, oh.
[02:15:07.900 --> 02:15:10.520]   - Oh, oh, Foxconn bought Belkin.
[02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:11.760]   Oh. - Yeah.
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:12.900]   - Wow. - Yeah.
[02:15:12.900 --> 02:15:13.740]   - Okay.
[02:15:13.740 --> 02:15:14.740]   - Yeah, that was-- - Maybe I'll stay away
[02:15:14.740 --> 02:15:16.100]   from all Belkin stuff. - That was forever ago.
[02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:18.060]   - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:20.580]   - Belkin was always up and down because they would take,
[02:15:20.580 --> 02:15:25.060]   they would basically relabel, no name Chinese gear,
[02:15:25.060 --> 02:15:25.900]   as Belkin gear.
[02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:27.380]   So some of it was very good.
[02:15:27.380 --> 02:15:28.660]   Some of it was not so good.
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:32.340]   I guess now we know they don't really care.
[02:15:32.340 --> 02:15:33.540]   - Profit.
[02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:34.520]   - Thank you, Stacey.
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:37.420]   - Wow. - Jeff Jarvis, a number?
[02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:40.660]   - Oh, I'm not sure if you're okay.
[02:15:40.660 --> 02:15:41.500]   - Yeah, next.
[02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:46.020]   - I like rebranding the wiener mobile.
[02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:46.860]   (laughing)
[02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:48.180]   - All right, I'm just gonna let that go
[02:15:48.180 --> 02:15:49.020]   and do that for a minute.
[02:15:49.020 --> 02:15:50.100]   - I vote for that.
[02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:51.900]   - You're not getting off that easy.
[02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:55.980]   - After 87 years, the Oscar Mar weener mobile
[02:15:55.980 --> 02:15:58.100]   is now the Frank mobile.
[02:15:58.100 --> 02:15:58.940]   - No.
[02:15:58.940 --> 02:16:01.340]   That's terrible. - It's terrible.
[02:16:01.340 --> 02:16:03.820]   - Of teenage jokes, is that what it is?
[02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:04.660]   - It's, well, you know what?
[02:16:04.660 --> 02:16:06.100]   Nobody calls them wiener's anymore.
[02:16:06.100 --> 02:16:07.340]   I think that's probably the thing.
[02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:08.180]   - Is that what it is?
[02:16:08.180 --> 02:16:09.020]   - Oh, okay.
[02:16:09.020 --> 02:16:10.940]   - No one calls them Frank's either.
[02:16:10.940 --> 02:16:11.980]   (laughing)
[02:16:11.980 --> 02:16:12.800]   - What do you call them?
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:13.640]   Hot dogs.
[02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:14.640]   - Hot dogs.
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:15.480]   - Hot dogs.
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:16.380]   - It's a hot dog mobile.
[02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:17.540]   - You know, my family.
[02:16:17.540 --> 02:16:18.380]   - What do you call them?
[02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:20.340]   - Growing up, it was never wiener's.
[02:16:20.340 --> 02:16:21.460]   It was never Frank's.
[02:16:21.460 --> 02:16:23.780]   It was wiener's.
[02:16:23.780 --> 02:16:24.620]   - Wiener's.
[02:16:24.620 --> 02:16:25.460]   - Wiener's?
[02:16:25.460 --> 02:16:27.380]   - Well, I think the wiener's mobile really is not
[02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:28.220]   gonna be good at it.
[02:16:28.220 --> 02:16:29.060]   - I'm gonna be good at it.
[02:16:29.060 --> 02:16:29.900]   (laughing)
[02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:31.100]   - So it was always strange for me to hear
[02:16:31.100 --> 02:16:34.220]   wiener's and Frank's.
[02:16:34.220 --> 02:16:35.540]   - Wiener's.
[02:16:35.540 --> 02:16:38.580]   - Beans and wiener's.
[02:16:38.580 --> 02:16:39.580]   - Beanie-weenies.
[02:16:39.580 --> 02:16:40.580]   - We used to have beanie-weenies.
[02:16:40.580 --> 02:16:41.580]   - We used to have beanie-weenies.
[02:16:41.580 --> 02:16:42.580]   - I like beanie-weenies.
[02:16:42.580 --> 02:16:43.580]   - When I saw beanie-weenies in the store,
[02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:44.860]   it, that blew my mind.
[02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:45.860]   - You thought it was a family name.
[02:16:45.860 --> 02:16:46.700]   - Yeah.
[02:16:46.700 --> 02:16:47.540]   - Yeah, I did too.
[02:16:47.540 --> 02:16:48.820]   We called them beanie-weenies when I was growing up.
[02:16:48.820 --> 02:16:49.660]   I loved it.
[02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:51.700]   Bake beans and little, this is a hot dog.
[02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:52.940]   - Yeah.
[02:16:52.940 --> 02:16:54.980]   - That's Frank and beans.
[02:16:54.980 --> 02:16:55.980]   - Yeah, see, that's just weird.
[02:16:55.980 --> 02:16:56.820]   - But now it's Frank's.
[02:16:56.820 --> 02:16:57.660]   - That's just weird.
[02:16:57.660 --> 02:16:58.500]   - Why are you eating Frank's?
[02:16:58.500 --> 02:16:59.620]   - All right, so there's one, the Oscar.
[02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:00.940]   I like that one.
[02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:01.780]   What else you got?
[02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:08.780]   - Well, the first thing I want to say is,
[02:17:08.780 --> 02:17:11.780]   in 2016 I went to Google Newsgeist,
[02:17:11.780 --> 02:17:13.780]   and a friend of mine named Jochen Vägner,
[02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:15.780]   who's the editor of a site online in Germany,
[02:17:15.780 --> 02:17:17.780]   saw all us American journalists after the election.
[02:17:17.780 --> 02:17:19.780]   Stop yawning, I can see it on there.
[02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:21.780]   (laughing)
[02:17:21.780 --> 02:17:25.780]   - I'm breaking the fourth wall, the fifth lens.
[02:17:25.780 --> 02:17:26.780]   - Yeah.
[02:17:26.780 --> 02:17:29.780]   - I'm in busted twice today now.
[02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:30.780]   But now they know.
[02:17:30.780 --> 02:17:32.780]   Anyway, so Jochen said he watched all the journalists
[02:17:32.780 --> 02:17:35.780]   in America going nuts after our election in 2016,
[02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:36.780]   and he said this can't happen in Germany.
[02:17:36.780 --> 02:17:37.780]   I got to do something.
[02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:40.780]   And he created something called "Büchlünd Sprigt,"
[02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:43.780]   in which people answered questions at the end of stories
[02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:46.780]   about their views, and then they asked them,
[02:17:46.780 --> 02:17:48.780]   do you want to meet with somebody near you
[02:17:48.780 --> 02:17:49.780]   who disagrees with you in person?
[02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:51.780]   - Oh God, that's my worst nightmare.
[02:17:51.780 --> 02:17:54.780]   - Is that, well, I'm not even having your chance in a second.
[02:17:54.780 --> 02:17:55.780]   So have a chance.
[02:17:55.780 --> 02:17:56.780]   - One privilege.
[02:17:56.780 --> 02:17:57.780]   - One privilege.
[02:17:57.780 --> 02:17:58.780]   - Was matched with...
[02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:01.780]   - It's bad enough I got to talk to Stacey every week.
[02:18:01.780 --> 02:18:03.780]   (laughing)
[02:18:03.780 --> 02:18:04.780]   - Stacey and I.
[02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:06.780]   - So, most of the time.
[02:18:06.780 --> 02:18:10.780]   - So, now, and they now made it into,
[02:18:10.780 --> 02:18:12.780]   I think it's your world speaks.
[02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:14.780]   Is that the world talks?
[02:18:14.780 --> 02:18:15.780]   Your country speaks.
[02:18:15.780 --> 02:18:17.780]   And people can do it in countries, individual countries.
[02:18:17.780 --> 02:18:19.780]   Now they're doing it across the world.
[02:18:19.780 --> 02:18:21.780]   On a given date coming up in June,
[02:18:21.780 --> 02:18:23.780]   if you go to theworldtalks.org,
[02:18:23.780 --> 02:18:25.780]   and you answer, if you scroll down,
[02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:28.780]   you can just answer a few questions, very few.
[02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:29.780]   Sign up.
[02:18:29.780 --> 02:18:30.780]   Just hit sign up.
[02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:31.780]   - No.
[02:18:31.780 --> 02:18:32.780]   (laughing)
[02:18:32.780 --> 02:18:33.780]   - No, you're not gonna worry.
[02:18:33.780 --> 02:18:34.780]   Don't worry, you're not really signing up.
[02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:35.780]   - No, it's Germany.
[02:18:35.780 --> 02:18:36.780]   They believe in privacy.
[02:18:36.780 --> 02:18:38.780]   - Did you get here from a friend?
[02:18:38.780 --> 02:18:39.780]   Yeah.
[02:18:39.780 --> 02:18:40.780]   - No, go to scroll.
[02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:41.780]   - Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.
[02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:42.780]   No, don't scroll.
[02:18:42.780 --> 02:18:44.780]   - Is the world a better place than the first?
[02:18:44.780 --> 02:18:45.780]   - It's a world better workplace.
[02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:46.780]   Answer the question last thing.
[02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:47.780]   - 20 years ago.
[02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:48.780]   Yeah, it is.
[02:18:48.780 --> 02:18:49.780]   - Okay, now you're gonna be--
[02:18:49.780 --> 02:18:50.780]   - This is gonna be like chat roulette after answering the question.
[02:18:50.780 --> 02:18:52.780]   - Does hard work always lead to a better life?
[02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:53.780]   No.
[02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:54.780]   - You're gonna answer these few questions.
[02:18:54.780 --> 02:18:58.780]   - Should climate protection be a priority, even if it means sacrifices?
[02:18:58.780 --> 02:18:59.780]   Yeah.
[02:18:59.780 --> 02:19:02.780]   Should all countries sanction Russia for the war on Ukraine?
[02:19:02.780 --> 02:19:03.780]   Yeah.
[02:19:03.780 --> 02:19:05.780]   Should every company accept your refugees?
[02:19:05.780 --> 02:19:06.780]   Yeah.
[02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:08.780]   Should state and religion be separated?
[02:19:08.780 --> 02:19:09.780]   Yeah.
[02:19:09.780 --> 02:19:12.780]   Should people of every gender have rights, equal rights?
[02:19:12.780 --> 02:19:13.780]   Yeah.
[02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:15.780]   Well, who would say no to any of this?
[02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:17.780]   All older generations living?
[02:19:17.780 --> 02:19:18.780]   Oh, yeah.
[02:19:18.780 --> 02:19:20.780]   At the expense of younger people?
[02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:21.780]   No.
[02:19:21.780 --> 02:19:22.780]   Hell no.
[02:19:22.780 --> 02:19:23.780]   - Um, sir.
[02:19:23.780 --> 02:19:26.780]   - And you disagree more about yourself?
[02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:28.780]   Yeah, about you living.
[02:19:28.780 --> 02:19:31.780]   You'll be matched to someone around the world.
[02:19:31.780 --> 02:19:32.780]   - Yeah.
[02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:33.780]   - To have a one-on-one conversation.
[02:19:33.780 --> 02:19:34.780]   - Agitata.
[02:19:34.780 --> 02:19:37.780]   Just once Stacy likes all the time and says, "Let's have a conversation."
[02:19:37.780 --> 02:19:39.780]   - You're doing a great time.
[02:19:39.780 --> 02:19:40.780]   - Tweet.
[02:19:40.780 --> 02:19:42.780]   - Have a conversation with somebody who just screws with you.
[02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:43.780]   What makes you happy?
[02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:44.780]   Tweeting.
[02:19:44.780 --> 02:19:46.780]   [laughter]
[02:19:46.780 --> 02:19:47.780]   What worries you?
[02:19:47.780 --> 02:19:48.780]   Twitter?
[02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:49.780]   Tweeting.
[02:19:49.780 --> 02:19:50.780]   Okay.
[02:19:50.780 --> 02:19:52.780]   And then now they're gonna pair me up with somebody who disagrees.
[02:19:52.780 --> 02:19:53.780]   With what I just said.
[02:19:53.780 --> 02:19:54.780]   Yes.
[02:19:54.780 --> 02:19:55.780]   - Well, I got it in here.
[02:19:55.780 --> 02:19:57.780]   I don't have to go around the world for that.
[02:19:57.780 --> 02:20:00.780]   I put in here, "What do you do for a living?"
[02:20:00.780 --> 02:20:01.780]   I put "meat hit."
[02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:03.780]   What are you doing in your free time?
[02:20:03.780 --> 02:20:04.780]   I put "whisky."
[02:20:04.780 --> 02:20:06.780]   What makes you happy?
[02:20:06.780 --> 02:20:07.780]   I put "more whiskey."
[02:20:07.780 --> 02:20:08.780]   What worries you?
[02:20:08.780 --> 02:20:10.780]   I put "no whiskey."
[02:20:10.780 --> 02:20:11.780]   You see?
[02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:12.780]   [laughter]
[02:20:12.780 --> 02:20:13.780]   - Because they're too much whiskey.
[02:20:13.780 --> 02:20:14.780]   - No, whiskey!
[02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:15.780]   All right, that's cool.
[02:20:15.780 --> 02:20:17.780]   That is at the World Talks.org.
[02:20:17.780 --> 02:20:18.780]   - The World Talks.
[02:20:18.780 --> 02:20:19.780]   - The World Talks.
[02:20:19.780 --> 02:20:20.780]   - The World Talks.
[02:20:20.780 --> 02:20:21.780]   - The D site in Duchland.
[02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:22.780]   - Duchland.
[02:20:22.780 --> 02:20:26.780]   - So, how did the original German version do?
[02:20:26.780 --> 02:20:28.780]   - It did very well.
[02:20:28.780 --> 02:20:33.780]   My favorite part of the story was that one woman was linked by, matched by the algorithm
[02:20:33.780 --> 02:20:35.780]   with her father-in-law.
[02:20:35.780 --> 02:20:36.780]   - Oh.
[02:20:36.780 --> 02:20:37.780]   - Yeah.
[02:20:37.780 --> 02:20:38.780]   - Oh.
[02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:39.780]   - And they had--
[02:20:39.780 --> 02:20:41.780]   - That would be my worst nightmare to be mentioned by father-in-law.
[02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:42.780]   - Exactly.
[02:20:42.780 --> 02:20:47.780]   I think they had 1,000 people who got together one-on-one in person, and there were no fistfights.
[02:20:47.780 --> 02:20:48.780]   Nobody--
[02:20:48.780 --> 02:20:49.780]   - Nice.
[02:20:49.780 --> 02:20:50.780]   - The American might be dangerous, but--
[02:20:50.780 --> 02:20:51.780]   - The Germany wasn't.
[02:20:51.780 --> 02:20:55.380]   - And then they've done another country since, and it's really kind of a neat experiment
[02:20:55.380 --> 02:20:57.780]   that says, "You know, you can meet people."
[02:20:57.780 --> 02:21:00.780]   - It's one of those ideas that sounds good in principle.
[02:21:00.780 --> 02:21:01.780]   - I know.
[02:21:01.780 --> 02:21:02.780]   But it's kind of worked.
[02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:05.780]   - Hey, I'm glad they're people who will actually do that.
[02:21:05.780 --> 02:21:06.780]   - Exactly.
[02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:07.780]   - Yeah.
[02:21:07.780 --> 02:21:09.780]   - Yeah, I was debating whether to do it myself or the other.
[02:21:09.780 --> 02:21:11.780]   - I don't know what I'm talking about.
[02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:13.780]   - Because I'm going to get-- no, you see, you know what it's like--
[02:21:13.780 --> 02:21:14.780]   - I just get upset.
[02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:15.780]   - I just get upset.
[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:16.780]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:22.500]   - I'm just upsetting to talk to people who don't agree with my 100% correct points of
[02:21:22.500 --> 02:21:23.500]   view.
[02:21:23.500 --> 02:21:25.500]   - And the numbers you always present, which are always--
[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:26.500]   - Yeah, sure.
[02:21:26.500 --> 02:21:27.500]   - That could be great.
[02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:28.980]   - Did we disagree over whether old people are living off of young people?
[02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:29.980]   - Yes, we did.
[02:21:29.980 --> 02:21:32.340]   - You think that I am abusing your youth.
[02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:34.140]   Wait a minute, you're old.
[02:21:34.140 --> 02:21:35.140]   - I'm not old, I'm old-ish.
[02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:40.340]   - Oh my gosh, we're so close to the end, you all.
[02:21:40.340 --> 02:21:41.340]   - There's a difference.
[02:21:41.340 --> 02:21:43.340]   - I love having a host.
[02:21:43.340 --> 02:21:46.340]   - Today's season, the body is full of show to be over.
[02:21:46.340 --> 02:21:47.340]   - By the minute.
[02:21:47.340 --> 02:21:50.580]   - All right, Aunt, it's time for your thing.
[02:21:50.580 --> 02:21:54.060]   - My thing, a quick shout out to Viewbug.com.
[02:21:54.060 --> 02:21:57.380]   Remember, I was a judge for a photo contest in Viewbug.
[02:21:57.380 --> 02:21:59.740]   It was their early morning photo contest.
[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:02.020]   It was 17,000 entries.
[02:22:02.020 --> 02:22:04.580]   Thank you to everybody who's just evaded.
[02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:06.980]   They whittled it down for me to pick.
[02:22:06.980 --> 02:22:09.700]   And I picked the list of photos.
[02:22:09.700 --> 02:22:10.700]   - I can't get in.
[02:22:10.700 --> 02:22:11.700]   - Why can't you get in?
[02:22:11.700 --> 02:22:12.700]   It should have left.
[02:22:12.700 --> 02:22:13.700]   - You have to have an account.
[02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:14.700]   - No, you don't.
[02:22:14.700 --> 02:22:15.700]   It was-- ah, shucks.
[02:22:15.700 --> 02:22:16.700]   - You don't have to fix that link.
[02:22:16.700 --> 02:22:18.180]   - Does it mean I have to participate?
[02:22:18.180 --> 02:22:19.180]   I don't want to--
[02:22:19.180 --> 02:22:20.180]   - No.
[02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:21.180]   - Anyway, outside in here, we'll see.
[02:22:21.180 --> 02:22:22.180]   - Yeah, there should be a public link there,
[02:22:22.180 --> 02:22:23.660]   but Viewbug.com, early morning content.
[02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:24.660]   - Early morning content.
[02:22:24.660 --> 02:22:27.260]   - Oh, this is if I wanted to upload some photos, I guess.
[02:22:27.260 --> 02:22:28.260]   - Right.
[02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:32.060]   - Yeah, I want to see the-- I want to see the explore photo contests.
[02:22:32.060 --> 02:22:34.940]   - Uh, should be completed.
[02:22:34.940 --> 02:22:37.420]   I had to fix the link for our show notes, I guess.
[02:22:37.420 --> 02:22:39.300]   - No, no, no, the link was fine.
[02:22:39.300 --> 02:22:40.420]   I clicked a button.
[02:22:40.420 --> 02:22:41.420]   It was my fault.
[02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:42.420]   - Nice work.
[02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:43.420]   - Yeah.
[02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:47.180]   - Let me do that again, because if you-- the link that we'll put in the show notes, it
[02:22:47.180 --> 02:22:48.980]   says, "This is it," right?
[02:22:48.980 --> 02:22:49.980]   - Yep, that's it.
[02:22:49.980 --> 02:22:50.980]   - So I pressed View winner.
[02:22:50.980 --> 02:22:51.980]   That was my mistake.
[02:22:51.980 --> 02:22:52.980]   - No, don't do that.
[02:22:52.980 --> 02:22:53.980]   - Don't press throw down, because that's the winner.
[02:22:53.980 --> 02:22:54.980]   - Oh my god, that's gorgeous.
[02:22:54.980 --> 02:22:55.980]   - That's a very, very--
[02:22:55.980 --> 02:22:56.980]   - Oh, wow.
[02:22:56.980 --> 02:22:57.980]   - I got a question, man.
[02:22:57.980 --> 02:22:58.980]   - Why is that?
[02:22:58.980 --> 02:23:01.820]   - Is that a real-- how do you know that's a real photo?
[02:23:01.820 --> 02:23:03.060]   - Uh, I pixel peeped.
[02:23:03.060 --> 02:23:04.060]   That was real.
[02:23:04.060 --> 02:23:05.060]   - That's gorgeous.
[02:23:05.060 --> 02:23:06.060]   - That's gorgeous.
[02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:08.860]   - One of them is actually an iPhone shot.
[02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:09.860]   - Wow.
[02:23:09.860 --> 02:23:12.660]   - That's the second run, the first run up and then the second run.
[02:23:12.660 --> 02:23:15.380]   - Oh, by the way, I said that, because the first photo is so amazing.
[02:23:15.380 --> 02:23:16.540]   You think a computer made up?
[02:23:16.540 --> 02:23:19.300]   - Yeah, well, yeah, I was like, I didn't know there was a place that looked like that.
[02:23:19.300 --> 02:23:22.060]   And then I'm like, man, where did these people find the horses?
[02:23:22.060 --> 02:23:24.380]   - Well, they were camping in that first shot.
[02:23:24.380 --> 02:23:25.380]   - Really?
[02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:27.340]   - And they're like, yeah, we're going for our tent.
[02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:30.620]   This is what we open our tent to.
[02:23:30.620 --> 02:23:32.220]   - That's why you camp.
[02:23:32.220 --> 02:23:33.460]   - Yeah, it's beautiful stuff.
[02:23:33.460 --> 02:23:34.820]   - This is also gorgeous.
[02:23:34.820 --> 02:23:35.820]   - Yeah.
[02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:36.820]   - Now, the last one here--
[02:23:36.820 --> 02:23:40.500]   - I'm glad you chose this, because it's not a landscape, and I kind of like that.
[02:23:40.500 --> 02:23:44.940]   - I made this one a part of the list, but I couldn't make it a winner, because the
[02:23:44.940 --> 02:23:48.260]   file name says Night Train.
[02:23:48.260 --> 02:23:50.260]   It's supposed to be a morning contest.
[02:23:50.260 --> 02:23:51.260]   - Oh.
[02:23:51.260 --> 02:23:54.340]   Well, if you ride the train all night, the sun will come out.
[02:23:54.340 --> 02:23:55.660]   - The sun will rise up.
[02:23:55.660 --> 02:23:56.660]   - Yeah.
[02:23:56.660 --> 02:23:58.260]   - Isn't that what's happening here?
[02:23:58.260 --> 02:23:59.900]   - Yeah, maybe.
[02:23:59.900 --> 02:24:01.260]   - It's a night in train.
[02:24:01.260 --> 02:24:02.260]   - I mean, that's what I assume.
[02:24:02.260 --> 02:24:03.260]   - Oh, that's another beautiful one.
[02:24:03.260 --> 02:24:04.820]   - That's the people's choice.
[02:24:04.820 --> 02:24:06.380]   So what is Viewbug?
[02:24:06.380 --> 02:24:08.300]   It's just another photo community.
[02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:09.300]   Think of Flickr.
[02:24:09.300 --> 02:24:12.540]   - Is that the Momo Bridge, the one between Copenhagen and Momo?
[02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:13.540]   - It looks like it doesn't.
[02:24:13.540 --> 02:24:14.540]   - It sounds sweetened.
[02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:15.540]   - Yeah, it looks pretty.
[02:24:15.540 --> 02:24:16.540]   - Yeah.
[02:24:16.540 --> 02:24:17.540]   - It is so pretty.
[02:24:17.540 --> 02:24:18.540]   - Oh, that'd scare me.
[02:24:18.540 --> 02:24:19.540]   That'd scare me bad.
[02:24:19.540 --> 02:24:22.100]   My pick of the week next week is going to be for you, Mr. Jarvis.
[02:24:22.100 --> 02:24:23.420]   I'm looking forward to it.
[02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:25.420]   I've already picked it out.
[02:24:25.420 --> 02:24:31.540]   Oh, and my other pick, I want to say don't leave home without it.
[02:24:31.540 --> 02:24:33.580]   And it is as simple as this little--
[02:24:33.580 --> 02:24:34.580]   - This is 20,000--
[02:24:34.580 --> 02:24:37.500]   - From a guy who spends a lot of time on the sideline.
[02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:41.180]   (laughter)
[02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:47.100]   - This is where you take to every football game, baseball game, soccer game, lacrosse game.
[02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:49.580]   Or just because you feel like sitting outside.
[02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:50.940]   - Yeah, that's true.
[02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:52.100]   It's got a cup holder.
[02:24:52.100 --> 02:24:53.100]   - I had lunch today.
[02:24:53.100 --> 02:24:55.340]   - I've seen so many of these at the game.
[02:24:55.340 --> 02:24:57.500]   - Art-twits sponsored lunch today.
[02:24:57.500 --> 02:24:58.500]   I had it outside.
[02:24:58.500 --> 02:25:01.020]   - Oh, you actually took your hamburger and went outside?
[02:25:01.020 --> 02:25:02.020]   - Went outside.
[02:25:02.020 --> 02:25:04.460]   - And it's because I always have my chair with me.
[02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:06.500]   And part of that comes with you at all times.
[02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:09.340]   - Yeah, I keep an orange shirt and my tromp.
[02:25:09.340 --> 02:25:10.340]   - You keep it in my pants?
[02:25:10.340 --> 02:25:13.100]   - My chair, not so comment.
[02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:14.860]   - I thought those slides were long.
[02:25:14.860 --> 02:25:17.420]   I didn't realize you had a chair in there.
[02:25:17.420 --> 02:25:18.900]   - No, these are-- you know what?
[02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:20.340]   These are like, classic.
[02:25:20.340 --> 02:25:21.340]   - This is so good.
[02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:22.340]   - This is a classic.
[02:25:22.340 --> 02:25:23.340]   - You can't beat them.
[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:24.340]   - Yeah.
[02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:29.460]   - We keep two of these in our car during the summer season for impromptu basically like,
[02:25:29.460 --> 02:25:32.020]   "Oh, look, it's a festival or, oh, look, there's snow on you."
[02:25:32.020 --> 02:25:33.500]   - You need these all the time.
[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:34.500]   - Yeah.
[02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:37.180]   - You buy one, 20 bucks or so and throw it in the back of your car.
[02:25:37.180 --> 02:25:39.020]   It's always there when you need it.
[02:25:39.020 --> 02:25:40.020]   I use it for the--
[02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:41.620]   - Do you keep car clothes?
[02:25:41.620 --> 02:25:47.540]   - The only car clothes I have is I have my, I have an orange sweatshirt or an orange shirt.
[02:25:47.540 --> 02:25:48.540]   - What the hell is a car clothes?
[02:25:48.540 --> 02:25:50.540]   - You use it in the back of my car.
[02:25:50.540 --> 02:25:51.540]   - What is that?
[02:25:51.540 --> 02:25:52.940]   - Because in case I want to go on a water walk.
[02:25:52.940 --> 02:25:53.940]   - Car clothes.
[02:25:53.940 --> 02:25:54.900]   - Yeah, so we keep car clothes.
[02:25:54.900 --> 02:25:56.900]   We have a bucket.
[02:25:56.900 --> 02:25:57.900]   It's not a bucket.
[02:25:57.900 --> 02:26:04.460]   It's one of those cloth bins and it's got a pair of sweatpants, a hat, a scarf, a sweater.
[02:26:04.460 --> 02:26:05.460]   - Is that in case--
[02:26:05.460 --> 02:26:06.460]   - A blanket.
[02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:08.740]   - You go to the beach and your clothes disappear and then--
[02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:11.980]   - No, it's 'cause I live in Seattle and like you drive like--
[02:26:11.980 --> 02:26:12.980]   - Oh, Jesus.
[02:26:12.980 --> 02:26:13.980]   - Yeah.
[02:26:13.980 --> 02:26:14.980]   - Yeah, you're like, "Now it's hot.
[02:26:14.980 --> 02:26:15.980]   Now it's cold."
[02:26:15.980 --> 02:26:21.660]   - Well, while you were gone, these people both admitted that they pack screwdrivers in their
[02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:22.660]   suitcases.
[02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:23.660]   - What?
[02:26:23.660 --> 02:26:24.660]   - He probably does, too.
[02:26:24.660 --> 02:26:26.660]   - No, I don't have a screwdriver in my suitcase.
[02:26:26.660 --> 02:26:27.660]   - The screwdriver's in that case.
[02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:28.660]   - You have a multi-tool.
[02:26:28.660 --> 02:26:31.900]   - All right, I want a tour of Stacy's trunk.
[02:26:31.900 --> 02:26:33.900]   - That's a good one.
[02:26:33.900 --> 02:26:35.540]   - I can see how they wanted you to talk.
[02:26:35.540 --> 02:26:36.540]   That makes sense.
[02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:39.660]   - The only other thing we have is the picnic blanket.
[02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:40.820]   I mean, we have the chargers.
[02:26:40.820 --> 02:26:42.460]   - Actually, I do carry a multi-tool.
[02:26:42.460 --> 02:26:43.460]   You're the--
[02:26:43.460 --> 02:26:44.460]   - I carry a multi-tool.
[02:26:44.460 --> 02:26:45.460]   - Yeah, we have a multi-tool.
[02:26:45.460 --> 02:26:46.460]   - Yeah, that's a--
[02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:47.460]   - In your suitcase.
[02:26:47.460 --> 02:26:48.460]   - Yeah.
[02:26:48.460 --> 02:26:49.460]   - You never know.
[02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:50.460]   - You never know.
[02:26:50.460 --> 02:26:56.300]   - Lately, before we left on this last trip, I bought any Anako recommended these three LED
[02:26:56.300 --> 02:26:57.300]   lights.
[02:26:57.300 --> 02:27:01.540]   They're a little, like postage stamp size and I just bought them and I kind of scattered
[02:27:01.540 --> 02:27:02.540]   them around.
[02:27:02.540 --> 02:27:05.100]   You know, there's a fire, the lights go out.
[02:27:05.100 --> 02:27:06.100]   You got a light.
[02:27:06.100 --> 02:27:07.100]   - That's true.
[02:27:07.100 --> 02:27:08.100]   - Yeah.
[02:27:08.100 --> 02:27:09.100]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:10.100]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:12.940]   We do also keep two headlamps in our car.
[02:27:12.940 --> 02:27:13.940]   - Yeah, headlamps.
[02:27:13.940 --> 02:27:17.340]   - I want a special outdoor version of Stacy's Things.
[02:27:17.340 --> 02:27:18.340]   - Dude.
[02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:20.340]   - Oh, you know what else I want to see the back of the car.
[02:27:20.340 --> 02:27:21.660]   - Then I keep in the car at all times.
[02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:24.060]   I keep a special device that has a light.
[02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:25.060]   It'll have a blinker.
[02:27:25.060 --> 02:27:28.940]   It's like a flare, but it has a magnet on it so you can put any part of the car and it
[02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:30.780]   has a seatbelt cutter in it.
[02:27:30.780 --> 02:27:34.780]   So if you get out of your seatbelt and you're getting a wreck.
[02:27:34.780 --> 02:27:36.780]   - Can you use it to break the window to get out?
[02:27:36.780 --> 02:27:38.780]   - Yes, it has a little window tab.
[02:27:38.780 --> 02:27:39.780]   - Yeah.
[02:27:39.780 --> 02:27:41.420]   - Mr. Jarvis, do you go camping?
[02:27:41.420 --> 02:27:42.820]   - Well, probably not now.
[02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:43.820]   - No, no.
[02:27:43.820 --> 02:27:46.340]   In fact, I broke up with it.
[02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:50.300]   I moved to California, my girlfriend at the time was an editor of the Chicago Tribune
[02:27:50.300 --> 02:27:53.660]   and she was kind of an outdoorsy person and she came and she said, "We're going to go
[02:27:53.660 --> 02:27:55.660]   to Yosemite because we have reunions."
[02:27:55.660 --> 02:27:56.660]   - Yeah, you haven't been to Yosemite yet.
[02:27:56.660 --> 02:27:57.660]   - Oh, no, I was just having to go.
[02:27:57.660 --> 02:27:58.660]   - I was just so great.
[02:27:58.660 --> 02:28:03.940]   - And it was snowing and I said, "No, I'm not staying out in a tent."
[02:28:03.940 --> 02:28:04.940]   No.
[02:28:04.940 --> 02:28:08.660]   And it broke up the relationship and it was not meant to be.
[02:28:08.660 --> 02:28:09.660]   - I want the tasu.
[02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:11.660]   - Do you keep car snacks?
[02:28:11.660 --> 02:28:14.660]   - Yeah, there's normally some snacks in my glove box.
[02:28:14.660 --> 02:28:16.660]   - Yeah, there's a car snacks.
[02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:17.660]   - Both of them.
[02:28:17.660 --> 02:28:21.020]   - My kills have yelled at me because I don't have tissues and water in my mouth.
[02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:22.020]   - Tissues are always in there.
[02:28:22.020 --> 02:28:25.140]   - And they said, "Mom has tissues and water in her car."
[02:28:25.140 --> 02:28:26.340]   - I have water in my trunk.
[02:28:26.340 --> 02:28:28.340]   I'm not mom.
[02:28:28.340 --> 02:28:29.340]   - Yeah.
[02:28:29.340 --> 02:28:31.340]   - I have all that.
[02:28:31.340 --> 02:28:32.340]   - I can't.
[02:28:32.340 --> 02:28:35.940]   - In honor of your winning photo, I want to mention just a little thing in my minion
[02:28:35.940 --> 02:28:36.940]   Fogarty.
[02:28:36.940 --> 02:28:38.940]   If you don't follow her, she's Grammar Girl.
[02:28:38.940 --> 02:28:39.940]   - Grammar Girl.
[02:28:39.940 --> 02:28:40.940]   - She's wonderful.
[02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:45.140]   She found out this week that there is a mountain in Washington state named Esclamation Point.
[02:28:45.140 --> 02:28:46.140]   - Oh, nice.
[02:28:46.140 --> 02:28:47.140]   - Isn't that great?
[02:28:47.140 --> 02:28:48.140]   - Isn't that great?
[02:28:48.140 --> 02:28:49.140]   - Isn't that great?
[02:28:49.140 --> 02:28:51.340]   - Does she find it on Peak Finder?
[02:28:51.340 --> 02:28:53.340]   - Good one.
[02:28:53.340 --> 02:28:54.340]   - Good one.
[02:28:54.340 --> 02:28:55.340]   - There is some--
[02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:56.340]   - What's her name again?
[02:28:56.340 --> 02:28:57.340]   - Minion Fogarty.
[02:28:57.340 --> 02:28:58.340]   She's on Massimo.
[02:28:58.340 --> 02:28:59.340]   - That was my pink fogarty.
[02:28:59.340 --> 02:29:00.340]   - She's Grammar Girl.
[02:29:00.340 --> 02:29:01.340]   - Is my pick of the week.
[02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:02.340]   - Oh, Peak Finder.
[02:29:02.340 --> 02:29:03.340]   - Oh, OK.
[02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:04.340]   - Peak Finder.
[02:29:04.340 --> 02:29:07.340]   Like several, like, I think a year ago, that's one of my picks of me.
[02:29:07.340 --> 02:29:11.820]   - Grammar Girl at CERCZiRK.US.
