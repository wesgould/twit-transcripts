[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:19.200]   It's time for twig this week at Google the show we get together and talk about whatever is on our minds
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.040]   Sometimes with Google Facebook Twitter the internet media
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.240]   journalism and
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.600]   Jeff Jarvis, it's all part of the plan Jeff would normally be in Davos right now
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.000]   But the effort is took me off the list the efforts
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.280]   So used to get a press pass to go to I was a member of the international media council nice
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:51.600]   But I brought them no money, but I brought them no money. So they use my seat for somebody else. Yeah, that's fair
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.320]   That and I apparently like
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.960]   Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and they don't oh really Washington boats. Yes, so
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.760]   Wait a minute Davos the billionaire is don't like her Davos has in a pit. Yeah, I would bet
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.440]   70% tax marginal tax rate would be a
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.840]   Sticking point for some of Washington posted it just in a story about how her name comes up often
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.840]   Which is a reason to like her
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.960]   That's Jeff Jarvis professor journalism at the City of University of New York
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.640]   Also here Stacy Higginbotham she
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.900]   covers IOT for Stacy on IOT.com and does a great IOT podcast with Kevin Tofel. Hi Stacy
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.300]   And she's stuffy and has a scarf to keep her threat warm. I have to say you feeling okay
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.300]   Are you feeling bad or is it just kind of irritating?
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.040]   I'm not feeling my best
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.460]   Just a little cold. Oh, sorry. This is gonna be sad Stacy. This is a bit of Stacy. Yeah, no
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.800]   Yeah, just ask hey
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.040]   What do you think of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.520]   Do you have an opinion?
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.760]   Now the 1% don't like her, but you know you could still win with 99% of the votes. That's the key
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.480]   So Google we just got an update from Stacy Higginbotham who brought us this breaking news
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.160]   Google has been fine. We knew this by the French
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.240]   regulator for privacy CNIL as Jeff says can you
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.060]   50 million dollars for violating GDPR
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.680]   Stacy says Google has announced it's going to fight
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.480]   I can pull up a story for you 50 million euros, which is about 57 million dollars
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.280]   Now actually if I read this properly
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.320]   It's canneal explained Google had violated two provisions of the law. This is according to ours technica
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.760]   first
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:55.080]   By not making its data collection policies easily accessible enough they didn't contend that the policies weren't available
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.160]   To end users. It's just that there were too many different places. It was too difficult to find
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.560]   And then second by not obtaining sufficient and specific
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.120]   User consent for ad personalization canneal said it has to be
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.600]   Every single place you're doing it. You can't just say in general
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.240]   Do you do you mind if we collect data about you for personalizing ads? You have to say it at youtube
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.400]   You have to say at google maps. You have to say it and hang out. You have to say it every single service
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.320]   and
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.480]   Plus so that's only because
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.280]   Google is more split up than other things but but but sure should the new york-tow should should
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.960]   The the the loom have to ask your permission in the food section and the book section
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.280]   Right and the news section and the sports section
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.320]   It's basically equivalent. Well, it isn't though because that all comes in a package called a newspaper not anymore. It doesn't
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.280]   What? Oh, I'm you
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.960]   Yeah
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.960]   You you go to the same site
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.880]   And google doesn't I mean you know maps is owned by google and you know
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.400]   Android maybe not but all the other google properties you are aware that they're owned by google google
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.880]   Google changed this remember we made a big we talked a lot about it a couple of years ago when google
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.840]   Unified their privacy policy across the board for all of its services youtube was the big one that hadn't for a long time
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.200]   They'd really run separately they incorporated all of it together
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.840]   And obviously from you from google's point of view it makes sense to aggregate a bunch
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.840]   It a lot of this happens to a lot in media
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.280]   where you'll aggregate a bunch of different kinds of
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:37.160]   platforms or media or into one thing because it's easier to sell that big thing and then spread it out
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.440]   Now who is max shrimps because this
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:49.000]   He is an Austrian who has been the thorn in the side of all the platforms especially facebook but also google where he's done
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.200]   Projects
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.720]   Stunts where he shows how much the platforms follow him or he he
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:08.520]   Showed how his phone followed him everywhere and so he he's a provocateur and he ends up then filing suits
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.640]   On behalf of all europe against the various platforms
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:19.720]   So he says in this article by ours following the introduction of gdpr
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.000]   We have found that large corporations such as google
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.520]   Simply interprets a lot differently and have only
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:35.080]   Superficially adopted their products. It is important the authorities make it clear that simply claiming to be compliant is not enough
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:42.440]   He runs an organization called n o y b dot eu not your business or none of your business. Dot eu
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.160]   It's also completed against instagram. What's happened facebook those are all pending
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:56.520]   So I think this is there is room for appeal here because they're not saying google doesn't tell people they're just saying they don't make it easily
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.680]   Which would think that there'd be a step. I don't know what what happened what keneel did was two questions
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.440]   Was there a step here where keneel said guys you're not doing this right and then there was a chance to remedy
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.840]   And then that's what the gdpr is
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.720]   They passed a law and the next step when she passed a law is to start enforcing the law
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.560]   So that's the answer to your first question. So this is the act of enforcement
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.640]   And then there's but is it not the first time as somebody's been fined under gdpr or no
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.080]   I know there've been some smaller fines in different countries
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.160]   One of the questions we had last year when gdpr became law and one of the things a lot of people said is well
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.160]   Let's wait and see how they enforce it
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.560]   You know, yeah, because they were very
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:44.840]   Quiet they were very quiet about how they were going to enforce it and different data protection agencies have different
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.040]   They are each able to enforce it right so
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:56.040]   That's why they say and okay and none of them prior to actually the law being passed
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.480]   None of them gave any indication of how they were going to do this. So
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.920]   What's happening here is it this is I mean
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.640]   This is how the law works
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.640]   He passed a law then you're like
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.960]   And in google but sometimes
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.000]   They were going to be the target sometimes and I think gdpr had this isn't there kind of this
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.160]   Process where under the law you're warned
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:25.400]   offered an opportunity to remediate then if you don't then that's the safe that's the safe harbor stuff or copyright
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.120]   Yeah, I don't think that's gdpr
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.080]   But but i'm so serious my real question is this
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:37.160]   So the french can go now or finding google can the germans and then and the norwegians and the
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.880]   The dutch also find google under the same law. I thought it was he was no
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.480]   Under what I don't know so every
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.200]   country
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   has their own
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:56.840]   Group that monitors it so I don't yeah, I don't know if you can be fine multiple times
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.880]   That is an excellent question that you would have to ask a lawyer
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.720]   But would you like google statement? Yes, yes, please
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.880]   Here is what a google spokesperson spokesperson said in a statement
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:15.320]   We've worked hard to create a gdpr concept process for personalized ads that is as transparent and straightforward as possible
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.760]   Based on a regulatory guidance and user experience testing
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:26.920]   We're also concerned about the impact of this ruling on publishers original content creators and tech companies in europe and beyond
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.680]   Duh, duh, duh, duh, and we should point out
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.920]   That
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:39.560]   This is not the full extent of the fine they could have it will have you to find up to 4% of the global revenue 2%
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.360]   4%
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.360]   Which would have been $4 billion
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:50.680]   This $50 million is frankly google could easily pay it. I think this is right appealing it
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.840]   Is a print is on principle?
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:59.160]   And they should I mean this is how we figure these things out. I mean this regulation hasn't been tested in court
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.920]   um
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.440]   I think one could argue that a $57 million fine is either
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.240]   You know
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:13.000]   Tied to the I guess how badly the french regulators feel that google has screwed up
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.320]   So maybe they're like, yeah, this isn't a huge thing, but it's kind of a thing google. So let's get this fixed
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.280]   So there's a lot of different ways you could interpret this
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.320]   So here's the question
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:29.720]   And this isn't a legal question, but I think it it speaks to the issue
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.240]   Does
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.560]   A why doesn't google make it clearer
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.480]   You know, I mean why don't they just say okay fine. We'll put a we'll put a pop up everywhere
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:48.360]   Why don't they make it clear and is do people really not know what's going on?
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:55.400]   Do they need to make it clearer? Are there is google not doing a good job completely independent of the law information
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:03.080]   I think it's really hard. So I was actually talking to a company just before I did this this show
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.280]   About how they could improve their security
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.320]   how they could improve communications around their data collection and security practices
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.760]   and
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.520]   You know the solution I came up with is actually doing some sort of interactive quiz and in sending people to take it to get
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.160]   What is actually informed consent, right?
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.480]   And I think it's just so overwhelming to contemplate these things
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.120]   we don't have a language for
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.040]   plain language for the for a lot of these issues, right and
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:40.760]   Every company is worried or many companies are worried about the risk of scaring people if they actually explain kind of some of the risks and things because people
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.480]   will read the worst into it. So
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.040]   There's like a business sphere here
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.840]   There's a it's really hard to get informed consent over something as complicated as house
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:57.720]   Someone like google might use your data from different services and then three readers are users aren't actually going to click through it
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.480]   so
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.480]   I think that's why
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.640]   That's a real issue that we we just have to solve and no one's sure how
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.600]   it's my opinion
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.600]   that google doesn't care
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:16.760]   If they have to put it up everywhere because they think most people don't they go yeah
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.800]   Yeah, yeah and go on with they're not going to do anything about it
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.840]   That there's no harm and I bet you they have data to show this
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.160]   Other services you might say uh is it not worth it and leave but google you're not going to leave
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.520]   Right and they and google knows they're going to do fine no matter what
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.600]   You know you could it's like it's like
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.640]   Cigarettes you could put all the warnings on the cigarette pack you want you're still going to sell them
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.000]   And I think yeah, let's be honest. This is a political act
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.240]   So I put up in the in the chat there were other fines there were four other
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:50.360]   Examples and then I put in the chat. Yes. No, I can't find them. I have the link here
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.440]   Okay, good
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:57.880]   A Portuguese hospital was fined 400,000 euro after the staff used bogus accounts to access patient
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.120]   reheard so german social media and chat service was
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.200]   20,000 euro
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.840]   For storing social media passwords and plain text
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.040]   Uh, it was in austria was fined
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.040]   4,800 for having a security camera that was filming public space
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.240]   Which I think is all over europe would be that as a may
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.120]   But the problem is we didn't know any of that that didn't make any big splash. It's a political act
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.840]   Now the whole world knows about gdpr being
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.480]   Uh keneyol's business because they went after google google or facebook
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:34.040]   It's not true. Oh, it's a political act. Okay. It's not just a political act google and facebook have
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.120]   the
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.120]   most
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:44.440]   Most to lose in some ways. I mean they're what people care about so in that sense. Yes, but they're also
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.920]   Some of the biggest vacuum cleaners out there sucking up our data and using it
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.320]   And so if you can get google and facebook to comply with gdpr
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.560]   There's going to be a couple of effects one people will feel more secure overall
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:04.600]   Two google and facebook could develop or open source technology that makes it easier for other companies to adopt
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.240]   You know to be compliant with gdpr
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.200]   They have all the smart people in the room some portuguese hospital
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.720]   No
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.600]   Well, this is they don't have this is really telling if you look at what the previous fines have been
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.000]   They've been for things. We would all agree
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.840]   Are really egregious breaches of trust the
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.320]   You know the the staff use bogus accounts to access patient records
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.360]   the
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.960]   social media pastor stored in plain text a security camera filming public space these are
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.000]   That last month. Oh, we're
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.160]   Okay, you're right. It's a public space, but no anyway
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:47.640]   You could say okay, that's as good. These are this is stuff privacy regulations should definitely address
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:54.120]   But you could say with the google thing that that was that's like well google. You're just not open enough
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:01.400]   It's not like i'll tell you you want to find yours of fine. This just came out and this is incredibly infuriating
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.400]   um
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.040]   This this morning we learned that a database
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:11.320]   with more than 24 million financial and banking documents
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.600]   from some of the biggest banks in the u.s
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.840]   Was online in the clear with no login no password and he would could access it
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:26.760]   it was exposed for two weeks an independent security researcher found it as soon as
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.640]   tech crunch asked banks who's who's this whose customer service
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.120]   Information wasn't the budget is was shut down january 15th just a week ago
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.560]   The leak was trans traced back to a company
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.080]   That the third party the financial industry uses
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:50.920]   They among the services they provided this company ascension converts paper documents and handwritten notes into computer readable files
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.960]   It's an ocr company. So they did ocr for these banks and some big banks by the way
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.120]   including
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.400]   city financial hsbc life insurance wells fargo capital one
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.160]   And the u.s department of housing and urban development
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:12.440]   These records were online. They included not everything social security numbers
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.680]   Checking account numbers names address birth dates loan agreements
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.600]   Look at this is a sample record that kinds of stuff
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:26.360]   This was all in the public now that should have an egregious fine. That's a breach just like us
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.480]   The before you talked about before except well, maybe not the the security camera
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:37.880]   But that to me is a really good look admittedly they can prosecute anything they want
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.360]   But why isn't keneel go? I mean this is the kind of thing I would I think gdp
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.240]   not well that's in the us and they're
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:52.360]   They will prosecute those things, but they also this law has a bunch of this is not just
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.360]   Hey, you're storing your passwords in a crappy way. This law is supposed to help
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.360]   Inform and let users control their data
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.920]   And that's why they're going after a variety of cases
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:11.000]   I mean so leo do you have a tunnel bear or something on your on your machine there? Can you go act as if you're in
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.720]   france
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:20.280]   Redley not easily. Okay. So that's why I want to see what what I want to see if I go in to one of these services
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.280]   What does it was what does it give me?
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.960]   Because you know, here's the thing this day. So since it's a minute ago
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:33.480]   Google has the best darn lawyers you could imagine so you you got to believe that they went over this with a fine tooth comb
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:39.080]   And came up with their view of the of the of the best and practiced most defensible
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:46.040]   Implementation of GDPR they could imagine they were gonna screw around it was not worth it for them to screw around with us. Right?
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:52.280]   And and I think we used to before is right there. There's a there's a there's a hunger judgment
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:59.960]   Appertime for a judgment call. This is a case. This isn't a blatantly obvious breach of public trust. This is a judgment case
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:04.760]   Right. Well, this is this is establishing the boundaries of the law and I think
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:13.080]   Well, I think that yeah, but it is. I mean like come on. It's it's definitely political. It's definitely
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.800]   it's political in the sense that
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:22.520]   Creating laws is political. It's political in the sense that they they have an agenda when they created this law
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:30.120]   They created the law and now they're going forth with that agenda. So well, that's what bothers me because if the agenda is let's take down these big
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.400]   United States
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.400]   isn't the agenda really isn't
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:41.320]   That the agenda really is to control is to let people have more access and control over their data and how it's used
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.960]   unfortunately
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:50.840]   No, it's not in kinesis. I sat in kinesis office and I heard French regulator who's French regulator
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.840]   Is just the just one after them with the head of it. I've had long conversations with her
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.680]   And I think she's a very reasonable and smart person
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.240]   But other people around the table
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.800]   Politicians and regulators and such
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.960]   There is an appetite
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:09.400]   To bring down the big guys. I I gotta agree with leo on this one and and they're looking for that opportunity
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.760]   I don't think there was anything egregious that google could have done in this case. Oh my god. How can they not go after google?
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:21.080]   Uh, it was right. It's a dial. Oh, it's not it's not prominent enough. It's not frequent enough
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.600]   Well, define enough and I'll bet the law this is where they're gonna win in court
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.680]   The law is probably not gonna be explicit enough because the their lawyers
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.840]   I'm sure did a good job has said here's what the law says about enough and here's what we're doing
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.920]   Maybe a little more but that's all
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:40.520]   Do you think stacy that google flouted the law or is it flaunted flouted?
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.360]   Google flout law they flaunted flouting the law
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.440]   After they threw down the cotlets
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.640]   Um
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.040]   By the way, there was a great discussion about the difference seen flout and flaunt on reddit
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.880]   They were talking about concealed carry and the whole thing started by somebody said
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.960]   Uh, what did they do in the wild west?
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.040]   Uh about people carrying their guns that just everybody have a gun on their hip
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:17.000]   and they and uh ultimately came down to the uh, I thought the perfect sentence which was
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.560]   they
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.920]   flouted
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.440]   the ordinance
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.440]   By flaunting their ordinance
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.120]   [laughter]
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:33.000]   Think about it give it to me again. No, no, I got it. I think you switched your ordinances
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.920]   They flouted the ordinance by flaunting their ordinance. Yes
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:43.480]   Ordinance is another word for ammunition
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.320]   And they flaunted is it is it
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:53.160]   Any weaponry, I think it's any weaponry. It's mounted guns artillery
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.000]   so they flouted in other words
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   blew off the ordinance the law
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.200]   By flaunting because they were saying in uh, that was why the shootout at okay corral happened
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:12.120]   Is because that whatever boys wouldn't wouldn't put their guns up as they went into town so why at her pad to shoot them
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:20.520]   Okay, it's ordinance is the law they flouted the ordinance by flaunting their ordinance
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.520]   Yes, that that's what was confusing me at first because you had the
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:29.000]   Now if they'd been ordained we would have had a whole other conversation
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.080]   Uh, anyway did google flaut
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.640]   GDPR
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:42.120]   Like did they say oh screw that uh, we're never gonna get fine. No, they did the best they thought they could do without
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.720]   I think they did the minimum they thought they could do so that's the question what I would expect
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.560]   So that's the question. I think they did the minimum they thought they could do so I don't think frankly
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.760]   about the requirement. What's the video? Yeah, yeah, and that's that's how that's how laws
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:22:01.160]   I mean, that's what we do. That's how that discussion is we go to court. Yeah, and then then the court will decide
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:06.280]   Uh, or they'll settle. I mean they'll sit down in the room and france would be like
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.920]   We're really pissed off about this and coogle be like, I don't care and france is like i'm gonna find you
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.240]   And like find we'll talk
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.440]   Yeah, I may be my guess a google
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.360]   Is willing to put up whatever notice at least for the first part put up whatever notices
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:29.320]   They're required to put up, but they understand that it's annoying like this cookie law that the that we have to put up with
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.480]   It's annoying to users to see these so they said well, what would be the
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.520]   What would be the minimum compliance with the law?
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:41.240]   That would not annoy our users and this is what they decided and then and then
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:47.080]   Canneal decided said no, that's not enough. We want more or max shrimps
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:52.520]   We want more and I and I don't so what i'm saying is I don't think google's acting in bad faith here
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:23:00.520]   Because honestly, I think if if if if canneal came back said we want something like the cookie rule google
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:06.120]   So it's how you guys are idiots, but they would do it because you know what it would make any difference to their business in the long run
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.640]   um
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.600]   So I signed on to tunnel bear
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.960]   As if i'm in the uk
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:22.200]   But it's not it's not working for waiting for proxy tunnel. Never mind. You need express vpn. I find
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.640]   I was no I in fact do need that
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.400]   And I was thinking about doing that after the last sponsorship
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.800]   Yeah, the the the less you pay for vpn the slower it is
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:38.040]   Anyway, I think this is certainly not the last time we'll have this conversation
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:43.480]   um, you know the reason I asked the questions that I asked is is google evil here or
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.160]   Uh, is it just a question of interpretation?
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.960]   And I don't think google's being evil. I think that they're
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.520]   You know
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.280]   They just i think we're where stacey and we're disagreeing only on degrees too
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.760]   Is that she's saying that there's a there's a they want a test case and this is a test case
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.760]   That's what they want they got to do and
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.320]   We're arguing that it's a little more politically motivated than stacey would agree. Would that be true stacey?
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.240]   Yes
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.800]   Oh, I don't diminish stacey
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:26.280]   Sorry, yes, no, yes, yes
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.560]   Okay, i'm gonna stop we should talk about something else. Yes
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.360]   No, I think we've really flattened this one
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:39.560]   There's every we've squeezed the life out of it much like this ball python has squeezed the life out of my keyboard. Yes
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.160]   Is it happy? How do we know if it's happy?
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.600]   Well, it's yawning a lot now
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:51.960]   There's some debate among ball python fans if the yawning is because it's sleepy or because it's measuring my head to see if it could swallow me
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.560]   Oh my gosh, that would make such great television. Think about your rating
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.480]   Where leo go right there. He's in the middle
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:05.720]   I mean, it's not gonna kill you but in the meantime the clip is gonna go viral what doesn't kill you
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:11.640]   Makes you slightly go viral. Yeah, that's good. You know what? That's the new youtube generation
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:17.960]   Screwing itchy. We got youtube what doesn't kill you makes you go viral what doesn't kill you makes you go viral
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:23.800]   Or i like it you know when the python by the way, I started watching that fire festival documentary on netflix
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:28.840]   Wow, oh is it people have been raving about it. It's really good. Well
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:36.440]   It just shows you where we've gotten to with this whole instagram social media marketer
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.240]   hype machine that
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:44.600]   It's I don't know. I don't haven't finished it. So I don't know if it's a concha
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.640]   It was a con job or just something that got out of control
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.440]   but go on
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.840]   No, oh, I was gonna say the whole thing reminds me of my mom, you know
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:01.720]   She would always tell me some people stacey. They just have more money than sense. Yeah, and that's what i'm like
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:06.360]   Oh, yeah, I mean, I feel bad. I feel bad. People got caught a lot of people got caught
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:12.520]   Uh, you know, this was the festival just to refresh your memory from uh april of last year
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.540]   That was so ill planned that when people got there instead of the luxury
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.840]   Combinations and gourmet meals
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:23.160]   They they got a hurricane survivor tent and a piece of bread with butter on it
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:29.080]   And then there was no concert at all and there are lawsuits and all sorts of things flying back and forth
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:33.240]   But really it's a good documentary to watch because it's a testament to our times. I mean
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.400]   They marketed
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.160]   They did the viral marketing brilliantly. They're really good at the viral marketing
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:45.880]   They're really bad at producing a product to match the viral marketing and uh, you can you can make people want something
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:51.160]   The question is can you deliver easy peasy and there's this whole the thing is there's this network of influencers
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.120]   One of the things the fire festival guys did is they promised
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:59.640]   500 instagram influencers free tickets and accommodations at the festival
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.800]   If they would uh at a specific date and time all push
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.840]   An instagram picture of just a y- orange
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.680]   Screen
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.640]   And everybody did it at once with the hashtag fire festival. I can't wait or something like that
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.760]   I mean they were really good at viral marketing the problem was then they get to the festival and they don't know what to do with these
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.560]   500 influencers because they're expecting tickets to a show and luxury accommodations and all they got is nothing
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:32.920]   Uh, it was really interesting. But what was also interesting is there were a number of people who saw the fraud happening
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.360]   Uh who tried to put they put up a website
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:41.960]   They tried to create a twitter account saying don't go or if you go we know what's going on fire festival people
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:46.200]   You got to tell people are going to go in two weeks of this festival that there's nothing there for them
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.960]   They can't they'll be stranded all this stuff and it was ignored
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:56.200]   So that the the the people who were doing the you know the belt they'll ring in the alarm
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:01.880]   Didn't really know how to use the uh the influencers in the same effective way
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:07.560]   Doing the festival wasn't there wasn't a governor on it right. Yeah, it was really interesting and they got they brought out
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.480]   uh 12
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.400]   female supermodels
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.560]   To dance around on the beach in bikinis and they that was like a year before the event
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.160]   And they used the video from that right up to the day before the event
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:24.360]   As if this is what's going to happen. It was it's a good documentary. It's on netflix
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:29.240]   It's very there was also a a uh was a tonne con the vidcon alternative
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:36.280]   Oh two years ago. I believe didn't hear about that, which was a very small scale same thing
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.120]   Yeah, uh
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.400]   Tana
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.360]   uh
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.760]   Was irritated for some reason with vidcon and decided to have her own vidcon across the street
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.520]   and got a room and like a mariot
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.760]   and
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.200]   Too many people showed up. They didn't really have anything. There were safety issues
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.040]   All kinds of like because because I can go online and I can market this
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:03.320]   I can go to kickstarter and I can go to patreon and I can go to youtube and I can excite people about something
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.080]   Oops
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:10.040]   Wonderful what we've gotten this marketing this viral marketing gets so good. Yeah
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:15.720]   Well, it's kind of mean think about it's just like vaporware taken to yeah, but next I mean
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.480]   Yeah, but I mean it's really causing her you know havoc
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:24.680]   Uh, yeah, and of course it's going to attract con men now. I mean be
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.560]   by or beware because
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:32.840]   You know if you're on the internet will get blamed for the bad actions of human beings
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:39.160]   Right. Well, but again as we've talked about many times the internet has weaponized the bad action of human beings, right?
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.400]   They're able to do stuff
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:49.400]   So much more effectively than ever until we get our our our systems in place and institutions and so I just got a new book here
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.120]   from um
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.120]   Do you ever read these or you just show them?
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:30:00.840]   I don't know how you could you say like twitter you just read all the time
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:06.920]   I just a thin but look how thin it is. Oh in shape with that. So thin. I'm still reading the book. I started last month
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.840]   Well, I I do audio books by doing one on you know
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:17.160]   You have a commute. That's the difference. The commute makes a huge difference. Yeah, but if I've got to use it for research
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:23.080]   I read it. So yeah when I can be like just four hours. I just listened to Kamala Harris's book already
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:28.440]   You've done with it. I saw you bought the hat read the book bought the hat. Well, the hat bought the hat. Yep
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.080]   But the Kamala, but I think you're jumping a little too soon here. I mean there's I might be
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.480]   Is it Kamala or Kamala?
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   Kamala, I learned that the auto that's why audio was very
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:45.960]   Uh beneficial because it's audio. I like that hat because they use colors to go kah ma
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.800]   La it's kama. She says it's kama
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.680]   Think think punctuation you're fine
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:31:00.920]   It's a good hat. I've said i'm sorry jeff since it's a good hat. Yeah, I was that was part of it too. It's just a it's just a good hat
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:05.240]   By the way, it's better than the hillary hat. I have now actually deleted my instagram feed
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:12.520]   I have did I have requested the deletion of my facebook feed later today. I will literally delete my twitter feed
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:16.680]   No more deactivation. I'm taking this taking this serious
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.760]   Oh, are you listening to far hud in the new york times about never tweeting?
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:29.400]   So I have not but far hud is now no longer a tech columnist. He's an opinion on the editorial board. He's opinion maker
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.960]   Yes, that's interesting. He now
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:39.240]   Is his latest column is never tweaked the controversy over the covington student shows why american journalism should disengage from
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:45.480]   I've been saying that give me an effing break far hud. What a what a new york times
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:51.320]   position of privilege that is because you can go in the newsroom and your concerns will be covered
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.280]   There are a lot of people and the new york times is on it
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.240]   Are not cannot be heard you can be heard far hud
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.320]   There are people who cannot be heard who finally are heard because of twitter so
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:07.000]   Yeah, but it seems that people are using twitter are not the people who are not being heard
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   But the people were just getting left
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:17.080]   All right, so we're gonna listen to the part hud. We'll answer your questions about this column on yes twitter on thursday at 2 30 p.m. Eastern
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.560]   Then what is it to kill his account?
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:25.720]   Uh, I don't know about far hud, but there are definitely people who should stop tweeting and you know who i'm talking about
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.800]   I love twitter
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:32.680]   I will not stop disagreeing with you on this and not because jeff not the way jeff loves twitter
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:37.240]   I love twitter because I have the most awesome nicest coolest followers
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:43.160]   who show me neat things and tell me in polite normal ways that
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:47.880]   I screwed up and when I did screw up, they're like oh
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:54.840]   So, I can I find those people you just have to follow them you know them
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:00.120]   I tell you know, I mean there a lot of heck half my twitter followers are probably your listeners
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:03.800]   I mean
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:09.880]   horribly controversial things as I did yesterday then the trolls leave me alone
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.000]   There were 24 hours. I had the trolls what'd you do?
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   I I
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.400]   Savannah gothra. I'll be sending it you want me to say it? No, no. I don't know. Did you get in trouble?
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.500]   Yeah for saying something on twitter. Oh, no, I just said savanna gothra
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:28.040]   I don't say anything. That's why i think you want to but did you do it on twitter?
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.520]   Yeah, I did on twitter say so i got trols
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:36.120]   No, 25 is people they're all say things on twitter. They wouldn't say in the real world
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:41.800]   I only say things on twitter. I say in the real world. That's maybe why you have such a quality twitter feed
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.040]   Very much. But you're alone
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:50.200]   Do you know the president tweeted? I didn't even know this on january 20th. He tweeted more than three dozen times
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.000]   Well, he has nothing else to do the cover
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.760]   That's 40 times he tweeted in one day
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.880]   It was kind of meandering. It really is kind of like watching your grandpa tweet
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.520]   It was you know like
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.160]   It's cold out there stay home
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.800]   What the hell?
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:14.120]   And then elon you should not be you should not be on twitter
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:19.320]   Maybe it's a substance abuse thing that combines with twitter or just lack of sleep
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:24.520]   There's just a lot of people a lot of people getting trouble on twitter a lot of people not just jeff
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.640]   I haven't tweeted much lately. Oh
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:38.440]   I predict I predict the 2019 will be the year that you will come here stay see and say you were rightly
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.120]   I'm never going back on twitter. I predict that. Well, that would hurt too much to say leo
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:49.000]   No, I have these lovely conversations see here that i'm talking with someone about capacitive touch on a faucet
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.240]   I'm talking to life's too short to talk with people about capacitive touch on faucet
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.720]   What are you talking about risk?
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.440]   bread and butter
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:07.560]   Whole thing whole dialogue on risk five architectures. I mean come on like far-hud mind you speaking from white privilege
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:13.640]   But yes, you are because I don't you know, I know I can talk I get to talk
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.360]   For hours today. Yes
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:21.720]   Here's the problem leo. There's nothing more you want to say i'm done
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.440]   You said it all I said it all
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.200]   As Howard Stern says that when you know the interview is coming to the end
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:34.040]   Well, you've said it all you've said it all and we're done and you know you're off off here and face
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.040]   A Vidcon
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:42.040]   What is via comm up to they bought Vidcon, right? Right now they just bought Pluto tv
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.960]   For a whopping 340 million
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:54.520]   What is $2 tv tell us that please Pluto tv is one of the fastest growing free ad supported tv streaming surfaces
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:00.920]   So if you go to Pluto TV, it's interesting. I kind of I thought maybe they were a little sketch because
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.280]   um
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:09.800]   By the way snakes love Pluto tv because they're broadcasting. I don't understand how they get away with you know
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.640]   Broadcasting some of the things they broadcast on here
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:19.160]   So they meet the press on right now. Yeah, do they have a license for that? They must are via calm
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.040]   Viacom with jones who does which one does via comm on
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:28.600]   They all CBS would serve the most litigious of all. Yeah, they wouldn't buy something like
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.600]   They're the same
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:35.160]   They wouldn't buy something like this if they weren't I would mute this but I can't because the snakes
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:41.320]   Sitting on my mute key when let me you can just push him aside snakes are very nice. Really. He's not gonna
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.920]   Bite me. Is that a stake on your monitor or yeah?
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:48.520]   Yeah, he is so there's cheddar. There's a fox sports
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:54.360]   Impact wrestling. This is all free. You just go there and you just watch this for free because right?
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.520]   It's ad supported. There's look at all this college sports
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:03.320]   I've I've seen this. I mean I thought what were we on Pluto tv briefly? We were we were I know we were in
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:09.080]   Negotiations to be on Pluto tv. I'm not sure if we ever actually got I think they wanted us to do stuff
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:13.480]   We didn't want us to they cut out our ads and stuff right? Yeah, that was the problem. It was too much work for us
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.880]   So cnets on here. Nerdist is on here
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.600]   CBS
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:24.520]   And they're their founder we did talk to them. Oh, okay. Interesting. So so what is his
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:30.520]   What is his strategy? What is his well his strategy is he just got 340 million dollars
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:35.320]   No, I know I work Leo. That was a good strategy. What would I what was I thinking
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:41.320]   Look at all the stuff on here. They've got music channels. Jesus. This is crazy
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:45.560]   And I guess it's all legit because it wouldn't exist if it weren't legit
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.480]   Right
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.480]   Like
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.240]   They're just they put all these agreements together. So the really what viacoms buying is
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:38:02.520]   Is these agreements? What I wow an audience how big is Pluto? I mean does it? Oh, it's not a big it's a it's a micro streamer
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.240]   It's super tiny. It's a micro streamer. So
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.760]   Yeah, it's not that's what's interesting about this
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.480]   Let me see if it says here
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.240]   Tom ryan who I guess was a guy we had on triangulation
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.560]   Uh, it was gonna it will continue to serve as a ceo. It'll be independent
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.280]   uh upon closing of transaction
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.720]   Should close in the first quarter subject to regulatory
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.080]   approval, but frankly
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:33.560]   Uh, as uh, axios says it's unlikely to deal this size would get much scrutiny
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.760]   Um
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.560]   It's just fascinating to me 340 million sounds like a lot to me
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.760]   That's because you're a small fry
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:46.920]   I guess I am if you're thinking big, you know, you got to think unicorn
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:54.280]   But also this is uh an interesting strategy on viacom's part. I think that's it goes along with acquiring
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.960]   Uh
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:04.360]   Vidcon for instance. So pluto tv had 12 million monthly active users. Oh, it's nothing. We have seven that is nothing. We have seven
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:10.040]   Do you want to be bought by viacom? Is that what i'm hearing? What is what fraction of 12 million is seven
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:17.000]   It's like 6 percent. I'll take 60 percent. I'll take 60 percent of 340 million. I'll take it
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.720]   Marlena. I have a wonderful audience. They tweet beautifully
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.360]   Uh, that you
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:29.720]   Actually leo they wanted you until you killed all your social media and then probably that's true
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:33.720]   It was probably suicide to kill those accounts, but yeah was
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:40.040]   Uh 7.5 million of pluto's viewers are on connected tv's so viacom likes that
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.680]   Um, they also
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:49.640]   Yeah, they're probably young right they're cheap. That's what I would worry about. I mean, right
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.280]   Uh
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.840]   It ain't they also become also bought noggin
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.200]   And comedy central now
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:03.800]   Well, it's a dead. So that's a channel right noggin. Yeah, noggin is like a nickelodeon sponsor
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.120]   I thought it was a nickelodeon can they also bought awesome
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:11.080]   Audient for toddlers they bought awesomeness tv, which is I think a digital media
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:17.400]   Uh, oh no, I'm sorry. It's where all your favorite creators come together and daily shows made for you
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:23.320]   Oh, well, that sounds like it's just for us. It's it's not even it doesn't stay alone. It's on youtube
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.440]   It's a youtube publisher
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:32.280]   Wow
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:37.400]   I don't know how much they paid for but so viacom's up to something probably trying to stay relevant in the 21st century
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.560]   I think so my thinking
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:45.560]   Well viacom hold on viacom does not have cbs. They're both some of redstone. Yeah, I think
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.360]   Oh, is he still
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.360]   So i'm thinking
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:54.360]   That's like that. I don't think there's a story there, you know, that's a movie. I can't wait to watch that movie
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:59.960]   That'll be an HBO for sure. Oh the summoner redstone story. That was also a great mtv game show category
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.600]   dead or canadian
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:06.280]   It's awful
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:12.680]   All right, let's take a little break the snake. I'm using the snake as audience feedback now. He seems to have fallen asleep. So
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.480]   Clearly we're boring. Are we are we
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.800]   Should you kiss snakes or no?
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   Just
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:26.360]   Did i ask him? I'm asking for a friend. He smells like a
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:32.520]   For a friend is it okay to kiss your snake
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:38.360]   Our show today you notice how grammatically correct i am have you noticed that
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:43.800]   I know the difference you are you you you do a good job between flout and flaunt
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:50.440]   I think even when you speak or you speak with the oxford comma, which I respect i do i use the oxford comma in speech
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.920]   Yes, I eat
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.920]   shoots and leaves
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.200]   And all of that i o2
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.480]   Well besides mrs. Plotkin in fourth grade grammerly

[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.400]   I didn't have an editor for a week and I'm notorious for my
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.520]   My all of my editors have said stacey
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:27.960]   You love just sprinkling commas at random. You really have no idea where they go that
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.000]   Is what my latin teacher called a comma blunder
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.800]   And it should not be allowed comma blunder. There's the overuse of commas
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:42.200]   I have a few diseases that I I I I love dashes. I like some
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.680]   I call too much. I loved emdashes
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.320]   It's just another book
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:50.200]   But an ode to the semicolon
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.440]   well kind of
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.720]   the form of the book who by yan
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:58.280]   quichold
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.880]   who
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.880]   Was jailed by the nazi
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:07.240]   Because he was advocating new typography. Wow
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:13.000]   You think this stuff's easy that was dangerous. Is that so he has a whole chapter on the proper
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:20.280]   A setting of dashes. Oh, I gotta read that. I had to buy it. Oh, I had to buy it. No, that sounds like the most boring book ever
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.360]   Exactly
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:26.040]   Not more boring than discussing capacitive fussets. Well, I
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.200]   Big go z
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:33.480]   No, I was okay. So this is a true story. I was one set a baby shower
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.640]   Yes, yes
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.160]   And I
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:43.000]   This was when the iPhone had just come out. So it was like 2007 and this poor girl sitting next to me at a baby shower
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.760]   So she was normal and she had like I think it's so cool how
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:51.560]   You know the iPhone works, but I don't understand why I can't hit it with my nails and have it work and I was like
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:54.280]   Do you do you really want to know?
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:58.360]   Yeah, I do I was like
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:03.880]   Do you really want to know so that I'm sitting there for like only like a few minutes explaining capacitive touch
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.880]   But she did not talk to me for the rest of the time
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:12.120]   Sad, you know, I've learned you got to jazz it up. So what I always do is say go get me a mozzarella stick
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:14.920]   and a pretzel
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:21.880]   And you can demonstrate it with a mozzarella stick and a pretzel
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:25.800]   Right, it was a baby shower not a football game mozzarella
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.240]   mozzarella mozzarella mozzarella mozzarella
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.280]   You can use it. You can use a mozzarella stick
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.520]   as a
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.640]   As a stylus, but you can't use a conductor. Yeah, because it conducts
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.360]   But you can't use a prep your pretzel
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.920]   It's too dry
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.920]   Right snakey right
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:48.280]   Right snakey so Amazon oh
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.800]   Hi snakey Amazon always thinking ahead
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:56.280]   Has created a vest to keep robots from pummeling humans
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.960]   Oh
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:05.480]   Interesting well, this is a rather link bitty, but I had to give a credit headline for man gadget
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.520]   So the issue is of course, you know, amazon warehouse
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:14.840]   Workers are working right alongside robots all the time automated systems and so forth
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:20.600]   And so the what these what this vest so-called vest is is really a pair of suspenders
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:27.720]   Connected to a belt that signals to robots the human is entering the space so the robot will stand down
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.640]   Oh, is it using 60 gigahertz radios
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:39.000]   Uh, well, that's a good question and gadget says sensors that can communicate with robotic systems, but I bet you anything it's a radio sure
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:44.200]   So ti just introduced probably two months ago a 60 gigahertz
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:50.040]   Sensing system that was in part designed to work with robotics by saying because the big yeah
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.600]   Because it's a little bit more accurate
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:56.680]   It's higher resolution data about how close a person is and that sort of thing
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.680]   But maybe it's using something totally different like computer vision could do this too, but not as well
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.000]   Do you know how this uh why amazon's doing this?
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.480]   Because they are going to have workers work with their robots in the warehouse
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.480]   No, the bear repellent incident
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:16.520]   One of them one of amazon's robots managed to
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:23.400]   Uh puncture a bottle of bear repellent 24 workers were hospitalized
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:29.960]   I think that's actually I think I read somewhere that that was like the second bear repellent issue that amazon had i'm not kidding
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:33.480]   We shouldn't laugh because one of the third it was the third
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.800]   Here we go. So really what they use create sensors for bear repellent
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:41.320]   How does maybe they shouldn't stop bear repellent
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:47.160]   Uh, it's it's a pepper spray for aggressive, uh or charging bears
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:52.600]   Well, what does this do just stop that if you're standing nearby the the robot could still do it and you happen to be nearby
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.760]   Does it just not no?
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.560]   Doesn't really solve the bear repellent problem. No
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.440]   Oh
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:07.960]   Maybe you only stalk bear repellent there. No people around snake change the page to uh being homeless is better than working for amazon
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:12.520]   Snakes are capacitive. Look at that snake is capacitive. Oh
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.320]   Take that to your baby shower
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.920]   Yeah, i'm talking to you talking about you snakey
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:25.000]   All right, that's really interesting this are you trying to make a political statement snake about homelessness in amazon
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.320]   Wow
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:29.320]   That's not the article i was talking about
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.600]   So i amazon
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:38.040]   Wanted to hiss that you would change the page. I think they were worried. I think they were worried
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:41.000]   Uh that
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.200]   Robot might think of a of a human as a can of bear repellent. So proactively
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:53.160]   What are you up to snake proactively so we have proven the snakes are capacitive
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:55.720]   That doesn't make sense. I would think that
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.320]   You would only load bear repellent when people aren't around or sometimes that right right it punctured a nine-ounce can of this stuff and it
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.320]   Fills gotta be other harmful lots of other harm. Yes things at the warehouse
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:14.840]   But are they stuck under high pressure? But wouldn't you want to design a robot that wouldn't that wouldn't in fact puncture anything
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.600]   I mean i'm sorry that seems like a failing in the robot
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:26.600]   Maybe it just but you could drop the the can and you're not over. That's what's interesting initially they said it dropped the can
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.560]   a preliminary investigation
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:31.720]   Uh determined the bear repellent fell off a shelf
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:38.520]   But a spokesperson for the town clarified that an automated machine punctured the nine-out scan releasing its toxic fumes
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.080]   Take that human
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:44.280]   Maybe this is how it happens. This is how it begins
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:51.800]   With bear repellent. This is the way the world ends. This is not with the bang but with bear with a bear with a whiff
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:58.840]   Facebook is building a meme hub called lll to attract teens
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:04.520]   Oh my god, my daughter only speaks in memes really just yes. Oh god. It tries
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:10.280]   It drives me so nuts. I mean i'm lucky that i'm online enough that i get like probably 50 percent
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.240]   How does she do that?
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:18.760]   Well, you have to think like she talks in vines she's still sad over the demise of fine, but like
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.600]   she like
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.320]   i'm trying to think like i'll say something and she'll be like
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:29.960]   Crap. Oh, I hate that when like people I you know that's actually an all-long standing thing
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:33.720]   Like you say something and they would say well duh
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.840]   like because that's a that's a thing people say or
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.480]   yeah, think or
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.880]   you know the ca the fake cough with the
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.520]   You know communist communist
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:48.520]   I hate that stuff and now of course it's all tied to some meme that people saw on
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:52.360]   social media so I want to plug a book a friend's book
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:56.680]   Memes to movements just out this week by anjao mina
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:03.640]   Uh from brookman center and among other things she's a brilliant researcher and and has a whole political
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.480]   Uh
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:11.880]   View of the use of politics how the world's most viral media is changing social protest and power interesting and she that that's true
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:18.760]   are important alphabet of the future. That's what jon donovan says too when she's been on from uh dana boyd's
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:23.000]   Center she says that's her almost her her beat is studying
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.280]   Memes and and and how they're used in political movements. Joan by the way has moved to harvard. Oh
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:31.800]   The shorin steins center there are very nice boston
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:36.360]   Makes a lot of sense when you know jones um twitter handle is boston joe
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.160]   Yeah, he wants to stay in game bridge
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:45.320]   I don't want to say anything, but she was suddenly got a real interest in you jeff. Oh
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:51.160]   She's coming your way. I think she originally was going for my mouse and then realized it wasn't actually in a mouse
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:57.320]   She's really woken up. That's good. This whole amazon thing is really uh
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:00.760]   Really stuck with her. She's like bear in pen. Oh
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:04.840]   She's measuring the pen
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:09.400]   She's measuring. She's just checking so fascinating
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:14.360]   They are kind of aren't they? I've never had a son. I love the way they move. Yeah, I think it's just so
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:18.600]   They're beautiful slithers not the right word. No, it's not
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:21.720]   I don't know what the rungulate
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.480]   undulate
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.320]   Very undulating
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:30.040]   So did you see the uh, we were talking about this on no on um windows weekly earlier?
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.160]   Microsoft was kind of a leak it wasn't an announcement microsoft
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:36.440]   But they said that they are going to have a fake news checker built into their browser
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:40.680]   Microsoft that's deep. I think we're gonna talk about cortana
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:42.840]   You gotta do that
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:47.160]   Well, that's a really so that's why I bring it up because I know jeff you know how hard it is
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.560]   but uh
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:56.200]   Microsoft's mobile version of edge is going to start issuing fake news warnings. Oh, it's based on news guard
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:54:02.120]   Is news guard not good? No, no, no, I don't want to be any judgments news guard is um
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:07.560]   A little simplistic because it it has a one size fits all for everybody
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:13.160]   Red yellow or green rating of a new site. It's hard to do right. I mean bingo
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:15.240]   and and
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:19.160]   Yeah, so it's not gonna. It's not gonna get you down to individual claims. It's going to be
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:25.240]   You know, uh sites that you think are not believable will get a different rating from what they do because it's one size fits all right
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:31.880]   It's also seems a little judgy. I'm looking at the exactly looking at the news guard. I know it has to be judgy
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:37.320]   But look so they're talking about what daily wire.com this website generally maintains base
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:41.560]   Extentives of accuracy and accountability. It does not repeat repeatedly published false content
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:45.800]   Gathers and presents information. It was responsibly, but it does
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:51.640]   I don't know why they get an X for this or I guess because it does not regularly correct or clarify errors
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:55.240]   It doesn't handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:58.920]   And it does not disclose its ownership and financing
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:04.840]   It's a little judgy. You know, it's like what's the whole point of it. Yeah. Yeah, I guess you have to be judgy, right?
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:11.400]   If you're judging, but yeah, I just it's done by Stephen Brill and Gordon crowwitz Stephen Brill started for tv
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.120]   the
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:19.720]   The two of them started the paywall infrastructure for media and they never liked me for not loving paywalls
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:23.320]   Uh, and so now they started this effort and they're hiring
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:31.720]   human journalists to sit down and judge sites against their criteria all of which I think that I think is is a good idea it's more data it's and
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:34.680]   full disclosure, I
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.560]   Raised money from facebook. I'm independent of facebook
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:43.400]   I received no money personally from facebook or any platform, but one of the projects i'm working on is to aggregate the signals of quality and news
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:45.480]   So i'm in this space
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:48.680]   So this is an effort to bring this to the consumer
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:51.320]   The question is how much it will resonate
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:58.760]   At an individual level individual site level. Do you agree with their view of fox news? Do you agree with their view of daily collar?
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.000]   Do you agree with their view of our tea?
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.400]   It'll proof from putting
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:06.520]   So if you are using edge
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.280]   on
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.280]   uh mobile
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.760]   There is a news rating
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:19.720]   Feature in the settings you can turn it on. I don't know if it's on by default. It describes news guard is, uh, you know, and what it does
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:25.640]   Um, I think this is kind of does facebook use news guarded what is facebook? No
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:31.240]   Facebook has all kinds of signals some of which my project will provide to all of the platforms
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.840]   um and advertisers and ed networks for free
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.920]   um
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:41.000]   But they've got a ton of signals on their own plus they got fact checking they've they've
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.800]   worked with fact checking networks
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.200]   uh to give them signals about
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:50.520]   individual pieces of content, but then that ranks up to
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:53.400]   the domain level
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.880]   So according to the guardian
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:01.320]   News guard is saying that male online, which I guess is the daily male
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:05.560]   It's unreliable and that's probably true. Actually, I probably pretty much true
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:11.880]   Yeah, so my daughter came to me the other day and said I saw this in the mail and then I was like, I so I had to sit down and explain
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:17.000]   journalistic standards and then the other day she was like, did you see in the post and I was like
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.280]   Which which post she's like the new york post and I was like
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:23.800]   No, but that's a good education you're giving it is a good edge
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:27.160]   It is a new one because they're both mainstream outlets
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:30.920]   Yes, uh, it's not they're not the national enquirer
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.400]   but there may be
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.120]   A little sensationalistic is that what you told her? What did you would I?
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:43.080]   I talked about how different organizations are like people and you know you how you have some friends who are like
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:48.360]   Yeah gossipy. Yeah. Yes. I was like so you have friends and I mentioned some friends
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:49.800]   So I don't want to do that here on the air
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:53.880]   But and then you have others and so when one friend comes with this kind of information
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:59.960]   How do you treat it? And she explains how she treats it. Oh, this is you're such a good mom. That is a great teaching
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:05.560]   Opportunity what that's really cool and then I put her in a room and I didn't feed her any dinner
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:13.640]   No, I think that's really good. I think what you did there is a is a model for everybody listening who has
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.680]   Younger children because they're faced with this they're growing up
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:21.560]   I mean, we didn't have to face this where they're growing up in a world where these I mean I remember the nuance
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:25.000]   Between news week and time, right? But I
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:32.120]   And I don't remember that's very nuanced much more than this. Yes, but but I do remember that and I don't remember how I learned that
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.280]   Probably my dad or my mom said
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:37.000]   You have some friends that
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:42.200]   Like to write first person articles as if they were there and then other friends
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.920]   Who do third person reporting?
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:47.560]   Who do you listen to?
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:53.480]   So the daily wire was given an all clear while Breitbart was not so that that's a problem maybe
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:57.080]   In I don't know
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:59:01.880]   I you know, I don't I think this is better than nothing
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:05.560]   It's interesting that my yourself's getting in this business
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:12.440]   Yeah, they're all desperate for something. Yeah. Yeah, I mean why else are you gonna use edge browser?
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.640]   Well, yeah, I mean the other thing edge has good ad blocking and there's some edge on mobile is actually pretty good
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:23.720]   But because you you raise the exact problem Microsoft has although news card I looked they offer a chrome extension
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:26.360]   Firefox extension and
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:30.520]   Uh other extensions safari. I was like and edge
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:38.200]   Very interesting Google has uh, I don't know this is probably no this wouldn't be a change log Google has
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:43.880]   Bought the technology for fossil smart watches for 40 million dollars
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.680]   Oh, that was in my newsletter last week. Yeah
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:52.040]   So do you think it's an indicator that google might be doing a pixel watch or be planning a pixel watch?
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:59.000]   Oh, I would just like something they have to do something to compete with the apple watch right if they do they they're
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:05.320]   Yes, they do because the apple watch has become so compelling in google and apple has brought in so many
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.880]   health and medical things that are
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:13.400]   I mean again really compelling and they're bringing doctors and medical records companies on board
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.920]   so
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.680]   if you think about
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.200]   a divide
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.560]   You know between people who have access to the state and people who don't
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.040]   People are going to
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:28.840]   Want this and google has to have something to answer with and android where right now is the
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.600]   Yeah
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.040]   It's not very good
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:36.120]   I haven't used fossils version of it, but apparently it's there's something they other google wants
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:42.360]   So fossil actually was really good at doing smart watches that didn't feel like smart watches
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.840]   and
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.840]   designing things that
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:53.240]   That were compelling to use for people who didn't want a computer on the wrist. So fossil is not android where
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:58.680]   No, I don't I don't think so. It's like pebble or fitbit. It's its own thing
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:05.720]   Uh, who did they was fossils they may have done an android where watch actually I feel like they did. Yeah, I believe they did
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:11.080]   Yes, I believe they did. I mean, I think they had other they didn't just do that, but I believe they didn't have an android
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.720]   Yeah, they have a hundred
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:18.760]   So they did have something though that was 255 dollars of blooming dales. That was kind of price range
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:21.720]   So that's thing. Yeah, they were less expensive, right?
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.960]   Uh, and they they're pretty I mean if you look at them on the website, they're nice
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:30.280]   Maybe it's the designers that says google's buying fossil smart word tech
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:35.000]   But maybe it's they're buying the ip is what they're buying ip. So maybe it is the design
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:42.120]   And some people I thought no, yeah, although fossil was quick to point out we're not stopping and we still have 200 people working on rnd
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.080]   So they didn't didn't get them all
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:50.760]   They didn't and yeah, it sounds like fossil's gonna keep doing smart watches. Hey, I wanted to give a
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.880]   tip a hat tip to google
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:59.400]   They have announced that they are going to give an additional 3.1 million dollars to wiki media the
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:07.320]   Parent corporation of wiki pedia as you might imagine. Oh now my $10 donation doesn't look like anything
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:13.960]   No, if everybody gave $10 it would be worth more than google's seven and a half million. That's what they've given over the last
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:20.360]   10 years they announced this at the world economic forum in davos to where we don't have a reporter there
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:27.960]   Third of the funds will go to sustaining current efforts at the wiki media foundation
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:34.360]   It's an on profit by the way. They're remaining 2 million will focus on long-time viability through the organizations endowment
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:40.280]   That's good. You know what given how much value google gets at a wiki pedia. Oh, yeah, i'm glad to see that we ask
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:45.000]   Sorry
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.120]   Here
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.120]   Me trying not to choke i'm really sorry
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:58.840]   Google will also be allowing wiki pedia editors to use several of its machine learning tools for free
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.920]   and
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:04.040]   They're going to be broadened something they call project tiger
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:07.800]   Which is a joint initiative they lost launched a couple of years ago to
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:14.040]   Uh, get more wiki pedia articles written in underrepresented languages in india
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:19.000]   And to include oh, yeah, there are a lot of different languages in india
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.080]   And to include 10 new languages in a handful of countries and regions
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:26.520]   It will be called now instead of project tiger
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:31.240]   Glow the gorgeous ladies of wrestling no growing
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:37.960]   growing local language content on wiki pedia says really more like good call
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.840]   cool cow
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:48.040]   Um, I think that's great. I mean does um serie. Yeah serie uses wiki pedia too. I hope apple's doing this
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:55.800]   Apple facebook and amazon as well as google also use wiki pedia content in their own products
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.760]   so
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.320]   There was there was a twitter discussion about a year ago jimmy whales
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:09.880]   founder of wiki pedia um and people were some people were saying well google exploits wiki pedia use wikipedia and I was saying
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.200]   I was saying well though it links to them like crazy and and
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:16.840]   jimmy said they do get people who come from google and that's good
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:23.080]   There's benefit i think i would like to see so google is working with publishers as his facebook
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:29.400]   On on paywalls, but I have been pushing both companies to say also work with companies that need contribution
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:35.960]   Uh like the guardian and like wikipedia and I think on every wikipedia box if you imagine there was a box there to contribute
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:39.400]   Um, that would be a huge give back to them
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:46.040]   Wait contribute like I mean because I have never contributed to wikipedia. Oh money nevermind
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.080]   They don't need any money
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.920]   Yeah, but they do need
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:55.720]   To wikipedia whenever they do their annual job, but do you why do you not edit?
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:59.560]   Uh wikipedia. Did you just never got around to that or I wonder?
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:03.880]   It's just really intimidating it is a little intimidating and there's a culture there
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:07.480]   It's the same reason I lurk on reddit, but I never post there because i'm afraid
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:12.520]   Oh, I'm terrified of reddit. Yeah, the way you feel about twitter is probably how I feel about reddit
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:17.080]   Yeah, no, I but I you only read read it even but I lurked there I read a lot of it
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.320]   But I just I don't i'm afraid to say anything
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:27.240]   I'm there so they're way too hip for me. Did you know that google has a big presence in yum yum, tennessee?
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.120]   And hollywood, alabama
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.680]   Yep
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:36.760]   In fact the new data center google is building in yum yum, tennessee
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.880]   Is going to have solar lots of it
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:46.440]   We they hope to have it be match match notice with a hundred percent renewable energy from day one
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:52.840]   They struck a multi-year deal with a tennessee valley authority to purchase output from several new solar farms
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:58.920]   413 megawatts of power for 1.6 million solar panels
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.680]   May I give you a related story? Yes
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:08.280]   So on the rundown I think under it's uh bill gross's energy vault
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:15.400]   My friend a friend of bills. Yeah, credit bill gross bill gross ideal lab was started more than 150 companies his latest is amazing
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:21.000]   Um, and he has a great presentation. He just gave it the dld conference in munich
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.640]   um where bill explains
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:26.680]   How we've gotten?
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:33.480]   Renewable energy cheaper than a remade cold plant right so we're there
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:38.760]   But what we're not of course is storage because the wind and the sun doesn't come when you need it
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.200]   and
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:45.960]   Uh, he said everywhere on earth where you can pump water up and have it get hydro coming down is pretty much already done
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.480]   and
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:50.840]   The storage plus the generation is still more than
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.080]   dirty energy
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:57.880]   So what you need to get the storage down to is three cents per megawatt whatever
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:03.000]   Um, and he's at three and a half cents with this new company. He started and spun off
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.280]   Which is nothing but cement blocks
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:13.800]   And it and and the cement raises the cement block up when it has energy and when it needs to bring energy back out
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:19.160]   It just reduces the that's a bad block backed out. It's a battery. Yeah, and and he's got
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:23.960]   cement that can be made out of recycled cement so it reduces waste
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:29.960]   And and it costs I think what do you say seven million dollars to build one of these things and it's it's amazing
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.960]   This is just bills genius
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.840]   at at uh startups and that engineering
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:39.080]   And it's really exciting because you get to the point you're part of the problem now with coal
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.960]   Is it's not worth it
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.160]   Yes, we can produce
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:50.920]   renewable energy for cheaper than coal, but we have a huge investment in the infrastructure around coal
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:55.400]   And the storage costs are higher if you go both below both those lines
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:59.640]   Then you start taking away all the motivation to use coal and even gas
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:06.440]   Uh for renewable energy and this and imagine to these these batteries out in the middle of of nowhere
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.600]   Not in the middle of a desert wait
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:13.080]   I have a physics question. Yes, man. Um, so i'm using the
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:20.200]   Renewable to raise the cement block and then the storage is it's up high and as we drop it the kinetic energy is released
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:26.360]   So it's some sort of size. Yeah, precisely. Okay. Just sorry. I just i'm like what is that? I didn't explain it. Oh, yes, you're absolutely
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:31.800]   To do this you can raise water level and let it go down. There's all sorts of ways to do this
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:34.680]   It's really clever. Yeah, yeah, it is sorry. Keep going
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:37.640]   I was just related to so so when you when you have
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:44.120]   Googles and facebook's and data centers using renewable energy they still have this problem storage, right?
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.000]   Um the last mile and all of that. I mean
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:53.960]   Energy's here. They're there. There's all sorts of issues. Yeah, right. That's why uh elons build in the power walls, right?
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:09:00.120]   Do you have a battery batteries or still so i i were not good. Yeah, the battery
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:07.720]   Cost is still much higher and you've got chemicals the limits get children barefoot children mining lithium and right? Yeah
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:11.480]   But plain old cement blocks on a crane, you know, it's not clever
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.400]   Legos
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:19.640]   There's so many stories here this I don't know where to go next well we can confirm by the way or at least the chinese government is confirmed
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:24.600]   We were talking about dr. Ho who gene edited uses chrisper. He claimed
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:31.160]   To gene edit two babies chinese government has confirmed that uh ho jiang kui did in fact
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:35.720]   Did in fact gene edit those babies illegally?
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:40.840]   He forged a bunch of documents. He did a lot of things to get it through but there are
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.640]   at least two babies
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:49.880]   That have chrisper edited jeans. I couldn't find it. That's wrong. Was there was there anything about what he did to the jeans? Yeah
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:54.840]   So he changed that's right. He gave them resistance to hiv
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.240]   uh
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:02.600]   Smallpox and what was the other one? I can't remember third disease by room by removing a gene
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.600]   I believe
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.840]   The problem with chrisper and gene editing
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:10.280]   Is we just don't know enough about what we're doing
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:15.480]   And it's very likely or very possible that there has to be side effects that you just don't know
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.960]   You're you know, you're modifying
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.520]   Crisper is kind of like cut and paste for jeans
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:26.280]   Uh, what does it talk about what happens to the kids? Do it does the government know who they are?
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:29.800]   Yeah, I assume they do but I don't think they've identified them and so
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.680]   The whole I hope they never do. I mean, that's exactly what they said
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.440]   um
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.080]   The the twins were nicknamed lulu and nana
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:42.360]   Another woman is still carrying a gene edited penis
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:48.200]   He forged ethical review papers recruited eight couples to participate resulting in two pregnancies
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:53.320]   Um, the guang dong government will keep the twins under medical observation
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.360]   but
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.640]   They are not going to say who they are the kids
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.120]   Detective that would be an amazing
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:10.600]   Thriller is the us government since agents in to steal those babies so we can monitor their progress and gain all the scientific knowledge for ourselves
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.680]   That would be an awesome awesome
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.840]   I'm done
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.840]   Someone take that idea and go with it
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:24.600]   in uh an interview with baging youth daily, uh shaofeng who is uh from the chinese academy of science as deputy director the national institute of
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.520]   Biological science has said the whole incident would need to be investigated thoroughly
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:31.240]   If I were to handle the matter
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:37.240]   I would never tell the twins they've been gene edited and allow them to live their lives like normal people. I think that's for the best
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:40.440]   He he did say he's worried about that
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.440]   They would have children
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:50.280]   Well, yeah, and how I mean you've got a test if it works, right? Like are you gonna expose them to hiv or just hope it happens
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.280]   And see if it works. No, I mean
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:58.360]   Yes, we need a double blind anybody you want to do it. I'm just I mean
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.440]   I don't think someone should do this, but at the same time. Yeah, well, you're I think
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:08.280]   It's so anathema the the scientific community all over the world even in china
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:14.200]   And that was one of the thoughts was maybe the chinese government is kind of looking sideways when this guy's doing it because they really are curious
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:18.840]   But it sounds like they actually condemned the guy they he's disappeared by the way they're trying to find them
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:24.040]   Yes, did they condemn him because the rest of the world was like yeah, well, that's a good question. Yeah
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.560]   um an expert in the field show is worried about potential health risks the children will face
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:33.720]   As well as get this the incidence effect on the human race
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:39.560]   Once the gate of gene editing is wide open the human race will be finished. He said
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:47.080]   The technology is strong, but the terrifying fact is anyone slightly trained in a lab can perform it
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:50.680]   some well and there's
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:54.680]   There's lots of science fiction books out there talking about like oh, yeah, you know
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:55.960]   Go fast forward
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:02.680]   200 years and you've got people who retain and want to be like the human race and then all the people are like screw this
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:06.520]   I could be better and you know adapt. Well of course the issue of the have and have nots
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:10.680]   This is going to be very expensive will only wealthy people with only one percenters
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:16.680]   Be able to have smarter babies and if that's the case will they gradually become a different species
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:23.560]   But yes, but I mean I think it'll only be super expensive given the rate of technological change and things like illuminance
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:30.600]   Right, so you could probably go five years. So if you just had a baby that sucks, right? But
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:34.280]   Yeah, I don't mean you've all known
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:39.880]   Hoorary writes about this in his 21 lessons for the 21st century makes a really interesting point up until now
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:45.320]   People could claim they were better. They were noble. They were rich whatever they could claim they were better
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.320]   But they were exactly the same
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:49.960]   All humans were the same
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:57.000]   This is the first time ever potentially that somebody with more resources with more money than other people could make them and their children
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.600]   Something different and could legitimately they're all saying now we are
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:08.360]   Yeah genetically all the same, but they could legitimately then say yeah, these kids are faster smarter more attractive
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.680]   for reals
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.680]   You know not just because of accident of birth
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.760]   Uh, that's an interesting that is an interesting new world
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.720]   Uh that we are I don't know if it would be all that new
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.640]   I mean if you think about things like access to resources and privilege
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:29.880]   You were definitely born up you and jeff both were born with a leg up for example. Yep, then so
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:33.720]   From me and look what it looked like
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:39.480]   I feel like a lot of people would like to be where you are
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.120]   I don't think it's you're not you're not resting on your
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:49.240]   240 odd million from biacom, but you know you're not doing too terrible 140. I'll take the 240. I'm just
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:52.280]   No, that's that's what I'm saying. That was what I would get. That was your 60
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.160]   All right. Thank you for doing the math
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:00.520]   Now I know it's a ask for when fire come comes there you go. Sumner redstone walks in the door
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.600]   Some now it's closer to two
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:05.800]   210. Sorry
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.800]   Sorry, I just
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:11.560]   30 30 million off the top right there. Oh god already. I'm losing money
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:16.040]   Uh, let's see. Oh and here's a story
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.840]   from the daily mail
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:26.760]   Oh, do we trust it? I don't think so. I don't think you should do this Leo China launches an app that tells you if you're within 500 feet of someone in debt
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:33.000]   And encourages you to report them if they seem like they're doing okay like maybe they just got some gene editing done
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.920]   Officials in the chinese province of hobe created the app it appears to show the locations of people who are considered to be in debt
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:44.440]   It's your debt radar
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:52.440]   This is just like everything just to I mean this is the chinese are like
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:16:00.440]   How can we make everyone's dystopian nightmares come true? But is it really? I mean, I think this is an ordinary society people shouldn't be allowed to
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:05.720]   You know run around uh, you know driving mercedes-benz if they owe somebody 50 bucks
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:12.680]   And and I think I've changed the law since but it was very recently in scandinavia. You can look up anybody's income
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:18.200]   online and your traffic fines were percentage of that wow what
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:21.560]   Yes, well, I'm not moving to scandinavia
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:27.160]   Now that's the daily mail. So again, although they're reporting something that appeared in the china daily
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:35.480]   Right next to it a story. I'm not going to link on jeff bezos mistress laren sanchez don sheer top as she in the newly buff billionaire
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:39.960]   Helicopter to malibu to enjoy spot treatments and then retire to her love nest
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.480]   So that's what you were talking about with the daily mail
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:47.400]   So rima
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:51.480]   Sla a finished businessman. Yeah was fined 54 000 euros
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:59.080]   Or traveling a modest if illegal 64 miles per hour and a 50 miles. Oh, no, that's not right because it's a percentage of his income
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:02.040]   Not d. I don't want to live there
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:05.480]   Although it is a happy place now google maps
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:11.320]   It does make the sense though if you think about it a lot of people speed if you're wealthy you can speed and you're like
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.640]   I can afford the ticket in the city of bus. Yeah
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:20.840]   However, if you're getting ahead on collision, it'll still kill you however rich right, but this this at least makes the penalties
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:24.120]   Equal to everybody
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:27.720]   Case to be made for that you socialist
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.760]   I'm just I'm
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:36.440]   This is a naphtha in our society. Oh, but it makes sense how it makes sense for skin and avians
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.200]   He should have had the new google maps which displays speed limits
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:46.600]   And it's iOS and android he would have known and didn't we say earlier that in some of it just jurisdictions
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.680]   Google is testing
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:50.680]   locations of speed cameras as well
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:55.320]   Yeah, I thought that was is this just the speed limit size? This is just the speed limits
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:00.360]   I don't really want ways knowing that i'm going over the speed limit in a particular area
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:02.680]   Oh, it knows they could actually
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:05.720]   The police officers
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:13.400]   You wonder is that's that's a privacy issue is ways storing that data. Oh boy
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.800]   Oh boy, hey tom wheelers back former
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:23.160]   Dingo from the FCC where did she fall under her desk?
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.200]   Nope, okay
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.200]   I'm trying to fix something
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.960]   Where the snake goes snake. Oh my god. Where the snake careful of your monitor careful of your monitor
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.920]   Don't move it. There's a little tail right here. Oh shit
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:43.880]   I want I bet it's really warm back there. Sure. Yeah, it's it's probably oh you can see it look
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:51.240]   You can see it right there. Oh, it is. It's on your little feet. Oh my computer. It's resting. It's resting. It's a little snakey chin
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:55.080]   I wonder if it'll emerge on the other side at some point
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.800]   Is the head coming out? Oh how funny
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:03.400]   If 5g is so important writes tom wheeler
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.920]   former dingo and uh chairman the FCC
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:09.640]   why
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:12.600]   We like him now though. It sure we do sure
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:16.760]   Uh, what's his name called? We didn't know how good we had it. We didn't know how good we had it
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:22.040]   Not only that, but we all thought he was going to be a dingo, but he actually turned out to be oh
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.600]   A nice tingo a puppy
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:25.880]   Yeah
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:30.200]   Which is what led leo to think that uh as you probably might be okay. I was hoping
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.840]   I had hopes. I want to you know what?
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:37.480]   I'm the kind of guy who gives everybody a fair shake
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:46.040]   You know, so when I was covering the FCC it was well known that pie leaked all kinds of anti net neutrality stories to certain publications
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:50.520]   That covered it. Oh, yeah, really? Oh, you didn't tell us that. Oh, you didn't tell us that
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.840]   That's not good. Now you know
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:57.400]   And so wheeler says if 5g so important why isn't it secure?
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:01.880]   And of course he's he's talking about uh, wah way among other things
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.320]   um
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:07.000]   But he he says here's the thing that trump administration
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.640]   Has made I didn't know this but you knew it. I'm sure stacy 5g
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:17.720]   Kind of a cornerstone of the future for the united states, which is i'm all about it
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:20.200]   It's basically our space race
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:29.160]   Uh, he says the 5g race is more complex and dangerous than industry and the administration portray when 5g enables autonomous vehicles
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:34.600]   Do we want those cars and trucks crashing into each other because the russians hacked the network
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:42.040]   If 5g is going to be the backbone of breakthroughs like remote surgery should that network be vulnerable to the north goreans breaking into a surgical
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:44.760]   Procedure investors innovators and users
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:49.560]   Confidence in the network cyber security if it's much heralded promise
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:54.760]   Is to be realized he apparently does not think that we are doing enough
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:21:00.920]   So remember back when the trump administration said that we should
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:05.080]   There was probably a year ago. There was a report that went around
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:08.680]   That people in the administration had made a pitch to say the u.s
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:16.840]   Developed 5g all in its own right and I think the pentagon should be in charge or something ridiculous and we all laughed at ha ha ha
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:20.280]   Um, there's a couple things about that one
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:24.280]   5g is not going to be used for robotic surgery
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:28.200]   You know the use cases for 5g using a landline
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:31.560]   Please
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:38.680]   Wired um, but it will be absolutely used for intercar communication it it will and there's
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:43.960]   And i'm trying okay. I can't read this article. Here's his point. I'll tell you what he's saying
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:52.760]   He's he's saying in november the president's national security telecommunications advisory committee told him the cyber security threat now poses
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:56.280]   an existential threat to the future of the nation
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:00.760]   He's been warned again and again, but then and and by the way
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:05.800]   Tom willer won't say won't he who shall not be named agit pie
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:10.120]   The chairman of the trump fcc quickly echoed the industry line that the market
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:14.040]   Not government is best positioned to drive innovation and leadership
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:19.880]   Worse than ignoring these warnings the administration has repealed existing protections
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:24.120]   Shortly after taking office the trump fcc removed a requirement
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:27.800]   Imposed by the obama fcc in other words me
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:33.800]   Tom wheeler that the 5g technical standard must be designed from the outset to withstand cyber attacks
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:40.600]   This was the first time wheeler says cyber security was required as a fourth thought in the design of a new network
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:45.880]   Standard in fact, I vividly remember interviewing vent serf instead if you could redo the internet
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:50.280]   It was of course one of the fathers of the internet. What would you do differently and he said encryption
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:53.560]   Security basically right i'd build an encryption
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:23:00.120]   The trump fcc also canceled a formal inquiry seeking input from the country's best technical minds about 5g security
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:06.440]   Retracted an obama ear a white paper about reducing cyber threats and questioned whether the agency had any
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:10.600]   Responsibility for the cyber security of the network's air trust with overseeing
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:16.280]   So I thought this was a really good opinion piece in the new york times by tom wheeler and worth just bringing up
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:23.880]   It's important, you know, it's funny because we're in a trade war with china so all of a sudden wah way is the evil empire
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:28.440]   And that's more I think about trade than security but this stuff that really does matter
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:31.400]   And the market will take care of it
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.400]   I
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:40.200]   Yeah, so I just put up surgery without a limelight
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.160]   The chat
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:45.160]   So so the way you would just
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:47.800]   Oh great
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:54.120]   We'll see no I I've seen studies about latency and 5g does have great latency profiles
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:57.000]   Um better you think than than like ethernet
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:03.480]   Here is dr leonade the will goes. Oh, this is the ant arctic. Yeah, sir. He's actually
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:09.960]   Performing surgery on himself, which is a little weird the surgeon who removed his own appendix the point being
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:13.080]   Maybe maybe in the someday
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:16.680]   Antarctic doctors won't have to remove their own appendix is
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:19.560]   appendices
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:22.840]   Wasn't there a house episode about that probably
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:31.160]   So here's a question. I know if it's an appendix to a book that it's plural appendices, but if you had two
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:38.680]   Human anatomy appendices would that be an appendices or appendices? It would just be a problem
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.720]   But of them
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:50.280]   So there's a Krebs unsecurity writes about a weakness at go daddy that is being abused. It's actually a terrible weakness at go daddy
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:59.800]   Being abused by spammers. Do you ever get the uh sextortion spam? I did where they say hey in the subject matter your eat your password is
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:05.880]   And it was a password I had used long ago and then the sextortion email goes on to say
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.960]   I logged in, you know
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.520]   I I logged into your system got into your system put some
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:16.680]   Recording software on there and watched as you went to a porn site and i'm going to send a video of you and the video you are
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:19.160]   Watching to all your friends if you don't give me bitcoin
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.520]   Maybe you didn't get that one stacy
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:25.720]   I wouldn't it wouldn't okay
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:30.440]   I am not I can't believe I'm admitting this. I've never been to a porn site
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:35.240]   So that's actually not the right answer to that particular
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:40.040]   I'd be like, huh, they must be fishing me
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.640]   but
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:48.120]   I feel really embarrassed to to admit that. Oh no. No. No, I'm not surprised at all because you respect women
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.120]   Uh
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:53.880]   There's porn for women. Yeah, but it's always got women in it, doesn't it?
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:59.320]   No, I don't I don't know. I just know that I've never been to a porn site. I wouldn't know myself. Oh, yeah
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:02.840]   according to
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:05.400]   Uh, Krebs on security
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.960]   There there was I hope it's been fixed a flaw
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:13.160]   In the way uh dns was handled at go daddy that may it meant that anybody
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:17.640]   Who was on the same dns server as a major site a well-known site
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.880]   Could commandeer that
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:24.360]   And use it to send spam see problem was you know, the it's hard to send spam because
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:27.400]   Most sites like google's gmail will block
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:33.080]   Email that comes from an address that is not a known good address, you know, I mean it's gotten that bad
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:36.840]   So they would use trusted domain names
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:40.120]   On go daddy to send out this spam
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:46.760]   It's not exactly hijacking the domain. It's just using the domains dns server to send out the spam
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:51.080]   Uh, so nasty, uh, I hope go daddy's fixed it
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:55.800]   It's all I can say
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:02.200]   Here's all right you you I don't give enough props to the trump administration. So i'm going to do it right now
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:07.880]   The open government data act has been signed into law by the presidency
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:14.840]   It uh, it uh, it is requires federal agencies to default when possible
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:22.360]   To making data and metadata public to publish that public data and a machine readable format and catalog it online
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:25.240]   It mandates the chief data officers
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:29.400]   Be appointed at those agencies to handle the process. It was bipartisan
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:34.680]   It flew according to tech crunch through the house and senate mostly uncompromised
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:39.640]   The treasury is yes. In fact, one of the agencies that will have to do this
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:44.920]   These agencies are also now officially required to find and present any evidence for any this is
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:51.080]   Actually the real reason this flew through and this is the reason the president signed it because he really wanted this one
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:56.280]   Agencies have been the past making regulations. This is something that really bothered republicans
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:01.240]   And now they won't be able to just kind of make their own regulations
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:06.040]   They'll have to find and present evidence for any new policies or changes. I can't say that's such a bad thing
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:14.120]   Personally, so there you go. Um, well, they'll use that to I understand they'll use that to turn turn back
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.080]   No, not just turn back but when
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:19.080]   And so forth. Yeah
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:25.720]   They'll just make it impossible to actually enact regulations because they'll design the studies that drive the data that's used. They see
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:28.440]   Yeah, yeah, no, we it's you know
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:31.800]   It's like Marco Rubio
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:37.480]   Saying that the state shouldn't be allowed to do privacy loss because the wheel do it
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:41.640]   It sounds like on the surface of it. Yeah, the great if you do it
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:45.960]   But the fact of the matter is Marco is well known
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:49.640]   Is there's no way we're gonna do a privacy law in congress
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:52.520]   Um
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:56.040]   You don't think so I think we'll get one. I think they'll be start to be pressure
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:01.160]   Yeah, but I think the well here's the other story that is why I don't think so
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:02.920]   Google
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:08.600]   Remember I just said google is given what was it seven million dollars to wiki media over the last 10 years
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:12.200]   Uh, would you care to hazard a guess?
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:16.120]   As to how much google spends on lobbying congress
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:21.480]   More than they used to a little bit more
[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:27.000]   21.2 million dollars last year
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.840]   the most they've ever spent
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:34.920]   And facebook and apple and everybody else
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:37.960]   So that's one reason I wouldn't
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:43.880]   Count on a privacy law in the united states the reason we'll get one is the same reason
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:49.400]   Marco Rubio sponsoring that bill because they don't want california to make a stringent law as we have already
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:55.960]   But they so the the rubio bill says no any existing state laws are void non void. It should be a federal law
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:58.280]   That makes sense right we one law not 50
[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:00.920]   but uh
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:05.800]   It's pretty clear that any federal law will end up well I forgot this
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:11.160]   I forgot I got a little bit of news here. Oh good. What's your news? French? Well, not not huge
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:17.080]   It's actually a little bit stale and old. Oh, thank you for doing it. Yeah, I know I appreciate that you appreciate that
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:20.760]   so uh
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:24.280]   What's his name? Oh, good goontotra
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:31.800]   Oh, no, it's not that no no no sam newness sam newness sam newness put in a I think it was he who put in a
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:37.800]   uh deep malicious deep fake prohibition act
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:43.080]   Uh, I think it was newness. Let me see who put it in
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.840]   uh
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:46.040]   And
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:50.040]   So it you know prohibits you anybody from making deep fakes
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:55.880]   Well, uh, ben sass ben sass ben sass ben sass seven newness is gone right ben sass
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:59.880]   So we did it. Well, okay, but the problem here is
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:02.520]   um who determines what's fake
[01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:08.360]   What's satire? What's art? What's anything else? Wait, don't you mean who what's malicious?
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:11.400]   Yeah, well even then I need to come in that
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:18.200]   So you're allowed to make a molarity of Trump. You're gonna call the liches, you know, that's uh, that would be a violation of the first
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.520]   amendment. So that's one thing the courts will have to decide
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:24.600]   Well, amen is this is this a is this an act of congress
[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:27.240]   To prevent free speech
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:30.680]   I think that's what the first amendment so it's jumping on the
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:33.640]   Sorry, I haven't said it yet today, but moral good
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:38.680]   Um every time he says moral pentagon say good and verb
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:42.360]   I say moral pentagon say good bird
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:46.040]   Um
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:52.200]   So any audio visual record created or altered in a manner that the record would falsely appear to be a reasonable observer to be the authentic
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:55.240]   record or the actual speech or conduct of an individual
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:58.680]   Interesting satire
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:03.960]   falsely, I think that's key falsely appear to a reasonable observer to be authentic record
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:11.720]   So in other words, uh, Alec Baldwin's impression of the president on saturday at live as much as the president hates it
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:14.680]   On that failing network. Thanks me out
[01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:17.560]   You you believe it? I believe it
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:22.520]   Okay, the steve ban and I thought it was maybe steve bannen for a while
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:25.240]   But yeah, yeah, no
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:30.440]   So I think that you could say a reasonable observer would know that that's satire
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:37.560]   I think you know, I mean this clearly is going to be an issue right is it's possible to make videos now
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:43.400]   Uh that look as real as can be of somebody saying and doing something he never did or she never
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:47.640]   So this this this researcher called me about this and so he told me what the bill I didn't know he's a friend
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:50.280]   It's french. He knows more than I do it hurts. Um
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:53.000]   and uh
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:33:00.200]   But I looked up and photoshop came out in 1990. Yeah, we figured we never had a law. No, we still get faked out
[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:05.400]   Yeah, people can do malicious things, but we pretty much know they can make their fingers longer
[01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:08.120]   They can make your tummy slimmer
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:10.600]   I didn't say
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.440]   You said it. I didn't say it
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:17.160]   You can't send those tweets to leo though because he's not on twitter the chicken
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:23.240]   I would say we're still having a problem with photoshop though. I mean we're having a return to the law
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.680]   We need a law to tell you you can't do things
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:34.280]   If you use it if you use it to fraudually do something that is wrong if you use it to to sell somebody a florida condo
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:38.440]   That doesn't look like this. Oh, well. Yeah, but then there's a law that says you're protected by laws against that. Yes, right?
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:41.960]   Exactly. Yeah, so this is a kind of digital fraud
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:46.120]   I don't know
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:50.520]   This is oh, I know I says this is a violation of the first amendment. I have to say though
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.360]   I know I got this
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:59.160]   I mean don't aren't we aren't we one of the things we're saying is let's let's start looking at these things and having a conversation about
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:01.080]   you know
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:03.480]   Stuff so that we can make appropriate laws. I mean
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:06.120]   Okay, maybe not maybe there's no
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:08.360]   By the way, it says that there is a appears thing
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:11.480]   Yeah, paragraph two first amendment protection
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:16.920]   No person shall be held liable under this section for any activity protected by the first amendment in the Constitution the United States
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:21.480]   Oh, well, that's a circular here. That's the entire act
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.560]   Um, yeah
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:28.280]   Speech speech stay out of our say out of my mouth government. Yeah, and sas

[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:59.880]   See that sounds like that's all good and you should they're like protecting you
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:06.840]   So it appears to go to accounts dot google.com slash a whole bunch of stuff, right? But it's not right wow
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.280]   And could you hover your mass?
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:14.360]   Over it and tell is that you knew?
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:19.560]   Well, well, I know that's the thing is I it's accounts dot google.com so it looks like it's
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:22.840]   An okay place, but I can't be
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:28.200]   Why not? I don't know because I don't trust this it just doesn't feel right you think this is real yes
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:33.640]   You do well click it and see what happens. Well, no that I'm not that I'm doing the
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:39.320]   You're hovering your mouse over it and is it actually go to google.com
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:48.120]   It says hgps go on slash slash accounts dot google.com slash account choose your question mark email equals blot of blot of blot
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:50.680]   Are there two o's in google or three?
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.920]   I
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:56.360]   Think that's actually yes
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:59.800]   I don't want to take responsibility for it, but
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:02.440]   It sounds legit
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:04.440]   Yeah, get like ratted basically
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:08.920]   Well, if it asks you to log into google don't that you know
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:14.280]   You should instead could have won so what could happen if I click on this what bad can happen? Well, okay nothing for clicking
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:17.080]   Yeah, you're right if you're
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:23.480]   Computer's not up to date and you know you have I got chrome I got chrome you're probably all right. I think that
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:27.080]   We'll laugh at you. That's what's gonna happen
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:32.600]   No, I think that where you want to there is that potential that would take you to malicious site
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.120]   They'll download some malware in your system
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:39.640]   But that seems like unlikely what it would more likely be wanting to do is get you to give them your google credentials
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:43.480]   So if it pulls you to a google site, we have to log in look like right now
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:47.240]   I don't know. What do you think chat room?
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:50.280]   Click or no click

[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:57.240]   Click or no click
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:58.680]   What does the chat room say?
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:00.360]   Well, there's a little lag no click

[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:20.440]   There there are some lovely people who are telling you to cut and paste it into a note pad or text editor and then check
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:25.800]   That is the safest thing you could do. Yes, that would be the safest thing to go to a google and make sure it's a real google
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:28.920]   You are well, what's i'm going to the URL be the same thing
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:33.000]   No, no, because we don't know if you're actually click you know, that's the problem is that
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:39.320]   Uh, what looks to be a correct URL may not be so I type I will always say type not even cut and paste
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:42.760]   But type it in in case there's Unicode or some sort of hidden stuff in there
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:46.920]   So I just did a right click on it and save link as
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:54.680]   Add session on the doesn't know no I would type it in by copy link address. No type it in by hand
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:42:01.480]   It's very long. Well, just type the first part. Oh, I see the accounts dot google
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:04.120]   What I say it was accounts dot
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:11.880]   We know that's real and then type in and see if that you get and when you log in with your real account that they're sending that to
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:14.360]   If you then get
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:19.320]   Well, that's that's the that's the security page. Yeah, that's not right. That's right, but that we'd expect that
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:21.640]   That's why yeah
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:24.040]   Anyway, well that accomplished smart asses
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:32.760]   What'd that do the google assistant app is rolling out dark mode cards? I hate dark mode. Yes
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:35.720]   Dark mode. So does android police
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:37.720]   Yuck
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:41.640]   I like dark mode. Okay. See something forever. See we got a disagree with everything
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:46.920]   One of the things dark mode does do we should point out on ole d screens not all phones have ole
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:49.800]   lades screens, but if yours does is it uses less power
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:53.080]   So we don't say ole
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:56.760]   Sometimes I say ole d so people know what i'm talking about
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:03.560]   No, that this is this is a call or a Kamala Harris situation where i'm like, oh, have i been saying it wrong the whole time?
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:09.160]   We do say I think we say I think we say ole I think we say ole d I can say ole d no no I
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:14.600]   Sometimes i'll make weird choices on the air for clarity's purposes
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:21.240]   Ah, okay, so I will not take my you could you could say ole well the most
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:24.360]   best-known example of this
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:27.000]   the blurry
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000]   I don't why am I I don't never mind
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.080]   um
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:32.680]   Trust me
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:38.760]   There are a few words that I mispronounce intentionally to for purposes of clarity or sometimes acronyms
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:41.080]   I will spell out for purposes of clarity
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:47.240]   Got it. Okay. Sorry back to change log do do do do do google chrome to support windows mixed reality headsets
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:52.200]   YouTube finally goes nation. This is the headline. I I read this this morning. I thought
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:58.520]   YouTube finally goes nationwide almost two years after launch am I reading an old story
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:01.320]   now it's youtube tv
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:03.320]   and
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.880]   I didn't realize this because we got locals right from day one
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:10.840]   But a lot of households haven't been able to get their local channels in youtube tv now 98
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:15.160]   Us households are covered as of today the rest are coming soon
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:18.360]   all top 100 us markets have access to
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:24.200]   Locals on youtube tv sometimes they'll be a missing network because they haven't been able to make the deal
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:27.240]   But in most cases you'll get your
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:31.080]   Your locals, which is it makes you I think youtube tv is great
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:34.040]   I really I really of all of the different over the top
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:37.160]   Television solutions. I like them the best. I like the ui
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:40.680]   I like knowing that all my information is going to google
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:43.480]   I like to keep it in the family
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:48.760]   So you can get your basic cables your local broadcast your basic cables
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:53.560]   And then you can buy showtime and stars and get youtube and it's great
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:58.840]   Lisa watches we don't have we've in the old studio. We had direct tv and a cable subscription here
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:04.440]   We don't we decided I don't know who's gonna and then the football season comes and lisa says I want my football games
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:10.280]   She can watch it on youtube tv, which is awesome. Oh, I can you watch? Oh, this is a question for for sun jake
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:13.480]   So he lives in boston and doesn't want to get anywhere near the paths
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:16.360]   wants to watch the jazz
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:22.280]   Well, oh, that's an interesting question. Somebody asked me that it to my knowledge
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:26.840]   YouTube tv will see where you are and show you the shows from where you are
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:28.840]   But i'd love somebody to confirm that
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:33.320]   So if you try you can always see if it works by trying to use it with a vpn
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.280]   Right and usually if it detects a vpn it will flip out and not show you anything
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:39.800]   Right
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:43.080]   But usually the blackout the blackout rules still apply
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:48.040]   Got it. Yeah, I think that they yeah, they're trying to honor the blackout
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:53.800]   But could you subscribe to like an mlb wait no the patzer football is there an nfl channel
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:58.520]   There is i'm sure there is but it's expensive blackouts. I think you're still I don't know
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:02.760]   They're still affected. Oh wow. Oh, you know what that's right because my husband does the mlb
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:05.160]   But he still sometimes can't see the cardinals, which is up
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:07.560]   That's very frustrating. Yeah
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:12.760]   They were gonna do away with that under wheeler. There was a proposal and look how that didn't happen
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:20.520]   Jesus wait users all of us are oh, I got an email from them
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:23.240]   What did they say something about hangouts?
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:30.120]   Upcoming hangouts service consolidation, which is always a bad sounding thing
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:33.560]   Basically, this is the thing we've been talking about
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:38.040]   They're moving you but I still don't understand what's gonna happen. Yeah, no one does
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:45.160]   Stacy you go. I'm glad i'm not a little they're moving you away from that all in one hangouts to hangouts chat and hangouts meet
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.920]   Uh, some changes are later this year
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:54.600]   We're going to translate transition all of you to that but as a first step some changes are coming in April
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:58.760]   Something for administrators
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:03.080]   Features from classic hangouts will come to chat that's going to be the most interesting thing
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:05.480]   How much of hangouts ends up in chat?
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:11.720]   And then in october they'll start retiring hangouts for g-suite customers. So this is where is chat?
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:15.480]   Oh, that's not out yet
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:21.080]   I don't know. No, I don't know. I mean like I know where hangouts is but I don't know where chat is
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:26.840]   What I think it's an app right you have to download it. Yeah on my computer. Yeah, not on your computer
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:32.680]   Oh, I don't know. That's why I like hangouts because I'm on my computer. So if you okay
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:40.920]   Starting in april messages not chat starting april 16th if you have classic hangouts enabled chat will become available to you on the web
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:43.800]   And via mobile apps
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:51.720]   I don't want to download another freaking app. Oh, well, I guess I'd undownload hangouts. All right. So go to go to chat.google.com
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:57.560]   I don't want to go anywhere. Okay, but if you did, I'm craky. I don't want to go anywhere
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:59.800]   I don't either. I don't blame you. By the way, all right
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:05.640]   Maybe this is just in time google bans apps the promoter cell unapproved substances on the play store
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:11.160]   So chats.google.com can't be reached. Not yet
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:14.200]   Not yet
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:17.000]   What's the difference between chat and messages?
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:25.240]   RSC no, I don't know. Yes rich communication systems is not available. I don't think on chat. Maybe it is
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:30.600]   I don't know. No, why would I use chat if I have messages? I don't know. I don't know. No one knows google
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:34.760]   And that's the google change
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:37.480]   I
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:39.480]   Wasn't there a snake around here for a while
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:45.560]   Oh, try to figure this out. He's not dead. Is he he's just sleeping
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:51.480]   Just don't move your monitor. I see the tongue the tongue is moving. Is it? I don't see the tongue
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:57.960]   I can't see anything on the left of the screen. I think so that it's some video thing. You'd be careful. It's screen layoff
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:00.680]   It's
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:03.080]   Okay
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:07.720]   Don't hurt this. I wouldn't hurt the snake. Let's take a break and then we can wrap this thing up with your
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:12.680]   Pics unless I've missed any stories like a python. We're gonna wrap it like a parapit tightly and then
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:15.720]   Choke the life out of it. That's kind of what we do here
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:22.360]   I'm going to calm calm. I need that and I bet you the snake will enjoy it because snakes are calm

[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:54.760]   So just to put this in perspective nancy Pelosi speaker of the house has two million twitter followers
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:56:02.760]   Aoc a 29 year old freshman congressperson has 2.4 million followers. Yeah. Yeah, and by the way, I love this tweet

[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:46.360]   I found this account on twitter and it makes me so happy. It is what is it called? It's at our leaf fox
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:49.000]   Every hour it tweets a picture of a fox
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:59.400]   It makes my stacy's definitely in a low word mentality mode, which would you send me stacy
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:03.480]   You can send me your twitter followers, right?
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:08.440]   You can just I mean the people you follow can you send me that list so I can follow who you
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:13.480]   How do I could do that right? I create a new account called stacy's list
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:15.800]   Right, and then I just go to stacy's
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:21.320]   I go to giga stacy her twitter account and then I go to who she's following
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:23.880]   And then I just add every one of those
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:27.560]   Oh, I would take I'm following a lot of people. I follow 1500 people
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:31.560]   Oh, I was like much more than that. That's probably why I use Twitter so much. Yeah
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:37.400]   Yeah, but if you can I export them? I mean a lot of them are lovely and some of them are just people like normal people
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:41.880]   For the purposes of the show, I do have a

[01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:05.480]   I'd rather have the snake. They no longer spark joy. The snake doesn't spark much either. He's just sitting there
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:12.360]   Um, all right cool. That's that's by the way stacy's website stacy on I

[01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:37.400]   It's like I move in it's as I'm pulling that in
[01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:42.680]   That's going away now it snakes pee and crap

[01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:52.280]   snake flakes
[01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:57.720]   Mmm snake flakes jeff Jarvis your number of the week so so after having
[01:59:57.720 --> 02:00:00.760]   Been calmed down thanks to calm calm
[02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:07.000]   I'm also calmer about the eu right now. Are you no because the dreadful
[02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:11.640]   New copyright law and oh, yes articles 11 and 13
[02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:20.200]   Is on life support 11 countries would not agree to compromise language and it's back to the growing board and maybe nowhere from there
[02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:24.120]   It hit a brick wall
[02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:26.520]   However, I was I was like you
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:33.960]   A joyful about that until I read that the most of the reasons people this the name member states didn't like it
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:35.960]   Was it what didn't go far enough?
[02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:39.240]   Then I thought oh
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:41.240]   This isn't really something to celebrate
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:51.240]   But right now I feel calm about this good
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:55.400]   You should feel you can look at pictures of foxes until it even better
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:01:05.560]   So Julia right is great so calm. She's a member of the European Parliament who's been fighting this battle
[02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:10.840]   So she is against 11 and 13. Yes. Yes. She's been these are the very
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:16.680]   I refer you earlier episodes where we talk about this, but yeah, these would these would really be
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:21.080]   damaging to the to the internet. Yes, say man good
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:27.160]   Um, I don't really I didn't bring you anything today. I'm sorry. You brought us a snake. I brought you a snake
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:29.960]   Yeah, the snake is pretty cool. That is my show and tell for the day
[02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:36.680]   The snake answers to either snakey mixtape face or Sheila
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:41.160]   I bet it doesn't really answer to any doesn't answer to nothing
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:43.960]   It's a damn snake. It's uh, I don't have to answer to you
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:47.400]   It has found its new home here in the twit studios
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:50.200]   Here's a little breaking news. Uh-oh
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:52.760]   Buzzfeed to lay off 15 percent of staff
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:55.800]   Oh, oh, it's gonna lay off 800
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:02:00.520]   Who is from it's media business for eyes and both from oath
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:05.640]   We didn't talk about the buzz one of the treats the buzzfeed story
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:13.000]   That got them in a little bit of uh hot water. They claimed they had two sources two law enforcement sources
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:15.720]   uh that said, um
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:18.360]   I've forgotten now something about
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:25.880]   Cold cold cold line so lied to congress and then in unprecedentedly
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:31.640]   mollers office issued uh denial. They said this inaccurate
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:34.520]   but buzzfeed
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:36.040]   So divine
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:41.160]   This is another one of those stories out there. There's a there's my cliche story about co-coin going to um
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:47.960]   Prague that no one else has managed to to replicate and there's this story that no one's managed to replicate
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:50.760]   But they're sticking by it and we'll see because the denial was
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:58.440]   Qualified can't tell it was a little qualified. It was it was limited. Yeah, so and you're right as soon as there's a report
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:02.440]   We'll know if we see the report if we just see the report. We don't mean not see the report
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:04.840]   um
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:06.440]   So so
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:11.000]   I guess the reason I brought that up is buzzfeed a journalistic entity. It's kind of isn't kind of isn't right
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:17.000]   Well, there's two parts of buzzfeed there's buzzfeed and buzzfeed news and buzzfeed news where my ben smith is most definitely a journalistic entity
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000]   And they do superb work. He's a long time
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:24.280]   With a good rep with a great reputation very good repetition. Yes, but it is a little bit
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:26.920]   tarnished the name
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:32.360]   Buzzfeed because buzzfeed jona paredes buzzfeed is really seems to be all about you know
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:37.960]   Yeah, and I thought I was gonna get past that but it really it really has can and uh, but but but the but the
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:41.480]   The bigger story here is that we lost mic and we lost
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:44.040]   um upwardy pretty much
[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:46.280]   uh, and
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:47.880]   Talking to somebody
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:51.080]   Recently that who said there's gonna be more blood on the street. We have not
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:58.200]   Been honest about the failure of the business models in media and it's worse than we're admitting and everybody thinks paywalls are gonna save us
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:03.160]   Conde just said they're putting everything behind a paywall all guys children think their mothers told them wonderful they should be paid for
[02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:06.120]   Ain't gonna work folks. Ain't gonna work
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:08.840]   Is this facebook's doing?
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:12.360]   No, no, it's it's digitization
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:17.000]   It's just a general trend that's been going on along and and facebook maybe
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:24.040]   Gave him a little life support for a little while with exactly pivot to video. Yeah squirrel, but it wasn't enough or is it?
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:26.040]   Yeah
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:30.840]   Plans to lay off 15 percent of its workforce according to memo sent to staff this evening
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:34.680]   Do you think craigslist actually did more to hurt?
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:41.080]   You have probably right they heard the classifies disclosure as i'm sitting here at the craig newmark graduate journalism
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:44.520]   Uh, thanks to my friend craig. Uh, no
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:51.560]   If we're not for craig the internet itself would have brought viruses, hello together
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:57.640]   There were all kinds of other services like monster and jobs realtors went direct auto dealers went direct
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:01.560]   craig was just uh the smartest first person to figure this out, but
[02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:04.280]   It was inevitable absolutely no
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:09.240]   Can I just point out this last paragraph? Oh, it is the media group that vryzen's doing the 800 they have
[02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:14.520]   Sorry, i just looked it up to check that's what they call it oath used to call it now it's the media growth
[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:18.600]   Uh, I do want to point out this last paragraph the new york times article buzzfeed
[02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:25.800]   Generated 300 million in revenue in 2018 a 15 percent jump from previous year, but it still loses money
[02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:30.600]   Yeah, how much does it what is the what it how much does the new york times generate?
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:37.000]   I mean that sounds like a lot of money is I guess the point i'm making
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.360]   Let's see
[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:45.320]   Uh, their revenue last year was 1.676 billion. Oh, all right a lot more
[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:50.840]   Five five minutes more 3.1 billion advanced publications 2.4 billion
[02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:54.360]   That's expensive to run a media empire
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:56.520]   Yeah
