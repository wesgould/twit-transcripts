[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.720]   We got tan's in Canada.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.640]   Yeah, but not all.

[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.560]   Yeah.

[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.640]   Yeah.

[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.360]   Jeff Jarvis has the week off but I think we can muddle through with these two great
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.360]   minds.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.360]   It's always a pleasure to have you both.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.800]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.400]   And it really is true that this show has not restricted itself to Google in a long
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.520]   time if ever.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.360]   But when you get great people together to talk about technology one of the things I
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.400]   was asking before the show Kevin Marks of course one of the Mavens behind the indie web
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:27.240]   camp and indie web movement the idea of the web for the rest of us.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.400]   One of the guests we had on this week on our triangulation show was the inventor of
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.560]   the wiki ward Cunningham and his newest effort the federated wiki which is a really interesting
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:49.160]   idea that if it baffles you Kevin Marks as I'm well over my head but it was an indie webcam.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.720]   Sean Sean I was I was showing it at an indie webcam and it was one of the things that when
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.960]   Ward shows you think that makes the amount of sense I can see what I can do with this
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.640]   and then I can't I installed it on my own site so I've got wiki.kmarks.com and I haven't
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.560]   actually used it so it's been sitting there for a couple of years and I've been going
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.600]   and I've never I don't think to go there which is interesting.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.880]   I think the challenge with wikis is that wikis you can use a wiki on your own and I have
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.160]   friends who do but it makes much more sense when you're using it with a group of other
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.840]   people to curate something so they're like indiewebcamp.com is a wiki and basically the
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.960]   way we run that community is a mixture of continuous chat that we have in IRC and on
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.040]   the web and in Slack or mirrored to each other and a wiki to collect the stuff that should
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.360]   be a bit more permanent so we can chat about stuff and then when we when somebody has something
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.800]   that makes sense to to preserve or somebody else a question we answer it we preserve the
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.640]   audience on the wiki so the wiki becomes this sort of community repulsive of knowledge.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.080]   That's cool isn't it? I love wiki. I love the idea of wiki. One of the things I told
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.640]   Ward right away is this is I think really what Tim Berners Lee original conception of
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:06.160]   the web was was a collaborative document with hyperlinks. Yes. I had one that was all about
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.320]   me because of my thought. Hey because I'm fascinated with myself. It's a great subject.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:19.200]   But I thought I could have a spot where instead of waiting for someone to do a bad wiki page
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.480]   for me I could just create my own wiki and put a bunch of stuff in there and if people
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.600]   wanted to look at it they could and it just I don't know it just there was no point to
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.080]   it in a way because there was no one else contributing right I think to Kevin's point.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.560]   It doesn't really become interesting until there's other people in there.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.120]   Right. Oh we've got a reason to document it or do stuff with it. Yeah I mean
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.680]   Tintik Chilik has his own wiki Tintik another. I think that's where I got the idea.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.480]   I've used wiki I for a long time the radio show website was a wiki because I had this silly notion
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.720]   that the listeners the radio show might want to go in there and contribute to it.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:07.200]   But not so much it was a lot of spam and what I mean of course wiki Wikipedia is the you know the
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.720]   the paragon of what wiki is all about but you need a community around it an active
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.280]   community and people who will patrol it. I actually started when I was at the newspaper
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.160]   the little bit mail I don't know if you remember I think it was was at the LA Times
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.920]   someone someone tried a wiki editorial do you remember that years ago. No what an interesting idea.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.800]   It was an interesting idea and a total disaster of course it was.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.200]   Unbelievable they did that on purpose I mean that was their way of it was the LA Times wasn't it.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.200]   And they said basically we're right editorial it's a wiki just to show that wiki is a bad idea
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.240]   that was my sense of it because oh really okay. So I finished something I mean so it was a no
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.960]   I did two or two it should not be edited by the public. So I didn't think it was a disaster.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.000]   But so I tried one when I was at the Globe and I what I wanted was people to discuss
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.400]   a specific topic so if the newspaper was talking about the Middle East I thought it'd be great to have
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:11.440]   kind of live not a discussion so much as people contributing their thoughts or links or commentary
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.160]   that they found or interesting things because there's no real way to do that in a newspaper you
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.720]   can have an op-ed piece and then maybe someone writes a letter. So I was exploring the sort of
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:29.680]   almost real time but but asynchronous contributions from readers and it was fascinating because it
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:36.160]   wasn't a disaster but it wasn't actually a huge success either. You know I got maybe a few thousand
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.040]   people contributing but we got some really smart contributions that just never really
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:49.360]   kind of gained any steam and then. And then that was that. Yeah well I mean the it was about you
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.240]   know WordPress isn't whether you use it. So but way back when I was at Apple I said
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.440]   we were working for the time team internally inside the firewall. Really? Because we were because
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.400]   Wikis were cool and we were getting fed up with mailing around Word documents to describe new
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.120]   features and things. So we built and the PMs were grumpy because the engineers would never respond
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.600]   to their Word document emails. And so I set up a wiki for the Quick Term team to see if we could
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.200]   discuss you know upcoming features and things wanted to do and the engineers went into it and
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.480]   actually started documenting things which made the PMs happy because they had something to read.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:28.800]   So it worked fairly well for a bit and then one day my manager called me to his office and said
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.440]   that wiki you've set up you need to put security on it. Did someone outside see our plans?
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.600]   No but the other group can see what we did. Well there you go. It kind of sums up a point.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:49.200]   Yeah we had multiple out of wiki for our digital staff and sort of social media and then some other
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:56.320]   department had a wiki and then someone else had you know a doc or they had Microsoft SharePoint
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:02.240]   or something and we could never get everyone on the same using the same tool. So it was sort of
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.480]   duplicating things everywhere. Actually the federated wiki would have worked really well for that.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.920]   I'm very intrigued by wiki still but um
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.520]   Ward's particular iteration is interesting because of the federation. The idea that
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.480]   the wiki will live in multiple places but then
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:32.320]   I don't think again I don't. Federation is a challenge because for instance
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:40.640]   there have been attempts to do federated Twitter. That's what Evan Padromo tried to do with app.net
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:47.680]   and the notion which it notionally seems like a great idea is that there are multiple servers
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:54.080]   and that what you tweet to app.net on one server is then somehow migrated to the others.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.960]   Evan's was something different though. Evan's was an app.net. Evan's was uh
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:07.120]   Yeah he was did app.net. They just renamed it to something else. No no Evan. Evan Padromo did um
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.440]   status status. They changed the status net but it was it was identical and then it was
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:17.920]   downstated. That's right. Right um and now that code base is new social so that's perhaps
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.960]   been open source um and there's actually there's actually a fed there is a fairly widespread
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.920]   federation of canoe social instances which is kind of fun. I love this and I love the idea but
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.440]   I don't understand really how it works. Yeah federation is bigger than my mind I guess.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.440]   Oh yeah. I love the way we think about it. It's not the way we think about it.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.400]   Yeah you think about site site site site site site site site site site site site site site site.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.960]   He's thinking about sites as silos thing right. Well that's that is the challenge yeah that it.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:53.680]   But um so if you if you go to quitter.no or quitter.sa um this is a canoe social um
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.240]   fault with a sin that looks like Twitter or it looks like, it's like you're not trying to win that.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.960]   Um
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.560]   nor losing your uh your bandwidth here. Tell your daughter or your son to stop
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:13.200]   bit touring. My son's in London. That's right well he can't mess you up from there. I don't think
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:19.520]   we're a federation of micro bloggers quitter.no who care about social justice and solidarity and
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:25.520]   want to quit the centralized capitalist services. Yeah how would other people? So that's that's
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:34.000]   quitter.no um and it's just the thing is quitter.se did this they've took canoe social which looked
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.560]   like um as only could be it and then they made a skin for it that makes it look like Twitter
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.080]   look so much like Twitter a few iterations ago this isn't quite like today's Twitter early
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:50.800]   Twitter um and it's fed around it and it's fed around it so if you go to um
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.320]   you know actually I'm going to do this log doc because I'm not going to get slightly different
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:02.480]   paveways. This might be timely because I feel like um it's the only thing keeping Twitter alive at
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:10.640]   this point is a lack of a reasonable alternative. You know okay you know what I mean? We loved I
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:16.400]   love what Twitter does. I really do and you know all you had to do was watch the uh academy awards
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.680]   on Sunday night uh actually you better be watching it live because if you're not then Twitter will
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:27.040]   spoil the whole thing for you but if you're watching live and watching the tweets live
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:33.760]   it's like sitting around with your friends. Exactly. Yeah. It's really fun and so I love Twitter.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:40.400]   And the thing is that but it doesn't but it has problems right? I mean it's not. Well
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:46.240]   well we have some problems because there's too many people. Yeah. Twitter was actually great
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.400]   when there were fewer people. Right. No I think that that's not it. I think I've written a long
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.800]   essay about this but I will. The thing is Twitter actually worked as a place where different sets
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:00.160]   people could coexist originally. Yes. Because you chose who you were following and so what you
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:05.600]   primarily saw was the people you followed. Um and yeah originally they had a public timeline which the
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.440]   um close up now as well but that Twitter doesn't have that anymore because it would be too big.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.720]   Um it would would have scrolled past too far so you'd make sense of anything.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:19.040]   Um but the primary thing you had on Twitter was a set of people you decided to follow
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:24.240]   and it was a list of what they were saying and that was what you saw. Um and then eventually they
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.520]   added app replies but it was a separate thing you clicked to see responses to you. It was another
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.320]   column that was not the default view. Yeah. So your default view of Twitter was the set of people
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:40.640]   you chose and to see. Right. Um and that's still kind of true with Twitter. Um it's rapidly becoming
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:48.000]   less true. Except they um when we came mobile we came an app and got notifications they got very
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.680]   excited about notifications and they said I walked me notified people about what I want to notify
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.760]   them every post that would be annoying though actually original Twitter would do that with SMS.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.560]   That was part of the way it grew originally was it would send you an SMS with every post.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.760]   So it was it was mobile before before everything else was not this was this is like pre-iPhone.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:14.560]   Um and then they let you turn that on and off and then um when it became an app um they made
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:21.680]   notifications out of the app replies. Um and originally we still had the sort of conventions
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:25.200]   around app replies and how they behave from the previous model which was that was the secondary
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.840]   thing you looked at. But gradually the app replies become more important than the main feed.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:36.560]   Because that's where the conversation happens. But also because it's notifying you. So um one of
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.680]   the wonderful things about Twitter originally was it didn't have an unread count. It was just this
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.600]   thing you could dip into an app. It was a stream. It was a stream and you would you know it's like
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.880]   oh I've got five minutes in the in the line at the shop I'll dip in Twitter for five minutes.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.280]   Um I'm waiting for a tray and I'm gonna put a five minutes. There's no pressure unlike email because
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:15:01.040]   it doesn't say 27 unread or 2500 unread if it's my email. Um and then they once they added the
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.600]   notifications they put an unread count on it. And so now if you've got an iPhone you've got a big
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.600]   red number on your Twitter which is all the app replies that you want. And they've made the
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.480]   app replies the most prominent thing about it. So they've taken what was a different space,
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.840]   had a very different social construct in it and made it back into an inbox. And the problem with
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:26.000]   inboxes is it prioritizes other people's agendas over your own. So if you've got an inbox and
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.560]   want to send you stuff then they they are sending you stuff and then they're putting stuff on your
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.360]   agenda. And so that's that was the basic problem of email that anyone could send you stuff. And
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.680]   Twitter has sort of recapitulated that with that replies. I think it actually got better.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.800]   Like that replies were actually part of what started getting me interested in Twitter. When it
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:52.400]   was just a stream not the following people who I liked wasn't interesting but the conversational
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:59.600]   aspect was what I was I became more interested in. And there was a brief kind of uh honeymoon
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:06.320]   period you know uh like Camelot or whatever where there was just enough people um with different
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:12.960]   interests to make an interesting conversation but not enough people with dramatically different
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.000]   interests who could dive bomb your app mentions and and and create some of the social problems
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.480]   that we're having now. But yeah well exactly but also the app mentions first you have to
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:29.680]   click to get to them they were they were a thing on the side. And secondly um the the initial app
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:35.360]   back and forth staff you only saw if you were following both parties. Right. So they did they
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:40.160]   did really did that to stop everything being a flood of ads. Um because people found it you know if
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.640]   two of you get get into a back and forth row um not necessarily everyone wants to see that.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.880]   So that was that was part of the dampening thing. And the challenge with all these systems is that
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.840]   is the is bridging between the show me the stuff I've chosen to see. Right. Connect me to what's going
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.920]   on in the rest of the world. Now that is that is always the back and forth we go to with all these
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.520]   systems. And so you know initially they had the public timeline and they're going to get a
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.440]   gestalt what was going on because there were only a you know a few thousand of us in there and it
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.360]   wasn't changing that often. And if you look at these new social things that happened. I'm going to
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.400]   get mad at me for retweeting something dude. I don't know if you remember because retweets were
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:21.520]   were new and I I kept retweeting people. This person got really mad and they're like why are you
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.880]   retweeting these things into my stream? I'm not interested in them. Get your retweets out of my
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:33.040]   stream man. And I thought well this was actually what I thought was part of what was interesting was
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:39.840]   people retweeting things that interested them. And he saw an intrusion on his feet. Well then he
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.440]   can unfollow you and go away. I mean that was at the point. So all right. So I will. But that was
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.840]   it. So the other point is that retweeting was an important piece of this because retreating was a
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:55.120]   way of amplifying something you saw that was good. So it creates this signal that that is useful and
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.600]   spreads it further. But it's a it's a natural thing. But it can go bad too. Right.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:08.560]   It can go bad. I actually got called out by Chris Saka who called me the the king of the witch hunt
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:15.040]   retweets. And for a second I didn't even know what he was talking about. But what does that even mean?
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:22.320]   But I think what he meant was me quote retweeting someone as though I was saying hey followers.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:27.680]   It was a pile on. Right. Which is not well okay. I've done that a couple times. But
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:33.920]   but that's typically what I do with a retweet. Well part of the the retweet is there's so there's
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:39.200]   three gestures in Twitter now. There's the like which is like this is interesting but also
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.960]   had a bunch of other nuances and we got the story. But then it was
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.760]   you know but you could see other people's list of likes. But then they started sending those
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.880]   notifications as well or sending you you know eight friends of yours like this thing. Right.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:02.400]   And notifications and stuff like that. So they again they brought they made that a higher
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.920]   stakes thing. There's the the retweet and the there was the classic retweet where you actually
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:13.520]   had to do it by hand and then there's the new retweet which is a button that just basically puts
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:18.240]   that thing to the top of the post in your time and shows it to your followers and brings it up
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:23.760]   to the top. People already see it. So that's that's a very useful way of restructuring the flow
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.720]   to give them a way to certain things. So you know these things all end up in somebody says
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:34.720]   something very witty or shocking then you will retweet it in regard there. And then the new one
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:42.320]   is the what the retreat quote which is basically what they've done is they've taken a thing that
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.360]   you could always do which is point to another tweet but they give you a preview of the tweet and
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:51.600]   they let you write above it. And so that it doesn't thread like the back and forth that replies.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:57.840]   So it's a way you've gotten mad at me about that because it breaks the conversation.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:02.800]   It can break the conversation. I mean it's but it's a way of responding to something
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:09.600]   for your audience not for the person you're talking to. So it's basically you're quoting
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.800]   something. It's like doing a block quote with somebody and commenting on it which is a
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.200]   very classic thing. Which you can do for a number of reasons. You can say this is interesting
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:24.320]   or this dumb or shocking or I have something to add. I mean if you get into a canoe
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:30.160]   like a tweet multiple tweets with multiple people you get like eight characters to put
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.520]   something in your tweet. Can't really have a discussion. But but also I mean the other thing
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:43.440]   it's like is it's it's like quoting something on your own site or you know it's making
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.280]   you know Facebook when you quote something you create a separate conversation thread
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:53.200]   for your followers. You're not in the same thread as everyone else. And so if you if you do that
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.080]   kind of post you're creating you're basically saying let's talk about this amongst ourselves
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.240]   kind of. Except that the notification does go back to the person who you're quoting so they
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:07.200]   get they can get dragged into a conversation. And and then you can get you can get the
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:12.880]   pylon problem. And the pylon problem is you know I'm holding this person up for sacrifice.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.400]   I nominate you for the Hunger Games. You will be shouting that right. And the reason that is a
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:23.200]   problem. And you know sometimes sometimes that is calling out can you believe what
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:28.960]   politician ex just said. And that that is you know that is the purpose of it. But often it is
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.760]   his look at this idiot let's all pile on him. And the reason those pylons are problematic
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:42.240]   is that they then become ways of destroying that person's twitter experience and and
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:48.640]   filling up their replies with noise. Which is the. It can be. It can be. But I think that also if you
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:58.160]   so if you are genuinely trying to broaden a discussion right assuming that ever happens or
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:03.840]   anybody actually wants to do that. I mean that's part of what I why I do those things because I
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:09.200]   think there are probably other people who don't follow either one of us who may have some thoughts.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.720]   So the but the problem is there's there's a sort of gray area between let's broaden the
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:21.440]   discussion and maybe people have some thoughts. And let me call out this person and the mob can
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:27.040]   take over. And there's and that sort of that gray area is where most of twitter exists right now.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:33.840]   But the thing is because you know so there's this this structural thing of the at replies
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:38.720]   becoming notifications is the thing that makes that a toxic behavior. If you if you were just
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:45.760]   discussing it amongst your your followers then that that would be you know a thing and it may be
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:50.960]   maybe you may be obnoxious but you're not at least you're not like it's not being thrown in the face
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.600]   of the person who you're talking about necessarily they'd have to go and look for that.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:59.200]   Whereas because of the structure this and so it would it would naturally dampen down.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.880]   Whereas because of this structure it actually feeds this thing and the feeds they they're sort
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.520]   of out grouping and shouting at each other thing. Well a lot of what I think twitter a lot of the
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:13.200]   things that twitter has done to make these problems worse are things that the company did to try
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:18.800]   and boost engagement because it was trying to become more valuable and justify its you know
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:24.560]   IPO and so on. And so a lot of the things that were aimed at increasing engagement actually
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:33.600]   boosted the sort of pile on problem. Now let's talk about an alternative like GNU Social.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:41.840]   Does this fix the problem or is it just a I'm sorry I'm just wondering about GNU Social.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:47.440]   Is this just a Twitter clone that replicates Twitter's problems or does this fix those problems.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.320]   It ends up with a different interesting different set of problems which is which is always
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.720]   fun to look at. There's always a different set of problems.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:59.920]   Different problems. So what happens is each of these basically there is a bunch of separate
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:05.920]   sides and you sign up for one of the sides. I just sign up for quitter.no for instance which
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.240]   seems to be the biggest of them right. I think quitter.se may be a big about any did you just
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:16.240]   sign up for it yeah okay so if you look at the front page you've got now yeah what
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.760]   I don't have a timeline because I'm not following anybody.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.920]   Okay so even follow me I'm Kevin Marks on there what are you who are you on there Leo.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.320]   Leo Laport I'm the same everywhere as you are.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:31.440]   Okay so I'll follow you on there. So I'm going to search for Kevin Marks as I would on Twitter.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.360]   I haven't customized my profile I'm busy doing a show right now but let me
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:40.560]   let me but I was able to do this. Okay there's Kevin so I'll follow you this looks very much like
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.720]   Twitter. No exactly this this skin is made to make it look exactly like.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.600]   I mean you probably can reskin it right. Yes so now you've got if you took your top left you've
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.480]   got a timeline yeah timeline it'll be me yeah it's just be it's the Kevin Marks timeline.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.200]   Actually it isn't because you haven't tweeted since maybe if I refresh it it'll bring in your
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:06.560]   tweets. You need to say something. I'll follow some more people. I presume I could follow Evan and
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:12.720]   a few more people. I ran we ran a status net it was identical at the time and identical
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.000]   it was called the Twitter army for a while and it was really cool to have our own Twitter.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.080]   Now federation often when people talk about federation they say well Twitter is not federated
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:29.600]   email is federated email is an example of a federation. So okay now I see you Kevin.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:35.600]   Okay so now so you see you've got a timeline link yeah under that you have a notifications link
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.720]   now that's you click timeline that's that's following. Okay timeline yeah so that's
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.160]   welcome to Twitter. You said calm but we won't nobody will quibble.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:49.280]   If you look at notifications. Can I by the way have they added editing of tweets?
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.760]   No because it's federated you wouldn't want to right because it's too late.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.080]   Are they even tweets? I'm sorry what do they call them? No not good news.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:02.560]   So there's there's debate about what to call them they were calling them tweets
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.840]   which which QU C S.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.240]   I it's not good but it's not a good name. No there's there's Swedish they thought it was funny.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.040]   In the days of identical what do we call them I'm trying to remember.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.760]   Dense they were called dense that's right.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.200]   They're now talking about calling them quips. Quips is good let's call them quips.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.560]   But then then re-quip is a bit weird but it's not really.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.240]   No re-quips is exactly right.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.960]   So so quip is a fairly good name anyway.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.280]   And I'm going to email you one that'll be called an equip.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:36.720]   Anyway you've got a timeline yeah you've got notifications which should be one in there
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.800]   because I asked you unless I got your name wrong.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.720]   Let's go look at notifications yes that's correct I see one.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.400]   Okay and then you've got favorites.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.640]   Yeah which is nothing because I haven't fave you.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.240]   Let me fave this here.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.800]   Oh they don't they only have a star they don't have a smiley.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.320]   All right all right.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.680]   All right no hearts they're gonna put downs in my favorites.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.400]   Yeah but then you've got public timeline so public timeline.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.960]   That's all the people that's how I would find new people right.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.320]   That's so click that.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.760]   Corey Doctorow is on here so that's enough for me it's loading.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:15.520]   We've just brought by the way the the the the web's administrators are going.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.320]   What's going on?
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.840]   This is going to be bad yeah they'll probably shut down registrations for a bit.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:24.560]   Anyway so public timeline is all the people who have accounts on this server.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.280]   On this server that's important this server.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.960]   Yes okay.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.040]   Whereas there's a thing under that called the whole known network.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:39.040]   Oh which is not related to known with known.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:39.440]   Right.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.600]   This is this is just an unfortunate name.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.680]   What that is is not just everyone on this server but also all the people on
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.840]   other servers that the people on this server follow.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:48.080]   Right.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.800]   So that is actually bigger and what you're seeing.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.280]   Oh wait a minute now wait a minute though it's not the whole known network.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:28:01.040]   It's the network the GNU social network that is contains people followed by people on quitter.no.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.000]   Yes.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:02.960]   Important distinction.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:03.840]   Yes.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.040]   It's it's not everyone.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.880]   But that's actually good because what you're getting is if you've got this social network
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:13.120]   that's quitter you're getting people that other quitters are interested in.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.640]   Yes.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.640]   So the thing is you can see what I'm seeing on this one is something in greeks.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.720]   It's very international.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.640]   A bunch of other stuff going on.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.360]   As it should be.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:30.400]   But it's not something you know but but if you actually look over over them.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.040]   You can see that some of them are on different servers so they're going to go.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:35.440]   See.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.880]   They're.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.000]   Where's that one someone's local.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.560]   You can even go to the original quip.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.240]   I like it they're calling them quips.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.320]   So you can go you can go through to these other servers.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.160]   So there is some federation between them.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.280]   There's also a sense that each of the servers has its own
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.480]   house style and you join a server where the public timeline makes sense to you.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.040]   Should you run your own server?
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.200]   You can do it's up to you.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.400]   I know you can but should you.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.440]   It's like running your own wiki.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.640]   It's like if you've got a set of people that would make sense to you can do that.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.520]   If you just want to have a place that's all yours you can do that too.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.800]   It's up to you.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.920]   And then if you tweet on I'm sorry quip on your server.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.960]   It would federate to other servers.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.320]   So somebody could follow you.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:21.200]   So what is my what is my what's my name space would be the name of my server.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.320]   It would be Leo Laport at the server name.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.080]   At Quitter don't know.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:26.400]   Yes.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.080]   And then somebody followed Leo Laport at quitter.no.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.240]   On another server.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.200]   So that's how it federates.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.320]   It would federate they would get the federate updates and they would also add you to the whole
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.920]   the whole known network on that server.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.640]   Yeah got it.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.520]   Is there any way to.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.120]   Is there any way.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.160]   So we.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:44.400]   Sorry.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.120]   And also have that appear on Quitter.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.040]   Um there are ways to do that that I won't go into but yes you can do this.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:56.400]   And vice versa right I could post on more to the point I could post on my what I really
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:02.240]   want to do is run the server locally my have my own that federates and also can then syndicate.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:08.560]   In other words I want to with with known I want to known for Twitter for Twitter for
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.360]   going to social can.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.640]   Well can we get Ben and Aaron working on that.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:17.760]   I tried using app app.net I tried using identity.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:22.640]   I was on app.net for a considerable amount of time but there's nobody there.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.600]   There was no presence.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.480]   No nobody there were people there.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:32.000]   But and I did do some cross posting and I actually got yelled at for cross posting from Twitter.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.040]   There's zealots everywhere on there.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.120]   But so then so then you're creating.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.080]   Also what we find with this is that the different sites have different personalities.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:40.480]   Yes.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.320]   Um you know there's.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.400]   Up is network effects so all everybody I know or want to.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:46.960]   It's all fragmented.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.640]   It is on Twitter.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:48.880]   Right.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.760]   Virtually.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.040]   Almost everyone.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.160]   So then now I've got a separate place that I have to go to.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:58.240]   It's the same reason I use Facebook messenger because everybody I want to message is on there.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.680]   But prefer telegram because I like it better and it's not.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.800]   And this is why Twitter like even while Twitter was going through.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.600]   Why it continues.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.120]   All the yeah all the problems that was going down all the time.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.600]   It was and they keep adding dumb features and people just keep using it because
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.640]   everyone they want to interact with is there.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.640]   Patterson in our chat room says he just wants a CB radio for the internet.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.280]   But you know I kind of understand that.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.560]   That's kind of what this is isn't it.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:33.120]   And it would be nice if Twitter were a little more open with its API.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.680]   Maybe you could make it easier to federate from Twitter and to Twitter.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   But I don't see any chance of that happen.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.080]   Well I mean the the challenge what the challenge you see with these is that they all
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.680]   end up with different personalities.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.320]   And so they get grumpy if you put things in the public timeline you don't want.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:52.640]   Right.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.840]   So there's.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.000]   Well that's the interesting thing.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.720]   Nobody follows the public timeline on Twitter that is the timeline of every post.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.960]   First of all because it goes by a mile a second.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.720]   But on these they're smaller is very common.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:13.440]   We found this on ours as well that on the Twitter army identity everybody would follow the timeline.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.280]   That's that's what you would mostly visit is all posts.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.120]   And I remember doing that on Twitter too.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:19.440]   Right.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.920]   Yeah I remember doing that in 2007 on Twitter.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.480]   No but it's one of the things that makes sense at different scales is that
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.760]   you're able to follow the whole public timeline one of these and it makes sense of that scale.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:32.320]   And they have you know there's there's other ones like there's sea lion dot club and there's
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.560]   other ones that are that are designed for people to be trolls on and sea lions.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.520]   And do you know and like talk about trollish things and that that has a very different
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.600]   flavor to it than and we probably don't want to put that on the screen can we think of it.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.200]   Then so what.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.840]   Let's go there.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.520]   Flavor with that.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:58.880]   Actually believe it or not I can't even follow my own timeline.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:04.160]   So all the people that I follow I cannot look at that timeline because it goes by too quickly.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:09.280]   Because I'm following too many people so all I do is use lists I gave up.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:13.520]   Yeah I mean I should just unfollow a month but it would take so long.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.360]   So now it just is less and if it wasn't for lists I wouldn't probably be able to.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.320]   But this is the problem.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.040]   You know it's the this place to say no but it goes or any more problem.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.960]   Which is just too far.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:30.480]   But the thing is you are you but it's also the sense it's the balance between the
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.920]   chosen conversation and the public space and the bridges between the two.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:41.840]   And what are the bridges between the two are these at replies that connect things and they
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.640]   they can be toxic.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.520]   It's also the hashtag.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.240]   It's like things.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:49.920]   Which which bridges across so yeah you can put hash Oscars in and then you can all be
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.960]   talking about the Oscars at once and you can't you couldn't follow that whole tag on the
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.680]   ones I am.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:58.640]   But you could follow but you could follow if amongst your followers it would actually they
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.240]   would actually make some sense potentially.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.200]   And you know even there just watching your stream of followers discuss the public event
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.320]   can be a useful thing as well.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.960]   So it is the challenge of bridging these things together but the hard part about it is
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.440]   you're really talking about social dynamics and how they get into
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.920]   interacted with by software.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:24.000]   You know what fascinates me and I had this conversation earlier today.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:31.280]   This has been going on for some time but the the discussion was about how part of the problem
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:37.680]   with Twitter is that it's not really it's sort of verbal so sort of like conversation
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.880]   and yet it's sort of like publishing right.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.000]   So it's actually good and bad parts come from
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.320]   mushing both of those things together.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:46.800]   Yes.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.680]   So it's a little like having a discussion with people in a bar but then it's also.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:57.440]   But those discussions are preserved forever and thoroughly analyzed and create outrage.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.560]   So when you say something dumb in a bar but you're drunk.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.920]   Everyone understands.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:02.400]   Right.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.880]   No one no one like writes it down and then hands it out to everybody
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.360]   so that or publish it in the newspaper.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:15.760]   I found it fascinating that Mark and Driveson left Twitter for in fact.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.520]   In chagrana embarrassment.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.800]   Still hasn't tweeted.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.840]   No he tweeted once.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.560]   Like like yeah no he congratulated.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.440]   But nine.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.560]   Yeah so because of a tweet this man Facebook had to apologize to an entire country.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.200]   And and sort of mark it because of a tweet.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.280]   That's the power of the Twitter.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.280]   Well that's I mean that's not good or ill.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.760]   It's something he said if he had said it to you and I.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.120]   You know or even in a right in a public place.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.640]   It would not have had lived at all.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.360]   Right.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.880]   And he said the public place somebody would have written it down to you know he's he's enough
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.080]   about to figure that that was true.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:48.080]   True.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:48.800]   But he.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.200]   True.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:49.680]   But yeah.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:55.520]   But well there's that PR person who who made a vaguely racist comment before she got on the
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.640]   plane to South Africa and had been fired by the time the plane landed.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.320]   She wasn't famous.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.400]   What we're trying to figure out is how.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:02.960]   It's a game famous.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.200]   How does that change your behavior?
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.320]   If the things you say.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:12.880]   Things you just shoot your mouth off or you're you're tired or you haven't thought about something
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.880]   properly or you're had too many drinks.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.240]   What what happens when those things become.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.440]   Take on the power of basically publishing.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.720]   I've said said extraordinarily dumb things on Twitter.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.440]   Hurt friends there have been consequences many times.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.600]   And you know you maybe you hope you're learning a lesson but it really is.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.920]   It's very easy to say things on Twitter that you deeply regret.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.440]   Because it yeah because it feels like you're not it feels so.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.560]   It's so influential.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:43.760]   So.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.320]   So.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:49.040]   Well that's so that was I mean originally you know I wrote a thing about this in 2009 or something.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:53.840]   And where I was hopeful for the future of Twitter because precisely because.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.800]   Your mental model when you're reading Twitter is the set of people you follow.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.120]   Right.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.280]   So you you you see the set of things that people you follow say and you respond to those.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:07.440]   You're having a conversation with that audience except your audience is actually the people who follow
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.560]   you with a different set of people.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.160]   And they're you know they probably overlap but.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:18.880]   And the thing is if those things are all soft overlaps then that can work very well as a way of
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:22.080]   ideas sharing and some of them being amplifying some of them being dampened and so on.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.720]   The problem comes when.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.920]   People start.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:34.080]   Out grouping each other and using it to to fight other wars and fight battles between people.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.720]   And so rather than following the set of people that they want to follow.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.560]   They will go and find people who say things disagree with and argue with them
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.880]   because they know that if they apply them that will get into their face one of that somebody in the
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:50.640]   channel was saying I like sending gay porn images to to.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.000]   And it's like.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.720]   Yes I can think you probably do like doing that but that isn't actually going to change his mind.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:00.960]   Right.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.400]   No it's going to annoy him.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.680]   It's his position and.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.760]   And he'll say look at these people they're terrible look at these things they're doing.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.000]   Right.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.760]   And it goes back and forth and amplifies the thing it doesn't actually contribute to the discourse.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:18.800]   So the easiest way to build a group is to find somebody who isn't in the group
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.640]   pointing them and say look at them over there aren't they terrible and that reinforces the group.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:28.640]   And the challenge for Twitter is to reinforce the in grouping around the out grouping and originally
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.200]   they were they were.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:36.480]   Partly this was an outgrowth hat was originally built and the social structure it built partly
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:42.400]   because it was built by people who were activists like Ravelin Blaine who were who had thought about
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:42.880]   this stuff.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:48.240]   And then as you say it gradually got sort of we've got a increase engagement what
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.560]   increase engagement and the easiest kind of engagement to increase is people shouting at each other
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.000]   because once you start doing that it's hard to stop.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.840]   So once the somebody says the homophobic thing and this chap sends him gay porn and they start
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.440]   shouting at each other and it's going to be very hard to get closer to.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:11.280]   They also have a very obvious kind of incentives.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:15.680]   I don't know whether they did this deliberately or whether it just happened because it's one of
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:21.360]   the things about Twitter is it's impossible to know what was planned and what wasn't because so
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:26.320]   much of what has become was totally unplanned. But they've but in the incentives are you see
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:32.720]   the likes or you see the retweets or you see the and you get a little endorphin rush right
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:38.400]   every time oh I said something funny and so you maybe push it a little bit further or maybe you
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:45.200]   because you you want that that actually encourages bad behavior just as much as it encourages good behavior.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.600]   Yes.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.480]   Well I don't know.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.960]   You know I don't know what to do.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:53.760]   How do we fix it?
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:59.920]   How do I do feel like if there were a solid alternative to Twitter that people would be
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.280]   glad to go to it.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.160]   They would not.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.840]   You don't think so because there's nobody there.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:09.200]   And I think right that's the problem you have to get over I think every all of these things have
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.880]   been their great alternatives lots of them have great features.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:19.840]   And the Federation is a great idea but there is nothing if like if people were going to do that
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.280]   they would have done it by now. There's nothing that is going to move people,
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.920]   enough people off that or off Facebook to some other network.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:32.720]   I just don't I don't see what could possibly offer that would make people do that.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:37.520]   Well I mean you know there's you can say that but this has happened before.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.320]   I have we could have said that about MySpace.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:40.880]   MySpace.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.440]   Five years ago.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.160]   Oh who could actually get us to the scale of MySpace.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:50.560]   So people these these things grow exponentially and then they collapse fast too when when people
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:55.440]   start leaving and Twitter sphere is that they're in that state now that that post from Julianne and
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:00.720]   more was saying boobs rather than yeah.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.000]   Boop's readily it's like it's like.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.080]   Not Julianne more.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:04.880]   No.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.760]   Got a last name.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.120]   Sorry Julianne.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:12.160]   Well look I'll go a real last minute.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:16.080]   But she's saying it's like it feels like Julianne Smolensky.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:20.480]   It feels like I'm going through the through the neglected park now and it used to be this
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:25.680]   nice place and now it's I you know have to hold my purse carefully to myself as I walk through it
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:30.800]   and it's stopped being it's not being nice and that that is the that is the problem that it has
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:36.240]   become and part of that is that they coasted for a while on the initial culture which was this
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:42.880]   sharing culture following people you you you or were interested in not necessarily new and
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:47.200]   having that back and forth with them that was somewhat dampened because it took some work to find
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:52.960]   who was replying to go back and forth and by amplifying that that feedback loop they've they've
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.760]   flipped the the culture of Twitter to the point where Twitter is now synonymous with shouting
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:02.800]   abuse in public right and you know it's if you if you list if you if Twitter is mentioned in popular
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:08.720]   culture they're either saying you know tweet to save the person on American Idol or whatever
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:14.560]   or they're all they're describing it as as a byword for for people shouting at each other
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:18.320]   and that's that's the piece of the fix and that's going to be hard to fix because
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:23.120]   they they need to first things were just a technology such that the app replies aren't the most
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:27.200]   important thing in the app again rather than having an algorithmic filter on the timeline
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.000]   you know an algorithmic filter on the app replies so it's like I should probably see
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.400]   out replies to people that I already had in conversation with over random drive by people who
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:41.200]   are who are shouting me because I mentioned Bernie Sanders or something I mentioned a keyword that
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:48.000]   somebody's decided to go and shout about today right and they but they the structural thing they
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.600]   need to think about there is changing the culture to back to this culture that reinforces in-group
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:43:00.400]   discussion rather than outgroup and but I think but I but I think that that could actually make
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:04.960]   it worse as well but in a different way because I think if you I mean we've had
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:12.720]   a number of arguments show but so if it if it encourages you to just talk talk to people
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:17.440]   you're already connected to and agree with then then you're missing out on one of the biggest sort
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:24.000]   of potential benefits of having a broad network like that the problem is your that and this
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.480]   happens with comments as well which I've looked at a lot that if you you want a low barrier to entry
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:36.560]   right you want to lower kind of the obstructions to people interacting because that's where you get
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.840]   a lot of the benefits but but as soon as you lower those barriers or make it easier to do those
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:49.600]   things then you get lots of trolls and more so you can't actually have one without the other
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:55.200]   you can't you can't get something without giving something up so you know Twitter's
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:03.920]   big issue is how do they what are you prepared to do that will actually give up a certain amount
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:10.400]   of growth or engagement in return for these other benefits and then users would have to make the
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:17.360]   same you know choice whatever the point is is that it is it the it's more that you have to model the
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:22.240]   engagement better so if you're if you're more if you're just modeling it on number of tweets
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:26.960]   sent and people signed up then you're actually actually modeling people shouting each other and
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:32.160]   creating spam accounts to share with each other more and creating a assuming that's a positive value
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:39.520]   so actually what you mean is in a mill or nuance metric which is is there actually a useful
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:46.960]   conversation going on here when they're trying to say that well that's the problem you first of
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:53.600]   all you ask people you know you have if you do some qualitative stuff first you know and if you
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:58.320]   do a qualitative survey of twitter you will get the answers from from like Julian Smolensky's
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:02.480]   article which is it doesn't feel comfortable anymore I feel like I have to back away from it
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:08.880]   and that is the quality of answer you need to say okay what is causing that what are things we can
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:16.640]   do to fix that and the answer is make the make it closer to the things you choose to see you know
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:21.840]   basically it's one too far into the public shouting space as opposed to the filter bubble
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.280]   the big fear five years ago was we're building footer bubbles we're only going to see our own
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:31.920]   corner of the world I mean actually what we ended up building was the filter bubble where they gather
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:36.080]   together and then go and attack the other the other filter bubble and then shout at each other and
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:39.520]   that's the game and yes this is as old as the internet this is this is
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:46.560]   well this is the usenate the original usenate raid on rec.pets or whatever you know yes
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:51.520]   it's it's a it's a structural problem it's a problem we we've had with email it's a problem
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:56.080]   we've had with blog comments and the reason people fear those you've had it with youtube comments
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:02.960]   and the problem is always that you have to be able to fix it well that's what I'm saying twitter
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:07.840]   did twitter early on was a better space for this the reason twitter took off was that you were able
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:13.680]   to have as a sort of public figure you know in the sense of adjourners or even you know a famous
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:19.440]   person you were able to have a conversation on there with other people that wasn't swamped by
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:27.040]   by the replies now but i don't think it's just the volume of people
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:37.040]   i so maybe the solution is for people who are fleeing twitter to use twitter as a read-only
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:42.240]   public broadcast medium and then to have their conversations in a quieter place like twitter.nl
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:51.280]   or twitter.se or ganoo social somewhere wouldn't what about that doing that with dms i mean yeah dms
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:56.400]   become your private area right your private discussion area and then you sort of withdraw
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.800]   as a kind of regret though that we can't have a commons of some kind that
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:06.960]   that is the rise of slack yeah but slack is now about to starting to get i see a lot of posts all
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:11.440]   of a sudden people saying oh great i i just replace place my inbox with slack which is now turning to
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:16.640]   my inbox yeah right no and it is it is the same notification issue we're getting and
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:21.760]   except that i've now got 27 inbox 2727 slack so um sure and yes
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.760]   it is the problem of success there's too many damn people on this planet that's the real problem
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:32.000]   well that is that is that is the problem there are too many people there is you you cannot follow
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:39.600]   everyone um you cannot you cannot have every contribution to the discourse on the same page it
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:45.040]   just doesn't make sense right um and these things are power or distributed so what works for one end
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:49.680]   of the tale where there's you know a small conversation doesn't work at the other one a tale where
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.760]   a thousand people are in the conference trying to be in the conversation and 500 of them are
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:59.840]   making the same lame joke and 250 of them are shouting abuse um and which is the whole
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:06.640]   whole thing clashing clashing sort of not worldviews that's too to grandiose a term but
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:14.400]   so like filter bubbles i guess but bubbles running into bubbles so you and all your tech friends think
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:22.960]   this thing is hilarious and so you make fun of it but but that thing happens to be racist or
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:28.080]   it's offensive to someone in some way that you haven't thought of because all of you think it's
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:34.080]   hysterical and so then those things clashing into each other creates you know if it was just you guys
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:38.640]   going bowling or and talking about this thing it probably wouldn't turn into anything that's what
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:43.920]   twitter used to be right yeah what you had for lunch when all of those things are happening out in
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:51.440]   public then it becomes you shouting obscenities or offensive things instead of you just doing it
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:57.440]   with your body what does ganue social do about harassment i mean do they have tools built in
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:01.040]   this is the other complaint of course about twitter is they've become a wonderful platform for
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:09.040]   harassment um well that's and that's the thing um is that the harassment comes with the out replies
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:15.040]   right um if i'm if i'm just you know if i'm just writing horrible things about lio somewhere on my
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:20.160]   own blog and and they're not being sent to you that's much less of a problem right um by that
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:25.440]   way that was twitter's response oh you're being harassed we'll just mute them right just but that
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:30.800]   doesn't stop people doing it so so what happens is whoever's running the individual server has
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:35.360]   some tools of it because they're the server admin so they can kick accounts off they can put blocks on
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:43.360]   them um the challenge is in this um whole no network view if i follow someone another server that is
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:48.400]   posting offensive things that will show up in that view on this server and so then they have to do a
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:53.840]   federation block on that server they have to um you know block accounts and that so that there are
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:59.120]   there are some tools for doing that and this this has this has come up recently amongst because a bunch
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:05.840]   of um game-a-gate types have been setting up new social servers to argue with the other new social
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:11.680]   servers and that didn't take long and then then they say well you can post what you like just
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:15.760]   just don't post porn on this and then someone says well i'm gonna post porn on this and then you know
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.280]   and then they set up a server for posting porn and then they follow them on the other server and
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:27.520]   you know so yeah basically if people have decided to mess with you then federation is hard and you
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:33.040]   have to start putting filters in place um the challenge is are you trying to do this for everyone
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.880]   on earth which is the which is twitter's problem and why it's hard or can you do it locally within
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:46.880]   one server so um when when there was a lot a lot of fuss from um the the Breitbart lot on on twitter
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:51.680]   about being banned and so on a bunch of them went to quit to quit it.se and said okay when it
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.160]   created council yeah really and and the quit it as you see people said no we actually we don't want
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:01.360]   you here we don't like your politics if go and set your own one up if you want to have one um and
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:05.600]   then that that disclaimer they put on the top about we we believe in social justice and and
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:10.400]   linking the the the communist manifesto and things was their way of saying actually right
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:16.080]   wings we don't want you on this server if you want oh that's recent they've added that so it was
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:21.680]   it was it's few months old or something right so so you know the the thing there is you can
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:26.960]   excuse the bubble and then you you can follow across the bubble but then the admins if they if
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:33.120]   people start trying to troll each other then it creates problems the admins and you know i
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.800]   follow a bunch of the admins on different servers and see and see the problems they're having with
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:43.120]   this um and and trying to work this stuff out should Kanye create his own ganoo social
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:49.920]   he totally could Kanye not know he's what he's the best thing about twitter yeah
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:55.520]   i think i just goes mental and everyone enjoys watching him and i know twitter probably thinks
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:01.600]   this is great because it oh it's great for twitter are you kidding yeah but i think but i think to
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:09.040]   to kevin's point twitter has effectively created this problem and i don't see how they get out of it
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:15.120]   so they you know they're a public company the stock tanked by like 60 percent or something i don't
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:19.920]   know what it is now but i mean it's lost billions and billions of dollars worth of market value
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:28.640]   that it once had um user growth has slowed to the trickle if at all um and i realize there's a lot
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:33.760]   more people who don't sign in that was Fred Wilson's argument the other day and that is a huge
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:37.920]   part of the way people use twitter but so you've got to wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:43.200]   say that again don't sign in yeah there not really is read only and there's no at replies because
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:48.560]   you don't have an account yeah but then you're a lot of but then you're you might have to know
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:55.440]   someone's name or you're clicking on um what do you call them ma'am oh moments yeah moments love
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:02.000]   that moment so then and obviously the value of those people i think is lower but regardless so so
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:09.520]   twitter is public entity right but user growth isn't increasing which when you're a public company is
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:16.080]   bad something is not growing it might as well be shrinking in real life in real life we have
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:24.960]   of a right things totally fix the problems but still you know create more value without
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:32.240]   making the problems worse right in real life we have a diversity of spaces we have very public
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:38.640]   spaces where people act out uh and we have private spaces and sometimes you want just a
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:44.160]   conversation in a quiet neighborhood pub and sometimes you want to go to the stadium
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:49.680]   and we can have those experiences can we not do that digital or does digital
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:55.440]   or or is there something that is more digital native than than that i mean i i don't like it when
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:01.120]   we try to glom real world experiences into digital experiences but well i feel like kevin's right
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:10.480]   in a way that the twitter could have had more um a more sort of fluid you know small not so small
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:18.960]   little bit larger everybody kind of experience um and now you just have dms or right you're talking
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:24.400]   to the football stadium right um and and maybe if they had tried a little harder along the way
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:30.480]   they could have created some of those different ways of having that and not incentivized
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:35.680]   but the bad behavior let's take a break because we got we kind of move on but i think a great
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:40.720]   discussion and this weekend twitter this week in twitter i told you at the beginning it's anything
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:45.280]   you can google because the subject though twitter has always been this has always been the show about
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:49.600]   twitter facebook and google not just google and it's just kind of historically called this week in
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:55.440]   google but really it's it's really about the the the internet uh as it's evolving i wonder if google
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:01.280]   plus could have become that space i feel so sad about what happened uh with google plus it just kind
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:07.120]   of the circles was an interesting like i they were attempting to do something weren't they yeah
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:11.600]   that was the point of the circles um the side of the circles was you you create some sets of things
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:16.640]   to look into and it's it was like a smart version of lists right um but it was also a sense of you
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:21.200]   were publishing to that to that subset of people um and and the challenge of it is how do you model
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:26.560]   those and yeah it's not just that lots of people didn't do it some huge proportion of people just
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:30.240]   because no one wants to spend the energy to make circles that's a lot that's not what
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:37.680]   that's not good that's not good that's not good that's not good that's not good that's not good
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.440]   you know facebook has lists facebook has i know it was the irony was that he said that even though
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:47.440]   they had lists but i bet you he knows because they have lists how few people really use them right
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:54.160]   no but what they have is they have like chat subgroups so the the way facebook structures this is you
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:59.280]   build a a set of people you're chatting to what is just before we wrap this up what is the uh
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:05.760]   the style of quitter.ano i mean you said each kind of one of these canoe social sites is his own
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:12.880]   kind of style and it's a it's a program or is it open source folks it's sort of
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:16.960]   kind of i know it's like no lee jin says we're justice to people
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:21.440]   i love that that's so small news that's who i want to hang out with
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:32.000]   and what more of those all right we're gonna take a break and return with actual google news
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.440]   but first the google car gets in its first accident caused by the google car and brad
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:43.200]   templton who is a uh autonomous vehicle guru and the celebrant says that's a good thing
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:49.920]   that's a good thing our show day brought to you by our friends at square space

[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:32.160]   customize my my little profile followed kevin Matthew so the google self-driving car
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:38.400]   uh it was the Lexus it was the big one not the little one without pedals and steering wheel so
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:44.720]   there was a driver behind the wheel struck a bus in california on valentine's day it was in
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:51.440]   mountain view it was on the city streets it was an interesting situation and it's kind of an
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:58.880]   interesting uh you know test of the software so they're coming up to a red light and the car
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:05.600]   wants to make a right turn so as it would it's instructed to it gets in the as far right as it can
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:13.040]   so it can make the right turn but then there's a storm drain with sandbags around it in that lane
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:18.080]   so the car correctly senses the storm drain and the sandbags and stops
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:26.240]   now the light turns green the car is stuck behind stymied so it's going to pull around the sandbags
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:30.960]   and get into the next lane over unfortunately that lane occupied by a city bus
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:39.600]   uh the vehicles operator saw the bus approaching but quote believe the bus would stop
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:45.440]   or allow the google autonomous vehicle to continue about three seconds later
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:50.000]   hit the bus now it's only going two miles an hour the bus is going about 15 miles an hour
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.280]   what's this is a classic human being thing right you you you you expect it to let you in
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.960]   you try to move and you're like dude why are you not letting me in you don't don't you i don't know
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:06.080]   what you do in Canada but but don't you just kind of start to edge in and just say you're gonna
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.480]   have to he's gonna have to stop right and so you expect the other person to look at what you're
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:17.440]   doing and then decide so for whatever reason the google bus or the bus decided you look like a
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:22.000]   funny view maybe the bus looked at it and said hey you got lidar you know uh i don't need to let you
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.400]   in well but that's the other thing i mean so there's a there's a post i put in from water blog from
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:31.280]   september saying google was trying to make the self-drying cars more aggressive because other
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:36.480]   drivers were confused by how they behaved on the road because they were too timid right um now my
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:41.280]   suspicion is that any amount of you bus driver has seen these things for years and those that they'll
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:46.480]   get out of his way because that's how they have been they have been very rule following and so
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:49.280]   the bus driver was like always one of those things well i can carry on through because
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:56.960]   they always get out of my way um and you know but it didn't but it didn't um because they made
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.240]   them a little bit more aggressive because they've tried to make it drive more like a human but i
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.880]   suspect the other thing is they probably haven't really haven't thought through this whole how big
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:10.000]   is the thing i'm trying to cut off problem which is that if it's a bus if it's a truck you don't play
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.840]   that game so exactly yes you un-do that what's the point you're moving to right you know you don't
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.000]   get in front of a bus those guys are nuts they don't care right but also it's a matter of
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.200]   physics it's like that thing cannot stop very easily it yeah there was this there was this whole
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:29.840]   it was you know wasn't just a bus it was an articulated bus ones with the joints in the middle it was
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:38.160]   a big bus it hit it by the way it hit right in the joint right so i originally thought this was
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:41.440]   like one of the little tiny google things which would i would tell you understand the bus like
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.600]   trying to come back off i didn't realize it was the mid-in-size-lexus one but the point is that
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.720]   i this makes perfect sense what you just said kevin now explains the whole thing you're the
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:56.880]   first to explain this because uh there's nothing worse than getting to like in california we have
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:02.880]   these things called four-way stops and it's got arcane rules about what happens at a four-way
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.040]   stop first person it's said straightforward if if people arrive in order the first person gets
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:12.000]   there gets to go but if people arrive simultaneously you have to defer to the person on your right and
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.320]   it's a weird situation and the most annoying thing that can happen is some guy sitting there
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:24.880]   whose turn it is going no no no you go yeah right you go that's like no follow the freaking rules
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.280]   right you're not playing which is what i you're breaking the system by being
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:38.320]   wall polite oh no you go no you go i find a fascinating that google is trying to find the right sort of
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:43.600]   algorithm for aggressiveness isn't it interesting so you need to be a little bit aggressive right
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:48.240]   because otherwise you start causing problems but the other challenge is the four-way stop thing
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:53.520]   is what you do is you make eye contact right and if you're self-driving right right right
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:57.600]   all right i can't look at them you can't see if they've seen you so you're relying on are they
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.320]   moving or not and they they had another case they talked about a while back which was um somebody
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:08.320]   was on a fixy bike and so on a fixy bike you're not going to stop you're particularly back and forth
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.200]   yeah so he was jiggling back and forth away from the car to go and the car was
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.960]   car was thinking jiggling back and forth saying oh he's going oh he's going and it was like an
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:20.080]   impasse until it's a thing that you need on verbal cues right like so if you're looking over your
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:25.440]   shoulder and you want like i would have looked at the bus and you'd be like you know like
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:31.360]   could you and then the bus driver would look at you and you would get the sense that he was the
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:36.640]   kind of bus driver who did not want to let you in and then in a split second he would kind of come
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:41.680]   to an agreement here's what Brad here's what Brad Templeton wrote i love Brad uh
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:50.400]   usenet pioneer now and very big into autonomous vehicles he has a a blog grads ideas at the ideas
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:56.960]   dot for Brad dot com number four he writes um so why is this a good thing well because google
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.560]   starting to work on problems like these and you need to solve these problems to drive even an
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:06.480]   orderly like places like california he talks about India where there's the lane lines are purely
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:13.200]   a suggestion and nobody pays any attention whatsoever so he says to solve this problem we have to we
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:20.480]   have to solve come up with a resolution um get the get the computer to do the right thing he says in
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:27.760]   this case google says it learned that big vehicles are much less likely to yield uh he also says it
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.840]   sounds like the vehicles confusion of the sandbags probably made the bus driver decide the vehicle
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:39.120]   was stuck right oh you can't move um nobody wants accidents some will play this accident as more
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:43.600]   than it is but neither do we want so much caution that we never learned these lessons it's also a
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.520]   good reminder that google even though it's a clear leader in this space still has lots of work to do
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:51.280]   it's worth noting and this is what you brought up kevin that sometimes humans solve this problem
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:57.520]   by making eye contact to know well did he see me turns out robots can do that because the human
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:02.720]   eye flashes brightly in the red and infrared when looking at you that's why you have red eye
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:08.000]   with a flash camera you can't detect well so you can know if it sees you right but it's another
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:16.080]   level to detect intent yes he says that if you've driven anywhere in like in India or China or
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:22.800]   lots of places where traffic rules are just a suggestion you you govern yourself a lot by what
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.120]   what's the person how are they looking right they look aggressive right so now they can
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:31.840]   you have to determine as the book driver look aggressive what a challenge well that's that's
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:37.840]   the pedestrian crossing thing in in Ireland um if you make eye contact with the driver then the
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:43.040]   driver says well you see me so i can go um whereas in california if you may i go into the driver you're
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.880]   saying you you're basically saying i want to go go to and so that that can cause a cultural
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:52.080]   collision as well then it's a different sense of of how to behave in the substances when we moved to
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:07:00.400]   Edmonton Alberta um that we were from Toronto where for Canadians people are aggressive
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:06.480]   like in lots of other places but for Canadians and so then we moved to Edmonton if you even
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:13.840]   move towards if you're walking move towards a roadway cars will stop even when there's no cross
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:18.800]   what because they assume oh you're indicating a desire to cross in Toronto you just have to
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:24.160]   you have to go yeah you're around the cars but they literally stop and then you have to be like
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:30.560]   no i actually changed my mind i don't want to cross the road you go ahead yeah and that's and
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:34.880]   you know if you look at the visualizations they post for the other thing they draw little boxes
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:39.840]   around the pedestrians and the and the cyclists to decide where they're going to go and then they
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:44.240]   don't cross those boxes and so they are trying to work out if someone's trying to step off the
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:52.160]   curve or not all the time and it's no and that's different like i don't know why but some reason
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:58.320]   looking at a picture of Market Street in the early 19th or 20th century oh he's running in front
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:03.680]   of the streetcar no watch out here it comes if you look back at when cars when cars first started
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:09.360]   driving it was chaos yeah there were there were is that what this is this is this is okay this is
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:15.440]   video to film of a car of of the early cars on the Market Street trying to navigate the
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:21.440]   around our street cars around horse drawn carriages and of course pedestrians who just don't know what
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:26.960]   to do with this thing yeah yeah wow no we're getting people would play trying to rush in front of cars
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.680]   and they have the typical you know it's over to ten yeah where'd you get that video Jason clantas
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:38.240]   that's great video just on youtube it's uh it's from Market Street a hundred years ago yeah go back
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:44.960]   a hundred years when so yeah to 1916 cars were very very new there were a few and how people reacted
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:51.440]   was fascinating there was a huge legislative thing with uh jaywalking and in fact the car industry
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:58.320]   as far as i've been able to gather was actually pushing legislators to make jaywalking a crime
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:05.760]   because they didn't want cars to hit people obviously that's bad marketing um so jaywalking there were
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:10.560]   people who are publicly defending the right of people to just crossroads whenever they wanted
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.600]   and eventually obviously this all got sorted out presumably by people getting run over yeah
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:22.560]   it has a remarkably uh salubrious effect on the body politic but you know Brad's right about the
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:28.880]   way you learn even people learn by having accidents i've got three girls now who all drive they've
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:34.160]   all had fender benders they've all had sort of you know not big accidents but things where they
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.880]   made an assumption someone else made an assumption it's true you have to some extent that's how you
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:44.080]   learn yeah but the other thing is that you build a mental model of how cars behave so if you're used
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:50.160]   to cars yielding for you um then you can be messed up by something that can't stop not um so the classic
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:56.320]   thing here is trains um people's intuitions about how cars and even buses behave based on the fact
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:01.600]   they can actually stop whereas a train cannot stop um if you're trying to cross the kill train tracks
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:08.560]   the train cannot stop if it sees you it takes it half a mile to stop and so it cannot it can't adjust
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:12.400]   itself to what you're doing and there was a classic thing that they discovered where they were um
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:17.520]   where they had railway lines and roads that crossed them at the level crossing
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.760]   and they thought oh i know we'll cut down the trees in between the two so that the cars
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.840]   build to see the trains coming and that way they'll they'll they'll stop and they won't try and get
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.840]   across and what they found was if people could see the trains they think oh i can make that i can
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.240]   make that and they catch getting hit by the trains i can make it so they so they put they put the
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:40.480]   trees back up so you couldn't see the train and then people were more cautious so the because the
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.760]   problem is your intuition your intuition comes from other cars another cars two actually can
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:51.920]   actually slow down three hundred miles an hour away oh well no not in america you know it's doing
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:57.200]   50 miles an hour you're lucky um maybe 70 if you if you if it if it's the track set
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:01.360]   the other thing is that if you see a train coming you may be stuck there for half an hour as the
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.320]   dam freight goes past yeah so that the other reason you try and get across and find it but um but
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.760]   you know people's intuitions are wrong about these things because they built them in one space and
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:14.400]   they try and applaud them in the other there was this whole thing there was this whole big thing
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:19.120]   some middle of last year where they're people kept saying making like trolley thought experiment
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:24.240]   things you know the trolley problem of do you divert the trolley to hit one person rather than five and
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:29.680]   like thought experiment things and then they were saying should you yourself driving car drive you
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:35.360]   off the bridge to stop you hitting the school bus and i like have you guys seen a school bus if
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:41.360]   a school bus hits your car you're dead the school bus is fine you know you if you look up school bus car
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:45.840]   crash what you see is destroyed cars and very large school buses that are completely fine
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:52.160]   because they weigh 15 tons um and they can resist impact you know that they don't have seat belts
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.320]   in them because they can't stop that quickly um and that's that was the reason they built them
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.080]   like that you know that they're actually understood physics there and this is this is the same you
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:05.280]   know this is example the same thing it's like there is a big piece of physics here which is that
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.200]   thing is a large piece of metal that is moving faster than you and you should get out of it's way
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.440]   and if you if you haven't actually factored that into your model if you don't actually have an
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:17.440]   understanding of of how different things on the road can accelerate and decelerate you're gonna
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.720]   get it wrong so suspect that's the piece that they're gonna have to go back and build into this but
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:28.640]   the part that interests me more is how these robot cars and and AI in general are going to build a
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:38.000]   sort of model of predictable human behavior based on facial gestures or or finger gestures or you
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.440]   know how how are they going to use kind of nonverbal cues and other things to determine the things that
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:51.280]   we naturally determine without even realizing it probably right so that's yeah the stuff we got
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:55.280]   on the screen that they show them they they have an understanding and a projection of the vectors of
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:01.920]   the existing cars and how they're moving um and and they they predict those forward and they they
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:06.080]   understand where there's a space that makes sense and where there is yeah and they they can cope with
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:12.080]   you know there's there's there's they've got a compilation of weird random stuff we've seen on
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:17.120]   the road in Mountain View like people driving the wrong way down the lane um because there are some
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.640]   bit there are some bits of matter where you've got these these six lane roads and you take the wrong
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.160]   judgment suddenly you're driving the wrong way down the road and they've got you know motion capture
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:28.640]   of this and they're like okay I will get out of the way of that thing until he comes the other way um
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.400]   yeah so you're seeing it here so they draw boxes around everything else on the road and they draw
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.720]   these little fence things you can see there are they're projecting somebody might cross it
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:40.800]   wow look at that and so they don't they don't walk through those fences that's that's
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:45.520]   those aren't for when to stop and when they catch a junction they decide am i safe to go or not based
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:50.320]   on are these are these these these things here or not and the challenge is
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:57.120]   there are times you know Mountain View is a relatively easy place to navigate
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:02.800]   there it's it's it's got wide roads they've got wide lanes there aren't that many pedestrians or
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:09.520]   cyclists except in a few little bits of it um whereas if you try to navigate through Boston or
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:13.680]   London or you know Pombay or something you would have to train it completely differently and this
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.480]   is part of the problem they have the other problem they have is they Mountain View has a very lovely
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:23.440]   climate like like I'm sitting here exactly um these cars have not seen much rain they've never
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.120]   seen any snow or they've seen a little bit of snow because sometimes they've taken the
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:32.400]   data or something but it's not it's not part of their you know learn environment much they've got to be
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:37.760]   probably you could probably wipe out order or more of the population of San Francisco simply
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:43.920]   by having a little snow because parking and driving on those hills would your life would change
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.960]   dramatically yes well and that's you know the other thing is when it does rain here you know
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:53.680]   the first rain of the autumn after it hasn't rained for six months exactly everyone crashes they
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:58.880]   go mental um they don't because they forgot to have a drive in the rain also all the water floods
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:05.760]   across the the places and the traction and you know this is where AI could come in really handy
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:11.840]   once the once cars build a model of one thing they're not going to forget what it's like when it
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:16.640]   rains they're not going to forget what it's supposed to be the point yeah right and if you've got cars
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:23.440]   like uber every or not uber sorry but um tesla cars every tesla car that is encountering
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:28.240]   something new is effectively building that database for all those other cars so the more you have
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:35.040]   presumably the smarter they get faster yeah and that that's that's supposed to be the point is that
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:39.440]   each of them learns from each other but it also means they will make the same mistake so there is a
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:44.000]   you know if one of them if one of them thinks it's time to ram buses all of them think it's time to
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.680]   ram buses and they you know in this case there was a complicated set of circumstances it was trying
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:55.280]   to trying to solve and that you know there was it was an edge case that they hadn't found and but
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:00.000]   and this is there was that sort of weird ab where we're going to say they said we've driven 10,000
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.200]   miles in our in our self driving cars and so that's nothing yeah i was just a different like
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:11.520]   to do that in a year over a million yeah but it's like you know people are not over a million miles
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:15.920]   and they and they've all learned from each other the other thing is that that um and Brad's written
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:22.640]   about this a bit i think is that um they the the moment these self-driving cars can only drive
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:27.760]   along roads that they've got properly mapped which means some a human has to have driven the
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:32.960]   LIDAR thing down that road first um so they've actually got the sense of where all the lamppos and
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:37.840]   things are um but also to some i think they have to have driven it more than once so they've got
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.000]   at least a sense of which things are permanent which things are temporary so they they've got
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.760]   they they're building this really model of what they're seeing and they're not just reading what
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:50.080]   level is established so they understand what they're what they're doing in that space and
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:54.960]   somebody fired up the bit torn again kevin i'm gonna interrupt you
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:17:02.000]   it's that we're going crazy we're gonna take a break anyway it's a really uh fun conversation
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.840]   of course as always is when we get kevin marks and Matthew and grim in the same room and i'm glad
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.360]   you could be here for it we'll have more with them in just a bit here's a video somebody in the
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:16.320]   chat room gave us of driving in an intersection in india uh and you just you don't know how
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:23.360]   how is this even how come people how how they don't have a roundabout they don't need it we
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:28.480]   don't need us thinking roundabout just drive go where you think you're what you need to be
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:34.880]   and and let the devil take the hindmost well of course it's sped up but a slightly sped up
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:39.120]   but i don't think it's that much yeah you can see how close the pedestrians on the right come to
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:49.120]   getting clobbered uh i mean wow just wow notice how easily the bus got through by the way
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:55.760]   nobody they know that much nobody gets in the way of the buses but this is yeah but it's like
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:00.160]   they build up a line so it's it's you know in theory that's what traffic lights are doing in
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:03.840]   practice this is what these things do it's like okay when there are eight of us here then we get
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:07.600]   to go because i wonder i wonder if it's more efficient you know i wonder if this is better
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:14.080]   than traffic lights it probably is and i think it's i think people learn different kinds of
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:18.800]   behavior i had this discussion with somebody about when we were in europe we were talking about the
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:24.160]   driving where you shouldn't and in lanes where you're clearly not supposed to go and and his argument
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:29.440]   was that this was actually better than having too many rules and too many laws because then
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:35.120]   people are more prepared right for under paying attention right so they're paying attention because
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:40.720]   they know that car might just suddenly swerve and anoroid who's in our chat room who posted the link
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:47.840]   says that per capita motor deaths in india are 16 times that of the uk so maybe not maybe not
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:54.960]   maybe it's not such a good idea maybe not it's it's it's not quite that good idea using the
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:19:00.240]   comment about what did you people someone from the future what did you do before self-driving cars
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:05.440]   oh you know we just drove cars ourselves but didn't millions of people die oh yeah oh yeah
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:09.360]   that's okay that's you know that's part of the deal that's how it is
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:19.360]   do i do remember being in kyrow and stunned by how the traffic is downtown kyrow and somebody told
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:25.680]   me they had put in stoplights and it was such a mess because people just ignored them so they just
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:29.280]   took them out they just took them out it's like that wasn't a bad idea they didn't work
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:36.720]   so there you go i mean it's the roundabouts thing as well it's like in the in the uk we have we
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:41.520]   have a roundabouts we do in kyrow we're starting to do them here stop sign junctions yeah there
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:46.400]   were like you know there are a few over here but the point is there in the uk you will you will have
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:51.520]   them at the place that before we stop sign here would probably be around about there a lot of the
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:56.000]   time right but also they will have a bigger junction so a junction like that sort of one in
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.280]   India would have a roundabout in the middle and that forces you to actually basically what it does
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:05.600]   is it turns a four-way junction into a series of three-way junctions so it actually simplifies
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:10.800]   the calculation you make because your calculation is is there someone coming from the left if there
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:14.880]   is our weight if there isn't i can come into this thing and then when you go out can i get out onto
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.560]   the right here and the bigger ones will have two lanes in the middle and you can enjoy the
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:23.360]   Marshall roads at a point but the point is it the reason you put this giant circle in the middle
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:29.280]   is to reduce that you know reduce a complex junction into a series of smaller junctions
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:34.400]   and that's that's that's the design presses for it and you think it would work here i think
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:41.600]   the thing that's weird here is you have these you have these computer control runs
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:45.600]   things but you have rows that look like this you know in England you don't have
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:51.440]   eight lane suburban roads right right you bet the same thing in France that's right
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:56.160]   part of it is a volume problem yeah yeah so so the one of the reasons you need all these these
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:00.480]   you need all these traffic lights and lanes and things here is because the roads have me built
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:05.760]   that right right and that one of the interesting things in in sort of urban design is rethinking
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:14.640]   that and restructuring the roads rather than having a six 12 foot wide lanes going down to
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:20.720]   few to fewer 10 foot wide lanes and a barrier and a bike lane and then rethinking the junctions
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:25.120]   so that the bikes can actually turn without being hit by cars by putting pieces that are
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.800]   that are almost around about in there as well and there's a there's a sort of growth of
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:38.720]   rethinking junction design and planning that has moved away from this that you know the cars must
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:44.640]   move and the traffic lights will make them stop thing the other way thing here is that in California
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:49.280]   it's rare to have traffic lights that that understand that other junctions exist they basically will
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:55.360]   operate independently whereas in Europe they will they will phase them so that as you drive up to one
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:59.360]   it will assume that if you drive through the speed limit to the next one that one will then
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:04.640]   be green and you can go through that here it's rare there's like three streets in San Francisco
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:11.680]   that do it most of them are autonomous junctions i think we have time lights in many of our suburban
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:17.680]   areas no not so yeah not so many you could have gone pine you can go all the way up pine if you
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:21.680]   time it right yeah i think there's one all the way down bush there's certain certain seats yes
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:25.520]   there were that's what i was saying there's two like thoroughfares that do that in San Francisco but
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:30.240]   yeah it's not a it's not an assumed thing they figured out the suburbs but it's your use of space
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:36.480]   right in in in Europe use of space it's so little space in the u.s. the reason why there's so many
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:43.520]   giant freeways because there's lots of yeah roge let's take a break kevin marx matthew ingrum
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:50.400]   we're talking twig jeff has the week off he'll be back next week our show today brought you by
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:56.560]   carbonite good thing to keep in mind your hard drive will die and carbonite's there to help you
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:01.280]   back it up i want you to visit carbonite.com
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:12.240]   c-a-r-b-o-n-i-t-e.com if you don't have uh by the way this is exactly how backup should be
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:16.800]   it's automatic right so it's not like sometimes some backup program oh yeah we're gonna on a schedule

[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:27.920]   your file immediately it's backed up and because let's face a lot of data disaster is just from
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:33.200]   you know human error trashing a file that you need having those versions there is great it's
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:40.720]   also great and very important if you bit by one of the crypto ransomware programs carbonite in
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:46.880]   fact there's a white paper on the carbonite site about how carbonite can help you not get bit by
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:52.800]   ransomware if that hospital in southern california had been using carbonite wouldn't have had a problem
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:59.120]   automatic continuous and oh finally it's off site it's in the carbonite cloud where your data is
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:05.600]   kind of on vacation it's just uh relaxing it's enjoying the climate controlled data center

[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:23.680]   their support of this week in google i don't know what this means eric schmidt has a new job
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:30.640]   uh he has been appointed the chair of a new defense innovation advisory board
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:36.960]   uh actually i i think this is a great idea if if he actually gets to do it it's the idea is to help
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:42.800]   the department of defense act more like a tech company 12 individuals who have successfully
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.760]   led large private and public organizations will be tasked with advising the pentagon
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:53.040]   on areas that are deeply familiar to silicon valley companies rapid prototyping iterative
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:58.320]   product development complex data analysis and business decision making the use of mobile and
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:03.280]   cloud applications and organizational information sharing the department of defense is massive
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:08.160]   the pentagon is one of the world's largest office buildings yeah they are faced with
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:15.360]   incredible organizational challenges thought by the way military strategy nothing like that
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:19.920]   it's it's really is modernizing the office which i think is a good thing
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:24.240]   did you watch any of the testimony yesterday in congress
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:29.440]   i didn't i saw tweets about it yeah that's all you need
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:36.400]   tweets that darrel is apparently doing doing good work there yeah good on him he's uh uh
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:42.320]   representative from your district right is he one of yours we're gonna zero
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:47.040]   he's is he southern california the forty ninth district wherever that is
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:52.480]   um anyway he's a good man he'd ask the right questions and uh i have to say uh director
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:57.920]   komi james komi the director of the fbi maybe didn't really get uh get all the right answers
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:03.120]   yeah one of the things he admitted i'd like the if you watch fred a company to put the shredding
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:10.480]   bed together yeah yeah let's do that please unshred this mr garbachev unshred this document
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:18.000]   uh he um he admitted that they blew it and i think that this in the long run this might hurt the
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.640]   fbi more than any argument about public safety or the sanctity of encryption
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:29.760]   the fbi admitted yeah we changed the i-cloud password because we thought that would work
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:36.080]   we were wrong had they asked apple and apple's been quick to say this including yesterday in front
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:42.320]   of congress had they asked us it would have just given them a copy of the i-cloud backup they could
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:46.640]   have just brought that could that that i-phone into an area where it's already paired with the
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:50.480]   wifi it would have backed itself up and we would have gladly handed that data over
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:58.560]   the fbi was too smart by half uh and apparently that impressed members of congress more than
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:03.840]   anything else i mean you blew it and now you want apple to go fix your mistake
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:09.040]   it's unfortunate because that's well that's the problem it doesn't really get to the heart of the
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:15.840]   matter which is should phones be private or not should there be a kalea style back
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:22.160]   i don't want to use a word back door it's loaded a kalea style interface for law enforcement into
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:27.840]   our phones just there just as there is an interface for law enforcement into telecommunications and
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:34.000]   that's why if they were looking for uh you know a case that would give them a precedent they picked
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.520]   the wrong one because this isn't they blew it actually right because they made a mistake that
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:47.120]   they're now trying to fix stupid uh what's going on there is your is your wife
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:54.080]   is it raining in florida did you hear that noise and and mrs engram is stuck in there and she's
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:59.360]   going into a glass she's really like i gotta get out she's what she's pacing the floor like a
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:05.920]   tage tiger not exactly oh okay i have a vivid imagination
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:14.480]   darrell is of northern san diego darrell is a representative for northern san dieo carls
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:18.960]   baton ocean signage look at that but they kind of shot themselves in the foot right yeah what if
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:26.000]   they had chosen a case presumably there are many not just this well syrus vance jr the district
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:31.760]   attorney in man haten says i have he testified to this as if this is a good thing i happen to have
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:37.840]   175 iPhones i'd really like help with like that was like that was persuasive oh no yes
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:44.960]   we have we could really use this congress that kind of craters the it's just this iPhone yeah
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:53.440]   these guys got to get on the same page yeah um there's also uh there's also um
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:02.000]   let's see the issue of uh this case in ruchlin where the judge the magistrate said no apple apple
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:08.320]   doesn't have to do that that's a that's asking way too much uh so that was fascinating yeah
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:14.800]   some of his arguments were really really powerful he just bladed online there's also the insight i
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:21.120]   i hope this doesn't get glossed over what mossberg pointed out um that apple does in fact have access
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:27.440]   to the entire contents of your iphone if you use i-cloud backup and gladly gladly we'll hand this over
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:34.160]   and there's many times yeah so that might be something you want to keep playing
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:41.120]   i mean it's it's hard on the one hand for apple to say well we fight for your privacy and on the
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:44.880]   other hand to say but we have built it a mechanism we expect almost everybody to use that will make
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:50.960]   your data completely transparent what is exactly apple's point
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:59.840]   so there's a there's a bunch of subtle points here too go ahead uh please explain to me
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:06.080]   mr. reference so so the the point is that they are saying you're trying to weaponize the software
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:10.720]   update mechanism that's a bad thing i agree with that because that will stop people using
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:15.520]   software and that's a general vulnerability in almost all software is that software update could
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:22.000]   always be used by the company that has you know my micro software or google could always be used
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.280]   to get in to the stuff and you know that there have been previously been exploits that have
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:32.400]   basically been been fake software updates uh update servers before they built right key
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:38.080]   signing there is now on on mac and tush there's an update or a lot of companies use including vlc
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:44.160]   called uh sparkle that is an updating service that they use is you know is open source
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:51.040]   and in sparkle you have the choice of using http or https and a number of companies including vlc
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:57.760]   chose http so it's trivial to man in the middle the software update right and a software update
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:04.320]   essentially means we could do anything we want right so so the point is they have to
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:08.480]   so what they're what to something what they're arguing about is not so much the software side of
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:14.400]   it as the as the signing side of it and saying you are forcing us to sign something that is yours
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:19.520]   rather rather that's that's the free speech argument that we you can't make us sign this right yes
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:24.880]   and that you know and that's so some of the debate was like what you know what if we kidnapped the
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:28.960]   fngedians could they do it the answer is no you'd have to kidnap the person with the key right and
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:34.560]   there's a revocation mechanism and so on and yeah yeah when we get into like this sort of hey actually
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:38.560]   that's an interesting question i hadn't heard them say there's a revocation mechanism if you
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:44.240]   can you use that because if you revoked it wouldn't all the existing iPhones be unable to update
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:53.120]   aren't they expecting the signing key from apple yes they are so i think i'd have to i don't know
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:56.640]   the exact protocol there are protocols for for saying this case revoked you need to go and fetch
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:02.880]   new key and that that that has been that was built into blu ray they've never invoked it but that was
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:07.360]   one of the ways that the motion picture association responded to the almost instantaneous cracking of
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:13.120]   dvd's content protection mechanism css they said well this time we're going to have a
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:19.120]   revocable key because last time we didn't right but it gets very messy and you know we we get into
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:23.840]   you know key distribution methods and the problem is how do i get to the next key and how to when i've
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:28.960]   revoked that key and then i've got to go and get and that may that gives you another surface for
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:33.920]   attacking and you raised a really good point is if we can't trust software updates no one will
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:38.400]   update and that is a bigger security flaw than anything right and that's you know that's that you
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:42.480]   know that's just some extent that's the problem that you know google has the opposite problem in
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:46.400]   that people people don't in source of work dates because of the the process for getting them is
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:52.320]   is more complicated and involves carriers and things whereas apple has built a straight path
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:57.280]   through to them which means they can deploy software it's much more easily so what that means is that
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:02.560]   it is easier it's often easier to hack android phones because some of the exploits go unpacked
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:06.480]   in a large proportion of them so there's a there's a you know there's there's a problematic trade-off
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:11.840]   there as well all right some of the the best informed stuff people were saying well i can get
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:15.760]   i can get my phone hacked in at any shop in the high street it's like well you can because they
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:20.160]   have a database of exploits for a set of phones so they can jailbreak them but that isn't necessarily
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:25.440]   the same as this and you know it doesn't there aren't no i don't you know i'm not sure you have to
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:29.200]   ask somebody who knows what it means but there aren't known goods good zero days for that
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:34.880]   generation of iPhones as far as i know right particular case right um
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:45.360]   let me see here uh i somebody just said that slice-off is back but i don't see it i just went
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:49.760]   to slice-soft dot or i'm sorry any dvd.com the slice-soft company that makes
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:56.480]   blue ray ripper and uh their page still says due to recent regulatory requirements we've ceased
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:01.440]   all activities relating to slice-off so but somebody says that maybe they've got a way
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:07.120]   torrent freak says there's a way back so yeah we'll have to see maybe they're maybe they're
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:11.360]   trying to do out under the radar so we won't say anything because hollywood popcorn time is back
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:16.880]   to it yeah you can't win the canyon how about this and i want you to try this kevin marx one of the
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:22.560]   problems with tap to pay at least as apple pay and google pay and andrew pay and all these
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:26.480]   others are implemented is even when i do that i still have to enter my pin code and say do you
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:32.160]   want to do you want cash back and it ends up being the same interaction not less painful because of
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:37.440]   tap to pay so now google's trying hands free payments this is an april fools joke
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:44.560]   yeah it seems dodgy to me so uh this is very much like the apple pay ad where you have to go
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:49.840]   through your wallet to find your tap to pay so it's very limited release yeah they're doing this in
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:55.600]   the south that's why i want you to try it kevin at mcdonald's and uh somewhere else in your area
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:36:02.080]   by saying your initial you say your initials yeah that's the cue that was that one ha no one
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:07.040]   knows your initials kevin x marx kxm i don't know what your middle initials
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:13.040]   so is it boy's recognition must be voice recognition well now you just gave it away kevin kjm
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:19.600]   that's weird that doesn't seem like a very secure system so why pappa john
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:26.960]   pappa johns and uh and mcdonalds maybe this is you think this is a joke and look at that url get
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:34.640]   dot google dot com slash hands free so what's the euro get dot google dot com slash hands free
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:40.800]   it says it's secure full card details will not be shared once you complete a purchase you received
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:47.760]   instant occasion on your phone hey there's a google chroma's blog post it's an app
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:53.840]   let me let me let me go see google play hands free you can download the app oh man i gotta
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:37:00.400]   install this among uh this is crazy for your next trip to the south bay mcdonalds yeah well i might
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:06.000]   drive down tonight pappa johns so you use this look good these services
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:13.200]   uh okay ask for initials and then use is the picture to confirm your identity
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:16.640]   so you don't even use tap to pay you don't even use your phone
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:24.320]   no so it's facial recognition by the by the so you say i'll pay with google at checkout
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:32.160]   they have a camera oh yeah that's leo what's your initials and if that matches then they go okay
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.320]   thank you we're going to debit that guy leo's account
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:39.920]   all the challenges by the hands free camera deleted immediately it says
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:47.040]   sure i'm still gonna see what happens okay well you you have an assignment you got to go to
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:50.720]   mcdonalds is there pappa johns nearby or
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:54.000]   mcdonalds it's funny that they're doing it in silicon valley only
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:00.080]   well it makes sense too that's what that's where they can try it yeah that's where their
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:04.080]   their employees are but yeah i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:11.520]   the thing you know there was somebody it was they must have very strong confidence in their
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:15.520]   facial recognition right is that what the thing is it depends what you compare it to
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:20.080]   i mean it's like credit cards in america are ridiculous and secure right i can give my son
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:22.960]   my credit card and he goes shopping with it and this was true when he was 15 you know
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:28.240]   the physical possession of the thing with the magnetic stripe is the thing you're competing
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:36.560]   with here so um as somebody did this thing of um imagine the pitch meeting for chip and pin
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:40.560]   it's like it's like swapping your credit card but you have to stick it in there and it makes
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:46.960]   a bunch of funny noises at you and it takes twice as long so why would anyone do this
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:51.040]   um and the reason is it's a second factor authentication and it's
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:56.480]   encouraging people to have a second factor um but also it's uh um the reason they want
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:59.440]   everyone to upgrade their point of sales is so that they can use tap to pay because that's the
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:06.400]   thing they actually want you to use which is the right um that that confirmation thing um and
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:10.880]   you have cut you know there are cards with that in there they're very few american banks issue
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:13.440]   them but they play widely issued in europe and you can tap to pay with them
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:19.200]   okay i'm a big person who's in them for a year or more yeah so it's just america being behind a
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:27.600]   lot of this stuff um well now we're ahead um that we're way ahead but i remember this because
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:32.720]   you know we had to have to pay on the on the android phone i know it's ill apple does it it
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:38.080]   doesn't exist i'm sorry but it was i remember this because i i saw they i saw the lego in the
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:42.640]   store and like i tapped my phone on the thing and the first time i was like what did you just did
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:50.800]   you hacked my tool the cash register drawer just opened oh my god what happened it's a thing it's
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:55.040]   like there's a i was actually reluctant to use tap to pay for the longest time because exactly
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:00.560]   because of for that exact the reason i thought they're not going to believe this but also
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:05.200]   samson have done that thing where they um they they immediately swipe made it feels if you were
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:10.640]   swiping it yeah they use a magnetic that's what that original uh what was the name of that card that i
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:16.240]   really thought was a bad idea where it actually did that you would you would you had one card for
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:20.400]   all your cards you'd press a button to choose the card and then you'd swipe it and it magnetically
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:27.120]   would change would coin coin yeah coin yeah remember that yep uh but but that's what samson
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:31.760]   pay does uh without that it just kind of generates a magnetic feel like yes and i use samson pay all
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:36.560]   the time do you yeah and people go crazy over it they're like wait you can't do that that's not a
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:42.480]   tap to pay terminal right yeah because it terminals it doesn't require any update right by the hardware
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:46.800]   which by the way if you're going to a store where they haven't updated the hardware to tap to pay well
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:52.320]   you know right right aluma yeah i know yeah we still have a video we still have a video store here
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:59.360]   they're vhs tapes nice yeah well that's well that's this is not the story so um we had one but i'm
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:04.720]   pretty sure it was a money laundering run maybe it is you're doing i don't know did you see that
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:11.440]   post from kqed about netflix that was interesting kqed our local uh public broadcasting station what
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:17.680]   about mine um so the challenge is that the problem is that netflix is is catalog is rotting now we
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:22.560]   know this about the streaming catalog is that now if you use to these to be more films available
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:26.000]   for streaming and now there aren't and and they've lost a lot of the classic stuff right but this
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.600]   is also true of their dvd and blue ray catalog too because fewer people are using it and they're
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:39.520]   not replacing the old discs so their their sort of library ability is is shrinking so they're like
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:44.480]   the more obscure art films or the older films that they only had a few copies of are falling out of
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:50.320]   the catalog um because they're not replacing them and they're not bothering to sign up rights to
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:55.360]   stream them because they're mostly signing up tv shows instead right um and they've and they've
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:59.280]   stopped trying to be the it's just netflix changing isn't it it's just becoming a different set it's
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:04.000]   all about original content but but it is a problem is that you know the question is is like okay so
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.680]   who is going to have that archive where do i get no one that these are your vhs store down the street
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:14.720]   right and there's a sort of weird thing where those those stores are coming back and part of it
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:18.480]   there's also a structural thing which is the doctrine of first sale which is if i buy a blue
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:24.400]   ray i can rent it to you that's allowed um if i have a digital copy i can't because there is a
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:29.360]   transferable license on those and so they have to do a per studio negotiation and the studios
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:35.040]   could you buy a blue ray blue ray rip it put it on a usb key and rent it that way no no no that'd
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:38.880]   be wrong because it's a physical objective aren't there any sort of niche
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:46.240]   veterans that are effectively you know this is all the weird like as Kanye West i think he knows
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:49.440]   how to find this yeah no well this is what's happening is that is that people are building like
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:57.840]   closed group curated things of you know like my my uncle who's like in his 70s um has signed up
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:03.040]   for this um opera torrent site because he's into opera right and that's awesome you know it's ran out
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:07.680]   of argentina and they have all the great opera great argument for britain is preserving this
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:13.760]   cultural heritage it's just like the uh the game rom sites that are technically illegal but
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:18.240]   they're preserving uh important artistic uh heritage and yeah and this is the entire
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:22.960]   archive argument but a lot of what they're trying to do is digitize things proactively and then
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:26.960]   work out how they can do it out so they do it with books so they do show us out of print books they
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:31.520]   also did digitize in print books and lend them out as if they were digital librarian try and
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:36.800]   work out president there but it's hard to do for films no there's there's there's there's
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:41.360]   agreements they can do public library somebody's point net brian and wnter chairman public library
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:47.520]   often has blue ray and dvds yes but i mean i'll try and find the article because that's a very
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:54.880]   interesting point Netflix has been our film reviewer at kqd say i can't get hold of these things anymore
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:44:00.640]   you know i i wanted to watch an old steve martin movie and most of them have not been
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:06.960]   are not streaming yeah and so you have to buy them yeah yeah i tried uh i remember when robin
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:13.040]   williams died same thing i wanted to go and find all the robin williams stuff and some of it was
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:17.840]   quite easy to find but there were some that you know you really had uh there weren't that many
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:23.520]   people seating there weren't meant because until he died they weren't actually that popular you
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:27.600]   couldn't even get them on bit toy that's how hard they are to yeah that's so hard you can't even
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:33.120]   pirate them well i think it's a strong argument for internet archive and but the problem is that
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:37.920]   there's far more stuff he doesn't i mean at this point i don't think he's uh saving a lot of old
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:43.760]   movies he is doing uh they i should say they not i think of it as british kale but what they are
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:48.720]   preserving do uh roms no they're preserving roms though yeah okay now did you do movies there's um
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:53.600]   uh what's that that video we saw of severses go that was for the internet archive they have it they
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:58.800]   have an archive of old films there's the palinger archive that that's an amazing but that's not
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:02.560]   amazing resource that's not like hichcock films that's just some guy's home movies
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:09.040]   well it's it's it's a collection of things that have got out of copyright and you know a collection
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:15.040]   of public information films things like that right so they've they've got like older stuff before
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:19.520]   copyright will extend into ridiculous lengths um and they've got things that have fell out of
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:23.840]   copyright as well but yeah it's it i think they they want to digitize more and they want to be
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:27.920]   able to do this but it's a it's a challenge of working out what's what's actually pressed
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:31.680]   on which all of their techniques things it but it's it is an issue anyway so i put the link in the
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:37.920]   chat for the kqv1 which was explicitly about i'm i'm trying to review this film that is is
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:43.760]   cited as a classic and i can't get a copy anywhere um even the even the public library and i had to go
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:50.480]   to the specialist um san francisco um cult you know video store to get it here's the good news
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:55.920]   mark zuckerberg is uh is denying that he is the commander of a vr army
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:02.720]   um sure yeah the fact that he felt he had to respond to this is hysterical this is the picture mark
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:08.640]   posted on facebook of him at the sam san event where everybody in the audience all the journalists
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:15.520]   were looking at vid video uh on a vr headset and he was able to just stride in unencumbered
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:21.040]   by this vision of the future pretty photo it's just it says so much but the fact that he felt he had
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:26.560]   to respond to this he did an interview with a german newspaper de veldam zontag and he denied
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:33.200]   enjoying the fact that he was seemingly commanding a vr army he says quote nothing could be further
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:38.880]   from the truth the exact opposite is the case boy when they start denying it that's when you know
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:45.760]   what was going on inside the headsets was a video of children playing soccer in some far away
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:49.600]   place you could look around you could see the kids playing soccer around you was a shared
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:54.400]   experience with everyone in that place it would have been impossible experience otherwise
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:47:02.480]   they were enjoying their their but the point is that that he posted that shot himself he didn't
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:08.640]   get it he still doesn't get it oh he's just for the muslin it's still still it's just you the video
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:15.760]   there's a vine going around of a guy sitting there experiencing uh oculus and there's a girl
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:21.120]   sitting next to him and she's got this look on her face she's looking into the camera like what am i
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:26.640]   even doing here because he's like moving and we talked about this uh what was this on the twit last
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:31.360]   sunday about how you look like the star wars kid you know the kid fighting with the lightsaber when
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:37.680]   you're doing when you're doing VR games you look impossibly dorky but you don't know it because in
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:45.040]   the way next level it's next level dorky it is as bad as it can get and that's why when you see on
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:51.600]   the cover of Newsweek pauler lucky the ceo voculus going like this in his in his thing
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:59.520]   and i mean this is going to be presumably inter-remed technology right like magically the whole
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:05.200]   promise of that is plug it in just appear in your environment yeah plug it you have to put on a
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:10.720]   ski mask you'll still look dorky when you're fighting nailing is it only you can see it was a
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:15.040]   business inside i'm trying to find it but that's all right you can watch twit on sunday and and
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:21.040]   see it it was very it was it was hysterical because she's going how epic how epic it is inside the
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:28.880]   VR and how ordinary it is not so it's not so epic actually gamers look bad we've just gotten
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:32.880]   they do it all gamers look bad true kind of slack jawed and
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:39.360]   but this is this is worse hey here's a tool i didn't know existed and it's somebody's a
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:44.400]   github project turns out there's geolocation i didn't know this in youtube videos
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:52.240]   so he's made a youtube video geo search where you you can search your address and see what your
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:49:02.240]   neighbors are posting on youtube this seems like a troubling phenomenon i didn't i didn't
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:06.800]   there's yeah there's actually like data in the video stream so they put location if the
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:12.480]   camera puts location in like if you shoot up your phone who knew that our video is posting our
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:18.640]   neighbors were posting mulch stock 2015 the largest peaceful lawn transformation on record
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:23.680]   who knew that's that's this is down the street actually i could have guessed
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:37.680]   mulch stock wow this is uh wow so there you go uh and that by the way that address is uh long
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:48.480]   okay i'm gonna stop mulch stock right now uh youtube.github.io and then geo dash search dash tool
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:57.360]   oh great kevin put the link to the uh video and she's a she's a design researcher vr researcher
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:05.040]   yes oh this is the short version this is the uh this is just the uh the single the single vine
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:08.880]   but it it serves the purpose it's just the look at her face
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:16.800]   definitely she's certainly mugging to the camera there she's like that's definitely
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:23.360]   pan just like he's like you can tell that's how you would be that's how you look yeah and for you
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:30.160]   it's a magical miraculous experience oh man for everyone around you they're going oh dear
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:36.400]   what a world we live in but the thing that zuckerbo didn't get is is that it is that photograph is
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:42.000]   the sort of perfect metaphor for zuckerbo control where everyone sees and he doesn't didn't see that
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:48.720]   you know it it is like it's the apple lemings ad from 1985 yeah it is literally blindfold except
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:53.520]   the one guy it is uh pretty much literally the lemings ad all he needed was a hammer
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:59.120]   no no that's the lemings was the year after oh lemings where they're marching off the cliff
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:01.360]   yeah if they're also with blindfold so that that's
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:07.360]   not 984 because 984 he's the guy on the screen he's not the girl with a hammer
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:12.800]   right he's the other one the people i don't know he's the guy who's not what
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:16.480]   day we celebrate the first anniversary of the information purification directive you know that
[01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:25.440]   that one yeah 15,000 vibes sold in 10 minutes at 800 bucks a pop
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:30.880]   and that's 15,000 people are gonna look really dorky to their girlfriends
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:40.480]   15,000 and this is much more expensive than oculus yeah wow
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:50.080]   wow did you say in front of their girlfriends yeah if they have them no comment
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:56.960]   they're imaginary girlfriends well they're boyfriends you know they could be their boyfriends
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:02.720]   i feel like it's well i don't know i don't want to say someone someone else says that he's like
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:05.680]   you know what would actually make more sense if you brought this into a motorcycle helmet
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:10.560]   because then let's dorky and be then when you moved into something you wouldn't hurt
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:16.160]   yeah exactly that's a good idea somebody has made a motorcycle helmet with a
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:21.200]   with a heads up display in it but yeah it's actually fascinating it is if i'm trying to get it i want to
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:28.160]   yeah the problem with that in all VR is you can't demonstrate it scullie scullie and mulberry that's it
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:33.440]   yeah scullie no scullie is a company that the helmet no yeah with a k yeah that was kickstarter
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:37.280]   wasn't it yep yeah we're trying i think we're trying to and it was a demo it was it was it was
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:41.440]   in all the places yeah but when they build it because we know the people who know them because
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:47.360]   they were the electric the bolt the bicycle guys electric bicycle guys know the scullie guys yeah
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:53.440]   it's a small community of strange people strange two-wheeled people strange strange two-wheeled

[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:28.480]   aggressively pretty sweet aggressively gold you know what i i like yeah now i there's a few things
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:35.280]   that you have to get used to with sam san physical home key and then and it's a little annoying that
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:40.320]   the buttons and by the way they're capacitive on the metal so that's cool but they're reversed from
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:47.360]   how everybody else does it the the and the recents button is on the left and the back buttons on the
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:53.200]   right you know yeah if you're a sammy user you probably just kind of you know you get used to it
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:58.560]   fingerprint reader is very good man is at a gorgeous screen 5.5 inches and while i do it looks
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:04.400]   nice from here isn't it yeah even on skype it looks good that's how good it is man is this camera
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:11.040]   good oh my goodness gracious uh one f one seven which means you're getting amazing images
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:19.040]   um that are really that rival uh dslr i mean this thing and this is pretty amazing this is low
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:25.520]   light here i mean this is we're in a restaurant that clarity through the glass clarity is in
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:32.800]   it is pretty good reliable and low light ois so this is as this is our td station is anthony
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:41.040]   nelson running the board for uh tnt i took the same picture with a like a cue and you know if i
[01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:44.240]   put them side by side you'd be hard pressed you'd have to really do a lot of pixel peeping
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:49.680]   aside to tell the difference how big is this cream five and a half inches but because of the uh
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:54.880]   bezel free sides you know the edge goes over the edge it doesn't it's actually feels very compact
[01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:59.200]   in the hand it's a great way to get a giant phone without having it feel like a giant phone
[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:03.120]   you know a couple you know the other negatives are this edge and i've had this problem with the s6
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:08.400]   edge as well because it goes around it's there's nowhere to hold so you can you activate it by
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:13.520]   mistake yeah you can get uh stray you have to kind of learn how to hold it like flat palm
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:19.760]   which is a little weird uh i i don't use this edge mechanism that but you maybe you maybe you'd
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:26.400]   like it to me this seems like a silliness but um you know sam's song always has to do something
[01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:30.720]   that makes it different than every other android device uh which of course means it's not going
[01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:36.960]   to be updated as fast but it is marshmallow it's 6.01 yeah apple has that uh now on the i've got an
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:44.160]   ipad and i'm constantly going to flip a page and flip board or something and and swiping out a
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:49.280]   menu from the right hand side you know because it wants to offer you the ability to do two things
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:54.720]   at once pull something open and then you on the sides i'm triggering that thing accidentally like
[01:59:54.720 --> 02:00:00.320]   half a dozen times a day it's so funny because i have the opposite i can never get it to swipe
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:05.520]   over what i want only when you don't want it's only when you don't want it yeah no i'm you know
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:11.440]   it uh it's it's way too early i've only had it since monday but um battery life looks pretty good
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:17.760]   it's it's a big battery they they increased it considerably over the battery on the s s 6 so
[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:22.800]   i'll have a better idea of how good the battery is in a few days but uh so far you know it's honey
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:27.200]   moon still we're still not even but boy is it pretty isn't it oh and i love this always on so
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:32.960]   lg's doing this too now because you've got an OLED screen you could actually there's time and
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:38.640]   date and notifications are always on it's like all the time all the time and actually i really
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:48.160]   like that it's very useful um i like the i have an lg g3 or g3 uh it's a g3 because i smashed my
[02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:56.480]   Nexus 6 and uh haven't got the screen replaced so i got a g3 uh for zero dollars from my from my phone
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:02.800]   company you know it so but i do like the lg the the tap that makes the screen come alive if you
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:08.720]   just want to check the time or see what the battery life is or see what a message is but i think that's
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:15.680]   a great feature yep yep i uh i feel like um you know here's the deal we have great choice now
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:19.280]   uh a lot of people will just choose the iphone because that's the default you can't go wrong
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:24.560]   choose an iphone but uh i believe that we have excellent choices and i have to say samsung is just
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:31.200]   making some really beautiful hardware uh couldn't be happier uh but that wraps it up thank you
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:37.280]   matthew engam for joining us fortune.com matthew's writing is a must read every single day he writes

[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:54.400]   if you're getting any if you're gonna make big scoops and oh don't forget don't forget he's
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:58.640]   also on quitter.no exactly the worst name ever
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:06.400]   quitter you're a quitter yeah i quit twitter quitter i'm a twitter quitter oh i get it is that what it
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:13.360]   is i don't know but that seems like it should be a show title oh twitter quitter oh trust but it
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:20.000]   sort of defines what you are yeah i don't want to be a quitter yeah yeah i might start my own you
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:25.600]   you you can join it do you want these things to work i was gonna say to him he's so passionate
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:33.040]   about this stuff and and you know i get caught up in his in his passion and uh and i i also want
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:39.920]   things to be open and federated it's really really hard to get people to go and use those things
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:44.560]   and so then no one's there except people who already agree that that's a good thing i know
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:49.600]   in some ways that's not bad i had some of the best conversations in the early days of google plus
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:56.000]   in the early days of friend feed in the early days of jikou in the early days so great i love
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:03.280]   friend feed so good yeah and you're right the smaller smaller you have a better discussion i think
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:09.360]   we need to have just as we do in real life big venues and little venues you can use quitter.no
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:17.440]   without quitting twitter and in a way you know i wish if twitter had not i wrote a thing not that
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:22.400]   long ago about the twitter that might have been and could we get yeah the twitter that might have
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:28.320]   been back the one that was federated the one that was you know open api and was just anyone could
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:35.120]   sort of put in or pull out and and i i think it's too late but i i kind of wish they hadn't been
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:40.880]   going for the ipo and all that what what could it have become what things could they have developed
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:42.960]   that would have solved some of these problems
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:53.840]   it's a bittersweet end to a very good show thank you matthew yeah thanks for having me
