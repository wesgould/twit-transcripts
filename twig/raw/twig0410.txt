[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.800]   Joining us from can in France Mike Elgin good to see you Mike
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.720]   Leo support great to see you
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.360]   You know you're back in that country and I am not in that country
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.640]   But it's great to see everybody traveling and I will do my best to be as
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.120]   Smart and angry as Jeff Jarvis
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.720]   Really there's no point in trying. There's no one better at cranky
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.480]   With a stacy hig and bottom of stacy and I OT
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.680]   formerly of giga home high stacy
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.760]   Hello, how are you I am back for vacation where'd you go? What'd you do?
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.960]   Coast to Rica with my family eco tourism
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.880]   eco tourism I tried to surf I
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.520]   Mean try to surf. It's very difficult to surf. It is hard. Isn't it you were you gonna stand up at all?
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.240]   I did get there, but I was not able to stand up in balance
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.640]   It's too much. Yeah, I know
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.200]   Did they give you one of those really wide floaty boards to start with? Oh my gosh. I think I had the junior junior
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.680]   Oh, it's so much fun though
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.920]   So I had a great time even though I could not serve I could watch my daughter surf and that was awesome
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.440]   And I just had a great time. Yeah, some reason the little kids maybe because they have a lower center of gravity
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.240]   They seem to be better. They don't have to lift letter, but they lift less mass, right?
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.040]   Totally with it popped right up there. Welcome home
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.360]   Wow, this is a traveling show because I just got back from vacation as well and I who filled in for me. I forgot
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.280]   Jason's howl filled in last week, right?
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.520]   Thank you Jason for filling in for me both times. No, I appreciate it Jason
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.840]   Did anything happen while I was gone? Oh, I heard
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.520]   In fact, it's funny because I'm I really we had very little internet access and I wasn't really able to keep up with the news
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.000]   But for somehow Amazon buying whole foods really broke through the silence. That was a big
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.760]   darn
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.600]   story this week
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.720]   And what's funny is that Amazon got it effectively in a way got it for free
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.080]   It was a 13.7 billion dollar all cash deal
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.200]   For whole foods
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.160]   But their stock price went up more than their value went up more than that because their stock price went up so high
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.280]   So you might say
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.960]   They got it for nothing to give you an idea of how big an acquisition this is
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.240]   Before the 13.7 billion dollar acquisition the next biggest was zappos for 1.2 billion
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.800]   Twitch for under a billion
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.040]   Kiva systems Suq. This is this is by far the biggest acquisition
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.640]   What is that what does that mean? What is the strategy? Why does Amazon want a grocery store of all things?
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.600]   Who wants to go Mike you or me you start
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.040]   First and then we'll let you go Mike and and then I'll tell you what it really means because Ben Thompson told me oh
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.840]   Hey, I was I was actually thinking Ben Thompson was the smartest guy in the room on this one
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.280]   It's a last mile distribution network for Amazon. So it gets them
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.720]   access to
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.640]   Like like Ben Thompson's Amazon is its own best customer with AWS and with the other products that it's or
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.640]   Services that it's released and this makes with Whole Foods a huge customer for its delivery network
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.360]   Plus it pushes it out to the edge just a little bit more for if you're gonna do like drones and that sort of thing or even
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.240]   Just pick up lockers. So they bought it for the for the physical locations
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.240]   as a both the physical locations and as Ben Thompson said has a
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:32.200]   Grocery distribution is is the most I guess just it's not maybe the most but it's a just in time
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.640]   Huge turnover lots of distribution like logistical kind of business and this is something Amazon
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.360]   really needs to or
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:50.320]   It's already had but it wants to expand into this even more and groceries a whole new element with perishable goods and all that fun stuff
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.200]   Is that what you think into Mike? Well, I so first of all, I don't think we should under
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:04.280]   Value or underestimate the perfection of Whole Foods in finding locations. We actually
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.560]   Whenever
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.280]   We help somebody find an apartment or whenever we're gonna do anything that has a location base
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.360]   If you if you assume that that Whole Foods are in the best neighborhoods in terms of other
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.600]   Resources that are in those neighborhoods everywhere. There's a Whole Foods. There's also public parks. There are good schools
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:32.040]   There are Starbucks. There are all these other premium stores and things like the very very very good and very disciplined at finding the location
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.280]   So the location thing is huge. The second thing is that
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:42.280]   In his exact states have said they can these these can be distribution centers for not only rapid delivery
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.920]   One hour delivery in the suburbs in the same way that they do it in New York City
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.160]   But also the delivery of refrigerated goods in a more cost-effective way
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.360]   That's a that's a big thing
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.840]   But there are two other things one of them is grocery delivery
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:01.880]   Everybody wants to crack grocery delivery because if you can get people in the habit of buying their groceries in a delivery scenario
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.360]   And everybody loses money on it
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:10.040]   I'm old enough to remember web van where they basically tried and failed to have a grocery delivery business
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.400]   This gives Amazon the opportunity to just nail that right out of the bat with
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.240]   an existing
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.340]   Loyal customers around 69% I think that's the number I could be getting that wrong chat room can correct me
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.520]   But there's a huge overlap between Whole Foods customers and Amazon Prime members
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.840]   So the whole food customers are basically already mostly
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:40.360]   Amazon's prime their best customers and they're already signed up and and so on and and so the third biggest element of this is
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.880]   The grocery stores are actually becoming extremely interesting places
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.600]   over the next 10 years
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.060]   Experts in the in the in the industry expect grocery stores to be experienced
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:57.560]   Centers you go there to take cooking classes. You go there to learn things. You go to their hangout
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:05.960]   Lot of Whole Foods are they set up bars and bistros and restaurants and cafes in the stores that people are spending hours there
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.480]   They're reading
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:14.000]   rooms essentially like coffee houses or whatever where you can just read books and magazines and newspapers and they have local
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.400]   bands and poetry readings and beatniks and hippies and all you know the whole bet and
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:25.400]   Community bulletin boards where people gather to do no they're grocery stores are becoming sort of
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.040]   town centers in a way
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.800]   And they're gonna evolve in that and Amazon if you if you look at what Amazon's trying to do in brick and mortar retail
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.760]   They're trying to figure out what to do. They have a robotics. They have a robotics store on their campus
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.480]   They have some bookstores that have some automation
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.840]   They use it to sell
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.640]   Amazon Echo. I mean there's all kinds of synergies and again
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:54.400]   What's important for Amazon is the quality of the customer and the same way that Apple has like these premium customers who spend lots of money on devices
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.240]   Amazon is essentially
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:03.360]   Doubling down on these Amazon Prime type of customers who spend a lot of money who are willing to spend extra for delivery
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.000]   Whatever it takes and I just think it's a brilliant move by Amazon
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.440]   And I don't think the stock price really demonstrate. I mean the stock prices go up and down
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.400]   But I also think it's interesting that all the other grocery chains
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.240]   tanked in terms of the stock price and this was announced yeah
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.800]   But but I think over the long term Amazon's gonna do its Amazon thing
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.680]   It's gonna bring prices down run along that sort of almost a zero profit
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:35.160]   Level and just drive growth drive everybody else out of the in out of the business. So the premium premium grocery business
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:42.640]   I just think this is gold for Amazon. It's just a playground for all of their high-tech food related delivery
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.640]   Drone delivery projects that they want to even think about I
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:55.560]   I'm gonna disagree a little bit with you there Mike just on the idea of a grocery store becoming that kind of Starbucks style third place
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:01.080]   Experience Center for stuff because I don't feel a I kind of don't see that
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.480]   Happening from a grocery store perspective
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.640]   but also
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:14.280]   Because I don't think Amazon. I don't think that's like a real Amazon strategy or place. They really want to be
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:22.200]   but I do think they want to be in food delivery for a variety of reasons and and I actually wrote a little bit about
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.440]   Like what Amazon can do with food?
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.840]   When the deal broke but but that's the only thing I'm gonna cuggle with on you
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:35.120]   I think actually you're both right in the sense that Stacy's looking more at the immediate benefits
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.280]   It's a real estate play. It's a you know, it's a brick and mortar play
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:44.120]   It's and but I think Mike you're right in the sense that in the so in the short term
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.160]   It's it pays for itself. I think with it as a real estate play and as a delivery play
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.040]   But in the long term Amazon, you know, this is where I thought Ben was really right on
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:11:00.520]   Let me let me let me quote from Ben Thompson of course is the creator of Stratecary, which he's been on the show many times
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.520]   We think the world of him
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.640]   Stratecary.com he and this is kind of what you said he builds
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:13.040]   This is Amazon's new customer that the whole foods is actually now a new customer just like AWS is a customer
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.440]   But I think where I got very interested is when he talks about
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:24.760]   Amazon's changing mission statement. So in the original mission statement their original s1 in 1997
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:32.040]   They said Amazon's objective is to be the leading online retailer of information based products and services
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:38.000]   With an initial focus on books. That's exactly what they were they started as a bookstore
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.600]   But they they wanted to be a retailer of information based products and services
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.040]   Then as time went by their mission statement changed
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.960]   To our our vision is to be the earth's most
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:57.360]   customer-centric company to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:04.480]   And then now he says they've eliminated the second clause literally Amazon's
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:12.720]   Mission statement today is just the single sense we seek to be the earth's most customer-centric company
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:20.960]   But he but he points out that really their goal is to take a cut and I really like this to take a cut of all
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:27.600]   Economic activity now obviously that's not doable. But it's a great goal to say every transaction
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.160]   We want to be the middleman in every transaction
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.800]   and I think
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.440]   Amazon in the long run
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:44.560]   Seas and I think they're not far off. I think it's just maybe less than a decade off almost all purchases occurring online
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.640]   in fact, they just announced a new service where you can buy a bunch of clothes and
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.920]   Try them on and then send them back. This is gonna be death to
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.240]   sponsors levars like
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.240]   like trunk club and so forth because
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.820]   Amazon's gonna get in this and not only that they're gonna give you a bigger discount the more you keep
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.120]   So they they're gonna and of course tie that with the echo look right which
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.760]   Has the camera and that looks at you and says oh not that maybe that
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:16.880]   Amazon's gonna so that's an area where people it's shoes to for years. Oh, you can't buy shoes online
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.640]   You got to try them on well
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.280]   They've proven clothes and shoes can be sold online. I think people today say I want to squeeze the melons
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.800]   You can't I can't sell groceries on I think it's but I see you know
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.120]   You're right
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.080]   Mike there've been a lot of online retail companies that have
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.920]   Peapot and you know as you mentioned
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.800]   What was a web van of all kind of dashed against the rocks here?
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.440]   Maybe they were just too early if anybody could do it Amazon could do it
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:49.040]   They've got this new - wand right which reads the barcodes on all the foods in your refrigerator
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.520]   And then does the shopping it has Amazon fresh
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.400]   So this is so what I but don't let me just finish them and go ahead
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.000]   Yeah, and so that what I think is in the you're right in the short term
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.440]   Stacey but in the long run
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:09.360]   Amazon saying well what happens if every all transaction first of all we want a piece of all transactions
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.600]   That'll be easiest if they're all online and we do the livery
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:17.840]   What happens though to to stores to people people want to go somewhere they want to do something and I I
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.200]   Wish I could remember because somebody who's been a contributor on this show for years
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:28.400]   Maybe it was you Mike, but I think it was somebody else has always said none of the future of retail is experiences not purchases
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.160]   That ultimately you'll go to a bookstore not to buy a book
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:39.080]   But for lectures to see because people do like to be around people movie theaters realize the only way they could survive is to become experienced
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:47.800]   Centers not movie theaters that ultimately the future of brick and mortar is experiences and I think Amazon on the long run
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.960]   Set you know in the short run they've got these stores
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.000]   They've got this real estate
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.580]   They've got this physical presence in the long run in order to get a piece of every transaction to become the middle
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.580]   Man for the world
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.740]   The way you do that is
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.900]   Putting everything online and then you keep these
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:10.000]   stores for experiences doesn't that make sense Stacy is a kind of a future I
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.120]   Think
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.800]   Stores for experiences are fine
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:19.460]   I think there's two really interesting things if you think about the physical retail experience that Amazon's doing and they're very different
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:25.960]   The Amazon go people lists kind of perspective, which is a very convenience oriented. I'm gonna get this
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.260]   I'm gonna pop in grab it and go for a situation like you know lunch. Maybe near
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.780]   I don't know if that's what they see is the end game
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:39.380]   Right, but I think there's there's a lot of value actually in something like that
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.300]   I think even though many people will have delivery right to wherever they are
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.940]   Well, but you're right. There's there's times when you want to know
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.060]   right, yeah
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.060]   but I also
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:57.200]   I don't quibble with the idea of experiences. I just quibble with the idea of going to a grocery store for that experience
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.400]   And I've been to what if it's like well wait, what's not you think it's a pressure?
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.400]   What if it's like there's cooking?
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:10.340]   Classes so there are cooking classes if you go to the Whole Foods in Austin when Whole Foods built its original headquarters in Austin
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:15.600]   That's exactly what it was it had a cheese bar a wine bar a beer cave
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:22.160]   Could it has still cooking classes it has it is an experience. I mean you go there and it's
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.220]   It's not a flop. They've closed some of those things down
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:32.940]   But they open some of the things in the London store, which is a really phenomenal Whole Foods
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:38.060]   And they try you know one of the things about Whole Foods is fascinating is that they're super innovative
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.400]   And they let the stores sort of do the innovation themselves
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:49.960]   I think there's something like 75 Whole Foods stores that actually have bars with microbrews multiple taps TV sets big lounge chairs and
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:55.880]   According to what I've read none of that came from HQ the stores themselves came up with those ideas
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:01.940]   independently to to sort of give people something to do probably I mean for the most part it's like give
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:07.680]   Husbands something to do drink beer while the rest of their families are shopping or whatever but but yeah
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:14.120]   They're they're pretty innovative company in terms of letting the stores themselves create these experiences that Stacy's talking about
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.440]   In each individual store
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:21.080]   But look what they did with the 365 stores, which is their new kind of
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:26.160]   Program for expansion because they're kind of tapped out on the existing
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.400]   High-end experiential thing and the 365 stores are much more bare bones minimalistic
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.040]   They're designed for millennials things don't cost as much
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:43.080]   They stock the 365 brand of organic foods as opposed to like I don't know the insanely delicious French
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.400]   Balsamic vinegar. I bought at Whole Foods, you know
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.760]   so
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.120]   There there is a place for some experiential centers
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.080]   But I don't think that's where they're gonna bet the farm
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.120]   But this is like a total small thing to be arguing about over the big
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.120]   Yeah
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.160]   Impact totally I totally agree with that and when Amazon thinks about an experience
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:09.200]   They're not thinking about people sitting around drinking beer and taking cooking classes. They're thinking about more data monitoring the
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.840]   consumer behavior a few so
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.040]   Amazon Go is the name of Amazon's amazing
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:21.480]   Incredibly high-tech grocery store that is on their campus. I think it might even still be in beta
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.120]   It was supposed to open months ago, but it wasn't quite ready
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.040]   But this store is crazy
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:33.000]   I mean it's crazy what they do basically what the idea is you just go in you pick items and you walk out and your Amazon account
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Is charged automatically they know what you bought. How do they know that what you bought?
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Machine learning so they have cameras that watch you
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.360]   Pick up items they the shelves themselves are scales
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:48.120]   So they know how much everything weighs so you remove something that the that the AI thinks looks like a
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:54.240]   Canister of yogurt the the weight differential is about the same as a canister of yogurt
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.360]   They look at your history and say oh this person always buys yogurt
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.640]   They're recognizing your face as you pick the yogurt off the thing and
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:06.560]   They take all this data together and say they just picked up yogurt off the shelf and then
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.400]   Yogurt has charged your account later on you can put it back it sort of reverses that all this kind of thing
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:19.040]   I mean, it's really it's really crazy, but the the hint about what Amazon is after can be found inside the store
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:24.320]   They know what behavior looks like and they've gathered data with what people do on Amazon calm
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.640]   But they don't know is what you do in a brick and retail
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:36.160]   Store how long you linger how long you spend looking at things are you reading ingredients? Are you?
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:42.200]   Taking something and putting it back are you concerned about the price out? What is really happening with?
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.160]   Your mind as you're trying to decide what to buy and what not to buy
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.960]   So Amazon go is their big attempt to figure that out
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:58.360]   And I think what they're what they're really thinking now is okay whole foods is a huge opportunity for us to harvest
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:03.160]   All kinds of data you can't gather on people when they're simply shopping on Amazon calm
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.820]   Right and that that is a huge so I wrote on my site
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:12.620]   I did a few things on what it means for food because there's a couple things there
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.680]   I didn't get into the data aspects as much but
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.520]   Getting
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:25.760]   Getting food data on the web and digitizing food data is really a challenge one because all of the devices all of the devices
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:33.920]   All of the items they can look a little bit different right so for machine learning and computer vision purposes, you know
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:40.920]   Beat in a fennel may look close enough or a parsnip in a carrot may look close enough
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.920]   You know that it comes challenging
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:49.600]   There's also the idea that these things are all called different names like we call a Ruga a Ruga and people somewhere else call it rocket
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.240]   so
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:59.220]   Amazon's gonna be able to get a lot of data about what people are buying how they're buying in for Amazon
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.040]   They have historically focused
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.560]   on
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.720]   Buying data they their recommendation engine is all about getting you to purchase more stuff
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:16.040]   So getting the actual data on how and what you buy is way more more relevant to them
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:22.720]   So if you think about Google being focused on search data and how that affects what they're doing
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.040]   Amazon's kind of like eh
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.680]   Don't care as much about that give me the actual buying data. So
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.920]   This will be very valuable to them for that
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:41.840]   Quick prediction - I think that one business Amazon would love to get into is the meal kit business the blue apron kind of business and
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:50.040]   Whole Whole Foods would enable them to use Whole Foods markets and Whole Foods inventory as the foundation for that kind of business
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:55.520]   So say we we did for a long time say oh you're never gonna buy shoes online you buy shoes online never gonna buy clothes online
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.960]   You're gonna you do go you do buy clothes online will
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:04.080]   Do you think it's impossible to say I'm people buy groceries online? I mean dry goods is one thing canned goods
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:11.120]   Fine you do blue apron. Yeah, but I don't do it for my all my shopping obviously I need to go to the grocery store for fresh goods
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.480]   Can that be done online I
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:19.760]   Think so here's here's where I think things get really really interesting
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.240]   When you have all of this data
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:28.480]   It is possible that Amazon will look at me like we so I'll say in my family we meal plan
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:34.160]   We have a kid and we we plan about four or five meals a week in advance and the rest of time
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.200]   We're just kind of throw one stuff around or eating out
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:46.000]   For staples you can use something like the dash wand which is like hey, I just use this don't we use safe way for all dry goods
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.880]   They just come every few weeks and it's just all the boxed and canned stuff that you don't need to look at and
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:56.640]   Then for all the fresh food because we buy all of that
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:03.680]   Having a trusted supply chain which for a lot of people Whole Foods is expensive, but that's what it is
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.440]   Just telling them you want that
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:12.540]   It's no different than like trusting blue apron right for giving you fairy eggplants
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:18.720]   Which I that's one thing blue apron is proven you can do I think it's been a great cost but to
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.880]   Really bring you high quality produce
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.860]   Because you know that's I think the biggest concern is all I'm gonna get
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:30.520]   Watermelon that are you know over ripe where I'm gonna get apples that are bruised
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.120]   I think that's the big concern
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:37.360]   I want to look at those, but if you always got as we do with with blue apron they're a sponsor, but
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:44.440]   It's also the fact that did that that they have a some sort of quality assurance that really you always do get perfect produce
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.560]   And you would trust whole food to do that probably now
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.160]   Here's the big thing that keeps whole food and one of the reasons by the way whole food is a bargain is because they were struggling
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.120]   They're not doing no
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.480]   And partly that was because it was a very high-priced story, you know
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.120]   We called it whole paycheck. I mean it really paycheck. Yeah
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.840]   But people who shop there
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:13.000]   affluent upper middle-class people who cared more about the quality of their food and organic whether this is true or not because
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.400]   Sometimes I wonder if Whole Foods commitment to organic was that genuine?
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.560]   But that whole health food thing and we're willing to pay more and you know
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.800]   We're kind of less price sensitive
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:27.440]   But if Amazon wants to turn whole food around and make it grow and don't they drop the price?
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:33.640]   Don't they make it more accessible to everybody or do they care would they I think they would want it to get
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:39.920]   Were they yeah, well, that's what the 365 stuff was
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:46.000]   Okay, go ahead. I'm sorry. I'm Mike. Go ahead. I can you can imagine all kinds of innovation on flex pricing
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.840]   I mean one of the things that
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.600]   Here's a couple of tips for Whole Foods customers and I learned this from Amira who's like
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:59.440]   Who I think she interviewed the CEO John Mackie. I think his name is of Whole Foods at some point, but basically
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:05.400]   Whole Foods has some really interesting policies that Amazon will probably change for example
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.800]   You can try anything at Whole Foods. You can open packages and try it really and
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:17.200]   You can pick up an apple and take a bite and that's a way that's smarter than you know the fans
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.960]   Absolutely, they will also
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.480]   Especially in the beer and wine section if you want something just ask and they'll start stocking it
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.480]   I we've gone there for instance and they have an enormous in Silicon Valley
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:36.560]   They have all the stores have really fantastic selections up here to be fair on local mom and pop store pedaloma market will do that also
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:44.800]   You know the problem a market is a level of a local small not a chain that store that's competing well against Whole Foods
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.040]   on price and by offering service
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:54.240]   But pedaloma market pedaloma market and kotati market in also in all of our summons. Yeah
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.880]   Yeah, I mean I'm in Oliver's. Yeah Oliver's market. That's the one I meant
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.720]   Yeah, those are two of the some of the best little grocery stores in California
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.440]   They're really really good. Yeah stores
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.880]   But but I think what what Amazon could do is some some version of that instead of
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:14.640]   Stocking in in perpetuito. Well, probably the best grocery store in all of California is rainbow market in San Francisco
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.400]   And they will literally stock anything from anywhere if they can get it
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:24.320]   They will stock it right if you just ask that that's bad business and what Amazon could do is say look
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.680]   You have a kind of a obscure request. We'll just ship it to you
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.080]   And we'll stock. I mean, it's kind of how bookstores work these days
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:37.600]   It's not on the shelf on that call on Amazon. Yeah
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.720]   So
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:48.320]   It's I think there's so much we could do. Yeah to make this so much more efficient with combinations of delivery and pricing and
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.720]   Inventory and which whole foods just hasn't been doing go ahead. I'm sorry. It's easy
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.200]   But no, that's okay
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:00.080]   And I would say also think about how Amazon prices things and how dynamic that can be
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.400]   what will be interesting is if
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.240]   You think about inventory management in a grocery store with
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:12.160]   Technology capabilities. So not necessarily people but if you have cameras looking at your stock
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.240]   You can say hey, you know, we have an abundance of corn. This is terrible
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:23.760]   Let's discount this right and in those kind of things should be pricing. Yeah. Yeah, yeah uber style surge pricing and
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.640]   Surge pricing a turkeys at Thanksgiving
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.360]   You know what's gonna be sad
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.880]   Whole foods is a very good employer. They pay well. They give benefits
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.280]   I don't know if that's gonna continue. I think that that was a good job
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:43.920]   They weren't going to change the whole foods culture and they have a history of that with I mean look what they let tony
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:49.200]   Tony shay do with zappos. They didn't touch zappos. Did they they give them free reign?
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.160]   Yeah, so they said they were gonna do that too with whole foods on the employees side
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.760]   So is this maybe just really?
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.680]   Because of walmart walmart said we want to you know mama's terrified of amazon
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.240]   Right as they should be as they should be
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:12.400]   And walmart's going after amazon and so is that really what we're seeing is a amazon versus walmart
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:17.120]   It's I mean that you can't discount that. Yeah
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:24.800]   Food is what is it 20 percent of the budget. Wow. Yeah, it's it's a huge thing and but I really think it's it's
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.600]   it's android versus versus ios here because
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:36.480]   I'm sure that what'll happen and what is already happening is that for the most part whole foods is going after the high end of the market and
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.480]   Walmart is going after the low end of the market
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.600]   That's true in terms of locations. That's true in terms of their pricing and what they emphasize
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.760]   You can find organic food at walmart
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:52.720]   But the shoppers aren't primarily interested in premium organic foods and the reverse is true at whole foods. So I think that
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:59.680]   I think they'll coexist and sort of battle it out on margins a couple of other things that they come to mind which
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.240]   Amazon could easily do
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.960]   Um people think that they go to the store and they're like oh, I can choose anything. I think I'll choose this
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.360]   I think I'll choose that but over a period of three or four years
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:17.280]   It'd be trivial easy for a company like amazon to to say you know what every three and a half months on average you buy a carton of
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.680]   agandaz
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.680]   Coffee flavored ice cream
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:27.680]   Why don't we just ship that to every three and a half months or you know they can tell you what the patterns are of what you buy
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.840]   there's probably a lot of
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.200]   um
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.600]   predictive capacity there and also
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.720]   Uh, they could do predictive stocking knowing what everybody does. I mean, I of course
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:44.880]   Um, walmart is really really good at this if there's a they check weather patterns if there's hurricane coming they stuck off
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.240]   They're very dated
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:51.280]   Things that yeah, but but there's another business that exists in in sort of like
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.920]   uh popular among organic farmers and so on which is that you can
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:01.680]   Subscribe, I mean there's lots of people do this in california you can subscribe to get fresh produce delivered
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:06.320]   And so you and and they decide what the produce is so like a csa
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:11.200]   Yes csa so you get if that's a that's one of those farm
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.880]   To table subscription services where you get a box every week of and they choose what's in the box
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:22.080]   Exactly. So they you could imagine an algorithmically determined
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.960]   um set of
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.200]   uh meal kit delivery
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:34.720]   Delivery of food based on what how you actually do your shopping plus this kind of uh, uh farm to table
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.080]   I already am a amazon
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.600]   Subscribing save customer. This was an amazon service. I don't know how well known it is
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.600]   But you get five to fifteen percent discounts by saying well, i'm gonna get that every three months
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.440]   Just ship it to me and that is something missing. I would love to see it. No more
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.680]   I'm constantly adjusting it because I know I got I got too many baggies now
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.040]   Well, you know, yeah, and i'm constantly adjusting it's a pain in the butt
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.880]   Although it's such a convenience that every every month on the 19th. I get a big box and they put it all on one box
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.720]   It's the biggest box ever saw I feel sorry for the mail care
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.720]   On my doorstep and it's all the staples and yeah, and and it's not it's far from perfect
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:18.000]   But it is i'm already using it and I think that that's a very natural thing for amazon
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.600]   To expand into one of the things ben tomsen says is that amazon
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.800]   likes whole foods reliance on
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:31.360]   Store brands like you were mentioning stacy the 365 brands and in fact one of the things I don't like about whole foods
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.240]   I can't get our local milk brand there they
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:41.280]   They they don't have all the brands they're not big on variety. That's something amazon likes though
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:47.600]   Yes, yes because they can control pricing they can they have all kinds of controls
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.440]   I was also going to point out because I do think this is worth noting
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:56.080]   in the greater amazon walmart battle for supremacy or
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.880]   being the man in the middle
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:06.320]   Walmart has talked to some of its customers some of its vendors and said hey get off AWS the amazon web services cloud
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:11.520]   So the wall street journal had the story this morning and it actually ties into really a couple weeks ago
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.000]   Yeah, I put it in the rundown and then somebody also surfaced it in the chat
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.240]   but
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.760]   a couple
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.200]   Months ago
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.200]   Maybe it was actually about a month ago
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.960]   One of the big logistics companies decided to go with microsoft's azure cloud because they didn't want oh it was merc
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.440]   the shipping
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.640]   m a er s can yeah, they're the big container shipping company
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:39.440]   Yeah, they went with azure instead of aws because they were concerned about
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:47.520]   Amazon being a competitor of theirs in the distribution business. Well, they're smart ultimately amazon is a competitor of every single
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.360]   Retail business in the word distribution business in the world
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.520]   It's true. I loved it that ben toms and sends amazon's goal
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.240]   This is the base mission statement where they say certain eyes take a cut of all economic activity and what an amazing goal
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.320]   Right
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.120]   Yeah, I mean true. Well, and why not if you're jeff bazos
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:12.240]   Who's doing all right? I think that just saw an article says he makes a million dollars a day
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.960]   personally
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.200]   Where else do you go?
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:22.400]   Well, I just want a bit I want to I just want to you know a penny on every economic transaction that happens
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:29.520]   Food is a great place people always need to buy food food is a really I didn't realize but now that I think about your absolute
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:35.280]   I didn't realize what a big chunk of our daily expense one and 20 percent of our daily expenditures is food. Yeah
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:40.560]   uh, so if you're a big enough tech company if you're apple google or amazon
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:47.920]   Really what you're doing you is your business is to build a better customer to get customers to have certain habits and inclinations
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.920]   I mean starbucks is the perfect example
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.720]   They they move the the world from a place where
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.080]   um
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:34:00.000]   People bought coffee in a can and and it was like, you know and they made it with a with the malita filters or whatever
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Uh to a world where you stand in line for half an hour and spend 450
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.920]   Uh for your coffee and then they transform the behavior that made a better user
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:13.760]   And if if you think about if you're a whole foods customer and you're an amazon echo user
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:19.520]   And you're making dinner and it's like, oh, we forgot forgot something we need we need some butter
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.680]   You are going to tell and if that could be delivered within an hour you would tell us how
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.000]   Knowing that it comes from whole foods
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.520]   And whole foods knowing what brand you prefer you would just tell us how I need some butter send it to me as soon as possible
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:39.200]   The psychological knowledge that it's coming not through the mail system from somewhere house somewhere
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.200]   But from the whole foods down the street
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:46.000]   Uh, it's really going to get people to buy groceries and if you're buying groceries and food all the time
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.160]   Through a scholar
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.760]   You're being trained to buy things through a scholar and
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.240]   I'm saying your name like
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.240]   I'm sorry through the
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.200]   Through the echo just say a virtual assistant that shall not be named and
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:04.400]   Close, I mean you name it and and of course all that stuff comes from amazon
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:10.160]   So, you know, I think I think a big part of this is how can we have a business and and a compelling
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.120]   Uh
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:18.000]   Offering that will get people to be using this thing for actual purchases several times
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.760]   a week
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.880]   Right and I think this this is this is a big thing toward that
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:28.320]   So this conversation has been great because I have completely now come around to the notion that we will be doing all of our
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.640]   Grocery shopping online through amazon in the next five years that this is just gonna happen
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:38.000]   Yep, well, I'm gonna tweak it. I know you want to get off this topic because we are not this weekend amazon
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.560]   Yes, we are. This is right down our alley
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.640]   so
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.640]   imagine so
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.760]   And this is what I did I broke down food into
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:54.480]   The five kind of ways to think about how we eat right in our house and how amazon will touch that
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.960]   But with um the echo
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:04.160]   The echo show which comes out, you know, june 28th. So next week at this time I should have an echo show to be like hello
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.320]   We can talk on it leo
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:12.640]   You can show amazon thanks to the data. It's gonna have about what produce is I can be like
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:17.840]   Hey, this is what I have and it will suggest recipes I can make what I don't have for it
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:22.240]   It can order and these things are gonna be so seamless and so easy
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.520]   It's just gonna be
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.040]   You won't go other places and it'll be great
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.720]   Well, that's a good point because it's convenience is gonna win it
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:39.520]   Well, it's not just convenience. It's also knowledge like I mean how often do you sit there and look in your fridge and you're like
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:44.560]   Oh crap. I've got this weird piece of fish and this vegetable and I don't know what to do with it
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.280]   right so
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:53.200]   So now I think amazon was a good move buying buying whole foods is a good idea
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.360]   Oh, yeah
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.320]   At first it's like what the what why would they want a grocery store?
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.560]   yeah
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.840]   because because we think of we think of amazon as as a
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.160]   The alternative to brick and mortar, but of course they've dashed that
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:16.800]   expectation long ago. Well, well, but wait a minute really have they I mean they do brick and mortar things
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.440]   but ultimately
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.520]   Well, what so so the mission statement which is to be
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.440]   The you know the world's finest customer centric company
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:33.840]   Is really just here's how we get a piece of all economic activity by by making it as easy as possible
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   For our customers to use us
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:42.720]   Then I see that I see there's there's two kinds of tech companies and I think that the quintessential
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:47.920]   Examples are apple and google so apple companies are visionary companies
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:51.680]   They work behind the scenes in secret to figure out what you want
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.840]   And they chip away and chip away and then they release it and like this is what you want
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.720]   And they're companies like google who are like we don't know what you want
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:02.400]   We don't know what anything's gonna happen in the future. How about this? How about this?
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:06.320]   How about this and they see what sticks to the wall? Amazon is a google type of company
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.040]   They have done so many experiment experiments
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:15.200]   Remember they had lockers in 7 leavens where you can have things delivered and you go to the 7 11 you still have them
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:20.880]   They're they're working on they're working on drones. They're working on blimps. They're working on all kinds of
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.360]   delivery systems that they're buying their own airline they're
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.160]   I mean they don't have any idea
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:34.240]   How people are going to produce food but what they one of the things they did learn in one of their experiments
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:38.240]   Which was the amazon echo was they were surprised
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:43.840]   To find out that everybody puts the amazon echo in the kitchen and that the amazon echo was right from the start
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.440]   Yeah, and this isn't the amazon show this echo show. This is the original echo
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:52.800]   People are asking it for measurements. They're asking for timers and they use it while they're cooking they're using
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.400]   It's a food thing and they're like wow this this is amazing
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.080]   You know that's a good point because I don't know if they knew that that's where it would end up
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:05.840]   But it is exactly where it started anyway now. I have echoes everywhere, but it starts in the kitchen
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.160]   Yeah
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:14.720]   So somebody in the chatroom says something interesting we are addicted to convenience and that's the other thing amazon must have realized is that
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:19.520]   You know while there are many considerations that you use
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:25.760]   To choose your economic how your economic activity is executed
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.680]   price
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.680]   convenience
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.680]   You know brand
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:39.840]   Status, you know remember the the old you know conspicuous consumption you show your economic status by what you buy and how you buy it
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.760]   um
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.640]   But more and more convenience is going to trump that I don't know why because our lives are busier or go ahead
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:52.560]   Why is busy because there's a there's a news story. Okay, it's an a on magazine
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.840]   It is conspicuous consumption is over. It's all about intangible. I saw that wasn't that interesting
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:03.440]   It was but that is why this is and so people are now buying convenience like it's time
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:08.960]   You realize that is the most important thing. You can't get more of you can always get more money
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.360]   You can always you know, but you can't get more time
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.920]   But I don't think that's it exactly
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.760]   Um, you you mentioned we're addicted to convenience. We're addicted to addiction
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.000]   Yeah, we're not we're not robots who are trying to
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.880]   Extract the maximum value out of every minute. We're looking for things that feel good
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.000]   Yes, we buy an iPhone because it feels good
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.840]   When you use the amazon echo and you ask it ask so-and-so a question
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:44.960]   And you get an answer back and you get a result or you get a timer you get something delivered or the or an uber comms or whatever
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.400]   It's not that you've done something efficient. It's that you've done something that releases dopamine into your brain
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:56.560]   Yeah, and you're sitting there going oh my god. That feels so good. We're all rats pressing the bar that gives us the food pellet
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.360]   That's it exactly
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.360]   That's it. Oh, that's even scarier
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:06.960]   Because what we haven't talked about we've talked about the howlies make sense for amazon. Oh, this is good business for amazon
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.840]   We haven't talked about is the consequence to american consumers
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:14.400]   which is ultimately that one company dominates economic activity
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.640]   And I in my gut that tells me that can't be good
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.120]   No, I mean people are already upset with amazon for a variety of reasons
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:28.720]   Um and things like dynamic pricing of groceries are really going to piss people off
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:34.320]   Um, yeah, but they still shop. I mean, you know, there's no there's a reason you can hate amazon
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.600]   But just still yeah, it's not slowing their business down any
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:43.120]   Well, actually so this will get into my pick. So this week's pick talks about some of this
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.000]   Okay, we'll save it you want to save it?
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.640]   I will save it or it's up to you this way people listen all the way to the end
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:54.800]   So we talk a lot about big data and we talk a lot about how we can use big data and so forth
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:42:00.400]   But really I think like you actually nailed it the whole reason that you put you you collect data you put data in
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.960]   You computerize stuff you put stuff online is because it's easier than to gamify
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.600]   and it's easier than to
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.600]   maximize the pleasure principle and
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.400]   and and and and
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:16.160]   when by addicting people to your stuff
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:21.920]   I mean, uh, somebody was talking about we I heard a great interview if we're trying to get him on triangulation
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:26.160]   A guy who's talking about a dick internet addiction addiction. He said look at world of warcraft
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.680]   What did blizzard learn from world of warcraft? Well, they have all this data on
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:36.560]   How much time people spend in the game? How much time they spend doing different things
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:42.400]   And then they can optimize it and what they found for instance was that people love to raid
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.480]   But what they love about raiding is loot
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.960]   So they made sure that all the raids provided a maximum amount of loot
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.480]   In other words, they can tune the game in real time because of the data they're getting to make it more addictive
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:58.080]   And he said in in many ways world of warcraft is an example of uh, how
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:03.760]   Addictive this stuff can be so addictive people didn't eat they didn't sleep
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.720]   One guy in korea never went to the bathroom. It was
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:09.280]   forever days
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.000]   Uh, how long does that how does that work? I think he died
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.160]   Oh, yeah
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:20.240]   Now maybe this is a pockable story probably is but but but I think it sounds it rings true because you know people have done this
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.640]   and there are world of war there are
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.360]   Places people can go to get off world of warcraft
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.280]   um
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.520]   And so but that's only because blizzard
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:33.760]   Was able to gamify make it so addictive so compelling
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.040]   And is is that ultimately what amazons trying to do?
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:44.320]   Yes, absolutely. That's what everybody's trying to do and it's it's a scary thing. I mean basically
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.160]   we are
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.160]   as individuals in a
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.000]   long standing battle
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.480]   Between things that are distracting and addictive
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.160]   Uh and our own biology and our own biology is not evolving
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.080]   Uh very quickly
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:04.320]   Uh, and everybody else all these companies are trying to figure out how to get our attention get our dollars get our time get our
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.760]   um
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.960]   activity
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:11.280]   And you see this in all industries you see it in the food industry look the fast food industry
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.800]   the people who
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:18.640]   invent the latest jack-in-the-box burger sensation are scientists who have
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:22.560]   Uh, they're doing experiments with people to see
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:29.680]   What is the food combinations of salt sugar and whatever that will get people to just eat no matter what
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:34.560]   And so the food keeps getting more addictive the tv shows keep getting more addictive and with
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:38.880]   the application of big data and ai like you say leo this is going to be
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:46.080]   This is a serious problem. We really have to figure out how to not be those rats
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:52.240]   Um, uh in this endless experiment on the other hand and this um paraphrasing
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.800]   Something from dillbert the pellets are excellent
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:45:00.880]   John gave me this
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:04.400]   part of the group part of the uh confetti that came down during the
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:11.040]   John waters us and then them cons concert resist and in fact, that's what a lot of john roger waters stuff is
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:17.280]   Is you know comes from niel postman's, uh, you know, uh, uh, what is it called addicted to? I'm using ourself
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.880]   Amusing ourself to death
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.440]   Uh, and niel postman recognized this decades ago
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:26.240]   Yeah, and it was with television ultimately, but but television was just the beginning of this
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.400]   Yeah
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.560]   Absolutely. I mean we were so innocent then
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:36.480]   And one of his thesis is was that people used to complain that that uh, that television
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.000]   News is too much like entertainment
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.680]   And his point was no, it's television. It's entertainment. It shouldn't try to be
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:50.960]   Substantive because it's television. It's got it's got to be just pure entertainment
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:57.120]   Uh, and uh, we should never take uh television news seriously as a source of information
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.720]   Um, that seems like you know when you when you look at today's fake
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.480]   Was innocent wasn't the outcome
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:08.160]   Yeah, we just saw those are the days when when when cable tv was uh was the big threat
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:11.920]   I'm using ourselves to death came out in 1985
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.720]   and um
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.240]   We were now living here. We are 30 years later living that
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.880]   For sure
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:26.640]   Isn't that tim wu has a book out a relatively new book out? Yes the attention origin. So it's excellent excellent
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.400]   Yes, we interviewed tim on triangulation and it's same idea
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:34.080]   Yes, he says that's how the advertising industry began
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.800]   And uh, and it's yeah
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.040]   Uh, but what but what has changed is
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:48.240]   Computers digital information big data the ability to gather data and then churn it in a way that you can be so effective in doing this
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.560]   Um
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:56.720]   So now we took something very positive amazon botanol foods and we made it a grim dark fissure for us all
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.520]   Our dystopian fantasy
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:04.560]   I don't mind you know, maybe is is it possible that jeff bezos. He's a smart guy
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.160]   He's read this book
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:10.160]   Is says but i'm going to make sure that yes, even though I control all economic activity
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:15.280]   I'm going to do it to the benefit of human kind. I think he's well. This is he acts this is the libertarian
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:21.520]   This is the libertarian, uh, sort of viewpoint, uh, libertarian streak that runs through all of technology
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:25.920]   Which is just like you tell me that i'm responding to all these things that are addictive
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:35.600]   Um, so what you're saying is that that all this technology is being applied to serving every desire that I have and giving me exactly what I want
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.600]   That's the problem. Yeah, right?
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.080]   I mean that that's kind of jeff bezes problem
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:44.240]   Uh issue with you know, he talks about undercutting while pricing and stuff like that
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.520]   He's like hey
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:50.560]   People come to amazon because because they save a lot of money on books because the fast delivery we're giving people what they want
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:55.680]   Or we're benefiting literacy and I don't know if you if he read that book, uh about the
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.320]   Um, addictive nature of all of this, but he certainly sold most of them. Yeah
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:05.520]   Yeah, in fact, where did I go to buy a coffee?
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:09.440]   Damn you jeff bezos
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:14.640]   It's a really that's a really interesting world we're living in because you what you have I think is say a few very smart people
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:19.600]   Who saw this and I I think must have maybe they did it instinctively without
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.360]   You know
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:26.560]   Explicitly thinking or maybe not that bezo strikes me as a kind of guy who he was a hedge fund manager
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:30.720]   Who suddenly kind of a light went on he said, you know, what's gonna happen with all this?
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:36.320]   We're gonna have in perfect data and we're gonna be able to use it to make customers perfectly happy
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:41.760]   And we are going to grab a piece of all economic activity and that means
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.240]   I mean, he's already infinitely rich. I don't know what you could do
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.200]   Unless that that's you know, but his
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:55.040]   Well, you read a sheriff's letter. That's his food pellet, right? What yeah, tell me about that because he this was a good thing, right?
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:59.680]   People were the shareholder people were saying good things about it
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:06.720]   Yeah, well his his his eye his big thing was like talking about how amazon needs to grow. I mean it
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:12.320]   It was it was about going after a billion dollar markets not small markets and
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:17.760]   I'm trying to remember the other big things the thing this struck me was the the big markets
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:19.760]   um
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:25.600]   So there was not like a super good thing he says this is a question he got at
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:31.840]   An all hands jeff. What is a day two look like that's a question I got at our most recent all hands meeting
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.320]   Oh, that's right. I've been reminding people that it's day one
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.240]   It's been day one for a couple of decades. I work in an amazon building named day one
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:44.720]   So he he obviously was thinking about this and when I moved buildings, I took the name when they I spent time thinking about this topic day two
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.120]   is stasis
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:50.800]   Followed by a relevance followed by excruciating
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:55.680]   painful decline followed by death and that is why it is always
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.720]   day one
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:03.440]   Uh, so so and then he took goes on to talk about true customer obsessions
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.160]   And I think he's he says by far
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:11.120]   Obsessive customer focus is the most protective of day one vitality
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:15.040]   Staying in day one requires you to experiment patiently
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:19.840]   We've talked about all of these things that are doing a very experimental except failures plant seeds
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.680]   Protect saplings and double down when you see customer delight
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:28.320]   A customer obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that can happen
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:33.840]   So customer obsessed now you might might say well that what that really means is obsessed with
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.520]   uh
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.720]   dopamine
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:39.680]   With with generating the maximum dopamine in our customers
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.800]   So just in other word way of saying the same exact thing
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:47.680]   Yeah, um, I mean, how do you get people to do something different?
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.400]   uh, whatever the biochemical
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:59.040]   Process is is not really as concerned. He's interested in the behavior and I think you know stasis too young too to remember that
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.440]   Amazon started all of this. I mean I remember
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.520]   um
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.520]   Close to 20 years ago
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.840]   Amazon was the first company to do algorithmic
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:12.240]   Recommendations with books and basically what they did as I understood at the time is
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.760]   They see that you bought a whole bunch of books and
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:20.160]   They see other people who bought the same group of books and some books you didn't buy
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.480]   So they recommend to you the books you didn't buy
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:28.800]   And I remember you know 2000 or whenever this was that I was learning that Amazon was doing this as a matter of course
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:35.920]   It was a mind blower. It's like wow that is brilliant. That's amazing. Well, that's what all business now is based on that simple principle
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.000]   Are those just getting a lot more
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:38.960]   um
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:46.560]   A lot more sophisticated and a lot more focused and a lot more areas and ones that are less easy to uh
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:52.480]   To sort of gamify I guess then uh, then books, but but I really I really do think that
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:57.840]   Jeff Bezos everybody says yeah, he's a genius and all this stuff. He has his own space program. He owns a washington post all that stuff
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:00.480]   But he really is
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:04.960]   I think one of the most brilliant and most importantly disciplined and focused
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:11.120]   Uh, tech CEOs in the industry. He's really really really smart and really really ambitious
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:17.840]   Yeah, read the shareholder letter because that if you wonder how conscious is it is it instinctive?
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:24.640]   Is it a planned if you wonder that you will read this or dogfight, which was a fabulous book about amazon
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.040]   um
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.280]   You will see immediately that this guy is
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:37.360]   Knows exactly what he's doing. Yeah and sees you know as as the great ceo tech ceos have
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:39.760]   sees farther ahead
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:43.520]   Then um mere mortals and and really is is playing the game
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:51.680]   Way in the future. Um, he talks about uh, he says day two companies make high quality decisions, but they make them slowly
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:58.640]   If you want to be you know, keep the energy and dynamism of day one somehow you got to make high quality high velocity
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:03.040]   Decisions, that's easy for startups very challenging for large organizations
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:06.800]   So you really this is like this letter. He's he's giving you a peek
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:11.920]   Under the hood of how of how he's doing what he's doing. He says we use machine learning
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:18.480]   Yeah, there's you know obvious visible ways, but really what machine learning is doing for us is making our operations more efficient period
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.920]   You know, uh in ways that are kind of more invisible
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:28.320]   Good inventors and designers deeply understand their customer. They spend tremendous energy developing that intuition
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:33.200]   They study and understand many anecdotes rather than only the averages you'll find on surveys
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:39.760]   He's arguing against focus groups and things like that. They live with the design that you know that that could be steve jobs talking right there
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.640]   Yeah dog fooding
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:47.360]   Really this this shareholder letter was very interesting. I'm glad you brought it up because this was last month
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:51.120]   And uh, we didn't really spend any time with it. And I think that this is really interesting
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.400]   Ta-da. Thank you
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:57.040]   Let's take a break come back. We'll talk more amazon
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:02.400]   Just one of the many topics we can cover on the show because this show has no portfolio
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:07.120]   We just talk about whatever the hell we want to talk. I thought you were going to say this show has no point
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:13.520]   That too. I'm looking over your shoulder stacy at a book called consent of the network
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:20.720]   Oh, yes, that's Rebecca mckinney from a couple years ago. Yeah, good book. Good good stuff. See she's smart
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:26.080]   We got smart p. This show is our smartest show bring in the smartest people mike elgin is also here
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:33.360]   Uh, his his new enterprise that he's doing with his wife amira is really cool. It's gastronomad.net
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:39.680]   Yes, and uh, the idea is to is really I think to finance your desire to travel
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:43.600]   And exactly and really build it on amira's great cooking
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:47.040]   Yes
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:52.240]   Give us an excuse to find geniuses in the food space in all these different cities our first ones in bar salona
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:54.320]   We saw or spots open
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:59.840]   Oh good bar so good. Yeah. Yeah, and so there's uh, so so step right up. That's a couple of times
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.840]   12th through 17th
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.680]   You have any tech components to that mike?
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.720]   Not really. Um, okay
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:10.080]   other than other than the fact that we do a lot of the
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:13.120]   um the booking and uh and sort of the
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:19.040]   Interaction and things like that, but but it's really for the most part so far. It's a very low tech thing
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.000]   We find geniuses who are doing visionary things
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.560]   uh, and who are good
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.760]   good at at at teaching
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:32.560]   And and uh that sort of thing who are visionaries in terms of making cheese or whatever it is
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:36.320]   And then we are just going to spend some quality time with those people
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:41.280]   Uh, just serially every day. We're going to be um, just doing awesome food stuff
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:45.280]   Uh in each place. So see this is an example of experience, right?
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:49.680]   Uh exactly that if amazon takes all the economic activity
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:55.040]   Well, what's left providing amazing experiences and and just like that article that you read stacy
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.240]   That's the new conspicuous consumption is not buying goods
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.880]   It's experiences
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:05.600]   And you know it's fascinating about this and I learned this fairly recently
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:14.000]   This whole idea of the experience economy, which is a big big deal right now. Um, this was actually foreseen by um,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.960]   in in the book future shock
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.120]   um
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:23.200]   Avent album to the end. Yeah, yeah, 1971 albany toffler
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:30.560]   Uh said what there would arise what would arise is something called an experiential industry interesting and uh,
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:36.720]   You know, he he predicted the whole thing and what he didn't predict was the degree to which
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:42.160]   Uh the experience industry is being driven by instagram and social media
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:46.960]   So one of the takeaways that people get from doing amazing things
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:50.000]   Is the photos they take of themselves doing it
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.920]   And uh, and this is a this is incredibly
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:59.840]   Um, and and I think that's it's it's especially relevant today because today is national selfie day
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.000]   and um
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Uh, I like to look at this
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:10.800]   um, this experiential economy is essentially being the selfie economy. It's it's selfie driven
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:15.360]   It's it's photo and social media sharing driven behavior
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:20.560]   Uh, where people want to experience all these amazing things and yes, they want to experience it. They want to be there in real life
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:26.880]   But the thing that they take away instead of buying something they take away the
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.720]   social media reputation the the sort of like the
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:39.040]   The the success theater on facebook instagram and all the other social networks and so these things are all connected social media selfies
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:44.880]   And the experience economy and it's a multi I think it's going to become a multi trillion dollar economy
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:51.360]   Well, you know, what's interesting is uh, if you've used any if you've been to a store like somebody in the chat room saying
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:53.600]   I last time I went to a sneaker shop in a mall
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:58:01.520]   The deploys kind of ignored me. They didn't really care. Nobody cared like it was a terrible experience and I think we're all experiencing that lately
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:04.880]   uh that uh retail brick and mortar
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:08.960]   Uh, uh, service economy is deteriorating
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.440]   So just which just gives a bigger opening
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:16.320]   Uh for this for this transition. We are you know, that's what that's really what this show is about
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:22.240]   If you're going to pick something that shows about it's about how are how the world is changing our technology is changing this world
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:26.880]   And it's changing it dramatically and sometimes like a frog in a pot of boiling water
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.440]   You don't or a water about the boil. You don't really notice
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:32.880]   It's good to get out of the water and look around and say wow there's things are really
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.600]   There's a shift happening
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:37.920]   No, but you may not jump back in
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:41.600]   Well, let's hope you don't actually
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:47.600]   Let's hope you don't and it doesn't matter if somebody's saying yeah like anybody cares for you cares about you on amazon
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:50.640]   That's not the point. And of course they don't care about you
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:57.120]   But they've created a system that takes care of you. That's all that matters
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:02.480]   It feels like they care about you. It doesn't matter to me if they care about me as long as I get taken care of
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:05.440]   Yeah
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:13.600]   Yep, our show today brought to you by legal zoom. Here's somebody's gonna take care of your legal needs in order to run your own business
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.600]   I could tell you this
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:19.280]   From deep experience attention to details critical
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:27.440]   You mess up a contract one legal misunderstanding and boom and the law is tricky the law is full of pitfalls and snares and loopholes
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:30.080]   But fortunately you're not alone
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.560]   There's legal zoom
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:37.120]   Over a million americans and I include myself have used legal zoom. We've used legal zoom for our wills
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:40.400]   I use legal zoom to incorporate or llc twit
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.520]   uh
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.840]   trademark stuff
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:45.840]   This is how I started twit
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:51.520]   But legal zoom services go well beyond business formation. They have a nation. This is something relatively new
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.920]   They didn't have this when I used legal zoom
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:59.680]   12 years ago to start twit. They have now built a nationwide network of independent attorneys
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:04.560]   So you can actually talk to an attorney and get legal answers to the day-to-day questions
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:07.760]   You have about your business legal zoom's not a law firm though. Understand that

[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.400]   I love that phrase lawyer up. I don't know why
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.760]   But it just you know, let's lawyer up here
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:09.120]   All right. I don't know if mike's passed out or disappeared or maybe just decided to run and get a beer
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:15.840]   But we are we probably in in france. It is it is wine. Isn't it? It's also late
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.800]   I know i'm like
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.680]   It's wine o'clock for sure in france
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.000]   So, um, you just got back from kostorica. Was that wonderful?
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.520]   It was it was an experience one of where I did not take a lot of selfies. So I yeah
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.480]   I like going places where you can't get online
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:41.360]   I I really like yourself though. The amazon whole foods thing did pop through. Yeah, but for the most part I was
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:47.360]   offline and kostorica the food has improved tremendously since I was last there 15 years ago
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.080]   So I was really excited. It's like yeah
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.480]   You can't be I think people realize you cannot be a tourist destination
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.920]   Without having good food
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.840]   That's another thing has changed hasn't it? Yes. Yes
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:08.000]   Absolutely. So did you go I forget a little glass of wine there uh mike or
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.840]   It's exactly what I did rosé. It's it's it's not a particularly elegant glass, but
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:20.960]   That's a lot. Oh, well, that's that's a disguise. See I had my husband bring me a topo because I was like oh
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.440]   All this discussion is parched
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.320]   You know you mentioned the the food and the internet connection
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:34.720]   I mean we talked about this on on twit a couple weeks ago, but when we went on to the sarah and morocco and
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:40.880]   That was exactly the combination zero internet connectivity and amazing food
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.000]   and these were these were deserts
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.760]   Uh, you know
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:54.240]   No, mad's basically providing all these services and they were actually able to get an internet connection from the top of a nearby
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:59.600]   Dune, but we didn't have any internet connectivity and and you're right leo it was really fantastic
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.920]   I saw that picture you had of your guide holding his phone
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:08.320]   Or as I had I think it was up like that so he could get a little connection
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:13.840]   Yeah, and it was it was just barely squeaking but but I remember when when airplanes
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.520]   Business travel was a respite from right now. Nobody can reach me
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.320]   You know for the next six hours and those days are gone
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:26.240]   So now we have to work harder and harder to find a place where we simply can't be reached and it is a luxury
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.720]   Yeah, it's also painful as hell
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.800]   And Lisa and I are both saying okay, we get to get back to the internet. So it's one of those things where
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:40.400]   You know, I noticed that I noticed you posted all these 360 videos after you got back
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.400]   Oh, yeah, because I couldn't there's nothing I could do with them
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.280]   Yeah, yeah, and I you know I used a Microsoft tool which I'd never used before but uh
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:53.840]   Mary Jofolian windows weekly had used it and uh really to good effect on her travels
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:59.840]   So I was looking for some way and I'm gonna use google photos also because google photos has a way of making an album
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.720]   And the nice thing about google photos
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.000]   Is that I can I have given access to everybody in the family
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.560]   So everybody who has pictures could put them in there and then I can organize them in kind of a big family album
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.800]   But I use this thing as part of microsoft office called sway. I don't know if mikersoft
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:22.000]   Pump publishes or promotes this very much, but it's a it's a presentation tool. So on the left hand side
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.720]   Uh, you know, I'm putting together a slideshow with my pictures and text
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:31.440]   And then what comes out of it is actually something you can embed in a website or you can share
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.360]   Um, and it's it's actually a really great way to share
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:42.160]   Both text and experiences, you know pictures and and video too couldn't put 360s in it
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.080]   Which I was a little disappointed because I would love to be able to put 360s in it
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:51.040]   But this is what's nice. That looks amazing. What it works really well. I'm but I
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:56.080]   You know, is this gonna be online 20 years from now when I want to relive this I doubt it
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.760]   So
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.680]   I don't know. I you know, I guess i have to print your photo book print a book
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.920]   I think that's what i'm gonna do is put in google photos make a make a similar thing in google photos won't be quite as
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.160]   Elegant, but I could at least print a book out of it
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.480]   And then i'll have the book
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.040]   But it was kind of fun and I thought if I do this
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:17.040]   I wanted to do it while I was on the trip so I would remember everything
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:21.280]   But I thought if I do this soon enough because I never do that I always think i'm gonna do this. I never do this
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.400]   Is that seal uh, i'm sorry lu, but this is an important question
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.120]   Is that seal like about to eat a penguin or is it killing it?
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:29.920]   Okay, this is my favorite you picked my favorite picture
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:34.720]   So we're sailing around this little rock on a zodiac boat a little rubber
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:38.080]   This is the Galapagos and a rubber zodiac boat and um
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.880]   The guide says oh look that seal
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.320]   Is
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.280]   Doing something so this seal if these are this is a sea lion
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:49.440]   It's calicia california sea lions exactly the same as we have in san francisco, which is weird
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:54.480]   And the bird on the right is what they is something unique to the uh, galapagos called a flightless quermerent
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.480]   The only quermerent that doesn't fly
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.480]   It turns out it it could fish perfectly well in the smaller its wings the better it fishes
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:05.760]   So it just doesn't fly has little wings and the flightless quermerent is centering on the rock and the seal is decided
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:09.600]   No, no, that's my spot. So he's literally yelling at him at least actually on our website
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:15.040]   I should show you that has the whole sequence. So he's trying to he's using a dominance
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:19.440]   Uh, you know technique that works great with other sea lions
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.120]   to
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.040]   to convince
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.440]   Get off my rock
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.640]   But but the quermerent is going what the hell are you talking about?
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:31.920]   So at least at least it got the picture view. I really got
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:35.440]   We're both standing next to each other in the boat and I was so mad because I came home
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.720]   I said I got the best picture ever and then she said oh yeah, I got that picture too
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.040]   And as hers is better because it's got sea spray in it
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.400]   but anyway, it isn't that funny, but uh
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:51.760]   So the seal ended up yelling and yelling stopped yelling and eventually just lay down next to the car red
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:57.680]   He's in okay fine. I'll share right so I think this is a lesson for us all, isn't it?
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.880]   You know a little less yelling a little more just coexisting
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:10.240]   Accepting. Sorry. I know you were making another point, but I know no, but that's the power. That's the power of the sway, right?
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.560]   It grabs all try to evolve
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.360]   We should all try to evolve. We should all just get along
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.120]   And I figure I could probably sell this picture for a stock photos
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:24.640]   Because I'm sure there's plenty of people who use it in a presentation like stop yelling and start listening and I mean
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.920]   I just think there's
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:30.000]   There's opportunities, but I probably won't it's just just gonna be up on this on the sway
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.400]   But yeah, that was a it's it's a it's a photographic photographic delight. I tell you have you been to the Galapagos
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:42.960]   I haven't yeah, I have not oh it's so much. I haven't even been to Costa Rica yet. I want to
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:49.360]   Costa Rica either. I'd like to go there. I've been to every other central american country except for Costa Rican Panama, but um
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.520]   It's definitely on the list. Yeah. Yeah, we had a wonderful time
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:57.600]   It's uh the Galapagos is pretty amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Oh
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:03.520]   It's a glamcy. It's like oh, I'm just coyly looking at you. Hello. You're looking you
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.200]   Hello
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.200]   It's a dog mermaid
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.800]   Very
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:12.080]   Yeah, that's my that was the picture when I took it. I said that's the picture of the trip
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.560]   Uh, and then lisa got a better one gosh
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.200]   She's a very good photographer. It's really fun
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.400]   We to go out on trips with lisa because uh
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:24.240]   We both take our cameras and have a this is whale whale hunting
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:30.400]   Uh, I shouldn't say hunting. We were not trying to kill them. We were just looking for them. We did eventually find them
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:34.960]   Uh, my secret leo maybe you can you can use the secret. Um, amira is a better
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:40.240]   photographer than I am and I so when I take pictures I take them from amira
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:47.840]   Have your pictures please host the pictures sheetbook and take full credit. It works great
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:52.560]   You're a smart man. Anyway, yeah, I was pleased that mike this is a microsoft tool
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.080]   But it has that big problem which is it's hosted by microsoft. It's on microsoft
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:00.160]   I'm saying it like any product is you know google products too if they decide not to
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:04.080]   Support it then not all of this work is for not but at least for now. It's
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.120]   Something you can you can do
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:11.760]   That's it. That's a tip. There's a little tool little tip for you sway.com. It's free
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:17.920]   Mm-hmm, but not so good if you're not if you have no internet connectivity because it's you know
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.920]   You know there's nothing you could do offline with it. You just have to you have to be online
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.840]   Uh
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:30.240]   Austin had a little as we've talked about before fight
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:33.280]   with the folks at lift
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.760]   and uber
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:39.120]   And I know the motto is don't mess with texas
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:45.360]   But it turns out if you mess with texas and you have enough money and enough legislators in your pocket you can win
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.000]   uber uber and lift win around they did it the old texas reach around
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.880]   and
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.920]   And spent I don't think that's what it is
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:01.760]   I do not think that means what you think it means
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:06.720]   Uh, they spent two and a two and a half million dollars 40 lobbyists
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.040]   And they got the state legislature to overturn
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.440]   Right. Isn't that what they did? Well, okay. So there's a couple things here
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:20.800]   Yes, that did happen. They spent nine. I think it was nine million. Wow our mayor mayoral
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:27.120]   And then there was a proposition right that they wanted that was the one I spent prop one they wanted to overturn
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.960]   So by the way, the way they did it was sleazy as hell
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:36.480]   Because what they said in the campaign against proposition one is a ballot initiative
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.440]   Uh was oh no, it's fingerprinting is fine, but who pays for that? Are you gonna pay for that?
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:44.960]   And the austin never said that taxpayers would pay for it
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.080]   Okay, this is why they got voted
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:52.640]   This is why that was voted down. It's because austin was so pissed at the amount of money they spent
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:59.680]   The way they ran the campaign and the fact that they were like just they had written their legislation and austin was trying to
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:03.440]   Compromise with them and they were like, nope. This is what we want and we're gonna fight for it
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.440]   The ad issue was the right to do
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:10.160]   To fingerprint and do background checks on on uber and lift drivers
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:14.400]   Right and uber and lift said no for reasons. I don't fully understand
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:17.120]   Why wouldn't you want background checks on your drivers?
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:25.840]   Uh because it costs money and it creates friction and friction is bad for web based businesses trying to move things in the real world
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.920]   Kind of get the feeling that they want to hire drivers that might not pass a background check
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:35.360]   I think they just don't want to worry about it and they don't want to be responsible for like the more
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.360]   Responsibility and this was it austin when they did it was a
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:44.640]   Uh a test case for them. This was a the big deal for them. They were like gonna prove that
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.920]   They could win they had to do that because I mean obviously
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:53.840]   $10 million is more than the fingerprinting would have cost but this was this was more uh print on principle
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:12:01.760]   Yes, so but what had so the texas legislature came in and what they did was so first we should say prop one failed
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:05.760]   uber and lift both said if prop one fails we're out of here
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:12.480]   And so at a south bite there was no uber there was no lift there were only local ride sharing companies and the local taxi companies
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.960]   Yes, so
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:22.160]   What happened now is they went to the texas legislature and the texas legislature hates austin because we are a bastion of liberalism
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.720]   public of austin
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.600]   um in austin was already
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:34.000]   The legislature was pissy at us and you know inner city houston and some other places for
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:38.240]   declaring themselves sanctuary cities and so
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:42.720]   And they're mad at us for a bunch of other things and so finally they were like, you know what
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.600]   We're gonna override local legislations and that's the rule that
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.680]   Past in the legislature is basically like
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.880]   I mean you hear the republicans and they're all about quote-unquote states rights and blah blah blah
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:01.040]   Well, they basically kind of did that to austin and declared that the state gets to
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.840]   Decide some of our governance issues
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.440]   Uh
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:08.000]   Not a fan. Yeah, so uber and lifter back
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   We're back. They're back. Well, let's see if lift is back uber is back
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:19.360]   You know uber, you know, we still had uber eats in town. So they never like abandoned it totally, but yes
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:22.000]   Well, you know who's not back travis calinik
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.880]   Yes
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:28.000]   Uh, that's the other big story of the week which broke yesterday
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.360]   Uh, I had read while we were away that travis was going to take a leave of absence of a few months
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.520]   While they got it together because jeff holder
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:39.280]   um who who was investigating all these
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:43.120]   Allegations really susan thaller could take credit
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.080]   for ousting
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.080]   Calinic, I think
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:53.600]   I mean is he really ousted he's well at first he was on a leave absence now. He says I resigned
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.240]   He says the board
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:01.760]   Still the chairman of the board and the board holder. He did say though that the board would basically forced him out
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.680]   But that means he's not there for day-to-day operations, right?
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:14.720]   Uh correct. He basically he if you follow hbo silicon valley, he just did what gavin newson just did
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:24.020]   Uh, he called roger on the f
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:26.400]   Someone
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:29.920]   In future. Um, yeah, he he got an airplane and went to Tibet or something
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:34.000]   But he's still he's still pretty much in charge of the company more or less
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.960]   He's just got a better life because he doesn't have to show up for work every day
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:39.520]   Well, this can happen though if you're a publicly held company
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.480]   Uh, or you've got an independent board. Ubers not publicly held, but if you've got an independent board
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.960]   They can force you out
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.880]   Uh, so even though he founded the company
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:56.400]   Uh, and you know, I think get some credit for building a uh, uh, behemoth unicorn even though it never makes any money
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.480]   Yeah
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:03.280]   It turns out it was the investors on tuesday yesterday five of uber's major investors
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:08.720]   According to the new york times demanded the caloneck resign immediately that includes benchmark capital
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:16.880]   Um, and uh, they deliver this letter and even even though you're the founder and the ceo
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:21.280]   Uh, you can't you can't ignore that and so
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:27.680]   Uh, he he's after long discussions with some of the investors the times right he agreed to steps down
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:33.120]   So let me ask you a high level question leo which is that they entered this space
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:38.160]   They wanted to disrupt essentially the taxi industry and in the long term
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:41.200]   the car ownership idea
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.840]   Uh by providing this
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.280]   Uh model whereby there would be an app driven
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:52.560]   Uh flexible employment based ride sharing
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:57.120]   Service thing, uh, and they're going up against you know
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.440]   Transportation
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:03.040]   Giants big tax and companies incumbents incumbents
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:08.560]   That's the word you hate if you're a startup is the guys who are already there and don't want to be disrupted
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.200]   and in order to do that
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:18.640]   Uh uber basically their their approach to dealing with that fact is just to be bear knuckles
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:24.160]   Lie cheat steal be a bunch of jerks abrasive brush off
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.200]   the law brush off whatever
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:33.440]   Track people. I mean just they they were just a hardcore company and uh, you can make the argument
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.440]   They had to be because they're fighting
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:42.800]   taxi medallion owners in the that is a question would they would they have succeeded if they would have played nice
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.840]   Oh no
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.840]   No, I think they had to be uh, no
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:53.120]   Puckinacious would have him with juneau, which was the hey, let's be nice to drivers. Let's follow laws
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:57.360]   They just got bought by somebody. I don't even remember them. Who are they?
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:00.320]   Juneau
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.640]   Yeah red sharing tag it was in
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:08.320]   In new york city mostly, but this is also a very competitive space, right?
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:13.600]   So it wasn't merely that you're fighting the taxi commission. You're also fighting lift and juneau and everybody else
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:18.000]   But he did I mean I don't so I don't know enough about the inside
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.160]   To know if he created the bro culture that was such a problem
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.800]   But oh, yeah, dude. He is such a he was such a libertarian bro dude
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:33.600]   I mean did you read the memo that he had sent out about like hey, don't have sex with your co-workers
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:37.840]   Please, you know, don't vomit in the yeah, he had party rules
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.800]   Uber's party rules
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:47.440]   I mean i've worked for startups and it's really easy and i've worked for good people and i've worked for bad people and
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:50.000]   I've had a boss who would you know
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.600]   Have meetings at strip clubs and show people porn on their phone and that was a very different environment than you know
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:01.120]   I could oh who was who was just a stellar person who like when
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:06.960]   Someone said something stupid. He'd just turn to them and be like that's dumb get out of here good for home
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:09.840]   I'm talking about giga home and oh mallec, of course. Yes
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:16.800]   This is the letter came out in 2013. It's called the miami letter a saucy rule book
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:23.520]   This is from recode for the 400 employees at the company were headed to florida's short club for what was a party focused celebration
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:29.920]   Of the car hailing company's success titled urgent urgent. This is all in caps read this now or else
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:35.760]   You better read this or I will kick your ass says travis calonic four years ago
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.400]   um
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.960]   Have a great effing time. This is a celebration
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:43.760]   miami's transportation sucks
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:45.920]   but
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:53.200]   I have to but I have to bowdlerize it so I can he says there's a 200 dollar puke charge if you vomit
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.480]   uh, no throwing beer kegs off buildings
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.600]   uh
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:04.000]   No fornication. It says do not have sex with another employee unless
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:11.120]   Hey, you've asked that person for that privilege and they have responded with an empathetic. Yes. I will have sex with you
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.280]   That's that's good advice
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:17.040]   And be the two or more of you do not work in the same chain of command
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:23.360]   Yes, that means travis will be celibate on this trip hashtag ceo life hashtag fml
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.600]   Boy, that is bro culture. Wow. See I mean like that's
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.360]   That's not a memo that
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:36.480]   He said he was proud of the letter and spoke to his team about it often
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.440]   Yeah, he's a douchebag
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:47.280]   Okay, so you can fairly blame him for the culture and and and it has to be you know to fall up on my previous question
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:52.480]   That there's no fine. There's no business benefit to that kind of stuff
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:56.240]   Well, um, maybe not but maybe there is because
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.240]   Well, for instance if you lead a sales team of of young guys
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:03.440]   Uh, as as I think you both know
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:10.800]   That's the kind of thing that works with them to get them pumped and motivated and rah rah and if you've ever been those sales meeting
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:15.120]   Mike you're an editor in chief. You know what those meals are like
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:20.160]   Young guys. I mean, that's right. Yeah, that's changed. And fortunately, I think
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:25.600]   Yeah, and so I I think that's you know if he was a visionary if he was jeff bezos and
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:29.760]   Calculated that you need to be bare knuckles and really pushed the limits
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.920]   Um in terms of elite laws and in terms of unions in terms of all the rest
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:37.680]   That's one thing. This is a guy who's kind of out of control
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:43.760]   Who's kind of like has a frat house mentality and is doing lots of things and saying lots of things and creating a culture
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:49.760]   That is not conducive to long-term success. Now. I I know lots and lots of companies
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:58.560]   That started out like this they're clueless geeks. They don't really understand they they don't have a lot of experience interacting with the opposite sex
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:01.680]   You just had a college you 22 years old
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:08.160]   Or whatever, but they change but before they get us, you know, uber's like a super unicorn
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.160]   They're a deca corn or whatever it is
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:14.080]   You know before they get anywhere near that big they have to change and become
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:20.240]   a company that that respects people and has a fundamental decency about them and has a
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.960]   The certain level of professionalism about them. You don't you know
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:26.480]   I'm talking you know when you transition from a 10 person shop to a 20 person shop
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:30.560]   By the time you get to that 20 person shop, you should not be talking like a frat boy anymore
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:33.280]   This is a huge. His investors
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:39.120]   Let that happen and part of the reason they let that happen is because this is a
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:45.920]   Silicon valley is both a male dominated and also a really youthful culture, right? So I mean
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.000]   Even I when I was younger
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.400]   I mean, okay
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.960]   Some of this I would not have responded, but you know, I'd be like, yeah
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.040]   Party
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:02.800]   And now you know, I'm like, oh, I I can't believe I even in sent some of those emails or talked to people like that
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:05.920]   Who were my bosses? I'm like, what you know, we had a really good triangulation
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:09.040]   I actually wasn't the hostess when I was on vacation, but I just listened to it
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:16.480]   on june 5th with a guy russel air away who runs a company really it's kind of a he does a podcast
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.960]   And it runs a company called candor incorporated. It's a management training company
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:28.000]   But it's it's it's well worth a listen because one he's talking about he started out at the age of 22
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.600]   He was a second lieutenant in the marine corps
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:34.640]   And which meant he says I was in charge of 14 guys
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:38.960]   And he learned lessons of which which by the way
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:44.720]   He probably one of the temptations would be like be that rah rah, you know guy
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:49.760]   Put a bag on it. It's okay. If you don't get caught kind of guy, but he didn't
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:55.360]   and the marine corps encouraged him not to be and he learned leadership lessons then went on to google
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:03.840]   and learn more leader and that I think well-run companies and the marine corps very well run has to be or wouldn't succeed as a
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.920]   military operation
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:09.120]   Learn that there are ways that are successful to run
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.440]   groups of
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.680]   Organizations of people and ways that are not successful
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:19.760]   We listened to the interview because it's really interesting and it taught me well lousy manager. I am but
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.640]   Yeah, it's
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:27.280]   So you might say oh, it's you know, that's how uber was you don't like it don't work there
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:34.560]   Um, but I think it's not good business and I think the board is right and I think the investors are right to say that's not gonna be good
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:38.560]   In the long run. That's not how you manage you can't manage a team that way it won't work
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.880]   Well, they didn't wake up to that
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:44.560]   Yes, they took their time and that's why travis kaleneck is on the beach
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:47.360]   It's a very nice beach
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:50.800]   Yeah, people girls and string bikini is giving him margaritas
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:57.760]   But it's not the beach that the investors want him to be on and it really it all started with this and I have to give credit to susan j
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:00.640]   Fowler and you know, I was just looking at this it was this was in february
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:06.960]   This was only four months ago. She wrote this blog post about her treatment and isn't this really wasn't this
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:15.440]   the you know the the trump it was even more than that it was the straw that broke but it was also the thing that woke everybody up and they
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.400]   Said this cannot continue. That's when they hired jeffrey holder. They began the investigation. That's when uh
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:23.040]   Ariana huffington got involved
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:30.720]   Uh people people mocks susan fowler. I think we talked about this when it came out. We just absolutely did not mocker
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.280]   In fact, we said what a big problem this was for uber
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:36.800]   I don't think anybody expected that this would topple travis kaleneck, but it did
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:40.560]   No question in my mind this did and rightly so
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:44.320]   Yeah, can uber be saved. Who do you I mean
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:49.200]   Yes, it's on I mean millions of people use it
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:52.560]   It's a great it's a great business
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:55.360]   Well, is it it's not profitable
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:00.240]   Yeah, that's interesting. I mean really the reason people risen is a deca corn
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:08.320]   Is not because of the of the the ride sharing business, but the future of autonomous vehicles
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.760]   Although they're having trouble there, right? They had to fire leven dowsky
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:15.440]   Because he stole intellectual property from google
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:26.080]   But in general, I think the the the the smart money is on the future of transportation is that the majority of people in most
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.760]   Especially in cities
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:34.480]   Will will conjure up a self-driving car with an app and it will take them wherever and it'll it should be very
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:37.200]   efficient and cost effective
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:44.640]   It should transform human culture in all kinds of positive ways we can transform all these parking lots can go away
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:48.720]   So many good things can happen out of this and uber is right there
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:52.240]   on the most direct trajectory toward that future
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:58.720]   And so they should whether they're profitable today or not they should be on their way to becoming the future of
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.280]   individual personal transportation
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.360]   um
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:07.280]   And I think they can be saved, but it's going to be it's going to require radical
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:12.800]   Cultural change they're going to have to do more than they're already doing more than just getting rid of calonic
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:15.920]   more than adding more wind to the board
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:19.520]   um, but it can and should be saved and
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:26.000]   Look, nobody's on the right track really with self-driving cars. It's it's an open field. Anybody could own this future
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.760]   But but I think what we do know is that it looks a lot like uber minus the driver
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:36.160]   Well, but that's right. So people are talking about this somebody in the charms says uber has a
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:41.680]   Three years runway that means they have enough cash to survive at their current burn rate
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:43.520]   They're current current costs for three more years
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:47.120]   But all they have to really do is get to the point where they can get rid of drivers
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:52.720]   Because that yeah, right. I mean is that why they lose money because the drivers they don't pay drivers that well
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:56.800]   I don't know why maybe they're lobbying expenses. Yeah
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:02.960]   There's a slight difference between what people are willing to pay and what it costs to make them profitable
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.600]   It's a pretty slight difference. Oh, it's interesting
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:10.800]   Dynamics could change in the future if people are not buying if the drivers are not buying gasoline for example
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:14.080]   They're driving electric cars if right, you know all kinds of things
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:19.920]   You know who knows what will happen with inflation or whatever. I mean they're they're in the ballpark of being a
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:22.720]   Thriving profitable business
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:25.520]   And you know if I were them three years runway is
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:30.560]   It's probably two two more years and they really need at this point. You don't know what's gonna happen in the future
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:36.480]   Um, but they're they should be on their way to to succeeding. It looks to me like I think that I think this
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:40.800]   reputation they're getting is probably the best thing that ever happened to lift
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:43.680]   And um and it could be there could be a swap
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.800]   I mean usually the companies that are the first movers in any sort of industry are the ones you never
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:54.160]   Have heard about later on. It's the late comers that come in and take over and and really succeed
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:59.040]   So, you know who knows and really ultimately who cares if uber as a company
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.160]   Is the one that dominates the future of personal transportation?
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:10.480]   What matters is the model what matters is the is is the idea that that you don't have to own a car that self-driving cars can
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:15.040]   Run around and improve safety and all the rest. That's really what matters
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:21.120]   I really mean whether itself lives or dies. I mean, I I don't know why anybody would care
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:26.400]   I would say the vision isn't what matters. It's figuring out the right metric to measure for success
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:33.520]   for self-driving cars because we don't actually we understand the profit and loss drivers for
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:40.400]   A taxi business we understand what network effects do for an online internet business
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.480]   um
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:46.160]   What we don't know is how we're going to measure
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.160]   Like what are the defining metrics for getting people to
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:53.680]   Get in your self-driving cars and pay you money
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:59.920]   Like is it going to be you know, is gas going to be the issue? There's so many things is it electric cars?
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:05.360]   Is it going to be you know, the capital costs of buying x number of vehicles
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:09.600]   To cover a city. What does that even look like who gets the best?
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:14.560]   Is it going to be in your algorithms that help you allocate those cars most efficiently like to me there
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:21.520]   There are so many unknowns right now because we're in an inflection point not just around the technology itself
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.680]   like the self-driving cars, but also how we're going to power those cars
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:29.200]   how we're going to build the data to
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:34.320]   Drive the cars to where they need to be. I mean, that's what makes it exciting and also terrifying
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.480]   uh according to the financial
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.840]   Go ahead. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Live according to the financial. I'm going to the financial now
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:44.720]   There's enough latency that we're like alphons
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.520]   the according to the financial times
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:52.960]   Uber passengers only pay about 41 percent of the cost of their trips
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:30:00.640]   Wow, that's ridiculous. So that's why uber doesn't make money. They're subsidizing almost 60 percent of the ride
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:07.440]   And yet uber's not cheap uber's more than a taxi. Why is uber so much? No, it's not. No, it's not more than a taxi
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:12.560]   Oh, I said it was well. I don't know where your taxes it depends depends. Yeah
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:17.200]   Isn't this conversation very interesting. It's almost like the conversation we had about amazon
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:22.720]   But 10 years before right yeah, uh uber's trying to do to
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:30.080]   Transportation what amazon's trying to do to grocery stores, you know, it's screw them
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:36.160]   No provide the so much convenience that customers just say uber uber uber
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:42.160]   I mean at this point uber is cheap enough that I told my daughter you don't need a car. It's cheaper for me
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:46.640]   You know to not buy you a car pay for gas and pay for insurance
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:49.040]   It's cheaper for me to pay for your uber rides
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:55.520]   Yeah, and and I tell you as somebody I mean we travel all over the world and we go to places where there is no uber
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:31:01.040]   And we go to places where there is an uber and when we travel abroad, of course, we leave our
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:07.840]   We live our pre-as back in silicon valley, but um, we were sort of entering into the future because we're living without
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:10.240]   um car ownership essentially
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:15.520]   And it's hell when there isn't uber or any sort of ride-sharing service when we're in mexico
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:22.720]   City which does have uber the uber. I mean it's a godsend to to to to be a conjure up in uber
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:29.360]   Because mexico city is it is like a country. It's it's a city that's so large that it's like a nation
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:36.320]   Right and you and it's can be dangerous and you can find yourself on some dark street and there aren't going to be taxis
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:42.960]   Happening by whereas you can just call an uber. They're there in two minutes. It's a brand new car in every case that we took
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:45.520]   um a courteous driver
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:48.640]   Uh, take you exactly where you want to go cost nothing
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:52.320]   Just fantastic and then we go to bar salona, which is banned
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:57.440]   Ubers and now we're back. We feel like, you know, we feel like the Flintstones
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:02.000]   We're trying to find a taxi when you know trying to hail them. Oh, they're full of people. Oh, there there's another one
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:09.120]   No, they're full of people. I mean, it's just it's it's barbaric really trying to deal with taxis when you go from city to city and it's like no
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:15.200]   uber uber no uber uber you realize that the whole model of of uber and lift
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:22.800]   Is just vastly superior from from a convenience safety and every other standpoint cost
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:25.520]   I mean, it's just it's just fantastic
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:29.440]   Part of that is because they're subsidizing it right if you had to pay
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:34.560]   Yeah, uh, the other 60 of that cost would you still think that way? I guess you would
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:38.640]   Well in in cities like san francisco, um
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:43.360]   I probably wouldn't want to pay the full cost, but I mean mexico city
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:48.080]   We I mean we went across the city and it was like a 45 minute drive that cost three bucks
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:55.520]   What I'd happily pay eight bucks. Yeah, you know, of course you bucks 12. Yes. I mean, it's really nothing and and so
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:00.960]   It really depends on on on the local economy, you know, and in san francisco
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:04.160]   Everything is way too expensive avocado toast is five bucks
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:10.080]   I mean, it's everything is way overpriced right and um, I definitely don't want to pay the full price
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:15.680]   Where can you get avocado toast for five bucks because that's a great deal. Yeah, right mexico city
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:20.240]   Leo, I'll make you some avocado toast
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:22.880]   I want avocado toast
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:29.920]   Uh, actually we don't have to have avocado toast. We've got snacks. It's time for you've all been so good

[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:45.920]   Uh with with good good ingredients never any artificial flavors artificial colors
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:51.040]   It is good stuff. You'll be happy and most of the bags are resealable. So
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:56.560]   Uh, you don't have to eat the whole they're very healthy sized bags. Oh, but you don't have to eat the whole thing
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:58.720]   I know those
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:00.000]   stuff
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000]   So the only thing left for me
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.600]   This is so I usually have a full box
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:11.600]   Crunchy barbecue twists sweet and smoky barbecue season lentil flour twists
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:12.640]   I don't know
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:17.920]   That's because they're gluten-free right because they have snacks for a variety of dietary needs. So I guess lentils
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:20.880]   No gluten. Oh, they're so cute
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.680]   Mmm
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:24.800]   Wow
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:29.360]   Lentils never tasted so good. I was gonna say what would happen if you didn't enjoy it Leo
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:32.640]   That particular snack kind of add with this be if I
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:35.280]   Oh
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:37.280]   Terrible
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:42.320]   Because you can get a new one for free right there you go whole wheat raspberry figgy bars. That was sera laine
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:47.680]   Oh, no, I mean she would do the yogurt pretzels and they would be gone like we get the nature buy
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.680]   We get several nature boxes a month for our staff
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:54.720]   They would be gone the day they came like she just take them. She said, I love these and eat the whole thing
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:58.880]   New snacks each month too. You never get bored inspired by your feedbacks
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.120]   You tell them what you like what you don't like these actually are great
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:02.960]   very far
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:04.560]   Mmm

[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:03.920]   Mmm. I wish I could I wish I could send these over the Skype. I do too because you know, it's like five 30
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:08.480]   All right, let's wrap it up. You always get hungry for the show before we wrap it up Leo
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:11.840]   I think I have an idea for you for your future nature box ads
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:15.120]   You should put a secret camera in the cabinet
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:17.600]   I know the nature of people stealing evidence
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:21.440]   Yeah, you can get you first of all you can catch calicanas in the act
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:28.480]   But but but more importantly you can show the employees like going through and you know, you find the fig the fig bars
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:33.200]   Although those are gone in like 30 seconds. I mean and find out you remember that mic
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:36.800]   I mean we had yeah, thanks your box and you're during your tenure. I used to steal them
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:38.800]   I used to take the whole back
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:42.000]   Take the whole bag
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.760]   I got just a camera for you get a blink they're cheap they're battery powered
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:48.240]   And it just takes a picture and you should have all of that
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.440]   Hey, I want to say you call me a doofus for ordering those nest cams
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:54.960]   Oh, that's because there's a better camera. That's yeah
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.960]   Well, they haven't come yet anyway
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:01.040]   But I got the nest outdoor cam and I love it and even while I'm in um
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:02.640]   Peru
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.240]   An Ecuador
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.720]   There's motion in your backyard. I could see the cats
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:11.120]   In the middle of the night the cats are wondering that's kind of fun
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:17.520]   Wait, wait, wait, so in matchu pichu you're sitting there watching real time live cat videos. Yeah
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:20.080]   It's depressing, isn't it?
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:21.600]   Oh, I want to give you an update too
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.960]   One of the things I said I was excited about going back to matchu pichu because I've been there
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:27.840]   I was there five years ago and at the time I was the four square mayor
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:30.720]   of matchu pichu
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:34.960]   Somebody took it away from me a few months later, but I just thought the idea of being the mayor matchu pichu is pretty cool
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.520]   Uh, I couldn't get it back
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:39.520]   They changed the rules or something swarm
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:43.280]   As i'm leaving it says you're two days away from becoming the mayor
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:46.000]   It's like I can't wait
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:52.480]   Two days. So it's that close change my flight change my flight. I almost I was almost did that
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:55.040]   Then I realized this is dopey
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:39:01.200]   You have been gamified leo you live in game. I there that shows you doesn't it
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:03.520]   Wow
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:09.280]   There's so much more we could talk about uh, but I don't know if we can't I'm not I'm not faint
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:15.520]   It's just we always do the he's had a glass of wine big glass of one. No, he's not stacy's not faint
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:18.400]   And you're not drunk or maybe you didn't say that
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:22.640]   Let's get uh, let's get our picks of the week
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:28.240]   By the way, I went on to the rundown to see what stacy's would be and it says stacy's really tired today
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:31.280]   It's true. Why are you really really?
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:38.080]   I came back from coast to rica over the weekend and my ac was broken. Oh, no
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:43.680]   And that was drama and then I had to travel to san Antonio for a couple days and then I just got back
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:45.760]   So I'm just like isn't though
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:52.320]   Costa Rica roughly in the same time zone as you oh it told it if they don't do daylight savings time
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.400]   So it was an hour later, but yes
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:40:02.240]   Lagged in other words. No, no, no, it's just it's just that vacation hangover where you're like it was a very active vacation
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:05.440]   Lots of free for you. So come home was that sad
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:09.600]   No, it was actually really nice because I'm not a beach lady and
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:16.720]   I was kind of sick of sand and really you don't you like to do you like educational vacations or sightseeing
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:24.160]   You don't like I like mountains. Yeah, like I love the beach, but I agree with you. Sometimes sitting on the beach is boring after a few days
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:29.120]   It's like yeah, I mean, I don't I don't sit so that was okay, but it was human
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:32.240]   Not that texas is anything. Well, did your daughter enjoy it?
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:38.160]   Oh my god. Yes, and I had fun. It's not that I didn't enjoy it. I just was ready to come home. Yeah
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:41.200]   So hang out around Lake Austin instead
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:43.200]   Yes
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:45.200]   But you want I don't have
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:50.320]   Oh, I wasn't what I was gonna say you're not too tired to have a pick for us though. I have a pick for you
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:53.760]   I remembered it because I I'm only halfway through it. So
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:41:00.640]   It may it may take a twist for the worst. Oh, I lost it. Um, it's all radical. Okay. Good
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:03.120]   I was like I lost my window. I have
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:06.080]   Okay radical technologies
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:10.160]   The design of everyday life and what this is this is a
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:13.920]   I don't know what this guy used to do. He's a designer Adam Greenfield
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:15.520]   he
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:21.520]   Wrote about what the internet of things specifically tied to smart cities will mean for people
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:24.720]   So what does it mean when all of your data is collected
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:27.360]   and shared and analyzed
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:34.400]   in how to so some of the things we're talking about like how to how will cities influence us to behave differently how
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:41.200]   Corporate entities use that data to influence us. So it's a very kind of dark and dystopian vision
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:45.680]   I'm not sure I buy into all of it, but it is a nice kind of critical
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:52.240]   View over what life is heading towards and might be so if you're into that sort of thing
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:56.240]   It's a it's a nice book. It's kind of a one lines what we were talking about, right?
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:00.720]   Yes, that's why I was like, oh, hey my picks gonna work here. Yeah radical
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:04.960]   Oh, you mentioned that that's right radical technologies design of everyday life
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:10.320]   Adam Greenfield and of course you can get it from amazon faster than anywhere else
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.400]   You could have yeah, I
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:17.440]   I had it downloaded to my kiddo because it came out monday and I was already in coast to reka and I was on the whole
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:22.080]   My and you see it appeared you see conveniences everything
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:26.640]   Another bookstore bites the dust because of you yes
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:32.640]   It was all me right there all of my amazon book purchases. I you know, it's
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:35.600]   I think convenience really does often trump
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:40.000]   Good sense, you know, we want we want bookstores we want independent bookstores, but
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.040]   They don't have the book
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:45.040]   And who wants to carry a book all the way to Costa Rica?
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:52.000]   Well, I was going to say it's it's primarily like I remember I traveled to Japan back in a like
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.800]   And in the flight I bought I brought along jean wolf's
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:04.000]   Science fiction that he's got I can't remember what it was called, but they're like four big books or three big books
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000]   I brought all of them
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000]   Because it was like a six and a half for flight
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.560]   I brought the
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:13.440]   Stephen king's the stand which is this thick to mexico
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:18.560]   But the night yes, but as i'm reading it, I just tear the part that I've read off and throw it away
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:20.400]   So the book gets thinner
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:25.200]   And it's less to carry I just I abandoned them. So I just I'm like, well that was done
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:31.680]   Yeah, leave it there many hotels that many good hotels have battered paperbacks for trade
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:39.280]   So so good. Thank you. That's a great pick mike. You got a you got a do you got a pick? I got a
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:42.320]   I got a number
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:46.160]   18 18 18 is the number of
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:54.400]   Badges the girl scouts of america are introducing around cyber security next year what 18 cyber security badges
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:44:01.840]   The girl scouts are going to learn about online safety internet safety they're going to learn about
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:08.000]   All kind you know, there's going to be a whole progression up through the the older girls to learn about serious
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:13.440]   cyber security what it's all about getting into some serious counter hacking and stuff like that
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:20.480]   And it's a brilliant initiative. They're doing with Palo Alto net networks, which I believe is a canadian company that
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:25.760]   Cyber security company, but yeah, they're getting serious about cyber security. I think this is fantastic
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:30.480]   There's it's all good. The only thing i'm concerned about is i'm afraid that in the future
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:33.680]   Girl scout cookies will be something they drop in your browser
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:39.040]   Wow
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:46.480]   Okay guys. I was not only a girl scout, but when I lived in new york as a young adult. I was also an assistant troop leader
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.080]   Aww
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:50.480]   That's great go girl scouts
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:53.280]   That is a great idea
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:56.480]   I also be able to explore opportunities in stem
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:01.120]   develop problem solving and leadership skills to earn their badges
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:04.160]   cyber security badges
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:08.560]   Well, I wish I had some you guys had such uplifting picks my pick is not quite so uplifting
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:12.960]   Oh mine is not uplifting if you read it. You're gonna be like oh crap. We're all doomed
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:16.560]   But it somebody told me if you search for spinner
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:22.160]   In google, you know those fidget spinner's oh you look you get a spinner
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:26.480]   You don't need a fire fidget spinner
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:32.080]   Look at that google's got oh and they can change it to a number wheel in case
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:36.640]   In fact, if you if you're really a nerd and you don't have your 20-sided die
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:40.480]   Lying around you could just spin the magic number wheel
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:43.680]   Oh, that would be a good amazon echo skill
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:51.120]   I think it is if they have a 20-sided. Yeah, yeah roll my 20-sided die. Yeah, they have they have those
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:56.480]   This is the dopiest
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:02.880]   It's literally an online fidget spinner is literally the only thing dumber than an actual fidget spinner
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:11.600]   Can you change the color that would be my feedback? You don't like the the aquamarine kind of
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:15.040]   Yellow no oh you don't like the yellow part
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:20.720]   Why I just I'm like I feel like I would like some other options like orange would be good for me
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:23.120]   Nope doesn't look like you can
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:26.640]   No, it's a pretty good spinner though. It's lovely
