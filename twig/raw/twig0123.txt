[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.440]   From people you trust.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.840]   This is Twig.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.640]   Bandwidth for this week in Google
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.920]   is provided by cashfly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.080]   This is Twig, this week in Google,
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.600]   episode 123, recorded November 30, 2011.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.160]   I have a Google.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.360]   This week in Google is brought to you by Ford,
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.800]   featuring available Sync with My Ford Touch.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.480]   Sync with My Ford Touch gets you to your destination
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.120]   with integrated turn-by-turn directions and directional arrows
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.560]   displayed on screen.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.000]   Check it out in the new 2012 Ford Focus
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.360]   and at forward.com/technology.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.240]   And by Netflix, watch thousands of TV episodes and movies
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.680]   on your PC, Mac, iPad, iPhone, or TV, instantly, all streamed
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.720]   directly to you, saving you time, money, and hassle.

[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.440]   It's time for Twig this week in Google
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.720]   to show that focuses on Google.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.360]   But not just Google, the cloud, Facebook, Twitter.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.040]   And today, a little bit of Spotify, too.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.680]   To my left, Gina Trepani from smarterwear.org,
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.600]   founder of Life Hacker.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.720]   She's also responsible for ThinkUp App.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.400]   Think about it.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.840]   Howdy.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.680]   Hey, Gina.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.880]   How's it going?
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.280]   It's good.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.080]   Are you in a new office or are you just--
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.080]   we're different, Ang?
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.840]   I rearranged a little bit.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.360]   You've moved the bikes.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.120]   I moved the bikes.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.760]   And you can see my Twit Fez is in the far corner there.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.680]   So I had to get that in the show.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.600]   Oh, we're trying to figure out.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.320]   I'm actually very disappointed.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.160]   We sent all the hosts, including Jeff and Gina Fez's
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.600]   last year for Christmas.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.560]   And we wanted to send you something equally exciting.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.760]   So we were going to get monogrammed lab coats.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.560]   There was a Gina Trepani this week in Google
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.800]   and have the Twit logo.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.440]   But then, first of all, they can't get them until after January.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.960]   And second of all, it's like, I know it will spend a lot of money
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.720]   on these, and you'll just put them in the closet.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.800]   Nobody's going to wear a lab coat with their name
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.800]   and a Twit logo on it.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.760]   That's impractical.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.440]   So we're going to--
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.640]   I wear my fez every day.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.240]   You look good in a Fez, though.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.800]   I like the Fez.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.000]   You should consider it.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.360]   You know.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.880]   Next time you go to Turkey-- oh, no, you can't wear it in Turkey.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.320]   I had a Turk made that impossible.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.360]   Hey, on our far left here, Jeff Jarvis was visiting us from Blurmani.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.000]   I'm trying to.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.280]   Which explains the look.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.040]   He's actually in a--
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.560]   I know.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.240]   Do you want to--
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.880]   No, no, you're fine.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.800]   Don't worry about it.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.680]   We love you.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.080]   What are you doing in Germany?
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   I was speaking at an event today about the internet and all that.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.760]   And then I had dinner tonight with a real party about the internet
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.280]   and all that.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.680]   So that's why I wore the tie, because my mother insisted.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.180]   He's had a very fancy meal with, like,
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.440]   interior-- what secretaries, ministers.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.080]   And four members of parliament.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.520]   And--
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.720]   Jeff, it's not going to work.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.680]   We're going to have to let you go.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.960]   I'm glad we could see you.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.960]   And--
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.360]   I'm glad you look so good.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.860]   But--
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.560]   True hotel.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.960]   He's still answering the last question.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:25.120]   Hey, he's in another time zone.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.720]   I know.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.760]   He's in the Skype zone.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   Sorry.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.000]   You want to try me out?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Don't look for--
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.640]   I think we're just going to let you go.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.400]   Look, in fact, we didn't even have to.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.920]   It happened all by itself.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.600]   That's all right.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.040]   We're going to bring in somebody in that slot.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.720]   No problem.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.320]   We've got somebody exciting to join us in a bit.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.880]   But let's say hi, first of all, to the hearsuit, Mr.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.920]   Movember, the last day, why did you
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.680]   choose that particular look, Mr. Matt Cutz of Google?
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.960]   Well, yeah, they call it the trucker.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.640]   And I could have gone for the whole cogan
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.720]   if I'd gotten just a little more off.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.920]   But this was easy.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.600]   And I've noticed people are very quick to get out
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.640]   of my way at the airport.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.840]   So I can really make fast progress.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.200]   So Movember is a yearly event now.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.360]   It's just become quite popular.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.560]   Started by some Aussies, I believe.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.880]   It was to raise money and raise awareness of prostate cancer,
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.120]   I think, right?
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.440]   Yeah, it means health issues.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.800]   It means health in general.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   Actually, Jeff, who is a cancer--
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   prostate cancer survivor, would be a good person to have on here.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.360]   But unfortunately, he's gone.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.960]   He's always had a Movember all year round.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.880]   Are you going to keep yours?
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.640]   This is the last day.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.080]   It's probably my last day.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.400]   My wife is a little anxious to get rid of it.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.560]   Unless someone wants to start donating for me to keep it,
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.840]   I'll probably start shaving it off.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.160]   Do you raise money by doing this?
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.680]   Yeah, in fact, on my lower third, I did a little thing where,
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.400]   if you go to Bitly/TwigMat, you can donate to my team.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.040]   We've got a Microsoft versus Google competition going on.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.880]   Well, that's going to help.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.080]   I think there's quite a few people now who will rush over there.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.000]   And I didn't say who, but you picked the one you liked best.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.760]   I think this is great.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.400]   US.movember.com is the site for the US-movember.com
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.440]   worldwide.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.160]   It is the last day, but next year, you could do it.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.320]   I did it last year.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.120]   I started it.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.880]   I couldn't do it.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.880]   It was just too scratchy.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.080]   My dad wrote after four days and said,
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.160]   I remember why I don't grow a mustache now.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.840]   He's totally village-people did.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.160]   He is a village-people.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.800]   Our small children like, Daddy, a strange man
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.120]   tried to talk to me.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.560]   Not too much, but my cat loves it,
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.000]   because she thinks I'm another cat now.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.760]   So I can rub up against her and everything.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.200]   Aww.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.040]   Hey, that sounds like Jeff.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.200]   Are we going to be on phone with you, Jeff?
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.240]   I'm still on an audio if this works.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.200]   Let's work fine.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.000]   This works much better.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.560]   Thank you.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.560]   And it does mean that we have room.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.440]   Yay.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.080]   In the third spot for Dylan.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.760]   So thank you for doing that.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.120]   Dylan Combs is with Google.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.240]   He is--
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.880]   Say again?
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.720]   My face.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.360]   I'm sure.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.520]   Dylan Combs is somebody else.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.080]   I said, I give up my face for Dylan.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.760]   Yes.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.360]   So you talk Dylan when Jeff talks and will think it's him.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.720]   Dylan Casey is a product manager at Google.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.000]   Who is doing God's work?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.400]   He's replacing the Google bar.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.640]   No, we've replaced the black navigation bar
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.760]   with the new Google bar.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.840]   Well, now I still have.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.800]   I'm looking at my Google.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.160]   That's right.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.240]   Well, it's going to take us a little while to roll it out.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.680]   But if you look at the Google blog post that went up yesterday,
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.480]   you'll get some screenshots and see the actual video that
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.880]   will show you what it looks like.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.800]   Why was this in response to something or just what happened?
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.600]   Well, this is just the next step in a series of steps
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.080]   that we've been taking most recently to really clean up
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.440]   the overall user experience across Google.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.040]   And the significance of the Google bar
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.240]   is that it really glues together all of the different products
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.640]   that users are already using and cleans up the interface
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.960]   and really makes it a more seamless experience.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.480]   And so the goal is really to make Google one experience
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.160]   as opposed to a whole bunch of siloed experiences.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.800]   And the goal here is that the Google bar
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.200]   is going to really enable easier navigation
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.480]   and just kind of help the user understand what
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.560]   it is to use Google.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.120]   So this is the bar that we're all familiar with right now.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.520]   And actually, I don't mind it.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.520]   I like the integration.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.960]   I like the fact that it goes across Google products.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.480]   And I have direct access to my Google+ and Gmail.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.520]   And of course, it encourages people
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.480]   to live in the Google ecosystem.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.360]   You did maybe one big fix already,
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.680]   which is to change the notification for those of us
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.920]   who get a lot of notifications from 9 plus to whatever
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.080]   the actual number is.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.320]   But now we're going to get a-- oh, look at this.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.440]   So Google will have-- all the apps will be under the Google
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.760]   logo.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.260]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.880]   So we're calling it the Google menu,
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.040]   or the Google menu, which is essentially showing you
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.600]   all of the apps that you can access.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.480]   And really, like I said, making it easier to access the products
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.800]   that are important to the user.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.800]   We also gained a little bit of screen real estate
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.800]   by eliminating the Google navigation bar at the top.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.960]   Interesting.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.880]   And it's going to have a more seamless look
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.040]   across all of the different Google properties, which
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.960]   is something that we've always struggled with as we develop
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.200]   and launch new products.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.280]   Were there complaints about the Google bar?
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.000]   No, I don't think-- this is-- it's not like everybody
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.640]   was complaining.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.440]   And we said, oh, we need to make some big fixes.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.520]   This is really just part of a long-term vision
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.080]   and how the overall experience is just evolving.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.800]   So this is just the next step in that process.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.680]   And what we do is we pay particular attention
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.560]   to feedback from users both internally and externally.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.560]   And we do lots of usability tests.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.000]   And we try to really understand what works and what doesn't work.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.320]   And then we essentially take all of that information
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.400]   and put it together as part of the development process
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.280]   to continue to push the envelope in terms of how
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.240]   we develop the products.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.000]   Yeah, but--
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.800]   Go ahead, Leo.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.000]   Sorry.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.960]   I mean, you did just roll out the black bar
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.720]   like a couple of months ago, right, when you rolled out Google
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.840]   Plus.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.080]   So the presumption is somebody at that point
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.640]   thought this was the way to do it.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.320]   And now you're doing it differently.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.040]   Well, I mean, we release often and early,
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.080]   and we iterate quickly.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.760]   That's the kind of mantra of Google.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.280]   And so this is just an illustration of that process,
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.080]   in effect.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.160]   Yeah, I think that's fair.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.760]   It's not a bad thing to back off on it.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.120]   I did wear my black shirt in honor of the black bar,
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.560]   which is gone.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.560]   I'm sorry, Gina.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.040]   You wanted to ask something?
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.360]   Well, I just-- I had a question.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.920]   So it's when you roll over the logo, the menu reveals itself.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.400]   So you don't have to actually click to see the menu.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.680]   You can click on it or roll over it, and it'll open.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:08.480]   So we basically have two ways to activate the Google menu.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:08.960]   OK.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.400]   You know what struck me about it when I first saw it was, wow.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.400]   This thing is tall, compared to the thin black strip.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   It's a bigger Google.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.680]   The Google bar looks taller, and that's
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.040]   because the Google search box is in it, which
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.480]   isn't the black bar and the Google logo.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.400]   But then I watched the video, and seeing--
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.320]   if you switch between Google products now,
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.800]   there's generally a search box and a Google logo
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.320]   at the top of the page anyway.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.920]   So if you compare it from that gray area up,
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.720]   the new Google bar is actually shorter.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.240]   But if you compare it just to the black bar,
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.200]   it's much taller.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.080]   Well, that's right.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.880]   We've actually moved the search box from the property
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.600]   or the product and moved it up into the Google bar,
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.040]   allowing more real estate for the product itself.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.480]   So for example, if you're in email or if you're in calendar,
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.600]   you're going to see more of that specific product,
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.680]   and it's going to be taken up by less of the Google navigation
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.440]   bar that we had previously there.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.280]   What's the process in this kind of stuff?
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.720]   Do you-- does Google do focus groups?
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.080]   I mean, how do you test this stuff?
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.880]   We just normally look for random people walking by campus.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.320]   And come here.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.320]   Come here.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.120]   Come here.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.840]   We pull them in and we feed them some food.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.920]   And we put toothpicks in their eyeballs and stuff like that.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.760]   Seriously.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:34.680]   It's a very-- it's an art form and it's a scientific approach.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.840]   We-- I think Google is well known for having this process
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.920]   where we launch products internally to all the Google
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.240]   employees and force them to use the products.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.440]   Eat your dog food.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.440]   Eat your own dog food.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:49.940]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:50.440]   Eat your dog food.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.920]   And this is really a great way to get honest, clear,
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.280]   and passionate feedback.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.680]   But oftentimes, we'll bring in groups.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.120]   We'll help-- we'll do usability studies.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.600]   We're very focused on metrics.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.880]   We track all the clicks and try to understand
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.520]   if we're creating any types of cognitive or dissonance
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.720]   for the user as they open a page.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.280]   Do they sit there and just stare at it?
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.160]   So there's a lot of different things that we apply
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.000]   in a very iterative process.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.280]   So it's a little bit madness.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.240]   Now, I still don't have it.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.360]   So I'm working blind here.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.880]   I've looked at the blog post, of course,
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.920]   but I'm not sure exactly how this is going to change for me.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.360]   How is this going to roll out?
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.680]   Is everybody going to have it by a certain date?
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.400]   Well, we're rolling it out slowly.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.680]   It's just part of our launch process.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.880]   But we hope that everybody should have it by next week.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.320]   Is it customizable?
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.480]   Can I change the menu items?
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.440]   No, so right now, it's a fixed set of Google properties.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.840]   And we're going to roll it out to English only
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:03.960]   across all of our domains and then quickly add languages
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.200]   after that.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:05.720]   So we're just going to--
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.400]   I still want to get a sense here.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.000]   Part of the process.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   What was the process that said, hey, everybody, a black bar?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.960]   It's a great idea.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.960]   And then as Gina says, only a short time later,
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.880]   you know the black bar.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.400]   Was there complaints?
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.280]   What was the internal process?
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.200]   Was it Eric Scott and Larry's in charge?
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.360]   I know you can't fully answer.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.280]   But give us some signal here of how this process happened.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.080]   Well, I think over the last six to 12 months,
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:38.840]   we've been in a pretty significant moment
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.880]   in the evolution of Google as both a product and a company.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.000]   Absolutely the case.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.040]   Absolutely.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:52.040]   And I think we've become really focused.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:59.040]   And part of the leadership that Larry has brought to Google
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:06.000]   is really helping us be very mindful about how
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.800]   we build the user experience.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.320]   And I think what you're seeing is the illustration
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.840]   of that leadership from Larry and of course,
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.600]   a whole lot of people.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.960]   But it's really--
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.560]   I can't say that there was this very defining moment
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.040]   or like, oh my god, everybody realized
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.080]   that they hate the black sandbar or users
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.120]   hate the black sandbar.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:32.040]   It's really just this natural, very organic process
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.400]   by which we make changes.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.400]   And I think we're starting to see--
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.480]   So that's-- as they say on Family Feud,
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.640]   it's a good answer, good answer.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.000]   I'm still wondering here, is there
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.360]   some kind of principle that then came up to say, everybody,
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:53.760]   here's the new rule and let's make the bar fit that new rule.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.720]   What's that new rule?
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.120]   No, there's no new rule.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:06.000]   I think what you can see is that the overall design
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.680]   across Google is becoming more unified.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.000]   Unified, yeah, exactly.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:13.400]   Thank you.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:13.960]   Got it.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.640]   OK.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.000]   All right.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.840]   And the Google bar itself is just a step in that overall process.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.840]   Now, we've seen this before.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.480]   Other companies have done this before-- dig bar, remember.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.880]   And sometimes people push back against something like that.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.720]   They say, I want this UI thing in every page of mine taking up
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.040]   space.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.040]   Well, and one thing to remember is that the dig bar would show
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.520]   that as you would go out to external places on the web,
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.960]   what I personally really like about the Google bar
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.280]   is you can tell from the video when you click from property
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.160]   to property, you get a very consistent sort of experience.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.600]   You know where the search box is going
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.000]   to be your mental model.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.520]   Yes.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.400]   It gets easier as you're just.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:54.880]   I agree with that.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.360]   That's good.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.720]   And if you can move the search box up,
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.200]   like everything on the Google page
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.240]   has to fight for its real estate in terms of being useful.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.120]   And so trying to get back a little bit of that screen
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.120]   real estate is also really, really helpful,
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.480]   because that leaves more room for your doc or your search
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.520]   session or whatever.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.360]   You did say-- you do say in your blog post--
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.600]   by the way, congratulations.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.080]   You mentioned this on Google+ that Larry Page blog,
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.280]   which must feel good when the boss blogs.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.160]   But you did say in your Google+ and your original blog post
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.400]   that this has been a year in the making.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.480]   Well, it's probably for me personally,
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.400]   I've been involved in this project
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:42.320]   to various degrees for over a year.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.800]   And so it was nice to kind of have
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.560]   that all come to a very specific crescendo
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.920]   with the launch of the Google bar.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.000]   What was the mandate a year ago when you started this project?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.760]   What were you told?
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.840]   This is what we want to do.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:01.200]   Well, I wasn't totally focused on just this one project.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   I had previously worked very closely with the search team
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.920]   and on the search team in building Google's real time
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.960]   search.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.960]   We love that, by the way.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.560]   Great job on that.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.000]   Thank you.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.160]   And as we started to think about what the future was going
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.720]   to hold and the Google+ project started to come to fruition,
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.560]   we-- the teams and various people
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.400]   were starting to participate in that process.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:40.080]   And the Google bar really is a product that
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.480]   has existed for quite a while.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.280]   If you recall, many years ago-- and I'm
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.440]   sure Matt has better details than I do around this--
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.800]   but we used to have tabs across the top of the search box.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.600]   And then eventually, we put that into a clear bar
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.080]   across the top.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.880]   And I can't even remember what we called it at the time.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.960]   But that was really where we first
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.360]   started to try to figure out a way to help users navigate
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.240]   across Google and how to access products
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.960]   and how to find the other things just beyond search.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.200]   So I think that the Google bar has been in existence
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.520]   for much longer than the year that I referenced
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.120]   as being a participant.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.440]   And so it's been a really interesting experience
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.280]   to see how it's evolved from just a couple of links
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.920]   to something that's really dynamic
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.000]   and is going to create this kind of consistent user
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.040]   experience across all of Google.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.000]   Dylan, does the web interface design group
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.320]   talk with the Android design group?
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.760]   And I ask only because I know that in Ice Cream Sandwich,
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.520]   the menu button is getting deprecated
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.800]   in favor of dropdown menus that are
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.640]   contextual on the action bar.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.520]   So is that purposeful?
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.720]   Do the web interface folks talk with the Android folks?
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:00.920]   Or are there just two different things?
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.680]   I don't know specifically if there's
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.600]   any correlation between those two things.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.960]   But I wouldn't say that it's impossible
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.760]   that that isn't happening.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.360]   I'm sure that there's some sort of conversation happening
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.760]   between groups.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.440]   But yeah, I can't comment specifically on that.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.600]   The new maps for Android does it too, right?
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.360]   6.0 has the menu.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.520]   Has the menu at the top where you tap?
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.920]   And I went to an Ice Cream Sandwich developer session.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.960]   I said, don't use the menu button.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.920]   I want to use the use the action bar menus
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.040]   and to drop down menus.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.240]   Similarly, a few people I saw on Twitter
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.840]   had commented that the new Google Bar menu dropdown,
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.560]   because you can nest some menus within it.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.960]   It looks a lot like the Windows Start menu just upside down,
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.080]   which I don't know if that was purposeful
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.840]   or if that's even one comparison you want to make.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.360]   There's only so many ways you can do menus.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.560]   Yeah, I get that's true.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.560]   OK.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.280]   But there's lots of room to add.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.720]   I mean, it's future proof, right?
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.520]   Like, part of the idea was to make it
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.120]   so that Google launches new products.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.120]   You can add it to this menu without taking it real estate,
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.440]   right, from other things on the page.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.640]   Dylan, I know you can't stay with us much longer,
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.560]   so I really want to thank you for being here.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.040]   Thank you.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.320]   There must be a--
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.960]   any even one pixel change on Google's pages
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.960]   is we're talking massive numbers of hits,
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.360]   massive amounts of downloads.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.000]   Do you feel a sense of a little pressure?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.480]   I mean, this is unlike any other web page.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.240]   When you change this web page, you're
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:41.600]   changing the experience of billions of people.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.640]   Yeah, I was thinking about that last night
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.360]   when I was leaving the office with a couple of my peers
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.200]   and thinking of all of the product launches
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.000]   that I've been involved with at Google
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.240]   over the last eight years and doing
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.720]   some back of the envelope math.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.560]   The Google bar is probably the largest launch
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.400]   that I've done in terms of the number of people
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.800]   that will see it and interact with it.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.440]   And so it is pretty rewarding.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:15.360]   And I think we take it for granted that we have the honor
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.120]   and the fortune to work at a company and on a product
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:24.040]   that really touches the lives of billions of people.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:28.960]   And it's a pretty incredible and rewarding experience.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.840]   And the best thing that we can do,
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.160]   I think our objective is to always
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.000]   do something that really helps other people and helps users.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.760]   And if we're able to do that for a couple of people
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.520]   or for a billion, that's pretty rewarding.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.120]   Thank you, Dylan.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.680]   We appreciate your time.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.240]   Thank you.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.280]   Dylan Casey, who is on Google Plus.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.800]   Of course, you can follow him there.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.000]   He's a product manager at Google
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.080]   and responsible for the change in the Google toolbar
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.600]   on the top of all of Google's pages.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.960]   Thank you, Dylan.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.480]   Thank you.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.280]   Take care.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:00.800]   OK.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.360]   Very interesting.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.800]   It was great to have somebody from Google
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.840]   come in on a new product like that
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.160]   or a change on it like that on the news of the week.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.800]   So good on you, Google.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.800]   Besides Matt, we always love you.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.880]   Yeah, no, there are very few companies that would do that.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.280]   I think it's really great.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.440]   And face the music as it were.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.240]   Hope the music wasn't too tough.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.880]   And they've worked really hard.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.880]   It'll be really nice to have it be streamlined and consistent
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.000]   across a lot of these different properties.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.160]   I think the process is fascinating.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.400]   It's just really interesting to imagine
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.400]   reconceptualizing this.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.840]   And I respect Google.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.320]   Given this very difficult position,
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.200]   there's so many companies that would--
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.280]   this kind of iteration would not happen at this speed.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.560]   It just wouldn't happen.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.880]   I think Larry helps with that, I think.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.920]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:53.800]   And I'm sure it's a little bit of a roller coaster.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.240]   Do you get to rest now, Dylan, or what's your next project?
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.960]   No, we do not get to rest.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.200]   I make very clear--
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.400]   Did you hear that, Larry?
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.400]   He's not resting.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:06.920]   No, no.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.000]   I've been it.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.080]   We have a lot of things that we want to get out very quickly.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.160]   Part of the challenge around launching software at this scale
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.560]   is that you never get to get every feature that you want
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.320]   into the release.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.240]   Or that your users want.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.600]   Yeah, our users want to.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.480]   So we're already planning some pretty significant releases.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.960]   And we have a lot of work ahead of us.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.160]   So we might sleep a little over the weekend,
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.160]   and that's about it.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:39.920]   Thank you, Dylan.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.160]   We'll let you sleep now.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.440]   OK, take care.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.640]   Dylan Casey, we really appreciate you joining us.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.920]   Matt Cutts is also here.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.960]   And Matt's an early Google employee.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.720]   You were in the first 100?
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.760]   So you've watched this process over a decade, almost.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.960]   It's almost like punctuated equilibrium or evolution,
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.520]   where sometimes you'll be moving really, really fast.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.440]   And then sometimes you just really need to iterate
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.840]   and work on the polish and get the last little pixels
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.920]   where it's really smooth.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.360]   So there's always some growing pains.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.280]   People that want to move faster or some people
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.080]   that want to move slower.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.080]   But it is pretty wild to watch how the UI people can iterate
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.440]   really quickly when it's called for.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.520]   You may have a hard time talking about this,
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.000]   and you don't have to answer if you don't want to.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.080]   But it sounds like things have changed a lot
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.680]   with Larry at the helm.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.080]   You know, he brings a really nice level of focus.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.880]   Larry's been very clear about some of the stuff
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.800]   that he believes in and trying to make sure
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.200]   that we follow down the right path.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.760]   And there were a lot of stuff that we were developing
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.920]   where, at least at the Google scale,
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.800]   it wasn't getting as much traction,
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.160]   or it wasn't going to be as good of a match.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.440]   I love Google Health.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.760]   For example, I send my wife to three things,
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.520]   and my fifth--
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.000]   - Sad about that, yep.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   - Yep, yep.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.240]   But at the same time, you know,
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.640]   if you want to really focus on a small number of things
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.720]   and do them really, really well,
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.680]   then you have to make some tough decisions.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.120]   - You know what's kind of fascinating about that
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.720]   is you would think from a distance
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.200]   that Eric would have been the one to say,
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.160]   no, no, no, no, I stupidly stop that.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.160]   And Larry would have been the one to say,
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.480]   well, what I like this project,
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.200]   and it's really interesting to me that Larry,
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.840]   it's not just Eric, it's the triumvirant,
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.120]   but that Larry is bringing this laser focus.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.480]   And I find that fascinating that he, in fact,
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.520]   is proving to be a mature manager.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.640]   You don't have to say anything to that, Pat.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.360]   - No, I think it's really helpful
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.040]   because Larry's been in the room.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.120]   You know, he's gotten to see all the great stuff
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.320]   that Eric's done over the many years,
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.400]   and Eric has been a fantastic CEO.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.360]   And so that leaves Larry having seen all of the stuff
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.600]   that Eric has done, and yet also,
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.920]   he can bring his own, you know,
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.000]   particular way of doing things
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.480]   and the things that he really cares about
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.520]   and make sure that those get addressed.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.680]   - I think that it's a sign of maturity as well.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.440]   And they say that Steve Jobs
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.680]   and kind of mentored in some ways, Larry Page.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.760]   And that was one of the things Jobs was really good at
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.600]   as laser focus.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.600]   He came back to Apple and killed a lot of projects.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.840]   And I wonder if this is a sign of maturity on Larry's part.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.520]   As much as Larry would love how these hobby projects,
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.560]   the green initiatives, I know that that was something
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.120]   Larry and Sergey loved.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.080]   I'm sure Google Health, same thing.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.160]   There's a maturity in a manager who says,
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.160]   "You know, we love all this.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.360]   "Sometimes you have to kill your children
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.440]   "and focus on a few, a handful of good things."
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.600]   - From what I can tell Larry is the quintessential engineer
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.800]   or nerd and that, you know, inefficiency and waste,
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.200]   you know, is just so bothersome to him.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.800]   So I think, you know, for probably for him, I don't know,
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.760]   I'm just totally speculating.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.560]   But I imagine starting a small company like Google,
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.360]   having such success and growing so monstrously big
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.160]   and then coming to the helm,
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.480]   it's got to be really satisfying for him
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.400]   to say, "This is what we're gonna do,
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.160]   "and we're gonna trim all the fat and we're gonna focus
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.000]   "and we're gonna make this product better."
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.280]   It just, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.720]   I think it's great that he's doing it.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.120]   And I like the way that it's manifesting itself
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.280]   just in the little interface changes.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:04.000]   And I think that the fall clean out or the spring cleaning
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.320]   has also been really satisfying.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.720]   I mean, there have been a couple of products
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.960]   I've been a little sad about.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.120]   - Waves. - For the most part.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.320]   - Yeah. - Well, well, yeah.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.400]   We was another, that was another story.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.920]   But for the most part, they've been really,
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.280]   it seems like things are going really well.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.440]   So good for him.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.240]   - Yeah.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.000]   Well, and it's also very interesting.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.680]   But now we'll talk at a larger level.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:29.360]   Google, which had a disparate number of products
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.720]   that were all over the place.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.440]   There weren't really links together necessarily.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.520]   It looked like a company that had a lot of brilliant people
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.040]   all working somewhat in different directions,
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.640]   given full authority to do that.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.600]   And there has been a tightening of the reins,
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.200]   not merely killing products,
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.680]   but also attempting to create an ecosystem.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.000]   And that's the thing I think the toolbar
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.280]   is the most interesting part of the toolbar
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.480]   is it's a really, again, the analogy to Apple
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.520]   and the Apple control of the entire ecosystem.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.000]   It seems to me, for better or for worse,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Google has decided we're going to create a unified ecosystem
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.760]   and try to keep people in it.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.920]   And you almost have to do that when you look at Facebook,
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.680]   the competition, which is doing that.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.960]   - There's no danger there, Leo.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.960]   Go ahead.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.800]   - Go ahead.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.480]   - Well, I think we also acknowledge
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.920]   we come from the Open Web and we do best if the web does well.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.920]   Some of these conversations about SOPA and related things,
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.160]   it's important that the web do well.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.600]   And so things like data liberation,
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.800]   Android being open source, Chrome being open source.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.520]   I think in some sense,
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.640]   you don't want a completely closed ecosystem.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.440]   And I think Google knows that.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.200]   That would be nice to get the best of both worlds.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.240]   I would love to see that.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.360]   We were talking on the show before this,
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.880]   Steve gets talking about Mozilla's browser ID initiative.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:56.600]   And it's a single sign on, kind of like Open ID.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.960]   And while it's great to have a lot of different things,
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.840]   this is an example of you would like a single sign on
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.280]   for everybody, just let's all have one,
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.280]   let's figure out which one we want.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.280]   And sometimes the market's not the best choice.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.520]   I mean, Facebook Connect is winning in the marketplace,
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.800]   but it isn't the best choice for all of us.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.640]   And even if Google did something,
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.720]   there'd be some concern that,
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.880]   well, we don't want Google or Microsoft or Facebook
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.160]   to own this, it should be open.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.200]   And so it's nice if you can get the balance of,
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.000]   hey, we do need to create a product that is unified,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.240]   there's some consistent UI, for instance.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.240]   And still we can't keep it so there's not lock-in
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.160]   is the word I don't like.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.960]   And that's the Apple word, we want lock-in.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:30:01.960]   - Right, Leo and S
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.960]   - But there's a commitment to openness.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.520]   And I left sort of there's lots of debates
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.360]   about what that all means,
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.160]   but that's why I feel more comfortable signing in
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.920]   with my Google account than I do connecting my Facebook account.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.800]   There could be a little danger
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.720]   and the more unified Google becomes,
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.520]   the more Google's enemies say, see, they do everything.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.600]   And the argument has always been that
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.280]   there's an alternative for everything
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.720]   and every one of those things that Google does.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:24.800]   And I'm a little hypersensitive
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.480]   because I'm in Germany right now,
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.000]   where people tend to go a little-
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.560]   - It's the land of the sea.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.520]   (laughing)
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.360]   - Exactly.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.720]   - They're the ones waiting to pass.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.760]   I'll give you an example, Google's front page today,
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.320]   which by the way, I love the Tom Sawyer.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.960]   That is just awesome.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.120]   I guess it's what is it, Mark Twain's birthday or?
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.840]   Anyway.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.680]   - That's a 176.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.960]   - Wow.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.160]   But, and this is something that you'll get,
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.360]   I'm sure some pushback on right at the bottom
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.720]   and add and effect new Google Maps,
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.040]   Indoors, Interactive Start Ear,
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.320]   and Google's using the most popular front page on the web
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.840]   to promote a Google product.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.680]   I don't see a-
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.520]   - It's a cool Google product.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.840]   - Yeah, I don't see a problem with that.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.160]   - There's a zero problem.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.360]   - Yeah.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.360]   - How about Germany?
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.960]   - Well, the problem there is you can't win,
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.520]   Google can't win because it's anti,
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.520]   I'll be too strong and I'll get arrested tomorrow.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.320]   It's anti-capitalistic and anti-americ.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.880]   - It's anti-corporate.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.640]   - Yes, anti-corporate, better said Leo, better said.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.320]   And so to that extent, you can't win,
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.720]   you might as well just do what you're gonna do.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.160]   And if you try to,
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.680]   it's like the complaint I have with Google
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.840]   is trying to be nice to newspapers,
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.320]   you can't win, so don't cry.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.520]   They're never gonna let it.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:43.360]   - No, but I do think that it's a challenge for Google.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.800]   The more unified it becomes,
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.600]   the better the experience becomes,
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.320]   but the more monolithic it seems.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.360]   And so some variation in the voice,
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.960]   the visual voice of Google is not a bad thing.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.200]   - That's a good point, just to put people at ease.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.720]   - Yeah.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   - By the way, this is not the new Google front page.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.280]   (laughing)
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.800]   But it ought to be.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.960]   - Okay, that's a good one.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.040]   (laughing)
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.280]   - For those of you listening at home,
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.640]   you'll just have to imagine.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.480]   We're gonna take a break.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.320]   Matt Cutz is here, it's great to have Matt,
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.080]   Gina Trapani, and from Germany,
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.040]   and we've got him via audio, and you sound great.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.440]   I'm really glad we could do this, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.640]   Hey, yeah, whew.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:33.040]   We do not wanna lose our Jarvis fix for the week.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.200]   - I never won a NIST wig.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.960]   It's my favorite part of the week.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.480]   - And you're staying up late to do it.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.920]   So it went well, you're breaking up.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.320]   So let's say again what you were doing,
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:47.320]   you had dinner with ministers and big shots.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:53.000]   - I talked to a group today of basically
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.640]   from the conservative party about the internet,
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.440]   and freedom, and publicness, and all that.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.320]   And then I had dinner tonight with the liberal party,
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.880]   people, four members of parliament.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.720]   - Wow.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.320]   - Which is kind of a, that this strange American
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.400]   comes here and I get to do that.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.280]   But it was fun.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.640]   - Liberal and conservative in Germany
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.800]   don't mean the same thing they mean in the US, I'm sure.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.720]   - No, no, they all hate it.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.040]   (laughing)
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.240]   - Just joking, Josh, joking, much.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:20.000]   - We wanna take a break, come back, we'll talk more about,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.520]   I wanna talk about this Spotify announcement.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.480]   I think this is very interesting.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.480]   But before we do, let's talk a little bit about Ford.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.680]   Also a great interest of mine.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.040]   You know, I was never a car guy,
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.000]   but when I got that 2010 Ford Mustang,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.600]   I kind of fell in love with it.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.840]   It's a great car to drive.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.800]   I love the, you know, the PEP, the muscle car thing.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.880]   But it's funny because for all the muscle,
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:44.160]   all of the, you know, kind of toughness of the Mustang,
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.520]   I've got this great super high tech Ford Sync.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.480]   And you know, I've talked about it like crazy, I love it.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.720]   I mean, this is Siri two years ago,
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.880]   where you talk to the car, you say,
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.480]   what song you wanna hear, who you wanna call,
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.240]   you know, what temperature should be,
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.280]   where's the nearest gas station.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.320]   But I always forget, this is also GPS,
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.320]   and it's the best GPS you can get.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.600]   Now, if you have the sync, their sync will just talk to you,
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.880]   so you don't have the big console,
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.760]   it'll just tell you where to go.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.360]   But if you have sync with my Ford Touch,
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.880]   where you get the seven inch screen in the center console,
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.120]   two screens behind the steering wheel,
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.120]   the whole idea for all of this is,
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.800]   keep your hands on the wheel, your eyes on the road,
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.120]   your driving, safety is job one.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.800]   But you still get things like, you know, Pandora,
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.480]   Playa, my Rolling Stones station, by talking to the car.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.720]   And with the GPS, you know, one of the things
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:33.040]   that's kind of a little thing that bugs me about GPS
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.560]   is the points of interest databases, usually so bad,
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.120]   you always end up entering the address,
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.680]   and that means I have to look at it, it's just a pain.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.520]   They have now in the Ford Sync,
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.760]   with my Ford Touch 40 million businesses,
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.120]   they're all in there.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.240]   They've really enhanced the database,
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.200]   not just directions, but also phone numbers.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.840]   You press a button, make a call,
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:55.160]   buy business name to 40 million businesses in the US.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.640]   You can also, if you're on the desktop or your laptop,
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.600]   you can go to Google Maps, MapQuest,
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.960]   does anybody still use MapQuest?
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:06.200]   Google Maps, and you can say, send this address to my car.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:10.240]   And so you can plan an elaborate trip with lots of stops,
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.840]   you don't have to enter in on the car GPS,
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.840]   you just send it to the car from your computer.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.720]   There's little things like that
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.160]   that just make a huge difference,
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.520]   it connects you to the 21st century.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.200]   Great vehicles, the great EcoBoost engines,
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.560]   the hybrid engines, the electric vehicle,
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.280]   I think I'm crossing my fingers,
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.800]   I think Scott Monty at Ford just told me
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.600]   that he's gonna put me on the,
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.040]   or early influencers list for the electric focus,
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.680]   I cannot, I'm so excited.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:35.560]   If you wanna try this though,
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.640]   the 2012 Ford Focus, a great way to take a look
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.280]   at what they've done with Sync in my Ford Touch
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.640]   and all the great Ford technologies.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.840]   Drive one today at a Ford dealer near you,
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.600]   or go to Ford.com/technology,
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.040]   and you can see this great website
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.920]   where they've got all this great stuff
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.400]   that they've been working on.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.240]   Really a cool car company.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.400]   We're gonna see them at CES.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.960]   They have a big booth, they're gonna have the 2012 Focus
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.360]   there, we can show how that works and all that stuff.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.260]   Ford.com/technology.
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.880]   We're talking about this week in Google
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.840]   with Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.640]   and joining us, Matt Cutz,
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.280]   who I never really give you the right introduction,
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.640]   but I just figure everybody knows who Matt Cutz is.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.560]   He is the guy who keeps spam off your search results
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.400]   among other things.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.000]   - Yay! - Yay!
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.400]   He's fighting the good fight for all of us.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.440]   Were you involved with SOPA, the fight against SOPA at all?
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.640]   Just as a personal person who thinks it's a really bad idea.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.080]   - It was your blog post that brought it
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.760]   to my attention, frankly.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.160]   - Oh, good, okay. - Yeah.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.560]   And it was 'cause of you that I put
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.160]   the censored thing on my website.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.080]   Speaking of censoring, and this must drive you crazy,
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.600]   there's the SOPA thing in the IP Protect,
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.280]   we're censoring by modifying DNS, breaking DNS, in effect.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.280]   A US judge has just ordered hundreds of sites
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:56.340]   de-indexed from Google.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:01.200]   Does that drive you crazy when you get this kind of thing?
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.120]   - Yeah, I'll just speak for myself personally.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.800]   You're not speaking for Google.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.120]   - Yeah, but it does seem a little strange.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.440]   There was a write up by Eric Goldman,
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:15.240]   or on Eric Goldman's blog, and they were basically saying,
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.600]   how does this happen?
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.640]   Like, under what authority,
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.680]   what particular law is this taking place?
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.400]   And they also said it has to be removed
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.400]   from Facebook and Twitter.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.000]   So there's a German website.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.600]   It was like SOPA mode.ws.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:32.320]   And people are transferring.coms to GoDaddy.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.440]   And so this is a German registrar, German registrar domain.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.920]   It doesn't even exist in the United States.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.720]   And so if you're gonna mention it on Twitter,
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.680]   Twitter is forced to remove all mentions of it.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.560]   - Oh my God, that's kind of strange.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.320]   - Is this Nevada judge a knitwit?
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.680]   He's a federal judge in Nevada.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.520]   It was a luxury goods maker Chanel
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.480]   suing hundreds of websites trafficking
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.000]   and counterfeit luxury goods.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.640]   Now, I'm not for counterfeit luxury goods,
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.280]   but is it such a high priority
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.000]   that we not have counterfeit Chanel bags?
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.040]   And that-- - It's a problem with SOPA.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.240]   - It's the judge ordered, listen to this,
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:15.440]   the judge ordered all internet, this is quote from his order,
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:20.080]   all internet search engines and all social media websites.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.560]   And then explicitly said Facebook, Twitter, Google+,
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.000]   Bing, Yahoo and Google to de-index the domain names,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.160]   remove them from any search results.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:34.800]   And by the way, the investigation that was involved,
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.520]   Chanel hired a private investigator in Nevada
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:43.520]   to order from three of the 228 sites
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.600]   when the orders from three, not 228, from three,
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:51.200]   when the orders arrived, they were reviewed by a Chanel official
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.080]   and declared counterfeit.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.120]   The other 225 sites were seized based on a Chanel
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.240]   anti-counterfeiting specialist browsing the web.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.800]   They didn't even order a product.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:07.040]   And the judge, Kent Dawson, said that's it,
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.600]   we're gonna take the domain names,
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.200]   transfer them to GoDaddy.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.680]   - Toy. - Yeah.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.480]   - Where they'd all be read, thank you GoDaddy.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.640]   It's like this guy is like a nitwit
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.800]   of freaking idiot.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.600]   And he says they're all gonna redirect
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.320]   to a page serving notice of the seizure.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.880]   Is this due process, 228 sites,
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.860]   three of them were actual products ordered.
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:38.320]   This guy ought to be deep, this barred.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.400]   - It's the same problem with Soap-a-leo.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.200]   And the problem is, and the same problem I had
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.400]   in the discussion with the German politicians today,
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.160]   there's no discussion of the principles
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.240]   that underlie these decisions.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.200]   They sound okay in the moment, but in Soap-a or in this,
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:58.120]   if the government is in a position to blacklist sites
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.880]   for whatever reason, that's bad.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.440]   That's the violation of free speech.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.000]   - And really, there's no due process here.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.480]   I mean, this was a hearing in Nevada.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.080]   These guys didn't come to Nevada.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.960]   It's just Chanel, some guy, Chanel,
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.480]   and the private investigator.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.200]   Judge, judge, we're losing millions of dollars
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.840]   to fake Chanel bags.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.080]   Oh, no problem, let me just get rid of that.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:23.680]   - I mean, isn't this take down the sites enough?
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.360]   If the sites redirect to the seizure notice,
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.880]   then anyone who clicks on the links
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.920]   from Twitter, Facebook, Google+,
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.440]   will go to the seizure notice, right?
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.320]   I mean.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.160]   - Right, that's exactly right.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.360]   And in fact, if you control the domain name,
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.320]   which evidently now they do,
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.400]   you could put up no index meta tags
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.520]   or you could register it in Google Webmaster Central
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.360]   and remove it there.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.400]   And so there's no need to go to any of these other companies
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.000]   if you actually control the physical domain name.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.280]   And I have to say, it kind of reminds me a little bit
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.280]   of something we saw a few years ago.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.920]   Now I grew up in Kentucky,
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.760]   but a few years ago, the state of Kentucky
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.760]   decided that they didn't like poker websites.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.680]   And what they ended up doing was trying to seize
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.000]   like several high profile poker websites
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.920]   that weren't even based in the United States.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.360]   So, you know, full tilt or poker stars or whatever.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:16.200]   And simply because gambling in Kentucky,
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.760]   you know, that was not allowed.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.520]   And so the state of Kentucky said,
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.200]   we should be able to remove this content
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.280]   from across the entire web,
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.000]   just because we think it should be not allowed in Kentucky.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.440]   And that leads to a pretty bad decision,
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.400]   you know, pretty quickly where anybody could say,
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.200]   oh, this part of the web should be illegal,
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.680]   remove it from the entire web.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.400]   And that's pretty dangerous.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.880]   I don't even know how it worked because in your right,
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.680]   I'm looking at Eric Goldman's blog,
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.800]   but it's actually Venkat Balasubramani
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.600]   who's writing the blog post on this.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.600]   He says, how do there's no clear basis
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.040]   to authorize a transfer of a defendant's property,
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:58.040]   pending resolution of the lawsuit to the plaintiff?
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.880]   Which is what's effectively happened.
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:05.440]   It's this big bad internet thing, Leo.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.800]   What's ruining the game for everybody?
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.880]   - In my sense of this is this is the problem.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:15.440]   You've got an Nevada judge who doesn't understand technology,
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.200]   doesn't understand in any way the free speech issues,
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.400]   the search and seizure issues, the Fifth Amendment issue,
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.360]   doesn't understand any of this for some reason
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.320]   because it's the internet.
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.080]   So his judgment is clouded,
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.400]   it doesn't see it as property,
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.520]   it doesn't see it as requiring due process.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.520]   And unilaterally orders all of this stuff
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.600]   that is, I mean, I don't want to do it.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.120]   We don't, it's just, this is, who needs SOPA?
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.960]   If a judge can do this, you don't need SOPA.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.400]   - So who's the other side, who fights that, right?
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.240]   - Well, that's right.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.560]   It's not gonna be this handbag side.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.400]   - The other side of that particular fight
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.120]   is some stupid handbag, you know.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.640]   - And by the way, the handbag guy just opens
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.840]   another webpage.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.680]   - Right.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.760]   - He just opens on 43rd Street instead of 44th Street.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.040]   - It doesn't stop his business for more than a minute.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.720]   Nope.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.720]   It breaks the internet,
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.920]   so it's all sorts of terrible precedents.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.200]   And it doesn't stop him for a second.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.360]   - But you're right there, idiots.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.560]   The minister who spoke this morning before me in Germany,
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.440]   the conservative minister, he was asked
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.720]   whether he was online, and he said, yes, I'm on Facebook.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.520]   And I have a Google.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.000]   - I have a Google.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.840]   - I have a Google.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.400]   And everybody went nuts on Facebook,
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.080]   laughing at them, which they should laugh at them.
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.720]   But it really does indicate the kind of lack
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.680]   of basic understanding.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.400]   Well, because these guys have a lot of power,
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.240]   they are unafraid to wield it in the face
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.160]   of their stupidity and ignorance.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:42.760]   And they have no idea what they've done here.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.920]   And who is gonna fight against this, if we don't?
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.440]   'Cause it's the handbag guy, isn't it?
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:51.160]   - Right, but literally legally in this case, right?
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:54.400]   The other side is the pirate handbag guy
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.800]   from Nigeria or wherever.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.560]   - He isn't gonna go to the Supreme Court on this.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.480]   - So how do we fight something like this?
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.040]   I don't know.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.160]   Well, it means we're in a really untenable situation.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.920]   You don't need so, but you don't need IP protect.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.080]   You just need a moron judge.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:08.920]   - Yep.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.200]   - And there's lots of them.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:11.240]   - No offense.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:15.160]   - Yes offense, fully intended, fully intended,
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.420]   moron judge.
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:21.960]   Let me get, let me say, the moron judge's name
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.640]   one more time.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:28.080]   Judge Canton Dawson of Nevada, you're a moron.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.280]   You should take yourself off the bench
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.400]   and go get a job at the burger place down the street.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.920]   You're an idiot and you shouldn't be given
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.840]   this kind of power.
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.120]   Sorry, go ahead Gina.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.000]   - Does Twitter, Facebook and Google come back
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.360]   and say we're not gonna remove this content?
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:47.440]   - So, what did Google do?
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:51.080]   - So, I asked a little bit about this yesterday
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.800]   and as of yesterday, as far as I know,
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.520]   no one had actually sent us anything
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.600]   or sent us any information or any court orders
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.080]   or anything along those lines.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.160]   But it seems to me, and I'm not a lawyer
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.000]   and I'm only speaking for myself personally,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.560]   but it seems to me that if a court is going to say,
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.560]   Google you have to remove something,
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.080]   then Google should at least have the ability
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:12.440]   to address that, defend that, make a case
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.880]   rather than, if person A, sues person B,
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:16.920]   and then as a result of that,
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.800]   you get to tell Google or Facebook or Twitter what to do.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.080]   That's kind of strange if Google or Facebook or Twitter
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.440]   aren't allowed to at least make a case.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.880]   And as I understand it, that didn't happen here.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.920]   I don't know all the details, but that would be kind of strange
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.800]   to say, because of this lawsuit in which you're not involved,
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.000]   some other third party has to do something.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.600]   - Yeah, something that kind of undermines their business.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.400]   - Yeah. - Right?
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.120]   - Well, and no one wants counterfeit sites, right?
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.040]   No one wants pirate sites.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.680]   The whole argument is, for example,
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.200]   when the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, you know,
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.320]   - I see. - Yeah, when I seized
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:58.320]   like 80 or 130 domains, they had some false positives.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.960]   They seized, you know, a free DNS provider,
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.800]   which actually had thousands of sub-hosts.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.560]   And they seized the domain, which had been ruled legal in Spain.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.400]   - Right.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:11.080]   - And so, you know, certainly most of the seizures
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.560]   might end up getting counterfeit goods,
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.960]   and that's great for everybody.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.080]   But if there's gonna be collateral damage and false positives,
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.360]   you want that to be subject to some sort of scrutiny
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.500]   or due process.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.920]   - Hmm, I guess I'll never go to Nevada now.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.680]   (laughing)
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.200]   - Wait, we're going for CES.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.160]   - Good, come get me, Kent Dawson.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:35.320]   I'll be staying at the Hilton January six through 10th.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:40.400]   - It's a showdown at the Leo Croul.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.280]   - Correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.480]   but I don't believe I could be sued
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.320]   for calling somebody a moron or a Nimrod.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.520]   - That's opinion. - I'll just Nimrod
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.840]   law in the background. - It's an opinion.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.480]   (laughing)
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.680]   - 'Cause Nevada all bets are off.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:56.840]   Obviously, this guy thinks he's got, he's God.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.040]   In that case, Devorak couldn't go to any state in America.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.680]   (laughing)
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.080]   - Yeah.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:06.520]   - Good, well, Devorak believes everyone's a moron,
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.320]   so it's okay. - Exactly.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.160]   - It's okay.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.200]   What do you think, Matt Cutz,
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.880]   of this open source search engine?
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.120]   - I love that people are trying different ideas.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:20.240]   You really want competition.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.200]   You want people to try things like here to here.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.640]   Danny Sullivan made a good point
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:27.080]   that there was a distributed crawler search engine
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.840]   called Grub from 2003.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:30.320]   - Oh, I don't remember that, yeah.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:33.320]   - Yeah, and I think it got bought eventually,
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.840]   but there's two basic ways people measure search engines.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.760]   One is to search for your name.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.720]   You'll search for Leo LeBord or Matt Cutz.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.080]   And I actually tried this with this search engine yesterday,
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.040]   and there were no results for Matt Cutz.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.440]   The other way is to look for porn.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.280]   - It's not a good sign.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.920]   (laughing)
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:51.520]   - The other way is to look for porn, and there was porn.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.400]   - It's very good at that, probably.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.320]   - Yeah.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.000]   They do say this is just a demo,
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.040]   limited functionality.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.760]   It's not the, how do you pronounce this?
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.920]   Yassie?
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:00.760]   - Yassie.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.560]   - Yassie, search portal.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.000]   So you have to install this on your computer
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.400]   'cause it is peer to peer.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:08.200]   You suddenly are beginning to,
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.040]   you're gonna be supporting this.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:13.640]   By, you'll be a crawler, I guess, on your--
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.240]   - This is like BitTorrent or that search
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.400]   for extraterrestrial life thing, right?
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.160]   Your computer does the indexing.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.200]   - And it's never heard of Leo LeBord either.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.880]   - By the way, lots of German on this page, Jeff.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.000]   - Ah, I can be loving it.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:28.840]   - Yeah.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.600]   But you can virtually guarantee that the spammers
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.600]   are already installing their nodes
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.640]   and trying to get their pages indexed.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.120]   - This is a very, you're the right guy to ask this about.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.320]   - Yes.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.680]   - Interesting.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.040]   - And there was someone saying,
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.240]   well, there's no one person reporting
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.800]   who will rank number one.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.960]   We all get to decide together.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:52.480]   And the problem is, if you have a majority of spammers
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.680]   who hop into their, well, then you'll get spammed.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:58.040]   - They're gonna be more aggressive than we ever would be.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.920]   - Matt, I imagine you in a James Bond movie
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.880]   where you always know what the bad guys are doing.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:08.200]   - If you've seen enough bad guys,
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.480]   you can start to predict a little bit.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:14.480]   I did wear my eating spam shirt, you know, so--
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.240]   - Wow, I like that.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.040]   - That's why I imagine this moment where you say,
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.760]   ah, at last we meet Mr. Bond.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.440]   (laughing)
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:28.320]   No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to pull your spam off.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.680]   Stay into it.
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:31.800]   - So you guys did a great video.
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.600]   This has been Gomez, a Google fellow.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.520]   The history of search, I don't have the whole,
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.840]   I don't have the six minutes to play this.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:42.360]   But this history of search in six minutes,
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.560]   and this is a video everybody should take a look at
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.160]   if you get a chance, 'cause just great stuff.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.000]   Great stuff.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.600]   By the way, thank you, Chattram.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.720]   They have given me a number of new ways
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:56.720]   to address this judge.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:01.960]   Airhead, bird brain, block head, bone head,
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.920]   bubble head, chutter head, chuckle head,
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:08.240]   clawed pole, clawed clunk, cretin, cuddy,
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:10.320]   and we get down to the bottom, twit!
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.040]   (laughing)
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:18.440]   Anyway, I just, I'm sorry, I went off.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.120]   Look at this, look at this, oh, I gotta show you this.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.640]   The original Google page.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:25.160]   - Oh, I have never seen that one.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.760]   - Look at that. - That's horrendous.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.040]   (laughing)
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.480]   - There is a picture somewhere that I was on Google Plus
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.920]   of the original staff, and they had that logo,
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.360]   that super color logo hanging above.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.800]   Are you in that picture, Matt?
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.640]   - It's about 50.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.720]   - 50.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:40.880]   - Probably not, yeah, it's really early.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:44.840]   They actually, the logo had an exclamation point.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.600]   At one point, it got rid of it.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.960]   - Yeah, 'cause Yahoo already dibs to the exclamation mark.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.400]   - But do you know what our very first holiday logo was?
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.240]   - No.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.760]   - The first Google Doodle.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.760]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.720]   - It was a burning man.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:02.600]   - Wow, that shows you how far we've come.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.640]   Wow.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:10.400]   Very cool, so this is a really fun history of Google.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.960]   Thing to go through, there's Marissa.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.320]   That's cool, that's cool.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.520]   She's got some sort of Google trumpet binder.
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.440]   (laughing)
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.960]   Google cheerleader, Horne Binder.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.240]   Anyway, well worth seeing.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:27.680]   I won't show it because it's just too long,
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.520]   but you can find it at Search Engine Land.
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.760]   That's where we saw the original post.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.480]   Let's, I wanna talk about Spotify in just a bit.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.120]   We also have to get tips and so forth.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.760]   Got a great cast, great people, Gina Trapani,
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:42.320]   Jeff Jarvis, the lovely Matt Cutz.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.960]   It was always fun to have on.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:48.320]   Reminder Joe, just briefly, that we are brought to you today,
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.200]   as always, by our friends at Netflix
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.600]   and a great holiday gift.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.320]   Do you have that Roku?
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.760]   John, is that around?
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.760]   We were looking at the new Roku.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:01.080]   It's so teensy, weensy, tiny.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.040]   Did you get one too, Liz?
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:03.880]   Liz Lemon?
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.760]   This is the new Roku too.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.840]   It is so tiny.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:10.680]   Do you think I need it?
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:11.520]   - You.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.400]   - Oh, I can't open it.
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:13.240]   Oh, I can open it.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.560]   I'll open it.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.160]   I don't mind if I open it.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.200]   John won't mind if I open it.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.680]   Look at this.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.840]   It's so teensy, weensy.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.160]   It weighs the thing as light as a feather.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.680]   You put this on your TV, you put the HDMI in there.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.640]   It's got Wi-Fi, but you can connect your ethernet.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:31.640]   And now, suddenly, you've got 10, 20, 100,000 movies available
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:34.960]   through Netflix.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.360]   If you've got a PlayStation 3,
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.080]   you don't even need this Xbox 360, your computer,
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.200]   your iPad, your iPhone, your Android phone,
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.800]   all the Android tablets now.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.560]   Netflix is everywhere you wanna watch.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.880]   And it just streams in and it's fantastic.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.080]   I want you to try it free.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:51.560]   If you just go to Netflix.com/twit,
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:52.920]   this is the page you'll see.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:53.840]   You can start your trial,
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.640]   you need an email and a password, that's it.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.400]   And see if you like it.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.560]   If you do 799 a month, if you're not already a member,
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.960]   now, if you're already a member,
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.960]   and I know everybody who's watching this show is, of course,
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:09.760]   do me a favor, tell a family member,
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.880]   tell a friend, let them know what's out there.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.360]   And you know what would be great.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.400]   This would be a great gift,
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:21.400]   given this Roku X2XS and a subscription to Netflix.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:26.080]   Wouldn't that be a great gift for the holidays?
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:29.080]   Netflix.com/twit, try it today.
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:33.800]   We did not cover the Spotify announcement today
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.360]   because we just, I was thinking,
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:36.600]   what could they possibly announce
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.520]   that would be a huge story?
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.600]   I don't know if it's a huge story,
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.360]   but they've announced a platform.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.200]   And I find that very interesting.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.240]   Even as Spotify apps,
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.920]   developers can build apps.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:49.920]   In fact, I got the new,
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:54.520]   you have to get the Spotify beta for the Spotify client,
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.000]   but this is the beta.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.320]   And you go to the app finder
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:58.560]   and there's a few apps here now,
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.040]   but there's one that I really like,
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:02.760]   which I turned on immediately, called TuneWickie.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.120]   So when you're listening to a song,
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.320]   here we'll put a song on.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:09.360]   We'll play Candy Says by the Velvet Underground.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.080]   - I wasn't getting audio earlier, but...
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:12.920]   - It's probably turned down,
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.520]   but watch is, and that's fine.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:18.640]   We don't need the audio because it's TuneWickie's great
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.360]   'cause it's a wiki for lyrics
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:23.560]   and it's in sync with the song as it plays.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:24.920]   You can read the lyrics.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.200]   Isn't that cool?
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.920]   And if there's an error, you can edit it.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:29.840]   So this is an app.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.120]   I mean, we're not talking angry birds.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.400]   We're talking things that are,
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.760]   Last FM song kick, which is kind of cool.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.040]   If you're listening to somebody,
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.760]   it'll tell you where they're playing
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.880]   if they have a concert coming up.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.440]   So that's kind of cool.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.600]   This is artists in my library who are gonna be touring.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:51.240]   Let's show you some of the other ones.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.560]   So what do you think of this, Billboard Top Charts?
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.800]   And I think they've, it's my understanding,
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.520]   they've announced an API so that people can incorporate
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:03.800]   Spotify into their stuff, which is kind of interesting.
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.000]   Makes you want a Spotify account, doesn't it?
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.240]   I think this is smart.
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:10.800]   - Do you have to have a paid account,
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:12.120]   or does this, you can also--
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.120]   - Good question. - Absolutely.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:16.480]   - I have a paid account, so I don't know.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:20.800]   Does somebody in the chat room, have they tried this for,
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.840]   you could, works for free, works for free.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:24.720]   - Yeah, it does work for free.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:25.800]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.200]   - And, but as a developer, you can't charge for your apps.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.280]   All the apps are free.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.160]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.760]   I guess that would be right, huh?
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.240]   - Yeah, it's not very interesting for developers.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.080]   (laughs)
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.200]   - No money to be made.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.160]   But if you're the guardian who has an app,
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.080]   so when I'm listening to a song,
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:44.600]   I can see if there's a review from guardian critics on here.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.400]   - Right, that makes a lot of sense, right?
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:49.920]   - Yeah, yeah, this is just another way to channel people in.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.920]   Interesting.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:55.480]   Okay, I thought I mentioned it.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:59.000]   It's not attracting a lot of attention, so moving on.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.160]   (laughs)
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.160]   - I think we're all saying that--
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.720]   - I listened to three boring--
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:03.560]   - A platform.
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.600]   - Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:08.480]   - The only thing to talk podcasts like these
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:09.640]   instead of music, you see.
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.160]   - Yeah, so this is no help for you.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.440]   - I don't listen to music anymore
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.920]   because your voice is music to my ears.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:17.040]   - Thank you.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.400]   - You know, I just realized this.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:19.480]   I should ask Dylan about it.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:23.560]   They're gonna have to redo the Google Plus commercial, right?
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:26.120]   Isn't the toolbar, isn't the black toolbar part of it?
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.800]   Maybe not, let's see.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.360]   - Oh, just a little bit in that one shot.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:35.360]   - Yeah, I thought this was not a great commercial.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.800]   Matt, you should tell your people.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.800]   Leo did not, so I tell you why,
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.640]   because it may circling look so much more complicated
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.200]   than it really is.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:47.520]   It was like, what, you do what?
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.720]   And then I hoot in the,
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.680]   but we talked about this last week, I think.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.820]   We do like some of the circles that show up on this.
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:59.120]   Wasn't it epic bros, that's the one we like.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.280]   - I think Matt dropped out as soon as you said,
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:02.360]   I don't like this commercial.
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.120]   (laughs)
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:04.960]   See, he's gone.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.040]   (laughs)
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:07.880]   - He's gone, he's gone.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.680]   - I knew there'd be a consequence to being so outspoken.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.200]   - Yeah, I was gonna personally hassle Matt
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.520]   about the epic bros thing.
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.840]   (laughs)
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:15.680]   I don't know if he heard the question.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:17.160]   - Matt is an epic bro.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:18.640]   I do think this is a,
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:21.160]   it was a good idea to demonstrate hangouts,
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.200]   'cause that's kind of something
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.680]   that might be intimidating to people a little bit.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:24.520]   - Yeah, probably the best part.
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.200]   - They're trying to push hangouts more.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.280]   People aren't using hangouts nearly enough for their taste.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.800]   And I think you can promote.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.760]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.520]   I think hangouts are great.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.120]   - They are, but how often do you use them?
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:36.960]   - I know you use them.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.040]   - I was like, "Have you hung out?"
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.360]   - Yeah.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:42.680]   - I would admit that I have not used it as much as I thought
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:47.120]   that I would, but I've had younger friends say that they've lost,
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:49.120]   you know, someone said to me,
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.600]   I lost my entire summer hanging out on Google+.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:52.440]   - Really?
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.360]   - I would do all night.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:54.600]   So I don't know if it's an age thing.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.920]   I don't know if I'm just like an old lady
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:58.760]   and I'm not as social, but--
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.480]   - Some people really dig it.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.880]   I mean, there's people like,
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:05.160]   what's the name of the musician?
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:08.040]   The woman who has been using it to great effect.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:10.000]   Some people really love it.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.320]   There's a new Google+ ad that's a love story,
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.640]   which I think a little bit better.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.520]   They're a little more emotional.
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:17.680]   - This one is better.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.040]   - Yeah.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.520]   - So you're not getting any audio from me?
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.240]   - No, I know it's not me on my--
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.400]   - Okay, let me look and see if I'm doing something wrong.
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:26.600]   Can you play the commercial?
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.440]   - Yes, I can.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.960]   - Well, you have a link.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:29.800]   - Oh.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.880]   - I don't have a link to that one, but I'll play it.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:31.720]   - Yeah.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:37.840]   Let me just pause for a station fixing.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.840]   I have a new computer and then we haven't used it before on here.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.960]   It says I'm sending you sound.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:46.360]   - I have it turned up, sorry.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.280]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.280]   - Going on.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:54.960]   That must just be something with that cable.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.360]   They put a link in the chat room.
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:57.720]   - So I'm on--
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:58.640]   - Oh, sorry, not that one.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.440]   - Go ahead, Matt.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.680]   - No, that was my video.
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:02.520]   Sorry.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:04.160]   - I sounded just like Matt Cuts.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.240]   - I know.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.160]   - How you doing, Matt?
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:07.680]   How's everything going for you?
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:10.080]   - I can't complain, you know?
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:11.920]   Epic bros, little prony.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:12.760]   - Absolutely.
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:14.440]   - So, Gina, go ahead.
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:16.560]   - No, no, I'm not going to hold that responsible
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.880]   for the Epic bros.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:20.080]   They just make a commercial, come on.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:24.400]   I can't do that, and that's a nice engineer.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.240]   It's good.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.080]   - It's true.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.000]   You can't blame him.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.200]   - I won't ask him.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:29.200]   I won't ask him about that.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.520]   - No, you can't blame him for that.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:32.320]   - It's cutesy, it's cutesy.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.640]   And some people like it,
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:36.920]   and then some people at Rubsy,
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:37.880]   the wrong way a little bit.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:41.320]   And, hey, it's just an ad.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.720]   - Yeah.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:43.720]   - It's not your fault.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:46.440]   - You know why the ads have been so good up to now?
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:47.600]   They've been so emotional,
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:50.080]   and you go, God, I love that ad.
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:52.040]   And this was the first one out of a bunch,
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:53.920]   so it's not bad.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:55.800]   - That's a really good video.
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.560]   The most emotional ad in a sense
[00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.840]   should be Google+ 'cause it's the most time to your life.
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.160]   - And you're right, it's not as emotional
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.600]   as they've made even search.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.720]   - They've divided.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.960]   - I love those search ads.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:07.800]   I thought they were great.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.640]   - Yeah.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.880]   - There was a search ad where it was like someone falling
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.920]   in love and searching for first aid,
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.280]   and how to speak French,
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:16.160]   and how to get married, that kind of thing.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.360]   And then there was the one where the father was writing
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:21.760]   Gmail messages to his daughter, the dear Sophie ad.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:22.680]   That was really good.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.320]   - Loved those.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.280]   - And, you know, so I was excited to see the Google+ ad
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.840]   go on during Glee last night,
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.120]   'cause it was like, you know, several of my favorite things
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.440]   happening all at once.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.040]   - If only they'd been Chipotle somewhere in there.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:35.880]   - Right, exactly.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:36.720]   There'd been a burrito.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.720]   (laughing)
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.920]   And, you know, I like the message of the Google+ ad,
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:43.760]   which is like, here's how to share as a grownup.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.240]   You know, there's a part where he says,
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.200]   you know, you know, as a kid, you just go out at recess,
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.480]   and just everybody was there,
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.680]   but now I've got these different, you know,
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.280]   which is the message of circles.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.560]   It just was a little slow.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.120]   Like the music is slow,
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.560]   and the screenshots are so tight that it's not,
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.360]   I mean, it's not supposed to be a screencast,
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.240]   but it's so close in that you're not really sure
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.640]   what's going on, but I, you know, overall,
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.600]   I mean, it was heartening for me to see,
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.760]   it didn't surprise me to see Google advertising.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.640]   - I love it that they're advertising Google+, yeah.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.480]   - Yeah, because it makes sense now,
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.760]   'cause Google+ really ties together
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.480]   a lot of the services in a lot of ways now.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.040]   - It does feel a little bit like Google's
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.200]   struggling with Google+,
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:24.680]   like they're, it's so close to getting traction.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:29.040]   - Well, and what's strange to me is it really feels like
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.640]   if you watch the team, they're moving very, very quickly.
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.160]   Like the things that you complained about
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.000]   when it first launched. - That's right.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.240]   - Of all been solved. - For things like
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:38.560]   the spam comments or the duplicates, you know,
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:41.280]   things like that, and that's changed quickly enough
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.360]   that I found myself doing a few like things
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.360]   that I've been meaning to blog about forever.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.680]   Like don't be evil versus do no evil.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.520]   I'm just like, you know what,
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.280]   I'm just gonna throw this up as a Google+ post,
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.560]   'cause it's easier than writing a blog.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:57.040]   I think the people like it, and I would include all four of us
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.320]   who use Google+ and get it, love it.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:05.320]   It's getting that critical mass jump,
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.080]   which I think you're this close to,
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.360]   and I think the ads might help.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.320]   You're this close to getting it to the mass market.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.600]   - But you know what else?
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.360]   There's a positive feedback loop to problem here
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.040]   because I got busy, and so I've been posting
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:21.520]   to Google+ less, and there's no, my notifications,
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.440]   I get two, and it's so lonely.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.520]   - Oh.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.960]   - And it's the problem of, you know,
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.360]   you come in as a new user and you see,
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.480]   you hear crickets, or you start using it less
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.200]   for a little bit of time, you get less feedback.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.880]   It's a real need for positive feedback loop,
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.960]   and if you don't have that, you know,
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.000]   I fear you could fall off the wagon.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.760]   - That's kind of true, absolutely,
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.640]   and so if you see some of this stuff,
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.200]   like what's hot on Google+,
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.640]   which is a little thing that sort of gives you
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.000]   a few people you might wanna follow
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.200]   and shows you some interesting things.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.600]   - I do like that. - I think that kind of,
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.880]   which is cool, yes. - Which is cool, yes.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:58.000]   And now my parents are on Google+,
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.240]   like for a while, my mom used a Google Apps account,
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.360]   so she couldn't get on, but that's been solved now.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.640]   Got my dad on, and so we're actually starting
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.360]   to share photos and things, so, you know,
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.600]   it might take a little bit of time,
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.120]   but it's nice to see the base functionality
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.280]   is there now. - Yeah.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.200]   - Okay, sorry for the door. - Is your dad your bro?
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.760]   (laughing)
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.080]   All right, I think we have, I think--
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.280]   - Is this the ad here?
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.880]   This is the new one, right?
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.320]   Let's see. - This is how you teach
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.400]   your grand to use a Chromebook.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.320]   - Grandma, Grandma. - Oh no, this is Chrome.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.680]   Sorry, I thought you sent this to you.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.560]   - Wait a minute, though, I'm liking this.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.120]   - That's cool. - Yeah, it's cool.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:34.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.320]   - Turn the music down, grand,
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.600]   it's four o'clock in the morning.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.240]   (laughing)
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.320]   - That's a good curve.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.800]   - So I posted that in the internal doc,
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.600]   just because I wanted to say,
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.880]   hey, Google's getting a little bit better about advertising.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.800]   - I always get some of the Chrome OS.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.200]   There's actually a whole line of like,
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:55.080]   how do you upgrade your laptop,
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.720]   with Google with Chrome OS and stuff.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:59.240]   So we're starting to see a little more clever advertising,
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.080]   which is kind of nice.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.520]   And there's a lot on Google+,
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.760]   but the Chrome OS stuff is pretty good too.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.720]   - Okay, now I have your ad, sorry guys.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.280]   - Wait, don't mind, this is fun.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:10.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:16.520]   - Love of my life, he just dragged Lisa
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.840]   to the love of my life circle.
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:22.880]   Now Lisa has just dragged Kyle to her creeper circle.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:27.800]   Oh no, wait a minute, wrong circle.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.840]   Book club circle, nah, no I don't think so.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.640]   Let's put Kyle somewhere he really belongs.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.280]   Guys with cars.
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.680]   - That was a little bit more.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.000]   - A little bit more.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.880]   - Skihouse?
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.840]   James dragging poor Kyle's head around.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.240]   - He's getting upgraded.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.640]   - Maybe, well he's, there's two maybe's, there's only two.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.120]   Take him out of maybe's and put him into...
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.000]   Cheaper's off.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.800]   The right people in just the right place.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.040]   That was cute.
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:00.880]   - It was cute.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.080]   - So it wasn't immediately clear to me
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:05.120]   that she was being upgraded over time,
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.320]   but I get it now, yeah.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.520]   - There's a cute book club and then the ski house
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.280]   and then anything can happen Leo.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.160]   - Started as a creep, ended up the love of my life.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.320]   (laughing)
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.720]   There's hope for me yet.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.960]   (laughing)
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:24.360]   - Boy, it would be nice if you were so successful
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.680]   that you actually had a competition
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.920]   to get tickets to your developers event.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.440]   (laughing)
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:36.440]   Holy cow, Google I/O coming up was originally April 24th
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.000]   and 25th.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.640]   Remember last year they sold out
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.040]   within a minute or something.
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.560]   They've rescheduled it now June 27th through 29th.
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.440]   This is the developers conference.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.680]   And apparently the announcement on the Google code blog
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:53.320]   says that we might have a test,
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.560]   a coding competition
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.440]   when the application process opens in February
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.600]   to test general programming skills
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:03.560]   as opposed to product specific knowledge.
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.360]   We're designing it so every developer is given a fair shot
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.520]   at attending Google I/O,
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.760]   but don't expect it to be involved as last year's
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.240]   last call for Google I/O.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.920]   I love this idea.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:13.760]   - I love this idea too.
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.320]   - It's a-- - I love that the blog post was like,
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:17.520]   "Don't make your travel arrangements just yet."
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.360]   (laughing)
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.520]   - You may not have a ticket.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.360]   How good are you?
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.200]   - So great.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.160]   - Do you have any insight into this?
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:26.920]   Should I study my Python mat?
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.720]   What's, I don't have any special insight,
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.760]   but yeah, I'm gonna start brushing up on my const
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.280]   and dynamic classes.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.400]   (laughing)
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.680]   I'm getting my GWT book in the mail.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.120]   Wouldn't that, that's just great, I love it.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.000]   It's Studio 54 for geeks.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.880]   - Yeah, there's instead of a red rope,
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:47.200]   you've got the code bar.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.680]   - When I fail the test, I'm gonna be trying for a press pass.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.520]   (laughing)
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.280]   - What if they test press?
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:57.520]   - I think press should be tested.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.840]   (laughing)
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.520]   - Got the press, no, nothing.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.960]   Spelling test.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.560]   (laughing)
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.040]   We actually do that to get into journalism school.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.240]   - Really?
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.440]   - Yeah, we get the test.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.920]   - What's the test?
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.560]   - Per an events and basic editing and style.
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.480]   - I am a fan of meritocracy.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.200]   I don't think meritocracy is a bad thing,
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.920]   and I think it's a,
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.120]   I mean, Google's the ultimate meritocracy, right?
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.960]   It's hard to get a job, well, it wasn't when you started,
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.960]   but it's hard to get a job.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.800]   (laughing)
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.040]   - No, Matt, that has said that himself.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.840]   - I could never make it through the front door now, never.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.800]   - Which shows you that maybe it shouldn't be too hard,
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:38.640]   'cause if you got a great guy like Matt,
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.360]   and he couldn't get through the tests,
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.680]   maybe he shouldn't make it so hard.
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.040]   Think of all the Matt cuts out there
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.440]   who don't have jobs at Google.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.120]   I remember Colleen going through
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.720]   hundreds of interviews, it seemed like.
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.160]   Hundreds.
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:55.760]   YouTube big month for the first time ever.
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:00.760]   They got 20 billion video views in one month.
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.200]   Half of all videos watched in the US,
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.520]   according to ComScore, were on Google's sites.
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.640]   Pretty impressive.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.720]   - This is insane.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.840]   Google YouTube also had the highest engagement,
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.720]   users averaged more than seven hours of video
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.120]   during the month.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.880]   - Incredible, isn't it?
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:24.960]   - It's just a matter of time before TV and YouTube flip.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:28.560]   - Yep. - Definitely, it's true.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.240]   - It's close.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.800]   Seven hours, probably TV is like seven hours a night,
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:33.640]   though, unfortunately.
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:34.480]   - Yeah, I think it is.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:37.640]   - You gotta beef it up a little bit.
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.000]   - Well, was there a proposal?
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   - Lots of potential.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:40.840]   - That's potential.
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.280]   - There's purposeful viewing and there's background viewing.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.200]   - And most TV viewing is just noise in the background.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.360]   I've watched so many people.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:51.560]   It's just the TV's on and it's on all day.
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.560]   Nobody sits down on a couch and watches TV for seven hours.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.800]   Your butt would get numb.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.320]   - Regis and Kelly.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.160]   - They didn't?
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.560]   - We do like watching Kelly.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.160]   - Oh, I love Kelly.
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.640]   - Kelly is wonderful, isn't she?
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:08.160]   - They asked me to go be on the show next two weeks.
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.440]   But I've just gotten back from France,
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.680]   so I said no.
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.040]   - Oh, I got to start the rumor here, Leo.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.120]   Is your going to replace Regis?
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.000]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.280]   I know, you know, I was just talking with somebody
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:21.000]   who's a big fan of the show about who they should get.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.720]   And we went through a lot of candidates.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.600]   You know, Michael Bublé will be the guest host
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.600]   when I would have been there.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.920]   But I think they're going to get somebody like Matthew Broderick.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.160]   It's got to be somebody who lives in New York.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.920]   Somebody who doesn't work in much.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.240]   (laughs)
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.200]   But she has to be seen now.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.240]   Why are we talking about this?
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.560]   I'm sorry. - I don't know.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.640]   (laughs)
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.480]   - Basically-- - We've won the cloud angle.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:45.240]   Kelly, cloud is the literative.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:49.640]   - Basically, this is the journalist test that Leo passed.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.600]   Give him a subject, he'll talk about it for 10 minutes.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.000]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.520]   (laughs)
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.720]   I could vamp for 10 minutes.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.600]   So all things D did a funny little retrospective.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.600]   - This is a good piece.
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.960]   (laughs)
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.200]   - This is a really good piece.
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.480]   - The great Liz Gaines, I love Liz Gaines.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.400]   Oh, this is nice.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.240]   Look at this.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.200]   Now Wall Street Journal and Rupert Murdoch
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.920]   have been banging on people for cookies, right?
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.600]   - Oh, the privacy violation, privacy violation.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.600]   The first time I've ever gone on things D on this computer
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.600]   and I'm getting a big yellow thing.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.720]   - Some of the advertisers in Web Analytics firms use
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.520]   on this site may place tracking cookies in your computer.
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.600]   We're telling you about them right up front.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.000]   (laughs)
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.840]   - And the Wall Street Journal was the one came on.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.160]   The person who has to write about privacy stuff
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.240]   had to write the story that said basically
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.040]   that Wall Street Journal is now tying your personally
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.360]   identifiable information to your browsing history
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.080]   and you can't do anything about it.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:49.400]   Meanwhile, the New York Times editorialized
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:53.160]   in favor of Do Not Track and I went on and did a blog post
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:55.680]   about all the ways in which they insist to use cookies
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:58.240]   and if you don't use cookies, you may not use
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.080]   the New York Times.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:10:59.920]   - Right.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:00.760]   - But anyway, Leo, you were saying.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.160]   (laughs)
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.760]   - The hypocrisy.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.480]   So meanwhile, maybe we should make this
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.720]   the apologies of Rupert Murdoch,
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.360]   but it's the apologies of Zuckerberg,
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:11.840]   or retrospective of the 25 posts
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.200]   Zuck has posted on the corporate blog in the last five years,
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.560]   10 were written to address complaints.
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.840]   (laughs)
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.760]   And so Liz, who is hysterical,
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.640]   has got a bunch of them together.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:26.400]   Here's one she calls a real gem from 2006.
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.440]   This was his first company blog post.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.120]   It was a pre-apology.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:34.960]   Warning users of upcoming changes they might not like.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.360]   When we've made changes in the past,
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.400]   a lot of people have gotten upset
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.960]   and he emailed us asking to change the site back,
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.000]   change can be disorienting,
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.560]   but we do it because we're sure it makes the site better.
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.000]   So calm down.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.560]   You actually wrote calm down, breathe, we hear you.
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.560]   I'm sure the Dylan was--
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.400]   - It was quite a patronizing.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.400]   - Really.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.320]   It's okay.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.640]   It's gonna be okay.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:56.800]   But you know, I have to say,
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.800]   when you make a big change like the Google toolbar,
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:02.160]   you know you're gonna get probably tens of thousands
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:03.080]   of complaints.
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.720]   - Google's gonna get serious blowback.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.120]   - Yeah, but that's just the reality
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.880]   of like making a popular web product.
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:08.720]   - You can't change.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:09.560]   - Anything.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.400]   - Yeah.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.760]   - You know, redesigns at Life Hacker, we're a nightmare,
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:16.320]   but it's just that people react to change badly initially.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.560]   - Right, right.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.640]   And I'll defend Zuck to this extent
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:24.120]   that he does back off, but he just throws things out there
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.040]   and then really listens to his public.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:29.640]   The argument is he listens too late.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.960]   He doesn't do his abated.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.480]   He does it as a product release
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.920]   and that puts him in a less good PR position.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.160]   But you know, what are you gonna do?
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.400]   Throw stuff out there, see how it sticks.
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:42.600]   - Right, he doesn't ask for permission.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.040]   He asks for forgiveness, right?
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.240]   - Exactly, and I don't think that's a bad strategy.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.080]   - No, I don't either.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:48.920]   - He's that strategy either.
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.880]   - And then, but you, the viewers,
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.960]   it listens at home and all of us have to decide,
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.200]   well, do we wanna play in this game?
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.800]   Unfortunately, it's hard not to play in Facebook's game.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.640]   You can't, for instance, have a Spotify account
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.280]   if you don't have a Facebook account.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.960]   They've made it very difficult not to play
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.160]   and that's what really frustrates me.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.760]   It's not like you have a choice.
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:10.600]   - But you can now do a turntable
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.720]   if you have a Twitter account.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.040]   You don't have to use Facebook anymore.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.960]   - Turntable.fm.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.200]   Hallelujah, thank you, they listened.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:21.000]   Can we make it on OpenID or browser ID
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.720]   or something that we don't have to have an account?
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.560]   - That'd be nice.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.680]   - Yeah. - It would be nice.
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:31.000]   - If OpenID was easier for people to understand,
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.200]   but yeah, I agree, I agree.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.320]   - We do that, yeah, I agree.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.280]   We all agree.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.320]   Let's take a break.
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.320]   Let's not take a break.
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.200]   Let's go right to Gina's tip.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.480]   We have a tip from Matt.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.720]   Thank you, Matt Cuts.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:46.360]   And Jeff's number of the week.
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.840]   And if there's time, I'll do a tool.
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.480]   Let's start with you, Gina.
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:52.920]   - Oh, actually, you know, so this was a story that we passed,
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:53.960]   but I think it's a really cool story.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:55.080]   So I'll just make it my tip.
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:55.920]   - Good.
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:59.400]   - Google Maps, and I believe this is just for Android
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.880]   right now or it's on the web as well.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.480]   Now, indexes indoors of public space.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.680]   - Isn't that wild?
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.000]   - It's so crazy.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.920]   So like malls and airports and that kind of thing,
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.840]   you can, and I actually, I just watched the demo video.
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:11.760]   I haven't actually tried it yet.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:15.440]   I'm not sure if it's rolled out just yet,
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.880]   but so you can see where shops are and bathrooms and exits
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.560]   and in public places.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.720]   And you can move up and down floors.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.320]   That was the bit that just blew my mind.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:25.440]   It's like, what's on the fourth floor
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.920]   of the Manhattan mall, that kind of thing?
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.520]   So really, really cool.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:32.800]   - Now, just to lay aside any privacy concerns,
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.800]   I know Germany just going crazy right now.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:40.480]   They go to the mall or the businesses and they say,
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.800]   hey, the O'Hare Airport, they say,
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.160]   can you let us map the inside?
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:51.160]   And so it's not like they don't have a street view key.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.720]   I actually, somebody made it,
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.240]   I don't know if it was a joker for this series,
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.720]   a little street view thing on wheels
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.240]   that you could go into the shops.
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:00.080]   - That would be cool.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:00.900]   - That would be cool.
[01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:02.400]   - And show me where my car keys are.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.600]   (laughing)
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.800]   - Yeah, these are public spaces.
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:06.880]   These are big public spaces.
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:10.120]   - And with the cooperation of the big public space.
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.080]   - Right, so when you're in some airport,
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.560]   you've never been in and you need to find the Chipotle,
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.040]   this would be a help.
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.240]   - Right now, it's only 25 spots.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:20.560]   San Francisco International, O'Hare,
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.480]   Macy's, Bloomingdale's, but I would hope
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.320]   they would do more of these.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.000]   I think this is a great idea.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.320]   - And I was saying actually, Tim O'Reilly
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.160]   did a piece on Google+, actually saying
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.440]   that this is kind of an interesting,
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.160]   you know, like Google generally doesn't build products
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.880]   for revenue streams, but this has a lot of revenue
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:34.720]   potential.
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.720]   - Yeah, oh yeah.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:39.920]   - You could show a special inside that store.
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:40.840]   - Right, right.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.440]   But I mean, it's also useful.
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.000]   (laughing)
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   And this was, this was my real tip was gonna be,
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.800]   or my secondary tip, I had to get that story in,
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.640]   so I thought that was interesting.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.480]   - That's good.
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.160]   - Goog calendar, there's a new labs.
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.760]   This is nice.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.080]   If you go into goog calendar settings, go to labs,
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:02.480]   there's a hide morning and night option now.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:05.240]   So I use goog calendar constantly in the web interface,
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.520]   and I'm always like scrolling through the middle of the night.
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:09.640]   I never schedule anything, you know, I'm a night owl,
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.760]   but I still don't schedule meetings between,
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:14.360]   you know, midnight and 4 a.m.
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.680]   So if you enable this labs feature,
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:20.240]   you can collapse late, you know, middle of the night times.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.320]   So you get more screen mail estate,
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.640]   and you don't have to scroll through that time
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.120]   when you're probably not scheduling meetings.
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.200]   So yeah, it was a cool little goog calendar tip.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.040]   - Perfect.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.360]   - Now I want that on my Android phone,
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.240]   because I'm constantly scrolling through.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.080]   - Yes.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:39.000]   - Now Matt's gonna show us how to explore the tool belt.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.200]   - Yeah, so, you know, we talked a little bit about
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.160]   the Google bar, which is up in the top left,
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.920]   and how it's got a drop down menu.
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:48.320]   But you might not have explored the tool belt,
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:51.120]   which is if you do a search like Republican debate,
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.240]   and you look over on the left-hand side,
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.840]   there's all kinds of really useful tools.
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.800]   - So imagine, what if you wanted videos?
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.160]   If you clicked on the videos tab,
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.240]   you might get the Fox News Google debate,
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.040]   which was, you know, 113 minutes,
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.280]   but the number of two result might be from Saturday Night Live.
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.040]   Well, there's all these great little things.
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.880]   If you click on long under any duration,
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.600]   then you'll only get the long videos.
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.120]   - 20 minutes plus, that's neat.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:15.960]   - Yeah.
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:19.320]   And so it's just this fun thing where even on images mode,
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:20.840]   you can click on images,
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.880]   and you can look for things with a dominant color.
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.080]   You can look for large and small sizes.
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.840]   You can click to see faces and photos.
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:30.040]   So if you haven't done those sorts of things
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:32.600]   where you can kind of do a little bit of exploring
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.800]   and see what great tools are hidden under the tool belt,
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.240]   even on the main web search,
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.720]   you can slice and dice by date range.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.960]   So you can say, show me the Republican debates,
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:45.840]   but show me web pages from 2002 to 2006.
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:48.000]   So just lots of ways to slice and dice
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.720]   are just sitting right there, a few pixels over,
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.200]   if you just wanna take a little bit of time
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.080]   to explore on the tool belt.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:56.680]   - It's funny because I think we're creatures of habit.
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:58.680]   So we look at the search, we do a search,
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.400]   we look at the top result, we go there,
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.560]   we never, it must drive you crazy
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.600]   'cause this tool belt is fantastic.
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:07.280]   And I bet you most people, it's nice if it doesn't exist.
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.920]   They just go, I got it, and they go.
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:10.960]   And it really is very, very, very useful,
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.400]   especially in the image search.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.720]   You can really narrow it down.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:17.560]   - Yeah, we like to joke that if we could spend five minutes
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.400]   with each searcher, we could really make them
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.320]   much more efficient, but no one wants to take
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.960]   five minutes to learn how to search better.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.360]   - And this is why speed is so important.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.000]   Click, click, click, and I'm there.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.680]   - And you do that very well, but yeah,
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.640]   I'm glad we could mention that 'cause you're absolutely right.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.760]   I use it, I guess probably it was you
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:35.920]   who raised my awareness, but certainly during the show,
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:39.080]   and I use it a lot now to narrow down results.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.160]   Thank you, Matt Cutz.
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.720]   - Jeff Jarvis, you're a number of the week.
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.640]   - The number of the week is two,
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.440]   which is the number of days it took Kansas Governor
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.560]   and former Senator Brownback to back off
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.000]   trying to muscle an 18 year old girl named Emma Sullivan
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.880]   into apologizing for a negative tweet on him.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:01.920]   And she, God bless her, refused to do it.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:02.760]   - Good, right on.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.360]   - And he learned a lesson about the first
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:06.680]   freaking amendment.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:10.000]   - Taught it by an 18 year old high school student
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.880]   who had a lot of guts.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.520]   Good on you, Emma Sullivan.
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:16.880]   - God bless her, and it shows how,
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:20.400]   we'll make it into a cloud by a big stretch here.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:23.040]   But the cloud made her powerful.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:25.560]   The cloud brought her the support of Twitter
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.800]   and made her say, F-U-GOV.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.880]   - Yep, she said he sucked.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.120]   (laughing)
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.440]   - #Hastag.
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.360]   It's like #Hastag.
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:38.480]   - #Hastag was pound, he blows a lot.
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.880]   (laughing)
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.160]   - Suck blow, you know.
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.480]   I just, I love that.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:47.720]   But I also think that Sam Brownback wins the Weasel
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:50.200]   of the award of the year because his apology
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.000]   said my staff overreacted.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:53.840]   - Yeah.
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.000]   - Yeah.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:55.840]   - Yes.
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:56.800]   Well, that's like, you know,
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:58.360]   that piece about Zuckerberg's apology is that
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.520]   he never really apologized.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:01.080]   He never says that he did anything wrong.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.040]   He's sorry that you perceived it.
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:03.880]   - Yes.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.520]   It's your perception.
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.600]   - You're sorry about your perception.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:10.120]   - Yes, sorry you didn't think I was wonderful.
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.880]   - Lessons in how to do this one.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.720]   - Great apology is always because I'm sorry if.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:15.560]   - Yeah.
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.120]   - I'm sorry you feel that way.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.360]   (laughing)
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:24.480]   - They actually, his office contacted school administrators.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.320]   - Oh yeah?
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.160]   - I mean, they really.
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.160]   - You really, they were trying to pressure her
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.480]   and she and her family, good for her family,
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.160]   her sister became her press spokesman.
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.000]   - Good.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.200]   - And they pushed back and God bless them for doing so.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:39.480]   This is the future of politics, you dorks.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.320]   - Just horrible.
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.920]   Then the school district backpedaled too.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:45.240]   - Was I staaththong.
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:49.520]   - Well, you see social media where someone was saying,
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:54.040]   Mitt Romney took a flight up from Florida to somewhere
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:57.280]   and whoever he was sitting next to wrote a blog post
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.160]   about how he wasn't very friendly on the plane.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.880]   (laughing)
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.600]   It's sort of like you're always on the record
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.200]   with social media that is.
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:05.160]   - Yeah, it's true.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.960]   Well, you know what this story is, she said,
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.440]   I posted this tweet to my friends.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.680]   I had a few different, I had a few dozen followers
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:12.840]   of my friends and I posted this tweet,
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.280]   it was kind of this in joke that we had
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.440]   because I saw that a reporter asked her
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.560]   if you were having a face-to-face conversation
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.960]   and the governor is just the language
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:22.040]   that you would have used and she said no,
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.320]   but I wasn't talking to him.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:24.640]   - I was talking to my friends.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:25.520]   - I was talking to my friends
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.560]   and his staff just happened to hear it,
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:30.240]   which is interesting if you think about it.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:32.640]   - Yeah, well that's something, maybe a lesson for her
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.760]   is that Twitter is public.
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:36.640]   - Right, well right.
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.000]   Yeah, so there's a few different,
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.560]   there's a few layers of issues here.
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.920]   - But you know what, she has the right to say that,
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.000]   just like I have the right to call that Nevada judge
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.320]   a Nimrod.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.160]   (laughing)
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.000]   What is he Leo?
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.440]   - He's a moron, he's a twit.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.040]   - What is he Leo?
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.080]   - Don't egg me on.
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.340]   (laughing)
[01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:58.760]   My tool of the week is actually,
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.120]   maybe I might have to backpedal.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.760]   Let me ask you, Matt cuts to you have a--
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.560]   - Is the tool perhaps a Nevada judge?
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:05.320]   - Yes, he's a tool of the week.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.400]   (laughing)
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:07.240]   There you go.
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.080]   - There you go.
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:08.920]   - I like it.
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.080]   Our tool of the week.
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:11.960]   But I wanted to ask Matt,
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:15.120]   do you have the Galaxy Nexus in your hands there?
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:17.760]   So I've been testing ice cream sandwich
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:20.640]   on an XSS because they need bug reports on that.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.640]   And so that works very nicely,
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:23.880]   looking forward to that rolling out.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.640]   But I super am excited about trying to get
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:28.120]   the Galaxy Nexus out.
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:31.840]   - When will we see ice cream sandwich on older phones?
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:35.920]   - Well, I mean, they have released the source code
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:36.760]   in this one.
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:37.880]   - Yeah, it's up to the carriers, right?
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:38.880]   - Manufacturers.
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:39.720]   - Yeah.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.560]   - I think cyanogen, there's already at least CM9.
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.520]   So people are starting to get that out there,
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:46.120]   but I think it won't be too long
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.000]   before it's released for the next season.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.120]   I don't know the timeline, but.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:49.960]   - Good.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:52.960]   Well, I have a Galaxy S2, which I love.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.360]   I love, but I don't know if that's, you know,
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.360]   that's gotta get Samsung and Sprint to do it
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:57.520]   and I'm blah, blah, blah.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.560]   So that's why I went to Expansis,
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.360]   which is a British website,
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:06.360]   and ordered my unlocked GSM, Galaxy Nexus.
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.000]   They're back ordered.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   (laughing)
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.160]   - Actually, now I see now it says in stock shipping today.
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.760]   So I was hoping I would get it by today.
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:15.080]   I hope I now will hope I'll get it
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.880]   by the time I leave,
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:19.560]   'cause I just, I want this badly.
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:22.200]   This will not be 4G compatible.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.440]   It will not be of a rise in front.
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.960]   I'll have to put it on T-Mobile.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:25.800]   - Right.
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:26.640]   - But that's okay. - When are you going
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:27.480]   to Paris, then?
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:30.400]   - Leaving Monday, so I won't be here next week.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.520]   Who's doing the show next week?
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:32.360]   - Tom, Tom, Tom.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:34.480]   - Tom Aaron will be here next week.
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.120]   And you know what?
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:38.120]   I'm gonna say hi to that Sarkozy fella,
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:38.960]   just for you, Jeff.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:39.800]   - Yeah.
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:40.640]   - Yeah.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:41.640]   - So.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:42.960]   - Is you the president?
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.480]   - Is you the president?
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:47.720]   - Monami Jeff Jarvis says,
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:49.080]   you blows a lot.
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.340]   (laughing)
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:54.160]   - In a hashtag.
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.000]   - #gulashtag.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.920]   - I know, I'm not so sure about the First Amendment in France.
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.760]   I'll be careful when I get there.
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:23:59.760]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.440]   Thank you, Gina Trappani.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:03.200]   And thank you, Matt Cutts, for being here.

[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:09.400]   Also, Dylan Casey of Google,
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.880]   who, it's not sure it's a little gutsy to come on the show
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.040]   and defend something new.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:13.880]   - You're great.
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:15.080]   - You're great.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.360]   And we really appreciate him doing that.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.720]   I will not be here next week,
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.680]   but Tom Merritt, will we do the show Wednesdays

[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.200]   - And good for you, Matt.
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:09.240]   - Yeah, for his movember.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:11.000]   And finally, I can get this off me.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:11.840]   (laughing)
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.560]   - Got that, it's really scary.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:15.880]   - You got 10 hours.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.520]   - I'm glad I lost the video 'cause you were freaking out.
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:20.800]   - No, I like it, I like it.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.640]   - Why is that?
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:22.480]   - I don't know.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.320]   - You know, his man, who meant true.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:27.400]   - His Skype image, he's bald.
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:29.200]   So it just goes all over.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.560]   - Yeah, it's just, you never know what you're gonna get.
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.800]   - I love your wife, Matt.
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:32.840]   - Yeah, she's a patient.
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:34.280]   - You're a man.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.560]   - I lose a lot of pets, but she's very patient.
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:37.760]   (laughing)
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.920]   Thanks for being here, everybody.
