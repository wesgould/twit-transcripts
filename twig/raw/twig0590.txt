[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.040]   Time for twig this week in Google the show we cover the latest
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.200]   From whatever the hell we want to talk about it Stacey a compotums back. We missed just Daisy. Thanks for coming back
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.280]   We appreciate it. I thought I thought I might have covid, but I did not so really were you that ill?
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.520]   No, no, I just had random like intermittent fevers. Oh, that doesn't sound good
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.360]   I'm tired. I hadn't I had an ear infection so very random
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.800]   You know when you get sick after you've quarantined like crazy in your own mouth you think how did that how could possibly happen?
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.960]   And flu disease it is way down because of this
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.640]   Yeah, fine mine. I I
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.200]   Think it's cuz I showering or doing too much in my trying to stay too clean
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.360]   You know I'm exiting and then I put my then I got an ear infection. That's the bottom line
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.120]   Well, here's the good news FDA today approved the first over-the-counter
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.720]   Home test for covid-19 at last at last it's an antigen test, which means you can do it in 10 minutes
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.000]   Just a little nose swab the only negative is you can get it
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.560]   You'll be able to get a pharmacy to get it online the only well, there's two negatives one. It's $30
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.960]   Because it'd be great if they were like if we're a little more affordable
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.200]   I put a stack of them out front at the studio and before you come in you test
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.080]   And you and you have to wait 10 minutes and if you're okay, you come in
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.120]   That's one negative is a price the other negative is they they say they can only make about a hundred thousand a month
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.920]   So it's not exactly gonna be they actually a hundred thousand a day Australian
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.400]   Manufacturers says it's gonna have three million tests next month, but they will be ramping up which means maybe price and availability
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.720]   Will become better?
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.320]   So this is good news. This is that this is the rapid test that dr. Minnet at Harvard has been begging
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.080]   for for some time
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.200]   Now I read about it and I was a little confused because it said if we have a negative on that test
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.720]   you could trust it
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.960]   No, I didn't think you could trust it. Oh
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.560]   If you're sick and you still have a negative then you can't trust it
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.680]   But if you're healthy and you have a negative you're probably fine it delivers a small percentage of false positive and false negative results
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.160]   Okay, people who get a negative result but have symptoms should follow up with a health professional
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.640]   Because maybe you do have it after all, but it's about 95% effective the point being
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.200]   It's effective enough to reduce the R not
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.600]   It doesn't have to be perfect, right? And but it has to be available and fast
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.760]   so
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.200]   Thank you Stacy. I'm glad you're feeling better
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.800]   Also with it. I'm sorry that was so much. Yeah, we digress. You got a long intro boy. Oh boy. Oh wait
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.000]   The whole freaking

[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.040]   Newmark graduate school of journalism at the City University of New York

[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.800]   How are you?
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.640]   Well, I'm sad and I'm disappointed and I'm a little bit angry right now because you didn't get the Donald Trump
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:26.200]   commemorative coin that I got is that why you're sad you just jealous that's another reason to be sad
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.840]   You bought two. I thought you said one of them is gonna be mine. It's not that's not I decided I needed this
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.800]   That's not yeah, well
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.520]   It's it's a self-defense measure. I'm gonna carry it my pocket if I'm attacked by a proud boy
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.040]   I just whip it out say challenge coin you owe me a beer
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.880]   Clever, eh?
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.700]   Yeah, why are you sad Jeff? I put one of my favorite stories ever and at the very top of the rundown
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.860]   Now is at the very bottom of the run. Oh, I moved it
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.200]   You did I figured you did I moved it because it isn't a top of the show story
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.200]   Oh, I thought it was
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.880]   Yeah, in fact the other reason I moved it is because it was a pick of the week yesterday a metric weekly
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.400]   Oh, all right. I'll but I will I will you know, I'm gonna make the first story in the day

[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.820]   So you can do you can make your own which is a little bit of it ago. It's even more fun
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:32.260]   Oh, that is fun. Okay, I see it. Yeah, but it's not to take it off take it off. Christmas. They don't do it. Do it. Do your own

[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:55.480]   Story that flab up. Yeah, this is a Google experiment from arts and culture dot Google dot com
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.820]   So yes, it has to do with Google the blob
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:05.420]   And you can get them to do it all at once. I don't forget how to do that you turn them all on or I can't I do it first
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:14.860]   Then if you move up it changes up changes pitch sideways changes the vowel
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.820]   And then they harmonize I
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:23.540]   Will say this is better than a musical
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.380]   hahahaha
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.620]   Ready
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:40.820]   This is supposedly is an AI thing I have no idea what relationship this has to a eye
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.460]   We do have a new twig scene now
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:52.240]   Why are their eyes swirling because they're blobs I'm doing that
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.400]   Hey
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:02.960]   Okay, that is not our new twig theme nor is the theme we played last week our new twig theme
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.760]   Oh, cuz nobody likes it. Oh man did they hate it? I
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.480]   Thought you guys
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.080]   We're great. I thought you guys hated the little wimpy flute theme
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.440]   Well, this is your way to make us love it and well, I guess so as it turned out
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:25.200]   I actually did a poll on the twig community and I said I will consider myself bound by this poll
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:31.280]   So whatever you and I got a lot of like the electoral the electoral college of just like the electoral college
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:37.760]   Exactly of themes. Let me log in real quickly. I have to do my two facts. They're funny
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.920]   I'll show we'll get them we'll get the real-time vote results and then I hate change
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.440]   Yeah, I knew that I said that even before I did it. I said Lisa
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:53.120]   I'd never I didn't remember hearing it. I fell asleep in the first five seconds of the damn thing Jesus the drums
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.320]   You thought the drums are getting that far. I was asleep all it was was drums
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.440]   All right, well, it was the old
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.080]   Triangulation theme and I thought well, we're not using that anymore
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:12.080]   So we'll recycle it what could be the harm in that well? I found out people did not like it play both
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.080]   We should play both for the audience first before you give us the results. Oh, you want to hear them both?
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.320]   Oh, that's complicated. We should play for the audience. So they know
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.880]   how to do that
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:27.040]   Can you find an old Triangulation? I guess I can just play it off of a youtube clip. Yeah, you're right
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.160]   I'll just play it off the website. All right, so before well, this might take a little editing
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:38.960]   Slice the way commercials are in there. Yeah, okay, so here
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.840]   Uh, without further ado, let me play this is last two weeks ago
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:50.560]   It's time for twig this week in google salesforce buy slack for a lot of money the top tick tock
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:56.560]   Videos of the year and why do you like that right? It's a little flute suddenly I do given the choice. Yeah
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.280]   This is what I tried last week
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:06.640]   It's time for twig this week in google stacey has the week off matthew engrams in from the columbia journalism review
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:12.720]   Joining jeff javus and of course ant pruit. I have in my hands a hundred you you don't like that
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.480]   You're making you making you I like that fine. I thought that was
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:25.280]   Me too fine me too. So oh, but fine. Let's say say you're a wife. You know fine is a very bad word. It's fine
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.920]   No, I think I think it's fine fine
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:33.280]   It's fine is not a bad word fine implies that this is okay. We can handle it
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.560]   So I decided not for you after getting many many emails
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.000]   People actually had an opinion about this. That's what's amazing
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.960]   Well, the really the really funny thing is that then there were a bunch of competing polls
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.880]   so
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.160]   so
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.080]   My poll got 13 votes
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:04.080]   Oh, well, then let's show the results bring back the flutes 54 keep the drums 31 percent what theme
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.640]   15 percent
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.000]   and then
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.840]   Somebody else had a much more elaborate poll who's a tab?
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.920]   I love it make it the theme of all the shows. I like it. Please don't change it. I don't care
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.240]   I don't like it. Please change it soon. He got 20 votes
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.480]   And well, but I don't I'm curious
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:31.760]   Now this is from may so this is the one that says don't change it from may I get it
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.680]   Oh, I see. So this is the flutes. So really the people have it
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.960]   the people have all
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.960]   All we're bringing
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.120]   We're gonna do the drums of facebook by the federal trade commission
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:50.800]   46 state attorneys general do and warm and washington dc. It's not a theme tucks. It's
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.680]   Twiddling your thumbs on a table
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.960]   Okay, okay
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.680]   The people have spoken that the flutes the flutey flutes are back
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.680]   Does it know I want the blobs now. I want the blobs. We could I can make a theme of the book
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.560]   I've often thought I should just fire up technology
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.680]   Yeah, exactly fire up garage band and do the whole thing
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:22.720]   Uh, so uh facebook we're off to an unlosey start. Well, no, we're getting back to it
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.200]   facebook
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:31.360]   bought full page ads today in the New York Times the wall street journal and the washing and post
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.960]   We're standing up to apple for small businesses everywhere
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:44.880]   Come on really for small businesses you're doing this for small businesses apple as you may know has changed
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:51.600]   How ios works? They've added something they compared to nutrition labels for food privacy labels
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.080]   And furthermore, they've surfaced a switch. This is the real
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:04.080]   Thing uh, the turns gives right when you install an app and first run it gives you the opportunity to turn off the id
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:10.800]   For apple advertisers and this was always available to you in ios, but it was buried deep within the settings
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.360]   facebook says
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.480]   Many in the small business community have shared concerns about apples forced software update
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:24.800]   Which will limit businesses ability to run personalized ads and reach their consumers effectively
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.840]   um
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.480]   Okay, you think
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.880]   Speak up. They made a page
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:40.000]   Speak up for small business small businesses deserve to be heard apple's latest update threatens personalized ads
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.760]   I thought they were just protecting privacy, but no, they're actually putting people out of business
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:55.040]   Man, man. Where do you stand? I think it's a good thing. I think everybody these things should be exposed
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:00.080]   Facebook should be making its case to end users saying please let us spy on you
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:09.040]   And let them make the decision as opposed to putting ads trying to get apple to change its defaults jeff you wanted to defend personalized ads
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.800]   Do i try again?
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.720]   Well, i'll tell you one thing there's very little evidence of personalized ads to actually work
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.080]   So I think i'm going to call foul on this
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:35.440]   Oh, we're just trying to survive. It's going to put us out of business. That's much ado about nothing
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.280]   Uh advertisers have always wanted more information
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:46.880]   They beg us for more information, but ultimately they survived just fine. Otherwise the super bowl wouldn't be able to sell
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.600]   Multi-million dollar 30 second ads that they all they know is a lot of people
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.560]   Pounds of what the product is and depends on whether you have that much money
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.120]   It's also a matter of efficiency and efficacy
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:04.080]   And and it varies greatly so it knows targeting in many cases does work depends on the case
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:08.000]   Does it really they're advertising bugwise or you don't need to target right?
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.720]   Whoa, that's what i was going to ask what evidence you have this that proves that
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:18.400]   Realization does not work and if it's not working why isn't it working?
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.440]   Is it because of what you have is happening behind the scenes?
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.160]   Well, first of all, I don't think we have to prove that it does not work
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.920]   I think you have to prove that it does work because you're invading my privacy in order to do it. Oh, it's not your privacy
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.120]   Yes, you are privacy. It's not you don't think facebook invades my privacy
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.680]   No, well, I mean i choose not to use it
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.920]   But even if you don't use it facebook still collects as much information about use you can
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.480]   In these so-called shadow dasies
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.840]   So I and I would say that it's really incumbent on facebook to prove that it works
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.920]   Because in order to but but I but I think we can say
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.560]   um
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.160]   That the problem with personalized ads probably isn't
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.040]   The personalization if it worked really well
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:09.200]   Maybe it would work the problem is that most of these systems just look at the tv shows
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.000]   Netflix recommends for you or the or the purchases amazon recommends for you
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.720]   These recommendation engines are notoriously awful
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:22.960]   Uh, I I will fall into the 1% though regarding those services
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.040]   Uh, I'm not a facebook user, but I use instagram facebook property
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.680]   Which is highly customized right and the ads that are presented to me are
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:39.200]   Really good. I have to admit that they present things to me that would make me stop scrolling and say hey
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   What exactly is this?
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.320]   Even though some of the ads that come through are
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:50.480]   Pretty bad products, but they are photography related. They are content creation related, you know
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:56.880]   They they figured it out and same goes for Netflix the recommendations that I get in its newsletter
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.280]   Once a month as well as what shows up on the screen when I turn on the television
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.360]   They're pretty spot on
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.600]   Well, then I guess the also the second question is to advertisers really need that
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.640]   That jeff makes the case that it's more efficient
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:17.680]   Um, yeah, because simply put especially on facebook if I have to go to every woman
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:23.680]   To sell this one product versus women who blank and blank and blank. I can go to fewer people
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.200]   And it's not about the targeting working in terms of hypnotizing you
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.680]   It's the targeting working and not wasting your money to go and people who have absolutely zero interest
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.440]   And what that does is give you greater relevance for the ads that are there
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.000]   That to me is a service. No the relevant ad might also be obnoxious and horrible
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.280]   That's a different issue
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.400]   But just to not give me ads that I couldn't possibly give it to him
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.760]   Don't don't advertise diapers to me. It wastes my eye space. No, right stop. I don't need them anymore
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.560]   Well, I will soon but oh my god. That sounds so entitled
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.120]   Oh, I don't want to see this because it's not possibly something that's useful for me
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.280]   I mean
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.880]   You're giving up your privacy. You're giving up all of this data
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.320]   So you won't be inconvenienced by diaper ads
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.720]   Is that what I mean?
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.560]   I'm giving up privacy to reveal that I'm a grown man and and listen
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.200]   In the day so fine. I would have bought esquire and it wouldn't have had diaper ads
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.760]   You know, that's how it worked there. You targeted by twit
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:29.520]   But first get ads targeted tech enthusiasts speaks. Yeah, I don't think that's a bad model
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.240]   Well, so here's an interesting thing though
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.320]   Some of these
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.120]   And this doesn't really bother me, but it is kind of funny
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.520]   Some of these in this is where they're not very accurate
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.480]   They use my love of tech for example for the longest time
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.600]   They've used my searches and information to to assume I'm a man
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.800]   So I get less of irrelevant ads because their personalization isn't great
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.440]   This does again doesn't bother me, but it does kind of tie into this doesn't really work
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.480]   Yeah, that's so that's my initial contention is
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.520]   That the recommendation engines they're using don't they don't work very well
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.840]   They're they make all sorts of dumb assumptions
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.760]   And and we all know that because we've seen the recommendations amazon producers stuff like that
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.520]   If it really worked you think amazon would recommend products that you really wanted
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.680]   Now I have to grant you aunt instagram does a fine job
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.560]   In fact, you know you're wild. I know I know so so
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:31.200]   Maybe we should stipulate that done properly done properly. That's a different target of that might work
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.400]   Yeah, you know another thing that I think about it a little more
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.280]   Regarding the recommendation engine for instagram versus say in Netflix
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:44.560]   I I know I feed Netflix with that thumbs up thing pretty regularly
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:51.760]   I don't do that so much on instagram, but i'm assuming instagram does a better job to what I scroll and stop on exactly
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.600]   you know, so
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.600]   I you know, I
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:02.960]   Delete my instagram account for a long time created a new one within literally a few weeks of using this new account and immediately
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.960]   Start suggesting stuff to me that I could barely resist buying
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:14.160]   So it clearly it's possible that it works. Maybe facebook's got it. I do reject
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:20.800]   Entirely facebook's premise that apple should not be telling people that they can disable this
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.840]   Because it's going to hurt our business
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:31.120]   That is I call b. Yes on apple should absolutely be telling people and do you not agree? Jeff people should have the right to say
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.600]   Don't track me
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.160]   Yeah, but I also think that
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.520]   That's like saying you have the right to see the New York times without ads
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.640]   Well, no the New York times has the right to say this is my business and
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.680]   You then the no, but that's a step. I don't think it's that farther saying
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:53.280]   Yeah, it's the same kind of thing. I you set the terms of the you want this free
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.560]   Well, I don't use facebook. I can set the terms if you get it for free. Yeah, I agree
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.920]   And you don't want it then don't use it, but those are my terms. Yeah, I yeah, okay. That's why I don't use it
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.000]   um
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.720]   And I don't use it with ad blockers. I mean I know I could use ad blockers and
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:12.400]   But I don't want to give them the information. It's not the ads. I'm bothered by it's the it's the information that they're sucking up
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.360]   They're who bring up that I don't like I just don't want to support their business model. Yeah, exactly
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.680]   Yeah, that's why that's exactly right. Well, their business model is media's business model
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.280]   That's the funny thing about it
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:28.800]   media created the attention-based business model and the mass media business model and the problem with the internet today is
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.080]   That they're copied the old model rather than creating new models
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.520]   And where I think we're the dying embers
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.880]   Of the old model before they figure out that it's not gonna work much more
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.160]   So that's why I'm not so concerned
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:45.520]   I think the ad model as we've known it is gonna disappear because you're irritated with it because it's not gonna work
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   Because you can avoid it right
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.920]   So deep while agree that facebook is the doomsday machine
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.560]   Oh, that's just you can imagine
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:00.640]   My blood pressure and I saw that and from somebody and a publication I respect I respect andrian le france I respect
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:09.360]   Uh the Atlantic, but jesus a better textbook example of moral panic. You cannot imagine well, then I won't ask you to summarize your point
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:14.320]   Um, but I think maybe you'd be I gave up on it like I gave up on our on our one week theme
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.240]   Yeah, it didn't let even last as long as that probably
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:24.800]   Uh, he's she says
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.680]   Limitations to the do she's talking she starts off really kind of dramatically
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.880]   Uh, yeah, that's cool. That's kind of moral panic saying remember when
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.480]   Uh, it was the the notion of mutually assured destruction was what kept us from a nuclear war
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:46.240]   And at one point scientists even thought maybe what we should build is an automated doomsday machine
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.440]   That should a nuclear war happened will just take it the rest of the way and destroy the planet
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:58.560]   That way everybody involved would know any attempt to start a nuclear war will guarantee the destruction of the planet
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.880]   That will keep us safe
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:06.800]   This fortunately nobody ever built although adrian does say that the soviet's did
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.120]   But I don't know I don't know maybe it didn't work. That's all I can think
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:16.880]   Uh, this if there's a doomsday machine sitting somewhere under the siberian ice now i'm a little nervous
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.600]   Anyway, she says limitations to the doomsday machine comparisons are obvious facebook cannot
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.120]   In an instant reduces city to ruins the way a nuclear bomb can
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.360]   And whereas the doomsday machine was conceived of as a world-ending device
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.600]   So as to forest all the end of the world facebook started because as semi-inibrated
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.720]   Harvard undergrad was bored one night, but the stakes are still life and death mega scale
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.240]   Is nearly the existential threat that mega death is
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.800]   No single machine should be able to control the face of fate of the world's population
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.560]   And she says that's what both the doomsday machine and facebook are built
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.400]   To do
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.520]   The cycle of harm perpetuated by facebook scale at any cost business model is plain
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:03.200]   To see as the woman from mass media but keep going most people who are complaining about big tech seemed
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.520]   To the complaint seems to be it's too big and that's in effect
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.680]   Which what she said the mega scale of facebook is what makes it dangerous
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.520]   Uh facebook has conducted social contagion
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:21.600]   The mega scale of facebook is also what enables people who otherwise could never have been heard in mass media to finally be effing heard
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:27.920]   Because they weren't because because gatekeepers like editors kept them out and communities and people were never heard couldn't be that
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:33.520]   Facebook's one allows voices don't you think that facebook has been used uh most notably
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.360]   Not exclusively but most notably to promote extremist causes
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:43.760]   No, no, no a million times. No, I don't see any of your damn who do you follow not sees when you're on facebook
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:49.520]   I see nothing extremist in my feed nothing. I think except you I think you buried your head in the sand jeff
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.920]   I think it's very clear. No, I'm telling you my feel i'll share my feed with you look my entire feed
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.400]   You want well, I don't hear the saying is used predominantly for it. No facebook hit
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.920]   No
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.080]   I can be the evidence. I hello like just like an assembly to go. Give me the damn evidence
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:11.440]   This is the definition of my petting. It's resuming in washington. You see the evidence. I think q and non is
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:18.480]   I I think the rise of extremism if not directly correlated is related. I mean I look at yeah
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:24.240]   I look at my my dad doesn't believe that biden actually won the election like he is a smart
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.760]   Man, and does he watch fox he somehow well fox is just i'm not saying fox is not
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.720]   Compla although fox
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:39.760]   No, winter. Yeah, yeah fox fox was okay. It's not it's not that fox is okay. So much as facebook is bad
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.840]   I don't i'm not going to defend fox or anybody else. That's another problem
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:47.280]   And I know that's that's one person but
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:53.600]   Well, no, it's not just one person stacy. That's I hear that all the time and I know people for whom that's an issue
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.160]   I know a lot of people
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:01.200]   A lot of people who have who get their news from facebook and youtube and who believe it
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.400]   My father does people also argue that watches fox and he gets it
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.760]   Some will also argue that facebook
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.960]   CNN and fox are just as powerful as
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.760]   Facebook I disagree the sensationalism
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.400]   Yeah, there's certainly that but I think that
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.120]   Old media
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.320]   Doesn't have the power that facebook does to do this and and
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:32.880]   Honestly, I think we're lucky that mark succerberg has not shown any interest in deciding who should be running the united states
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.120]   Because if he did he has the levers he could pull you don't agree jeff
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.760]   No, I do not no
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.320]   You you give you give the american people no agency no credit for making with their own mind
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.360]   You think and this is this is the perfect third person effect
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:53.840]   You leo can't be affected but everybody else are sheeple who are going to be changed how they vote and how they run the country
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.440]   Because mark succerberg besides something give them some credit
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.440]   Yes, we have idiots in this country about 30 percent, but we were they were there anyway
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:08.080]   I think that if you see enough people saying
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:13.120]   Enough the same thing enough times it becomes less outlandish
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.040]   if I told you if I got on here every single show and I was like
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.040]   y'all
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:25.120]   Toothpaste is not as effective. I know this sounds weird, but if you use oatmeal instead of toothpaste
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   I do it. I would do it. She said that clean your teeth. I will stay c-set if stacy said it of course
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.360]   And if jeff you tried it and you were like well, I don't know about this
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.680]   But stacy said it sure and then jeff started saying it and every week
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:45.120]   That's what you saw was stacy and jeff talking about how their oatmeal oatmeal is so much better than toothpaste
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:50.880]   People are gonna start watch out. Watch out here comes a gutenberg reference. Watch out warned you all right
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.680]   When print started
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.160]   Nobody trusted print because they didn't know who made it
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:02.720]   What we trusted was what we would now call rumor because I knew the the traveling sales person who came through town and the innkeeper
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.600]   And I knew what they said and I trusted that this print stuff. I didn't trust
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.120]   Print was unreliable. Does that sound trust in rumors?
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:14.160]   No, but the point is it did not it was not operated at that mega scale
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:19.600]   It was very much on scale by the fact they had to walk from one down to the other
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:27.040]   And admittedly it did shred it did happen, but it didn't happen at the rate and the magnitude that it's happening now
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:31.360]   Oh, I beg you to ask the ghosts of witches who got killed because of print
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.480]   Um, there was plenty of of bad stuff like that and print print was playing the same way
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.720]   The point here is it takes time to invent the institutions that bring the authority
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.160]   It took time to invent the notion of the editor and the publisher
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:51.760]   And the academic it related to printing that came along to say that is reliable. That's not that's a newspaper or that's a book publisher
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:57.600]   This is not we're doing the same thing now and we're in the very early throats and we don't have those institutions now
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:04.960]   So what happens is there's a vacuum into which yes trolls and bad people go and manipulate that until we need to invent
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.440]   You don't think you don't think the scale of facebook quantit changes
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:14.560]   The quantity of facebook changes the quality of what is going on. I agree
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.520]   It's not only made always gone on when I was a tv crew
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:22.800]   But we weren't at that scale yet. We are now at that scale nothing before has had two and a half billion
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:27.280]   It's a privilege argument. It's not privilege. Nothing. Yeah. No, you've got your you've got your platform
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.480]   But who all we didn't have it for a minute nothing in the past
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:39.120]   Nothing now has had two and a half billion daily active users facebook operates at a scale that has never been
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:44.640]   Seen no two people see the same face same with the one bad thing on face. Everybody sees it
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:50.560]   No, that's not true facebook's algorithm promotes all sorts of stuff and that algorithm is
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:58.640]   Is really been given way too much power in the overall give me the data bud. Nope. There's lots of data
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:04.240]   You've got your head in the sand jeff you just really you've already decided you do not want to hear what's going on
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.800]   I'm tired of having the same argument. You don't even want to argue that week after week after week after week after week after week after
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.000]   week well because
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.440]   Because the rest of the week can we go there jeff we disagree wait a minute jeff
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.520]   The rest of the world is going there
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.880]   You're the only one dragging his heels the reason is out of moral panic
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.240]   Even crops up is because you refuse to accept what is
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:26.240]   Painly i criticize facebook lots about this lots
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.600]   This is obvious to everybody
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.200]   This idea is being a doomsday machine is bs of bs
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:36.080]   And what it does is it hurts the internet and it takes off the voices who finally have their place
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:40.480]   And so we're going to kill section 230 and we're going to kill the opportunity for people communities
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.560]   We're never heard in this country to be heard i want to kill rage is dirty and i don't want to kill that
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.120]   That's where you guys where this we should kill face that's where it's real quick
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.920]   Because i think facebook is very any democrat
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.360]   Mom and dad stop fighting
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.480]   But christmas can we have a different story please
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.160]   This guy we have a reason we refuse this to accept the way things are
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.480]   You refuse to accept that you need some some
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.320]   Jeff data i'm not alone
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.680]   The agency of the american people
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.800]   Time to don't care for your knowledge
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.000]   40% of the people voted for trump what is that proof nothing
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.360]   The problem is we're watching down this path and jeff says it's not happening
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.120]   But everybody else is watching it happen
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   And jeff says it's not happening
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.400]   You're wrong jeff you just were holiness you're holiness
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.720]   Yes, you should come out with your index of forbidden books
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:27.280]   It will preserve i think that minds of the people and they will not be corrupted by this
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:32.080]   I can't understand why i go by you're so anxious to defend facebook which is ablated
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:37.040]   I'm not anxious to defend facebook facebook yes you are this can be i'm writing that all the time just when you bring up
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:41.840]   I am anxious to defend the internet and the public i'm not attacking the internet i'm attacking face you are
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:47.040]   It's not the facebook is not what facebook gets attacked there goes 230 there goes the net
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:53.760]   That's the problem no that feels that no okay that's a slippery slope but aunt has been trying to speak
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:33:01.920]   Yes, aunt please i still have my issues just with with people in general the original posters of this
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:07.120]   Ridiculous stuff that actually gets onto facebook and continues to spread like wildfire
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:13.840]   And i'm not just talking about the political stuff but people in general is just some weird societal norm now
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.680]   You want to post a video of some people fighting out here in the streets?
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:25.040]   Why why do we want to see that as as people humans and then it just continues to spread and facebook
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.280]   You know they see that on their little data chart that oh this particular post is just going out
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.920]   So facebook says you know what let's just keep pushing it on over there and nobody thinks to say
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:41.200]   That's some bull crap stop spreading stupid stuff like this and you can take that to the next level with political lies and other
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.520]   Crap, you know, so i not just
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:50.320]   People are necking i would i would agree with jeff that that stuff has always gone on what has changed is
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:55.840]   Those you know those people are people voice rumors are always been part of america of society
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:02.640]   Especially american society, but what has changed is this bully pulpit now i agree with you jeff that
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.600]   The pulpit is important to people who haven't had voices
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:10.320]   So i don't i don't want to throw that out, but i don't i think you've you got acknowledge
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:16.240]   There's a problem that somehow and i think it's because of the algorithm facebook
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.800]   Clearly elevates this garbage that you're talking about and
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:27.520]   uh because it it generates engagement it gets clicks and that's a big problem and so
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.720]   I don't know how you can say that's not a problem
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.680]   I'm not trying to say get rid of the internet or get rid of second i'm saying i start well start with media
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:40.720]   That's what media invented that that's the attention based marketplace and media does everything that ant doesn't like media throws on all the time
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.280]   It gives us a skewed view i've never been a fan of local news
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:47.600]   Either yeah, but they never had that kind of but they never had that kind of power
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:53.280]   Have huge scale local news has had huge scale local news invented scale that is the beginning of mass is local television
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.800]   That and steam power
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.120]   I think this was gonna be a different story
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.560]   Yeah, I was like we're not gonna move anywhere, but let's not talk about facebook. Let's talk about google
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:10.560]   Okay, well, let's take a break. I don't take votes here. It's not a democracy, but you just change the theme
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:17.840]   This is not democracy. I know what's he like the drums. I know what's an important story and uh
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.680]   You know you may not like it. Oh come on that that right up that piece
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:27.280]   Come on facebook buying a full page ad in the new york times the wall street. No, not that not that the june
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.520]   machine
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.720]   It's an ad onto this larger story of facebook buying an ad
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:40.800]   Full page ad in the largest newspapers in the country saying we're standing up to apple for small businesses is a perfect example of what's wrong with
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.800]   Face well the same time. Sorry while you're on this you got to go to another one a few line 103
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.960]   That's not a democracy. We're taking a break
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:54.560]   I don't know where you guys got the bills got the impresher you could just went with a boat for the theme
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.400]   Well, that was different. I let the listeners vote not you guys
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:03.600]   All right, what is it line what two
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:09.920]   103 it's just related. It's a whole line thing is driving me nuts publishers for a while ago. Don't you change your mind?
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:15.360]   I never said I like the word ahead. Did I say I like yes you did you said you liked it? Hey
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.040]   I
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.040]   Hate this line thing
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:26.480]   Major news publishers in the u.s. Join the coalition for app fairness advocacy group to fight the apple tax now
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.760]   This is for accuracy apple tax
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:36.560]   And this is this is top publishers like the new york times and others and the so-called digital content next which is a lobbying group
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:41.920]   This is about the absolute political clout, which is a little different from apple saying hey you have the right to privacy
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:47.520]   Let me show you what this app is collecting. Do you want it to do that? I'm all for that
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.240]   I agree there are real problems with the app store and apple has responded to that by reducing
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.440]   for any company making less than a million dollars a year reducing the
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:00.640]   Uh, they're vague to 15 percent, which I think is a very that's a good thing to do. Yeah
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.560]   Um, and it's not the end of that and I think there are problems with the app store
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.560]   I'm absolutely agreement, but I don't see any problem with apple exposing
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.440]   To anybody who uses an app on their platform. Here's what this app is collecting. Okay
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.080]   No, no, I'm okay with that. Okay with that. I'm fine with it
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.560]   You have a facebook's not why do you think facebook's well?
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:24.160]   That's not that was on the point. I was fine with the with your own on the app. I was not fine with your doomsday piece
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.000]   No, no, I just okay
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:34.320]   Fine. I agree. It's a little bit of hyperbole that's a little over-definition. I agree. That's that even stacy's not scolding me for using the mp words
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.080]   On that's right
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:40.160]   No, that's a perfect example of it. However, okay, I'm not thrilled about facebook
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:45.120]   Saying you shouldn't know what we're up to. Why would you want to know what we're up to?
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.520]   You know, that's bad for America if you know what we're up to
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.120]   To me that is almost an admission that they're
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.600]   No good
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:59.600]   Facebook did two other things that are really stupid in this line. We will get to after the message responses. Yes, and go ahead stacy
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:05.360]   Oh, no, no, let's take that break. I want to talk about a podcast where there are no arguments
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:11.600]   There's no fighting. It's a podcast about technology. You should probably be listening to that instead of this. It's called technology
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.200]   It's called it's from Dell. It's called technology powers
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:20.640]   X the X being some of the most interesting businesses in the world
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:26.480]   The host daniel applestone is a hardware engineer. She's an entrepreneur. She's actually great. She in each episode
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:31.840]   They focus on a different industry and they help you understand kind of how enterprise technology
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:34.640]   Things like ai cloud edge
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:41.920]   Intelligent devices are changing that business. It's actually fascinating one episodes about theme parks
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.680]   You know that the rides nowadays on theme parks are so heavily instrumented
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:52.000]   They're spewing data as you're riding that roller coaster all sorts of data g forces speed people on it
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.160]   Well, you know how they're screaming all those sensors the masses of amount of data
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:02.400]   And then they use that software to do a number of things to make rides more efficient to make rides more fun and make them safer
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.000]   Fascinating that's just one episode another one is about f1 racing
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:12.720]   How the legendary mcclaring racing team uses technology in those cars tons of data coming off of them
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:17.280]   They use that technology to analyze the data make decisions about should we should we do a pit stop?
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:20.240]   What tires should we be using what racing strategies?
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:25.280]   Should be using and they not only have a computers track side. They have data centers now
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.320]   That's that there's a lot of money in f1 racing
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.120]   There's this is an episode on beer listen

[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.760]   No, so what do you think? I'm like
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:36.240]   Jesus now. I'm criticizing them and I can't win. I just can't win. Would that make you happy?
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.320]   Okay, go ahead
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:44.240]   Well, because you're you want to kill it so i'm trying to give you ammunition. Okay. Give me some ammunition. All right, let's go
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:50.160]   Geez give me something that'll kill facebook honestly if i go flip a switch and kill facebook
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.160]   It's on line 33
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.640]   Take that fella
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:59.680]   Take that line 33 facebook working on tldr
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:05.360]   To summarize you're working on an algorithm to summarize news article so you don't have to read them
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:10.080]   Oh, that's going to make them real effing popular with the news industry that hates them good lord
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:13.760]   Look at all the trouble google's getting from snippets. This is worse than snippets
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.480]   Yeah, we're gonna summarize your article and take it away
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:21.520]   And then the other thing they're working on is a means i think they we talked about this before to read your brains commands
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:27.920]   Another thing facebook's the last company on earth. You would trust to do that. I will admit that fully
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:33.840]   You know what wait you are bonanzas. You don't want them to read your brain even i even i just got
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:34.800]   to do with it
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.840]   You get better at it's no no even i even you found the line he's trolling
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:45.680]   I think they are but i guess my point is they are reading your brain. They just don't have to put anything in oh geez
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.840]   Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez. You don't think they have sentiment analysis and they know
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.600]   That you're in a bad mood today or you're gonna give you an inch and take a
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:57.360]   Bad or you know, we know they're doing that
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:03.280]   We know they're having having this service to summarize the article does nothing in my opinion because
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:07.840]   Most people just read headlines and keep it there already summarize it right?
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.120]   And re-share it after they read the headline because they
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.600]   Fail for the clickbait of this is you know
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.720]   I'll say the articles are too damn long anyway. They deserve to be summarized
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.040]   That's what axios does as a business model and it works
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:23.440]   The uh, these announcements are product demos reported of an end-of-year company-wide meeting
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.720]   Which of course was probably private, but anyway, it's always leaks out
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.240]   Uh, somebody got one
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:34.080]   Buzzfeed news obtained audio of the meeting which is not public but was broadcast to thousands of employees so
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.920]   shock
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.720]   Uh a slew of pre-recorded company executives
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.960]   Some who called 2020 a trying year is the company weather to global pandemic
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:49.280]   Oh, maybe what do you think you think and the backlash of the police killings of george floyd brianatale and other black americans
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:53.200]   Despite the term a long time you get to the point actually so it actually needs a summary
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:57.600]   It takes a long time to get to the stuff with them. Yeah, you know what I could use that tool to summarize this
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.440]   You're like
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.800]   written
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:06.000]   Story it's called tldr. It can summarize news articles in a in bullet points just like axios
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.280]   Yeah, what's the difference if a human does it? I mean, that's what
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.200]   Yeah, that's what we do. That's what we do every week, right?
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.360]   That's sometimes
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:21.600]   Some of us try to offer some insight. Yes, we comment on it. We comment on it or entertaining arguments around them
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:27.120]   Yeah, some we just use the story. It was so traumatizing really or you're sorry
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.720]   That's to be I wanted to crawl under my desk
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:34.000]   But first of all jeff and I love each other
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.320]   So like brothers right?
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:43.280]   But second this is an important conversation. I think in the american future. We we're gonna have to deal with this
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.760]   Don't you think?
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.760]   But mommy and daddy shouldn't fight
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:55.120]   You asked for my microphone to go louder see I told you you mistake is all on me
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.480]   at
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:01.600]   Tm or john had potted me down and you ruined it
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.800]   Tldr stands for too long didn't read in case you uh didn't know
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:11.040]   You know honestly facebook this is an example of facebook not
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.440]   thinking about
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:18.640]   Anything except well, we know people want this so let's do it. We know it would generate engagement
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:22.960]   So let's do it. Yeah, damn the torpedoes full speed ahead, right? Go ahead stacey
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.160]   So well, I was just wondering you know twitter did there
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:33.440]   Maybe you should read the article if you try to retweet something based on headlines and i'm curious how often you encounter that
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:39.280]   Uh, hey, maybe you should read this and it changes your behavior at all. I never get that. Do you get it?
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.840]   Do you know what i get?
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.840]   Yeah, I was like are you on twitter?
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:48.640]   Well trying to read to one reason I know I never retweet there's that I don't retweet you're right
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.440]   Um, but I do sometimes and sometimes it's because I know
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:59.840]   I've already read the article, you know, and I encounter it again and twitter and i'm like, oh, okay, and sometimes it is it's just like
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.920]   Oh
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:07.120]   Uh, maybe I should so a couple times i'm like, oh, yeah, I guess I should be checking out the article
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:12.560]   And they call that feature something to tell tblr so tlbi i'm just wondering if anyone else interesting
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:17.440]   Tl yeah, I get that on twitter every now and then because there are some things that I will
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.760]   Does it change your behavior because pardon?
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:23.120]   Does it change your behavior she's asked
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:30.720]   Uh, no because when I typically do that it's because I know the source and I already trust the source that is coming from
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.120]   It's like another creator that I want to support
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:37.120]   I I know what they're putting out there. I know they're not putting a bunch of crap out in
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.080]   And um, so I just want to share
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:44.160]   It's the value of the value of a pre-print
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.320]   uh,
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.800]   communication where you trusted the source rather than
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.320]   Uh, because you knew them rather than the publication, right?
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:57.120]   But most of the time I do go ahead and read things
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:02.880]   Um before sharing it, but if I already see the source and I will you know, sometimes
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.880]   They see to change you it's just
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.880]   I change your behavior
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:14.240]   It has on occasion, um, yeah, no, I usually trust the source, but sometimes it's that someone
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.120]   retweeting something else or
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:24.240]   Yet there was a scientific paper. Oh, there was a scientific paper the other day that I tweeted because I was like, oh, this is fascinating
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:30.720]   And I had put it in google keep to read it and I scanned it just to like I clicked through scanned it
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.280]   But I guess I didn't click through long enough because twitter was like, are you sure you want to retweet this? Oh really?
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.800]   Oh, it has a timer. Oh wow. Oh wow. I don't know if it has a timer
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.680]   um, and
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:47.200]   I was like, yes, but you know what? I should have read the whole thing carefully because they were right
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:52.800]   I could have been more accurate. It wasn't inaccurate. It just could have been twitter now
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.800]   twitter now
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.800]   Twitter slapped your wrist
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.840]   It's funny because it's
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.960]   Computer science has been working on these summary things remember word used to do this
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.480]   For a long time until facebook said what if we did this
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.360]   Nobody's nobody even noticed
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:16.400]   Nobody even noticed these summarizes you used to be able to I think you might still be able to in microsoft word
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:21.440]   Take a long article and say give me a 200 word summary. Give me a 100 word summary. Yeah
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:25.840]   For a long time. Am I am I nuts? Do you say anybody remember that?
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:30.160]   I'm not gonna say you're nuts. I never summarize
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:36.480]   It's been a little round a long time facebook and I take it line 35 is the other one
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:46.160]   Facebook builds this is a good idea. This was not one. This is facebook doing uh cameo
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:50.960]   Cameo is the strangest thing ever, but it makes perfect sense
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.480]   Do you know about cameo?

[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.320]   That means they've got a charity
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:08.480]   Oh, so sugar rays doing it for st. Jude's as well
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:13.360]   Oh, that changes the whole the whole I feel like a terrible person
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.760]   You're gonna be all snarky and they're awful per se
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:21.360]   Uh, but again, what are your thoughts on someone does not donate into a charity?
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:24.000]   This is just an extra bit of revenue for
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.200]   Problem
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.280]   Jenner is 2500 bucks
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.880]   Boozy badass
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.120]   Who's boozy badass?
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:39.360]   Boozy badass is 1500 dollars. Do you think he's getting a lot of work?
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:42.160]   uh
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.160]   Shark tank investor
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.480]   So did you but okay?
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:53.440]   Did you see the videos that the professors did at the beginning like a bunch of professors at a college got together paid for snoop
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:58.720]   To do a cameo and then they edited the cameo into their video for like reading their syllabus
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:03.120]   That's awesome. And it was actually a really creative kind of thing. That's brilliant. Um
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.840]   And so
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.120]   I think
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:12.640]   The idea of getting like when used that way as opposed to like just sending someone a birthday card
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.560]   It really kind of opens up
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:19.360]   Weird avenues of creativity that I know Jeff likes to you know, like you're out of doing video, right?
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:23.760]   And this didn't exist until this is because of covet right these people are all at home
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.800]   Or no did this I think you can do this before
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:30.240]   Yeah, but it but it really took off because of covet
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:33.360]   So now face
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:35.600]   Facebook who's doing this facebook's doing it
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.920]   so
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.520]   Sorry
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.520]   This is this is kind of what
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:47.120]   The anti trust thing was all about was as soon as they see something successful
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:50.960]   They say oh we can do that and they either buy them. Yeah, well, that's what I was gonna say
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.080]   This this is a service that exists. Why are they adding this right?
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.640]   Why are they adding it after they've been sued?
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:02.720]   It's called super it will let creators entrepreneurs or celebrities host live interactive video events
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:10.000]   Oh kind of it's a mix between twitch and camio viewers can tip creators by buying them digital gifts
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.680]   Or pay to appear alongside a creator doing the live stream to ask a question or take a selfie
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.640]   YouTube also has a special service
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.640]   Coffee
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.880]   Yeah, now if if you see me on this
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:28.560]   Sometime in the next few months, you'll know things have gone very poorly
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:32.720]   Is it also kind of like only fans?
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.280]   Oh, yeah, only did you see how
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:42.080]   Only fans now only fans which initially initially or at least in my mind always was about adult performers
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:48.560]   But now everybody's doing yes playing this to me. Is it is it now not just porn? I haven't gone there out of fear
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:55.520]   Same here. Okay. Well don't show my screen people because I'm going there. Um, no, yeah
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:54:01.680]   Yeah, so it could be a lot of things because you got a sign in before you can do it
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:09.360]   Adult there's a lot of I could start there like Stacey explains it all for different topics. I guess
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:13.680]   So it's like patreon. I mean patreon is the first of these pretty much right?
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:18.960]   Well, but patreon's a little bit different because you don't have to do the
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:23.840]   activity in right there in the platform page. I mean rewarding something they already doing
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:29.360]   Yeah, you're rewarding to create so it's a little bit different than creating a revenue. Yeah. Yeah
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:37.200]   Only fans is the similar thing with this with the super chat feature if you're doing a live stream like you would on twitch or whatever
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.240]   Um, and if you have enough subscribers
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:45.040]   You can do super chats where they can pop into the chat room and say what they want to say
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:48.480]   Right they select to do a super chat it pushes them up in the queue
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:54.000]   So you you as the creator see what their message is or question is a little bit and they pay for that
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.960]   And they pay for that and it could be you can make a lot of money on twitch. Have you ever done that at?
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:01.520]   What twitch yeah, no sir
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:05.920]   Just you uh, I know people who do quite well
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:10.160]   On twitch. I know they're because there are also super donors
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:16.080]   So, uh, I don't know if I can say who this person is you know him, but I won't say his name
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:21.280]   But he does it and he told me there's there's one woman who will throw thousands of dollars at him
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:24.240]   Just like every once in a while just
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:27.200]   So you can make some money
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:33.120]   I know only fan people I mean is going to earn 300 million in profits
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:35.520]   Um
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:39.360]   According to a person familiar with the matter from 400 million in revenue
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:44.080]   90 million users most of which are paying subscribers
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:50.880]   So it's very lucrative so from their blog examples of the safe things
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:54.240]   Um soap making with may call
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:01.600]   Bathroom motivations with winny designs up photo editing tips with from danny batista and
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:06.080]   See I think this is a this is exactly what you were talking about jeff
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:13.280]   The really beneficial side of the internet is giving people this direct drive access to their audience. Yes. It's great
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:19.600]   I think it's great. Yeah, well and and well not just their audience, but but and importantly when it comes to the hashtag to each other
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:23.520]   Yeah, it's a it's a because the first member doesn't just protect the right to speak
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:27.600]   But also the right to assemble and the internet creates the ability to assemble
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:32.960]   I will also say though. It can be a scary wild
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:39.600]   unpleasant place in most platforms who are trying to make it e-connect don't think through
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:44.160]   the effects of certain design decisions for
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:48.560]   marginalized people or people who might be I agree so I I think
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.120]   absolutely agree every time you
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.760]   rush out find your audience
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:59.440]   You so in danger of finding your we'll call it the anti audience can also you you know
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:07.600]   So I say it's I say it's love that but it's also if you don't design to avoid manipulation
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:13.040]   But so when we talk about those I feel like you shut things down
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.880]   because
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:20.480]   You you shout moral panic when what we might be talking about I know we are just saying like facebook is evil blah blah blah
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:25.440]   but some of the decisions that people are trying to make and why people are suing facebook is to
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:32.320]   Implement some of these better design decisions or to help mitigate the optimization for
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:35.040]   You know crisis or in
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:38.880]   scary moral panicky reporting so
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:42.400]   I I'm all for that face. You would recognize
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:47.680]   Yes, would you have a normal conversation like you being a mature smart sane
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:51.520]   Stacy I am not going back to him. I don't care what you say
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.600]   then
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.800]   Then everything is fine
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.720]   But if you're gonna scream that it should be shut down and it's a doomsday machine ruining earth
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:02.480]   Slightly different things case. It's the scale of the
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:05.280]   effort on the couch
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:10.160]   So google was out yesterday
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:13.280]   Right along guys try sacy google yes
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:18.800]   You ever thought about being a therapist. Did you talk about good at this? You have that nice calming boys
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:24.800]   You're very soothing you could offer cookies. No, I think they say I would crawl into this with people are you?
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:29.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have to be able to take well, I would do that too emotional the heat in there
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:32.960]   Yeah, I think you know come on man. You need help. That's why I'm here dr. Hickenbotham
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:38.720]   I don't care you need some other help. I can't deal with you. I can't help you. I don't want to help you
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:43.040]   No, you're not worth my good because I don't want to live with him anymore
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.760]   Uh, gosh
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.560]   Google was down on monday and then down again a little bit on tuesday
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:51.360]   Uh, I know you know
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.960]   Do you want to know why we used to talk about this all the time?
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:59.360]   And now it's now it's news because it happens so rarely, but yes, I do yeah
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:05.120]   Those Stacy does it happen. It's it's news also because more and more people are relying on the cloud for instance
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:11.360]   Uh, we use gmail lisa for an hour or two yesterday couldn't get in any any mail
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:18.800]   And this is a crunch time right now a lot of a lot of advertisers make their last minute decisions for next quarter right now
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:22.720]   So this was a big deal that she wasn't getting any mail
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:26.960]   So I think the reason it's a bigger story now is not because
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:32.320]   It doesn't happen more. You're right it happens less but because when it does happen people are really relying on this stuff
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:35.600]   Um, so this was apparently related to
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:38.400]   Uh, google's authentication
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.520]   system
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:47.200]   So the root cause was an issue in google's automated storage quota management system
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:53.120]   Which in turn reduced the capacity of the authentication system and of course if you can't log in
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:56.320]   Or you don't have the cookie and the cookie can't be validated
[00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:05.680]   You can't get into anything in this case in the google cloud form platform, which is google console google's cloud storage big query the kubernetes engine
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.320]   Google workspace
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.120]   Which means gmail calendar meet docs and drive?
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.480]   Uh, you you were getting authentication errors
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.200]   Uh, you imagine why?
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.760]   Mail wouldn't work for me on the web but wouldn't work for me on my phone
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:27.120]   Because it's i'm authenticated through the phone or probably related to the fact that you had authenticated more recently on the phone
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:32.000]   And you needed a re-authentication on the web because you hadn't authenticated so lately
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.680]   So in other words, the phone would eventually have failed but may but it would have taken longer
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.120]   um
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.560]   Yes, so that that actually's that's a kind of really nice piece of evidence
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.040]   Your phone continued to get mail
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.200]   But your desktop did not
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:50.080]   So that that exactly sounds what like what they said it was the authentication went down
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.280]   Yeah, you're right. It's not as big a story and yet it is a big story
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.240]   Amas remember amazon was out for like five hours
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:00.160]   Yeah, that's right twitter used to go down routinely
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:03.040]   all the time
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.200]   Now they're being
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.240]   Did you see that they're moved to a ws? Yeah, that's a big deal
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.320]   Because they used to run all their own servers in fact remember they used to have a just dedicated justin beaver servers
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.000]   Because he was
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.960]   I knew the guy who built their original architecture and then is that failed a bunch rebuilt it and then
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.520]   That continued to fail as they scaled. Yeah rebuilt it again. You knew that guy
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.480]   What is he doing now?
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.960]   I have no idea. It spends a lot of time in bars. That's it was my old. It was like 2000 and
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.280]   I was all the days we put up the way all the time. I created the fail whale
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:50.160]   Actually, I know the woman who drew the fail whale initially really yeah, you link me and Lou
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.760]   She in fact I have a her original original drawing on the wall that she did for me and lisa
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.600]   She did it was actually that's an interesting story
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.920]   She
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:06.880]   Did it herself just as an illustration. She's a very talented illustrator. I think from hong kong
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:08.960]   and
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:14.000]   Wonderful person and she did those drawings yi ying lu
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.840]   um
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:18.080]   It was called it was a birthday card
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:23.920]   Uh called lifting a dreamer and it was on a stock image site and twitter just said oh
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:30.240]   There we go a fail whale. It was a whale remember was a whale being lifted by twitter like birds little birds. Yeah
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:36.160]   Um and they bought it though, right? They didn't just yeah, although because it was stock photo
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.200]   I don't you know stock image for it. They paid a lot
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:45.760]   She's very she didn't she was very gracious. She was very happy about it and uh
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.360]   uh
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.280]   She still calls the illustration lifting a dreamer
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.160]   She I think she was very happy
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.800]   I have uh if somebody help bring it in
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:04.640]   Because we had her we must have had her on the new screen say we got him on her on something and she just was wonderful
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.480]   And uh, she said she asked Lisa to me what's your favorite animal
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:13.120]   And I said mine and she said I said an elephant and I can't remember what Lisa said. She drew us a little
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:16.560]   Lovely little drawing in that same style. She's very talented
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.720]   Cool that's good stuff. Yep. Cool. Yeah
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:23.600]   Um, let's see google stories
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.520]   Oh, we you know, let's take a break and we'll do a changelog. How about that?
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.240]   Would that make you oh I was gonna talk about working from home
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:34.080]   Let's do that first working from home and then we can uh we can do the break and then the changelog
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:38.000]   Just because I want to get y'all's take on on when the pandemic will be over
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.160]   Just remember it's not a democracy, but in this case i'm gonna allow it
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:47.760]   Because because Stacy has better lobbyists than I do she
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.360]   She
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:54.400]   She's cut as my mom always told me you catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:59.680]   So I actually I think it's actually the possession of this challenge coin that has made me feisty today
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.080]   You know, or an ahole. Yeah
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.240]   Someone someone please steal that
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.680]   Yes, I think this is really what's changed my life
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:15.680]   All right, Stacy work from home google said they're gonna let their employees. Oh, yeah work from home
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.760]   Until september 2021, which I thought so september of next year
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:25.440]   They've moved it back from july, but then they also said they're gonna do they're gonna try this flexible work week
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:30.000]   That makes you work three days in the office and the other two days can be at home
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.360]   Um forever. I was I wanted forever forever end of time. Yeah
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:39.920]   Um, it's funny because apple just announced june
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:44.080]   And then a day later google says no september
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:52.240]   Which I think is far more realistic. Yeah, I think it starts. Well, not for everybody to be fair
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:59.520]   Apple has they make physical products. They need people in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you got it and those are highly secretive
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.440]   right
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:08.400]   It's amazing all their privacy army there. Yeah, it's amazing what they've been able to do without if they were good at ad sales
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.720]   They'd be out in the field, but they're not so they don't need them
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:17.440]   Who but yeah, so y'all think september 2021 is when we'll be able to
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:25.520]   We'll be back to more of a normal setting. I'm curious when business travel will ramp back up and why i hope so
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.680]   It all sort of depends on this vaccine too though, right? Yeah
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.600]   And
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:36.080]   The one unknown we know the vaccine will work the one unknown is how many people will take it take it
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:40.400]   But I predict you know, there's been a lot of assistance affects transmission
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:44.080]   That's right. Isn't that we don't know that's right? We have two unknowns
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.000]   Who's gonna take it and will it stop actual transmission or just suppress symptoms?
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.480]   I think it's gonna stop transmission. I think they don't know it because they don't have enough data yet. They haven't studied it. Yeah
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:00.000]   But I didn't realize most vaccines saw a really good thread today from a doctor who decided to enter the
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:06.160]   The trial actually still because they didn't sleep. Oh, yeah, this is a traffic on yeah, and
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.520]   He goes through about how he was dubious about the speed of it
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:15.040]   But then he researched it and found out why it was so speedy in fact, it's quite amazing why they've been working on it since sars
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:18.960]   That's why exactly and the woman who invented it invented it
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:26.960]   30 years ago and was poo poo she was actually demoted at her university because they said you'll never be able to make a vaccine that way
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:34.800]   All right, it's a great story the history of the vaccine is fascinating, but no we haven't working on it for decades. Yeah, very sexy
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:40.080]   So anyway, he goes through and through and I didn't realize somebody said in a comment that that he decided to do the trial because they needed it
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:45.200]   He's a doctor himself, but I didn't realize that if he believes he got the
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.000]   water
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:54.800]   And wants to switch the placebo vaccine. He's not supposed to for two years because they need to track him for that long
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:59.040]   Oh, that's a bad thing. So if you commit to the trial, I didn't I ever thought of this
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:02.880]   You've got to commit to giving them data for some period of time
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:07.680]   So you're in effect saying if you do get the placebo, I won't get the vaccine for a long time
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.800]   That's what this this comments dates. I believe it or not. I don't know
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.440]   I believe it was I just realized it was pretty obvious that
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:17.520]   You need data for a certain amount of time because we don't know about things like transmission, right?
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:24.320]   Or even long-term effects. Yeah, I suspect people are most vaccines don't have long-term effects
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:29.120]   Like it's mostly short you know within within months just like most vaccines
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:33.760]   Actually suppressed transmission, but we just aren't for sure
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:38.960]   No, right but but no, I do think that when push comes to show people are going to do it
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:44.000]   I think a lot of this resistance was in the abstract once it's actually available and your doctor calls you up
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.800]   It says when you come in and I think people are going to do it. I have high hopes
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:51.920]   We'll see. I will 100 even though I'm like one of the last people who's allowed to take it
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:56.880]   I know I feel sorry for you. Jeff and I'm ahead of all of you. We're like wait. Oh, yeah
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:03.680]   I'm over 65 with with plenty of preexisting. Oh, yeah, we're set old with comorbidities
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:12.240]   How lucky can a guy be I feel so unlucky. I'm so close. I got the comorbidities, but I'm just not old enough yet
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.280]   I am just wait
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.240]   I'll get there with any luck I'll get there
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:23.120]   Um, all right. Let's take a break and we have the changelog still to
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.760]   come
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:28.720]   My arch enemy Jeff Jarvis is here. He's a professor
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.640]   a cutie
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:37.600]   Buzz machine calm and he doesn't want to hear any more about facebook. Okay. I just don't want to have the same discussion for the hundredth time
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.680]   What's only because you're wrong. I don't want to hear it. Let's meet and that
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:48.060]   Stacey Higgin by them. Stacey on I O D dot com and

[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:03.200]   You're the voice of reason listen listen to the tone how you just said that stacey
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.400]   I want to read the tone
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:13.280]   Stacey is the voice of reason ant is the enlarged bicep of reason. Oh, okay. Yeah, that that that fits
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:16.480]   I'm not saying ant can't also be the voice of reason. I'm just like
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:20.080]   I'm just saying
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:23.440]   A reasonable way to say me and jeff. I would stand back. I know
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.360]   I go yes, sir. Oh, well that is true. Yes, sir

[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:40.240]   Pay to bills pay to bill
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:47.840]   He has turned into Donald Trump. He really has it is it is it is it is God. It is personality is an authoritarian now
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:53.280]   He doesn't like democracy anymore. He wants complete control. Yeah, that thing is bad for you
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.280]   I am going to get a whiskey
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:10:00.560]   And when we get back we're talking the changelocks to do this ad you got till I finished my point
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:06.560]   It isn't a coincidence that I am the 45th leo clone to be put into operation. I just want to say that
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:12.400]   Beautiful thing our show today brought to you by bandwidth
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:19.040]   Well, you might say well, yeah, the I downloaded it not that kind of not lower case be upper case be
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:25.840]   bandwidth bandwidth is a carrier a carrier that is cloud native
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:34.000]   They have injected the power of software into telephony delivering cloud ready voice calling text messaging
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:38.720]   And even more important 9 1 1 built for the enterprise
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:43.920]   They've helped some of the biggest brands in the world disrupt industries create new products
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.480]   Change how people communicate
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:50.560]   Uh, you might know one of the brands it begins with a g and ends with it
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.480]   He it's got an og and l in between for over 10 years
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:11:00.960]   Google's been using bandwidth. That's what google voice runs on from google meet to google homes
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:06.400]   bandwidth apis are behind the scenes of google products ensuring quality communications
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.200]   We use ring central they use bandwidth to
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.760]   uh bandwidth is
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:14.960]   the default the the choice the
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:18.160]   competitive local carrier
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:23.760]   That so many technologies use like microsoft and zoom. Yep. They use bandwidth
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:30.240]   Um to bring their most important customer experiences to life from sending SMS notifications at just the right time
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:32.880]   to making sure call center
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:40.720]   Uh sounds calls are crystal clear to ensure and this is again the most important reliable and secure 9 1 1 routing
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:45.840]   It's very important, you know, and a lot of there's regulations regarding e 9 1 1 in business
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:54.080]   And you've got to make sure that your carrier is doing it right and they do their bandwidth running on their own tier 1 carrier network
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:58.000]   Which means you get a no middleman pricing structure
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:04.160]   And you can see right into it so you get greater insight into quality and deliverability and you get a seat at the industry table
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:11.840]   There are lots of testimonials at bandwidth.com/tweg. Here's one from rovers co-founder and director of software development, philip kimmy
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:18.960]   He says no other provider offered the same level of hands on support or cost savings that bandwidth
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:24.080]   Has been able to deliver their flexible apis. I mean it's simple for us to get up and running without missing a beat
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:28.880]   Let me think google uses it microsoft uses zoom uses it
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:35.520]   Maybe maybe maybe you should be using bandwidth get the power and reliability of a tier 1 carrier network paired with the control
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:39.440]   And the agility of enterprise grade apis with bandwidth

[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:19.200]   Okay, that was kind of whiskey. Wow, that's awesome. We we're leo we've driven them to drink. I that's a bad thing
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:26.000]   So, what are you drinking stacey? What's what's your beverage here? I should have brought my this is the bane bridge island
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.960]   Local distillery. Oh whiskey is quite good. Isn't that nice?
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:34.480]   So it is is it a scotch or a bourbon or what?
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:38.960]   This is so this is just their whiskey whiskey. They actually
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:45.200]   Well, tell me wait a minute. Tell me is that ice cube in the shape of the death star? What is going on with you guys?
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.280]   Have I not taught you my free school?
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:54.080]   No, my fridge makes these giant ice cubes. It's this random feature that I had no idea it would do but it does
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:59.680]   They're made for whiskey. Are they balls or are they square? What is the they're almost balls?
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:06.160]   They're like little indents on the top because it's just yeah, yeah to hold it but you're supposed I actually lisa when you're gave me
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.680]   Whiskey ball. Well, I have whiskey stones too
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.680]   But I like ice in my whiskey
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.080]   I like a little water in there and they're balls though
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:18.240]   They're and I guess the idea is that because of the shape they don't melt as fast
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.720]   There's no
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:25.760]   But I see you there also don't hurt your nose when you won't get in your house. That's right no point
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.720]   But I see that aunt you are drinking in meat
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.920]   Yes, sir. You don't like to put anything in your whiskey
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.880]   What do I have my moments? But this is just a finger
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.680]   Are you drinking a finger of doers? What do you drink?
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.680]   I mentioned abel hour earlier. Oh
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.240]   You still have the abelower?
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:47.520]   Yes, sir. I gave you that bottle a year ago. Yes, sir. You've been very parsimonious
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:50.800]   Or something whatever that means maybe
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:58.320]   It's like parsimonious kind of has negative connotation. Uh, yeah, uh, what's a better word? You're right. That's the wrong
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:04.720]   Uh, you've been very sober. I don't drink it. I don't drink scotch every day
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:08.000]   Only when he's on wait a minute. You don't
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:15.200]   So next time I'll see if I can not that I know that scotch is so good. I love the abelower. Yeah
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:22.880]   The the bane bridge guys have a do you like a pd scotch? Yes, I do. That's so that's more like a log of woolens my favorite. Oh
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:27.280]   Okay, so this a fun thing is they they do a
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:34.400]   Distillation in the scotch barrels that adds a little of the pdiness which I love my husband doesn't care for it
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:39.840]   But I'll bring you a bottle back because it's I think it's delicious. He's frugal. Thank you. Is that better?
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:46.320]   No, there's there's a better way to think of it right now. Yeah, because y'all have traumatized
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:53.360]   Which one of you knew how to wear a writer or something? Okay, uh, penerius stingy tight-fisted
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.680]   No, no, no wait wrong
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.640]   Rosaurus
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.160]   Bad desorice
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:03.680]   He's moderate moderate. Yeah, that's too nice
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:10.640]   That's too soft. He he deserves nice. He's efficient. Nobody deserves nice better than our am now or efficient
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:15.680]   I'm definitely efficient about my whiskey super market so much. So I'm not gonna just go the abelors good
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:19.600]   Yeah, but that's so is that the same bottle I gave you or is that a subsequent?
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:26.880]   Nope, this is the abelower you gave me last july. Oh, was it in july? Okay. Wow. So yeah, it's lasted a good long time
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.880]   It amazes me that whiskey stays good
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:32.240]   I don't know why that just it's just phenomenal to me
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:38.800]   It's not always stated after you go through about two thirds of the bottle you will notice a little difference in taste you will
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.520]   Abst-abst-abstomus
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.800]   Is that it? Abstimius? Abstimius? Abstimius? Abstimius? Abstimius? Hetten heard that one
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:50.960]   No, he's not abstimius. It means you don't indulge. Yeah, he's not abstimius
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:58.000]   No, I think he is that means he doesn't over know the the the concept is he's he's careful
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:03.880]   He's doesn't you see parsimonius is so close, but you're right. I'm pragmatic
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.480]   Pragmat, but sure
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:13.360]   He's he exhibits self-control now. What do you think I got the all the grocery store the best one I can find the grocery store was angels
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:18.480]   Envy is that okay? It's not great. It's a bird. You know that used to be kevin's house bourbon. I liked it
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.840]   It's a good house for a bit good. I'm gonna call it my house bourbon
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:29.520]   I mean it's my house bourbon is basil hatens, but I would in a pinch. I will do angel have be
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:34.880]   Okay angels in angels. Okay. All right, the thing I even in a pinch thing
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.160]   I learned that I was really disappointed is that a lot of what you think of as good
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:43.680]   Burbs or whiskeys like bullet are really not they're made in a giant vat by a
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:50.240]   Company that resells them to other companies. You know about that a lot of them share the same mash bill. Yeah
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.440]   It's kind of depressing
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.440]   But not abelor recommend though
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:03.280]   Not abelor not Bainbridge Island distillery. No, we have a little one over here called griffo
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:08.080]   We had our christmas party there last year. I have their gin here. It's it's okay
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:14.400]   I don't think they're whiskey's that good though, is it? No, I like the gin the gin's nice and the botanical
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:22.000]   Google used a 64 camera rig to train portrait portrait lighting ai
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:33.440]   Which is this is branch this is why I wanted that reaction so they're essentially they're using machine learning models to understand
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:39.280]   Portraiture so that they can then put that model on the camera. Is that what they're doing it?
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:46.080]   Well again, you you go back to now hate to make this about apple but go back to what apple did and it's
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.160]   last release with
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.160]   um the camera app and
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:52.720]   figuring out you have portrait mode. Yes, where it's going to
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.560]   aesthetically
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:58.000]   Blur out the background for whatever person you're trying to shoot
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.880]   But then you need to have some sort of light light source in there that may not already be there
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:09.440]   And that that's the beauty of being able to sort of drag it around on the screen and make it to where it's natural looking
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:16.640]   And not just the blob of an exposure exposure increase and this is just the next step in that to making
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:23.040]   Photography on the smartphone is still just a one-click thing and not a lot of thought process into it
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:27.120]   Uh, this is on the google ai blog
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:30.160]   enhancing portrait lighting with machine
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.560]   learning
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:37.680]   and they actually this rig they they brought in 70 models and
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.720]   64 cameras
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:43.280]   331 individually programmable light sources
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.480]   And they just photos photograph people with different face shapes genders skin tones hairstyles
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:56.000]   Clothing accessories for each person they generated synthetic portraits in different lighting environments. Here's an example
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.320]   And then I guess the machine learning
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:04.160]   Uh, it created a model a data set
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:09.280]   So that the machine learning could then look at your picture and say where how they're going to apply the light
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:13.120]   Wow, and this is great because you can put this in
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:18.400]   uh, any type of smartphone camera that doesn't necessarily have all of the
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.880]   uh hardware
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:25.120]   You know to to be able to pull this stuff off because it's computational right so that means
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:28.160]   Keeping these phones under a thousand dollars
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.520]   The other thing google does is and they talked about this at i.o
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:38.240]   Uh, two a year and a half ago is they are able to get these models once they train them and they're very large when they train them
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:42.480]   But but they can then get them down to a size small enough that you could easily put them
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:48.720]   On a smartphone. This model is portrait lighting model is 10 megabytes. That's all
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:51.680]   Mm. It's kind of amazing
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.360]   Um
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.200]   Lots of training lots of information. This is this is AI for the good
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.160]   Not the evil
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:03.760]   Like I said, I think I mentioned this last week where
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:08.640]   My family they're they're just sort of used to it if I say hey, let's get a picture
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:15.520]   Uh, if we're out and about somewhere they automatically look to see where the sun is, you know, they they just said to learn
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:16.800]   over time
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.160]   Yeah, um
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.960]   How to how to make it work for the for the camera, but now they don't you know if something like this is in place
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:25.760]   You don't have to think about that because it's just snap it and go
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.560]   Sparing but then and economic what?
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:32.400]   What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? And what do you mean?
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:38.160]   I had a business because I have no I meant like your tips and oh no
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:44.880]   We still need it. I'll tell you I'll tell you the deal. Yeah, I've realized this and I mentioned it in a couple of shows
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.200]   So I apologize if you're hearing me repeat this
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:52.800]   But the the the the camera phones do too much they take they they give you a great picture
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.800]   But they do they tell all the creativity out of it
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:59.360]   They decide this is the images was gonna look like this is gonna be the best result and aunt
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:06.400]   You still need aunt. You still need a good tool. You need the creativity if you want to do if you want to make those decisions
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.080]   Not the AI
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.600]   You need you need to kind of kind of in a way a dumber camera a more
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.200]   uh
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.000]   Manual camera, right and then you need the help of aunt
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.800]   I hope to step in on the creative standpoint of it
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:27.680]   But I also want to step in far as the fundamentals, you know to help people understand why that AI is doing what it's doing
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.080]   Um, can you optimize?
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.320]   Can you knowing that the AI is going to be doing something?
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.720]   The example I always use I took a great picture with a good camera and then with the
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:43.520]   iPhone of uh my family sitting around a fire pit and the picture I liked was the one where the with the
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:49.760]   I turned the exposure down so it's profiles and just lit by the fire and the phone said no no no
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:53.920]   You want all the details you want everything and I don't I hate that. Yeah
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:58.800]   So is there a way to kind of anticipate what the phone's going to do and override it?
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:04.480]   I can't speak to the iOS side, uh, but at one point in time the
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:10.400]   Google camera app had that hdr plus feature where you can toggle it on and off
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:14.160]   Um, I haven't seen that feature in there in the last
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:18.560]   Uh to updates or so. I don't know why I can't turn it off
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:22.240]   It's almost like they're saying, you know what we're going to make this better for you and in general
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:28.880]   Yeah, that's is great to do that, but you know, just like you said every now and then you want to have those dark shadows
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.880]   There because it sets the mood for the scene
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:40.400]   Google is uh is actually adding to its memories feature. Do you like the memories feature? I love the memories feature. I do
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:44.000]   Yeah, I do what is the meme is that where they like just are like
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.560]   I stay in the same. Do you remember all those great meals you had in paris?
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:50.320]   Yeah, it's a little rough during the pandemic. Yeah
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:54.240]   Yeah, I'm like I kind of don't like actually
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:24:00.080]   I do like them because it's mostly pictures of my kid and then we all it's cute because
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:04.160]   Since we're all at home. I'm like, oh, remember when we did this
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.080]   Wow
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:08.080]   These sad moments were like, uh
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:14.080]   We absolutely dig it because it's been a bit of a bright spot every now and then
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.200]   Uh
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:20.640]   It's to me it's a deal with so much crap with this pandemic exactly stuff going on socially and
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:27.040]   Just every now and then that pops up just at the right time and say hey remember this and just it just takes you back for a second and
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.720]   You know
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:32.640]   It's uh one of the reasons I love my google nest hub max
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:38.480]   Oh, they discontinued that by the way. No, they did they just give them max. Yeah, the big
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:42.800]   Sorry, which I also love and i'm very sad about that is an awesome
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:45.680]   It makes me so they were going to discontinue that
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.680]   part speakers
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:51.920]   But that the one with the screen because I get a great slide show
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:59.760]   and and uh, it's uh, it's always going and every and uh same thing and i'll go oh remember that that was fun
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:04.880]   Oh, he was so young then that kind of thing is so much fun. Are you doing so we
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:07.840]   Google just enabled this but
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:11.360]   Sorry, I think we're in the middle of the change lock. Should I tell you this?
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:15.440]   Play the drums play the drums quick. Oh wait before she says anything
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:18.080]   I don't know if this is new play the drums
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:25.920]   Hope you're now in forbidden you are now in the change long go ahead
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:32.400]   I don't know when they changed it. They just changed it. They just did it. I guarantee you they added something called family note
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:36.160]   I don't know. Oh, yes, that is new to the display. Okay. Do you use that?
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:42.800]   So I just started using it and at first I just left my daughter because it shows so what you do is you say
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:47.280]   Hey geez create a family note and it's like what do you want the student to say and
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:53.120]   I started out with just silly notes like I love you kid and all these right, but now
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.560]   They and they display on all the displays around your house. Yeah on top of the photos. Yes like a post
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:00.560]   I do things like so
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.520]   My daughter when she's downstairs, I'll leave a note and I'll be like
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:09.200]   Bring up your laundry and then she'll see it and she'll bring up the laundry and it's nice because I know she's
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.760]   It's just a it's a less obtrusive way to talk to her when she's not
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.760]   in
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:21.280]   Upstairs with me and but I'd not interrupting her school. So we're using it a lot actually they got this
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:27.440]   November 18th. So it's new enough. I don't think we I don't know if we talked about it. So
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:32.800]   It's you can leave a note for somebody right. Can you put their name in it?
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:37.920]   And while you say you know, Andrew do this or okay
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:40.480]   And then I'll say it's from you have to say
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:45.760]   You also have to make sure you say family note because if you just say note, I don't know where it goes
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:48.560]   But it doesn't it goes into your note. Yeah, you probably google notes
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:51.200]   Go somewhere else never to be seen again
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:58.480]   So good. There you go. That's a guest appearance by stacy higginbotham in the google change log. Congratulations stacy
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.240]   Jeff
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:02.240]   But the democracy known as the google change
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:05.360]   I did have to change log
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:13.760]   I put half the change log thank you. Yeah, so just take that take that google photos is rolling out a series of updates to its memories feature
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:19.200]   That's the thing that we were talking about the surfaces your photos from uh from the good old days
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.760]   Memories will be expanded to include
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:24.880]   3d cinematic photos
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:28.800]   Updated collage designs and new types of memories
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:33.360]   Which may include the most important people in your life or your favorite things like sunsets
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.840]   Activities like baking or hiking
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:42.400]   Whatever seems to matter to you based on what they can determine from the photos that you upload you can hide
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.120]   specific people
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:50.800]   Jeff or time periods if there are parts of your photo history, you don't want to ever see
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:53.120]   You're gonna hide me
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:28:00.720]   Nice no you should be able to do that. Yeah, you don't have it also google's gonna think I love receipts
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:07.280]   It's gonna be like the white fourths remember that Amazon halo. You was a great receipt from the old days
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:10.560]   Cinematic I get a lot of those
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:13.520]   Remember that meal you ate here's the receipt for it
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:16.480]   Oh cinematic is neat
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:23.040]   So um it uses machine learning. This is more machine learning to create a 3d representation
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:28.880]   So on the left is a picture of a young girl in the fall leaves and the cinematic is on the right it created look
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:35.840]   She's she's moving closer to you. It's almost like the the Ken Burns effect. Yeah, hooray potter. Yeah
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:41.760]   Well google google did that like it turned like if you took a couple photos that would turn them into a gift
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.240]   Yeah, I never liked that
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:50.480]   Giffy things. Yeah, they're weird. Yeah occasionally it worked really well. I would try to bracket a shot
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:54.720]   And it would think that's a gift action shot. It was just yeah. Yeah
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:57.440]   And then here's
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.920]   Here's an example of what a collage
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:04.240]   Would look like so it's a number of photos kind of like it would be in a scrapbook
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.320]   Is it a do you say it collage? I always thought it was collage. It's collage
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:12.320]   Oh, okay. Good. We're southern or stacy. So it's collage
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:15.280]   It
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:17.280]   How do you say pecan?
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:19.280]   Pecan pecan obviously
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:21.920]   I already discussed that
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:25.920]   Is it really collage or is it collage? How do you say collage?
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.640]   collage
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.960]   Collage she just said that's pronounced collage
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:33.920]   Ask her how she says collage
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:44.960]   Collage collage so the emphasis is on the second one. Yes, it's not it's not a cooperative lage
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:48.080]   It's not a
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:50.720]   Collage
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:52.720]   collage
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:57.280]   She seems so uncloash. She's British. We don't we don't speak that English. We don't this is that well
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:59.280]   I don't say it like that either
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.600]   Well, I know but I was I was trying to help you
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:06.240]   I and I wasn't trying I just I can never be words collage
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:11.600]   Okay, so it's the emphasis is in the second second syllable syllable. Yes
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:15.600]   I've been saying around my whole life
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:21.040]   Back to this I have to rethink everything back to the change like back to google photos
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:25.760]   I know they added these features in but I wish it gave you a better
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:32.000]   Search for going through those highlights of memories because if you go into the app and you just sort of swipe through
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.560]   It's pretty limited
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:38.800]   I don't see any of the things that it showed me a couple of weeks ago
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.640]   but
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:47.040]   I wish I could just sort of pinpoint and say hey, I want to look at a memory that you select that you suggested to me from
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:50.800]   November 2020 something like that
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:56.400]   collage see that okay still trying to find somebody who says it how I do
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.520]   Nobody again find it
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:03.520]   And if you do they're wrong apparently
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:07.980]   There's the lodge and there's the collage
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:13.760]   Collage it does it together with the lodge college collage. This is like college
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:16.960]   Sort of college with a large
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:20.960]   No, it's not like college. It's just college. I'm like college. Well
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:25.600]   Well college is and fastest is on the second
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:30.000]   No, it's not college college. Oh, yeah, you're right college
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.400]   Right. So you're wrong
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:38.160]   Is it this French not rooted the world is it French? Is that why yes think of it is French?
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:41.440]   Good eye there you go
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:45.280]   Bless this heart
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:48.720]   Google has purchased never where
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:57.760]   Which really surprises me never where was a very ingenious company that was putting chromos on unapproved old pcs
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:05.120]   Uh, they've been doing this for five years with their cloud ready software schools businesses people with old laptops
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:11.040]   It was it was really cool. It was never approved by you know the chromos project
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:15.760]   I never understood my google wouldn't do this. Yeah obvious thing to do. Well, guess what?
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:18.320]   cloud ready will now be
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:21.040]   an official chromos release
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:28.000]   So this is really good news. It means google is going to allow people
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.680]   Uh
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:32.560]   Because there have been limitations you couldn't do the android apps
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:38.720]   With cloud ready and so forth. So this is fantastic. It means that I just tricked you
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:41.360]   So this won't come back to my
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:47.760]   FTC one file and thank you for moving and i'm not paying any attention to the line numbers now. Sorry. Sorry
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:52.640]   All right, yeah, the feud goes on it's the hat feels in mccoys
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:33:00.080]   I was saying what do you think this would be something that turns around and bites them, you know, five ten years from now?
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:01.680]   Oh, this is good
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:06.080]   Happening with facebook because they are acquired another company. Oh, no, no, no
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:13.120]   This is it big. I don't think never where ever competed or was ever excited to compete against a chromos or a google
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:16.320]   You're gonna get rid of your five thousand dollar Mac and now time
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:21.520]   This is actually great news. I'm very pleased how much did never wear a cost
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:25.440]   How much did they buy it for they didn't say no no no no no
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:28.240]   Oh, it was kind of free. I don't remember what the
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:32.480]   I mean there you could download it and install it for free. I guess
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:36.160]   There were some situations. There was a home edition
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:41.360]   And maybe if you were a school and you were putting it on a lot of them or something that there were some yeah because there
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:43.760]   it says requested trial so
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:48.240]   I guess they were charging but I I used it and actually I found it to be
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:52.240]   not always working so it's free for your
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:58.560]   home use for tinker's parents students other humans ready for a better os. I'm on this is on the cloud ready
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:02.480]   webpage $20 per device for education annually
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:08.480]   Okay, but I bet you google that's just give a read. Yeah, they're not going to charge for this. Yeah
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.280]   So so I the reason I asked that was
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:14.880]   How so you're trying to think if there's an antitrust
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:20.880]   Heavens, well you could argue if it's facebook. Oh my god. They bought another company to put it out of business
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:23.520]   if it's google
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:26.080]   Snuffle up against google
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:28.960]   They're
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:33.280]   I don't know it's interesting because because are they are they trying to dump on the market?
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:35.360]   I guess it's the only way I would see it
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:37.760]   No, I yeah, I don't think that's this is not
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:40.640]   a candidate for
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:44.160]   I don't think but who knows
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:47.360]   Who knows
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:52.960]   The google designs best of 2020 is out you want to see some of those
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:58.880]   Sure designs of what I don't know. Yeah, I was like what kind of designs
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:01.120]   Uh
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:05.360]   Best cameo appearance. He's listening to scooter X. I am
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:10.080]   Best it's a pretty page though. Look at that best of 2020
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:13.120]   a look back at the years most resilient
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:16.080]   design projects what does that mean
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:21.440]   Experiences that bring the world closer to you those that covid did not squash. Yes
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:24.880]   um
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:26.880]   The google arts and culture team
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:30.320]   Bringing a museum to you. I don't know. This is a nice page
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.400]   Yeah, the blob opera was arts and culture
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:41.280]   Um, yes, here's the solely sandbox boy that never went anywhere from a tap
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:48.000]   Here's pixel essential apps and google creative lab. Oh, this is actually this was this was very cool
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:55.200]   The ability to edit auto clips in the recorder app audio clips in the recorder app by selecting a text this became descriptive course
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:59.520]   Um, which is widely used now by podcasters to do something similar
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.040]   Uh, acidifying oceans. This is also google. So these are all within a google
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:10.880]   Timelines these are just pretty things nice things
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:14.080]   Pixel 5g they gave themselves an award
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:17.120]   That's nice
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:20.560]   Uh, it's like trump giving these other words
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:27.680]   How do you like that? That's uh font called frances or maybe it's frances. I don't know
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:29.840]   Um
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:33.360]   In texas, it's frances frances really with it you even
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:38.880]   Francis, uh, Edward mibrege animation as a variable font
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:41.680]   Wow, that's interesting. Huh?
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:45.840]   Okay, that's that moving on back to the changelog
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:49.520]   That was the scooter x changelog. You're right. You exactly right
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:57.760]   Scooter x is very good. Uh scooter x does I like his alternative train. I love his the scooter x alternative changelog. I agree
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:59.760]   100
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:03.040]   Chromecast is getting an apple tv app which is
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:09.760]   Just bizarre apple is slowly put apple tv on tv's on other people's devices
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:14.000]   It was for a long time, uh, an exclusive on apple zone tv
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.680]   Uh, but I guess because they have apple tv plus they want people to subscribe to it
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:23.120]   So coming in early 2021 if you have a chromecast the latest chromecast with google tv
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:27.360]   There will be an apple tv app. I have to say my experience has been that the apple tv app
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.600]   Is not quite as good as apple tv on an apple tv which would kind of make sense
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:37.040]   Have you used that chromecast? Yes, I love it
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:40.800]   You know the only thing it's really now it's a frustration of me
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:45.360]   Is I can't play stadia games on it for some reason you have to have a chromecast ultra for that
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:52.720]   So, um, I'm replacing it with a chromecast ultra only because I want to play the game on my tv
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:57.840]   Google is cutting prices on google 1 storage
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:01.680]   Just the highest tiers just the most 50 percent
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:05.600]   Yeah, it's a big cut and it's it's really kind of do
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.760]   So
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:11.760]   I don't know if you get the 10 terabyte tier. I don't even know if there was a 10 terabyte
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:15.520]   I get the 2 terabyte that's down from $99 a month
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:18.160]   To $50 a month
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:24.160]   Month to god, that's a lot. That's pronounced monday. Let me go. That's not the two. That's not the two terabyte
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:26.720]   10 terabytes 10 terabytes
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:28.320]   Terabytes
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:34.800]   Is is down from 200 to 100 bucks 30 terabytes from 300 to 150 bucks. So those are all cut in half
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:40.560]   Why why do you need that for a business for business for business business
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:46.320]   For a business business. I was like I have a business and I do not have that much story
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:51.280]   You don't have employees if you had a lot of employees all with google accounts employees you do
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.160]   I have one
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:39:00.160]   My other employee is a contract worker. I bet your husband considers you his employee
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:02.800]   Have you nonsense? He would never
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:11.680]   He's too smart for that. He is a smart man who is very adept at living with yes boss. He says
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:13.760]   Yeah, I say yes, but at least it too
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:17.360]   Um, yeah, but if you had like a lot of enterprises use
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:18.880]   Actually though
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:23.600]   I'm kind of think of it if you use workspace. I think you're gonna terabyte per employee anyway
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:28.720]   So I don't know I get lots of yeah, there's tons of storage storage. Yeah, I don't know what that this is for
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:33.040]   For people using the big 10 terabyte, maybe it's for photographers
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:38.880]   Well, I I had to go up to the two terabyte. I use two as well. Two is a good amount
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:44.720]   Yeah, I used to I'm still on the free tier and I haven't cracked it. That's only 15 gigs
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:49.360]   I don't you don't store stuff in the cloud. Yeah
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:52.480]   You see probably clean things up
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:56.320]   I I went the google way and said I'll just search everything in my life
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:00.720]   It's easy and it's much better. That's just sloppy. It's just sloppy the other day
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:03.280]   I was I've never done this and I don't know why I've never done this
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.920]   But I have as we were talking about the nest up max which has a camera
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.040]   And the other day I did a meeting in it. It was great
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:12.160]   in fact if you use
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.800]   meet
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:16.800]   With google meet oh
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:21.120]   You can actually get zoomed. Well now that's the story. I was meeting up to that. I'm sorry
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.760]   I just dumped on your side
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:27.520]   Yeah, you sure did Stacy. Geez thought that I have ever done that of course
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:29.360]   Uh, so that's good now
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:35.120]   These you can now do zoom calls on your nest up max as well as google me and duo I should I think I did duo
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:39.360]   But you know it's good because the camera follows you around as a little my I was doing with my daughter
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:41.360]   She said that's creepy. Stop it
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:43.840]   Because I was going like this and the camera would move over
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:51.280]   So I am really excited. I'll be honest it's surveilled for google to with their next generation
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:56.240]   Like displays to do what amazon has done by mimicking the portal
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:02.080]   Yeah, so amazon now has it on their displays where it physically moves around. Yep, which will be key and then
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:08.720]   When google can do it google does do it. I was just saying physically move the display. They just move your
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:16.320]   They move they they move the camera, but they can't rotate the display to follow you issue like the literal portal rotates
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:20.960]   The portal I believe rotates well amazon's rotates
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:25.440]   Amazon I had the original portal it didn't go anywhere. I just oh
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:31.040]   Well google's google's displays have followed you for a while because I was in my old house and it would follow me around
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:36.720]   Yeah, I was really surprised. I didn't know that no, I wasn't saying it was new. I just I was saying it was new to me
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:41.840]   Okay, it's like family notes. Yeah, it's like family that's and by the way
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:45.520]   They are going to upgrade the google or nest Wi-Fi system
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:53.280]   For video calling so they're gonna automatic. That's interesting. Yeah, it's a qos quality of service
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:58.960]   A lot of routers you can do this manually where you say look if i'm you know this this IP address
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:02.320]   I want this to get an improved service because i'm streaming or whatever
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:04.880]   Uh, the device will detect
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:07.440]   Video call traffic for either me or zoom
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:13.520]   And it should prioritize it and say no no no no no i want network neutrality in my router
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:19.680]   Uh-oh no well zoom is not a google product. So maybe that's maybe you know what that may be why they're doing it
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:27.120]   That may be why they're good because normals aren't doing qos settings. It's just not well because it's hard. Yeah
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:29.680]   Yeah, you gotta know what you're doing
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:35.760]   So as you said, i'm very sad and i think we're gonna add this to the google graveyard the 400 dollar
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.240]   12 pound
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:40.000]   giant speaker
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.120]   In the google family the home max it sounded good. I think it
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:49.360]   It was as good as you know the home pot any other high quality digital speaker. I really like it
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:52.160]   I listened to it this morning. I listened to it all the time
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:58.560]   But uh, I think 40 dollars is probably too much and I saw four dozen a lot and last week
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:03.280]   You gasped on twitter at the new apple headphones
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:09.520]   Five hundred fifty bucks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's um, but the thing is
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:17.600]   They're going to still sell a ton of those because the people in that apple market are used to that type of pricing
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:23.760]   You know it is a little weird that google now the best speaker google offers is just a little hundred dollar
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:26.640]   Nest audio losses
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:32.480]   So we actually talked about this a while back kevin and i just because I was in this market for I have a huge room
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:34.720]   It's like by 20 by 20
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:40.880]   Everything upstairs basically and we were trying to figure out what I needed to fill that space
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:44.960]   Adequately and really the only option was either sonos
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:49.440]   You know tied to something like the big sonosis or
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:53.920]   You know go for actual real speakers. That's what I would do. Yeah
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:58.240]   I I went with two nest audios and they sound really really good
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:03.200]   They because you can pair them for stereo sound they're only 200 bucks with $100 each
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.760]   And you think that that's a good sound
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:11.120]   It's a it doesn't fill the whole room, but it's okay, but it sounds really good
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:15.360]   And it's better than the echoes which were too bassy for me
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:22.000]   Yeah, and I even like it the the home pods. I have two of the home pod minis. Sorry two home pod minis the hundred dollar ones
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:25.440]   Yeah, and so of all the $99 speakers
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:31.840]   As a pair those the nest audio were interesting you prefer those to all the others. Oh, look what's that?
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:34.320]   What's what's mr. Eckow?
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:39.440]   Braven mini it's a beer can speak at these for 20 bucks now looks like one of those
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:42.320]   100 calorie Coke cans
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:45.520]   The middle mini Coke yeah pretty close to yeah
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:52.400]   You can get a pair of these and they'll do stereo. I have two of them and I stick them in a room and it fills up the room
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:56.720]   nice especially if you put them in a corner right you get the the reverb so
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:58.880]   yeah
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:00.880]   20 bucks
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:04.560]   I'm going the other direction. I ended up buying went out and bought fancy
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:10.240]   Elax speakers and upgraded my audio everywhere. I just decided if I'm gonna be stuck at home
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:14.640]   I'm not compromising although the max is so the max is in the bathroom now
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:20.480]   That's and that's fine for the bathroom. Yeah, but um I have nice a huge thing in a bathroom
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:23.360]   I got a big bathroom
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:33.280]   And a lot of leather bound books. Yeah, I got a book shoved in there and hogging 70 inch tv, you know
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:37.920]   Now the bathroom toilet the bathroom is
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:44.000]   Has two sinks and in the middle it's a lower thing which I think it's supposed to be like a vanity that you would sit at
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:50.160]   But nobody uses that so it's perfect for the max. Yeah. Yeah, only your house
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:52.160]   I
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:56.240]   Know I used to have a speaker in the bathroom in I still do like
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:59.680]   No, it's great because I listen to the podcast or music
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:02.160]   You know if I'm if I'm going to work and I want to get up
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:06.800]   You know I have them play a little Bruce Springsteen and get get in the mood and stuff like that. I find that very
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:10.960]   Handy it doesn't even a great shower. Yeah, it's not in the shower
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:16.240]   So it doesn't have to be waterproof, but it's and so it gets a little not as loud when I'm in the shower
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:21.120]   But it's okay. It gets me up. It's good. And I listen this morning. I listen to podcasts on it
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:24.560]   It's a good way to start
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:27.600]   Uh in the shower screaming
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:38.080]   Anything else in the change luck y'all yeah, I'm going on the wild and the innocent the history shuffle greatest album ever made
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:40.080]   Well the first three songs anyway
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:42.960]   Um, that's it that's
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:47.920]   That's all you're doing. You're not gonna do the new pixel feature. Oh, yeah. Oh, I missed that one. You're right
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:51.680]   There's a new I got it right here the new pixel feature drop
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:47:01.280]   It adds more battery optimizations adaptive sound and yes, you don't have to have a pixel five you can have a four a five g or a four a
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:06.000]   Uh the pixel three or newer so this four xl will also get it
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:12.400]   You're gonna get hold for me the one where you put it on hold and then the assistant says hey they're on now come on back
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:18.080]   Which I think is great extreme battery saver mode screen sharing on duo calls
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:21.040]   Um
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:23.200]   Let's see what else
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:26.960]   So these are this is one thing google really I think does right
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.800]   They
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:32.560]   It I guess because it makes you feel like well, why don't they give it to me in the first place
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:38.880]   But at least over time even with an older google pixel you're getting new features. It better stuff, which is pretty cool
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:44.720]   Uh, and I did get the got that in the december uh security update at the same time
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:49.200]   So I think that's uh, there's a good reason I have a pixel phone if you're gonna use android I think
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:53.920]   Um, there's new suggestions in google photos including dynamic
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:48:00.160]   Which which enhances brightness contrast and color and oh, that's cool and a set of sky suggestions
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:04.560]   Which helped you create stunning sunsets even if it wasn't so stunning
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:08.560]   Uh ai ai ai ai ai ai
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:16.900]   the guy, Adaptive Sound is an interesting idea. It uses the microphone on the phone to adapt
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:22.320]   the sound quality from the phone speaker, which is terrible. I've seen things do this
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:27.180]   in effect. All those digital speakers we've talked about in theory use the microphone to
[01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:33.760]   adjust the acoustics. The problem is the speaker and the Pixel is not the greatest in the world.
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:34.760]   Google says...
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:35.760]   It's not the greatest on most phones.
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:42.800]   It's the right. I know it isn't. How much can you optimize it? It equalizes the sound
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:47.480]   based on your settings. Google is quick to tell you that all microphone audio is deleted
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:53.060]   shortly after it's recorded. It's processed locally, never leaves your device. Audio and
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:59.000]   background conversations are never sent to Google. I guess I got to say that.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:04.720]   You can change the grid size. Wow. I use a customized launcher, a third-party launcher
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:11.080]   to do this. You now can use the Pixel launcher to customize the grid size of your icons.
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:15.120]   There is a feature I wish they would add because this is one of the reasons I use a third-party
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:18.880]   launcher, the action launcher. I like to get rid of... I know that's the phone. I don't
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:23.160]   need a text underneath the icon to tell me that's the phone or the Play Store or Google
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:28.000]   Chrome. I wish I could get rid of all of those. But no, you can't do that, but you can at
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:33.760]   least squish them in tight together. That's all in the new drop. If you don't update your
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:41.840]   Pixel regularly, you should. And that's the Google change lock.
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:49.040]   Your picks of the week, we will wrap this puppy up with a bow in just a little bit, but first...
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:56.520]   You want to do it again, really? One more time? It's just like I was doing the Facebook
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:00.400]   as evil story over and over and over again. So you might as well do the change log a few
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:08.240]   times. What's the difference? Why not? So if you want me to never again mention Facebook
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:15.600]   on this show? No, I'm not saying that. Oh God, please. I would love it. Okay. It's a
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:22.960]   democracy all of a sudden. I thought it was a democracy. I will not bring it up ever again.
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:29.520]   I'll criticize Facebook today. Honestly, because I don't have... Hey, we're talking about Facebook.
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:35.600]   I don't have Facebook. It's not on my radar. I bring these up just to annoy Jeff. I don't really care.
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:41.360]   That's true. That's true. I don't care. It's still topical though.
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:49.040]   It's topical. Let's go. Our show today brought to you my command line heroes. This is an interesting
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:54.160]   debate. We're going to get back to this command line heroes is a podcast. Oh, I love this. Another
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:51:00.960]   great podcast with Seran, who is really inspiring. She's an amazing host. But she brings together
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:06.800]   developers and programmers and hackers and geeks and open source rebels past seasons have brought
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:15.120]   some of the most interesting people on including guys and gals who are my heroes, the leaders of
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:22.800]   the geek revolution. She's up to season six now, which is all the whole season is dedicated to the
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:29.440]   stories of black technologists who innovated and invented despite systemic racism and unfair
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:35.680]   hiring practices, in equal education opportunities. Some of the people you'll meet Gladys West.
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:41.680]   You'd see this is the problem. You don't know her name. But her mathematical models and data
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:48.480]   analysis paved the way for GPS. Jerry Lawson invented the first cartridge-based video game console
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:53.200]   before there was an Atari and Nintendo or Sega. And then there's Mark Dean. He was raised in the
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:52:01.040]   Jim Crow South grew up to revolutionize a PC industry inventor of the ISA bus. You're going to
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:08.320]   really enjoy this. And you know, these are these are people who law their recognition is long overdue.
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:14.560]   So it's really great. Seran does a wonderful job. Go and search for command line heroes in your
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:22.480]   podcast app and subscribe to it command line heroes. And this is this very important season,
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:26.880]   I think, and Seran did a really good job with it. Download it today. Our thanks to command line
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:33.040]   heroes command line heroes downloaded today. Our thanks to command line heroes for their support.
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:40.240]   We are wrapping this show up with our picks of the week. And as always, I'd like to begin
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:49.360]   with Stacy Higginbotham. Okay, so I am going to do an update because people asked me and I'm a little
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:56.160]   late. I was going to do it last week, but I wasn't here. Last year at Christmas, I told you all about
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:53:02.160]   my Twinkly lights. They were expensive. John, John, John, do you have the video of your Twinkly
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:07.920]   lights at work? John has put them on his house. He loves them. I had no idea about those and he
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:13.680]   showed them to me. So I feel terrible because I should have told you the update actually, honestly,
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:20.720]   Thanksgiving. I'm a bad person. But this year, I added and it's super expensive right now. So
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:25.360]   don't buy it this year, but put it on your list for next year, like set a reminder. The spritzer.
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:32.400]   The spritzer. What the heck is the spritzer, Stacy? Well, wait a minute now.
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:38.160]   Close the window. Hold on. Because I searched for it and I don't think you're going to talk
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:45.360]   about what I just found. So you better tell us. No, no. I already know that it's not what you found.
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:53.200]   Let me just not Google it. What is the spritzer? I don't know. Leo, I just Googled it and it's
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:54:03.680]   fine. But I'm getting specially coded results just for me. It's a spritz of
[01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:12.080]   coins like strings. Oh, the spritz are lights. Okay. Twinkly. Three-dimensional lights.
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:18.320]   It is from Twinkly. And so I am using this. I didn't pull it out into a circle kind of formation.
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:24.000]   I just pulled it out a little bit and now it's a star on my tree. All right. Which is get ready.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:30.640]   Here comes a video of the spritzer from Holodynamics, which is one of the companies that sells it.
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:36.800]   But you say this is a Twinkly lights thing. It is. Is this it? Is this it? That is it. That's
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:42.240]   it. So he has it all into the ball shape, but you can actually do it more in a fan shape,
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:45.280]   which makes it better. You could actually use it like that as a tree topper too.
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:57.280]   So and it comes in, I think, 200 and 120. And y'all, just these lights, this is my second year with
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:02.800]   them. I have them outside for like six months. I brought them inside for my Christmas tree.
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:05.520]   So these are also like spritzer. These are app controlled.
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:11.920]   These are app control. You have they have mapping capabilities. What? What? Mapping.
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:19.680]   Strands. So the light strands you can put on your house. Oh, John used John used them to do the
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:25.600]   Twit logo in his house. You want to see? Yes. Sort of the Twit logo, but there it is. Yeah.
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:32.720]   Those are Twinkly's. Yeah. And is that a spritzer on the Twit logo? John? No, that's not the spritzer.
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:40.080]   That's next year's icicles. John's all in. So the Twinkly spritzer.
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:48.160]   So I'm just going to say the Twinkly lights so far still going strong, still loving them.
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:52.480]   The app is great. People complain a little bit about the mapping, which can be a little
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:58.080]   iffy. And you have to, the one thing I will say is every time you get a new tree, you have to
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:03.360]   hardware, you have to reset the lights because if you get a real tree, you're going to set it up
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:06.880]   in a different configuration. Oh, yeah, you can't get the lights where they were last year. Yeah,
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:10.960]   that makes sense. Exactly. But if you have like a curtain kind of, they have curtains like what
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:15.280]   you're seeing there, you could just set it once and let it. Yeah, John's curtains will always look
[01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:22.000]   that way. Yeah. They don't have to though. You can download new patterns and just apply them with
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.960]   a flip of a button. I love these things. I love them so much. And I'm sorry I didn't tell you about
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:31.440]   them earlier so you could buy them. It's too late. We already decorated my tree. Look at this.
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:36.240]   This is cool. So you can take, you can actually kind of like paint your tree with the app. So the
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:42.240]   lights are on the tree and now he's in the app. He's painting by dragging his finger on to light
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:48.800]   up the lights. This is so cool. That's crazy. And if you're like us, I will say, if you are like a
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:53.440]   completist OCD person, these will drive you nuts because when you're painting, they're never perfect.
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:58.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And you're going to be like, I want that one. Right. And that's going to drive
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:04.720]   you nuts. But I love these. They're pricey, but so good. You know, it's funny because I couldn't
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:09.040]   remember who recommended them. Pretty much every one of our hosts seems to be using them now.
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:15.360]   So Laurie Gill has them, Andy and I co has them. Was Laurie the first to mention Twinkly?
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:20.320]   Okay. So we give Laurie a credit, but Stacy's also been flogging the Twinkles.
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:26.160]   And I'm not flogging the Twinkles. I bought them last year because I have been, I will say for the
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:32.480]   last eight years, ever since I got into IoT, I have tried many versions of active lights. Yeah.
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:40.400]   And those were the first ones that I like was like, you do everything I need, you do it in a way that's
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:46.240]   easy and consistent because a lot of them not consistent. And the nice thing is now,
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:49.520]   and probably in the next year or so, you're going to see the Twinkly,
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:53.360]   Twinkles, and those probably should be fine.
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:58.800]   Which would they be bright enough, John? Do you have them like behind me in the studio or that
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:01.520]   they would be? They're pretty bright. Okay. They're crazy.
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:03.040]   I wish you'd get some Twinkles.
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:09.120]   You probably can you go to the Home Depot and get them or do you have to get, you can? Okay.
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:12.800]   So I might run and get some so that we can have it for our, because Jeff,
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:14.880]   you're just trying for a, for a tent, aren't you?
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:21.920]   Jeff, you're going to be on the OG Twit on Sunday with old guy Twit.
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:24.560]   Old guy. No, original gangster Twit.
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:32.560]   With Steve Gibson and Paul Therat and me, and it's going to be a really fun, it's our holiday
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:36.400]   special, and I should have some Twinkles, I think, to really dress it up.
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:38.080]   Everyone should have a tent.
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:39.680]   Trying for that 10 out of 10. I know what you're doing.
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:41.200]   10 out of 10. Trying for room raider.
[01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:45.200]   I can't believe he only gave me eight. I'm just bummed.
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:46.960]   It was all for effort too.
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:48.320]   It was eight for effort.
[01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:49.280]   You don't do wrong.
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:52.080]   Do you really don't do well in class, but you get an A for effort?
[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:54.080]   Because he showed up. That's pretty much why.
[01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:56.400]   Technically, it's not your home, though, Leo.
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:57.600]   It's a studio.
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:00.560]   It is. So it's not fair. I shouldn't really be in the competition.
[01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:04.160]   Actually, the fact that you got an eight is really shameful.
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:08.000]   Given the superficial broadcast studio.
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.680]   I was like, wait a second.
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:11.360]   But he didn't see all the things.
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:14.240]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:18.880]   So Mackenzie Scott, who received...
[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:20.800]   Used to be Mackenzie Bezos.
[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:22.160]   You might know her under that name.
[01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:23.840]   I don't want to use her dead name, but yes.
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:26.400]   Okay, that's not a dead name.
[01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:27.040]   Bad Jeff.
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:27.600]   That's not...
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:28.080]   What is it?
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:28.800]   Oh, it's not okay.
[01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:30.400]   It's her former name.
[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:33.680]   But she did chose to chase the name.
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:34.720]   Yeah, she didn't want to be a base.
[01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:35.200]   Because he's got...
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:38.560]   Just gave away $4.2 billion
[01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:43.760]   to 384 organizations across the US in the past four months.
[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:49.040]   Including, I'm delighted to say not to my college,
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:50.800]   not to my school particularly, but to CUNY,
[01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:53.040]   my university, $60 million.
[01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:53.600]   What?
[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:54.400]   That's the largest...
[01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:54.800]   Whoa.
[01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:57.280]   I guess we've ever gotten four Manhattan Community College
[01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:57.760]   and layman and college.
[01:59:57.760 --> 01:59:58.240]   So great.
[01:59:58.240 --> 01:59:59.680]   Which served...
[01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:00.320]   She gave Prairie View...
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:01.040]   You have a few people in New York.
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:03.840]   Yeah, she gave Prairie View A&M,
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:04.720]   which is a...
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:07.280]   I don't know if it's a formerly historically Black college,
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:08.640]   but that is...
[02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:10.800]   I think it might be.
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:17.120]   She gave them $50 million to pay for students tuition bills.
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:17.600]   Nice.
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:19.280]   For like during this time,
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:22.160]   when a lot of kids who have to also work
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:23.680]   and do things to make their...
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:24.720]   Yeah, so I was like...
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:25.520]   I saw that and I was like...
[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:26.720]   Yes.
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:27.920]   It's actually interesting,
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:29.520]   because she, in her divorce settlement,
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:30.880]   she got $38 billion.
[02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:34.000]   But like so many billionaires,
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.920]   COVID has been very, very good to her.
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:42.480]   She made an additional $23.6 billion this year alone.
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:46.240]   So good for Mackenzie Scott giving away
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:48.880]   so much of that money.
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:51.840]   She plans of course, to give back much of her wealth.
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:53.600]   It was...
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:55.840]   So she says on the Medium post where she announced it,
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:57.600]   "The team sought suggestions in perspective
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:00:58.800]   from hundreds of field experts,
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:01.120]   funders, non-profit leaders, volunteers,
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:03.760]   leverage this knowledge with collaboration
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:05.360]   with hundreds of emails and phone interviews."
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:08.160]   That's the hardest thing is you may have the money,
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:10.000]   but it's hard to know where to give it.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:10.960]   It's very hard.
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:11.680]   Yeah.
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:12.560]   The last of the three is hard.
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:16.960]   They looked at 6,490 organizations,
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:19.840]   undertook deeper research into 822,
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:22.880]   and then they put these 438 out there
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:25.520]   for evidence of impact on proven management team.
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:26.160]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:30.400]   They put 438 on hold while they,
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:31.680]   I think they could do better,
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:34.480]   but it's research driven and rigorous,
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:36.560]   but that gives them the opportunity to be human and soft.
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:39.920]   Well, there was this pandemic.
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:42.160]   It was a wind, you know, as much as it hurt,
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:47.760]   the lower 90%, the upper 1%,
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:49.520]   and especially the upper 0.1%.
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:52.640]   It was a huge boon to them,
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:53.840]   and they should feel guilty,
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:56.080]   and they should give it to Charity,
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:01:57.200]   at least some of it.
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:01:59.520]   They should give back what the windfall profits
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:01.200]   from the pandemic, I think,
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:02.080]   and good for her.
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:02.800]   She's doing it.
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:05.600]   And I think now the onus is on the rest of them.
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:08.560]   We should do the Mackenzie Scott Ice Bucket Challenge.
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:11.520]   She says, "Okay, now I challenge you, Jeff,
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:12.880]   to give 40 billion away.
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:13.280]   Good luck."
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:14.560]   Yeah.
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:16.080]   Nice number.
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:17.840]   And prove it.
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:18.480]   Pick of the week.
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:19.520]   4 billion.
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:20.080]   4 billion.
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:21.040]   No, it's 40 billion.
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:24.880]   No, but Jeff should give 10 times more away,
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:25.680]   because he's Jeff.
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:26.560]   Yeah, I see, right.
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:28.960]   He can.
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:31.520]   My pick I have to,
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:35.760]   first one is going to be this interesting,
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:38.560]   inexpensive camera gimbal.
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:44.080]   People watched our awesome hands on tech,
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:46.480]   where I did the review of the Van Move E-bike.
[02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:46.800]   Yeah.
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:50.080]   Oh, is this a lot of comments about the B-roll?
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:50.720]   Yeah.
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:54.000]   And I said, "Well, yeah, I used a gimbal,
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.080]   and it was this gimbal here that I was trying out."
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:58.800]   And it's inexpensive.
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:02.720]   It's about $100 cheaper than the DJI model
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:04.480]   that's comparable to this one.
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:07.360]   It doesn't require an app to be used.
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:11.680]   You can just balance your device on there and get the shooting.
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:13.120]   That's the hardest thing with a gimbal.
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:16.000]   I often spend more time balancing than shooting.
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:20.160]   Well, this one has a couple locks on it to make balance in it a little bit easier.
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:30.560]   They tout having more payload capacity, including the massive 24-105 lens from Canon.
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:31.040]   Wow.
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:35.120]   I'm going to call it a little bit of a fudge on that one,
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:37.920]   but it does seem, it still works pretty well.
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:41.520]   Like I said, I shot that footage for the hands on tech series.
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:43.920]   Are you going to review this for hands on tech?
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:45.120]   Pardon?
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:46.720]   You're going to review this for hands on tech?
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:48.640]   I would like to.
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:51.440]   Feu, F-E-I-Y-U tech.
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:54.080]   The AK-2000C.
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:55.680]   AK-2000C.
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:56.480]   Nice.
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:58.720]   Inexpensive gimbal for filmmakers.
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:03:59.760]   229.
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:04.400]   And my other pick is a, I did a little bit of writing recently,
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:06.880]   and I would appreciate it if folks go and check it out.
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:09.600]   It's over on the Scott Kelby blog,
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:10.560]   Kelby One blog.
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:11.760]   Scott's an old friend.
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:14.800]   And I just shared my thoughts on people being in a bit of a
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:16.800]   creative rut, especially right now,
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:19.120]   because things are locking down yet again,
[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:21.360]   and it's in the run out of ideas.
[02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:25.280]   And I tell you, shut up, just get up and grab your camera
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:26.160]   and start shooting.
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:27.360]   It's out of the rut.
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:30.000]   Good.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:30.560]   It's really good.
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:32.560]   Discomfort breeds creativity.
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:33.760]   Just go do it.
[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:34.320]   Very nice.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:36.960]   Scott Kelby.com guest blog.
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:39.280]   By our very own Ant-Proit.
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:43.680]   Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come to say goodbye
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:45.120]   to all the family and Jeff.
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:50.080]   Just cut that.
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:52.880]   No, actually Jeff's going to be back.
[02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:53.600]   Scrooge.
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:56.400]   He's going to be back on Sunday for our old guy, Twit.
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:05:00.000]   But we will not be back next Wednesday.
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.920]   It'll be the best of highlights.
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:04.080]   It's really interesting to watch these best ofs.
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:06.080]   Poor guys have to edit our Facebook discussion today
[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:07.040]   into that show with one.
[02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:08.800]   No, that's not a best of by any means.
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:11.040]   No, don't let anyone hear that again.
[02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:16.960]   But I have to say it's funny because this has been a long year.
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:21.760]   The year begins on the best ofs with CES pre-pandemic.
[02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:22.720]   Oh, what a change.
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:24.800]   And that seems like 100 years ago now.
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:25.440]   Does it ever?
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:25.840]   Yeah.
[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:29.040]   So the best ofs are interesting in all the shows this year
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:31.520]   because of that suddenly around March,
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:34.560]   so everything changes and the whole idea changes.
[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:37.040]   And we look kind of like a little sad.
[02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:39.920]   Do our-- does our hair get longer?
[02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:40.400]   Because I've had--
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:40.960]   Hair gets longer.
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:42.640]   I pull my hair back into a ponytail.
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:43.280]   Shag year.
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:43.760]   I mean--
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:45.520]   Yeah, it's interesting to watch these.
[02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:50.160]   So that will be next Wednesday, the 23rd.
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:50.960]   Oh, sorry.
[02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:52.000]   But we will be back.
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.400]   And I want to invite you all to join us
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:57.200]   not only this Sunday on the 20th for the OG Twit,
[02:05:57.200 --> 02:06:02.000]   but two weeks from today, which is the 30th,
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000]   because that'll be our look back at the year bit.
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.360]   Also, maybe more importantly, I look ahead to 2021.
[02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:10.640]   And I hope you will all join me and prove it
[02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:12.640]   from the hands of photography, hands on wellness,
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:13.360]   Jeff Jarvis.
[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:17.120]   It's OK.
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:17.520]   It's OK.
[02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:18.320]   It'll be true.
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:18.880]   It's OK.
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:19.760]   I'll read it.
[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:22.480]   The director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial
[02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:26.160]   Journalism at the Great New Mark Graduate School of Journalism.
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:28.480]   What could you say, former TV guide critic?
[02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:30.720]   At the City University, no, I want-- you know what?
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:33.200]   I'm proud of the fact that we have a prestigious
[02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:34.320]   guy like you on the show.
[02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:36.960]   So we got to sell that.
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:39.520]   Buzzmachine.com is his blog.
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:41.920]   Stacey is at StaceyOnIOT.com.
[02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:43.200]   There's a great newsletter there.
[02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:44.560]   You must subscribe.
[02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:45.840]   You should also look at the events,
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:48.880]   because she's always throwing interesting events
[02:06:48.880 --> 02:06:50.080]   that are free to join.
[02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:51.440]   And you can learn a lot from.
[02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:53.600]   Virtual parties.
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:54.640]   Virtual parties.
[02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:57.760]   And follow her fleets on Twitter.
[02:06:57.760 --> 02:06:59.360]   Are you fleeting?
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:06:59.760]   It's all.
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:01.600]   I'm fleeting my dog.
[02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:02.640]   Right now, I don't have any fleets,
[02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:04.960]   because my dog is just sleeping on the carpet next to me.
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:05.360]   But--
[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:05.760]   Aww.
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:07.040]   Aww.
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:08.560]   I got a fleet.
[02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:09.840]   That's-- I mean, it's--
[02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:11.200]   You got to get on Twitter.
[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:12.080]   You too got a fleet.
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:13.760]   But you got to find something fleet worthy.
[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:14.720]   Yeah, that's my problem.
[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:16.240]   I look at it and I go, that's not fleet worthy.
[02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:20.160]   So I go back to playing Animal Crossing and just shut up.
[02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:22.400]   It appears in 24 hours.
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:24.800]   The bar is low.
[02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:25.680]   The bar is low.
[02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:27.520]   But it isn't really, is it?
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:30.240]   People put good stuff up there, and that's the problem.
[02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:31.920]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:32.720]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:33.440]   Thank you, Ant.
[02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:35.040]   Thank you all for joining us.
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:39.920]   This week in Google is a Wednesday afternoon show for us about 2 o'clock,
[02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:44.160]   Pacific time, 5 p.m. Eastern time, 2,200 UTC.
[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:49.040]   You can watch us do it live before we cut out all the swearing and the fist fights and all that stuff.
[02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:53.600]   The live stream is at twit.tv/live, audio or video.
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:55.120]   If you're doing that though, if you're doing live,
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:58.080]   you really should be in the chatroom, IRC.twit.tv.
[02:07:58.080 --> 02:08:00.160]   Lots of people in there watching live as well.
[02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:03.120]   On demand, everything we do is available at twit.tv.
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:05.760]   This show is twit.tv/twig.
[02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:07.920]   You can download it there.
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:09.680]   You can, there's a YouTube channel.
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:12.560]   You can subscribe to our YouTube channel and watch all the shows there.
[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:14.480]   Every show we do has a YouTube channel as well.
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:18.880]   Best thing I think though is get your favorite podcast app and subscribe.
[02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:21.120]   That way you'll get it automatically.
[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:23.440]   The minute it's available.
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:25.600]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:27.360]   Sorry about the music last week.
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:29.280]   Sorry about the Fisticuffs this week.
[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:33.520]   I promise no Facebook stories in 2021.
[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:38.560]   We're just going to pretend it doesn't exist, which frankly I think will be good for everybody.
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:40.960]   We'll see you next time on this week in Google.
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:41.840]   Bye-bye everybody.
[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:45.760]   Hi, I'm Jason Howell, host of All About Android.
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:49.840]   Each week I'm joined by my co-hosts Ron Richards and Florence Aion,
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:54.480]   as well as a whole rotating cast of guests, journalists in the Android space,
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:09:00.640]   experts, developers and even people working on Android behind the scenes at Google.
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:04.240]   We talk about everything that has to do with Android and you don't want to miss a single
[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:06.880]   episode so you know what it's going on behind the scenes.
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:09.280]   That's twit.tv/aa.
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:11.840]   Make sure you subscribe so you don't miss an episode.
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:22.800]   The way who's forgotten the best end of FITA ZA.
