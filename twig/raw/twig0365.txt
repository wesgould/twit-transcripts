[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   It's time for Twig this week at Google's Stacey Higginbotham and Jeff Jarvis are here.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.080]   We're going to talk about the latest news from the Google verse.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.600]   We'll talk.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.720]   I mean, there's some heavy do-- we like to mix it up.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.760]   Some heavy duty philosophical stuff and also a kind of grab bag of new features and new
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.280]   stuff from Google and we'll demonstrate a new 360 degree camera.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.800]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.800]   Twig.

[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.560]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, a show where we cover not Google, but everything.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.880]   Anything we want to talk about, Google, of course, Facebook, the internet, the cloud,
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.720]   the internet of things, the internet of dings, the internet of ding dongs.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.880]   Journalism.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.880]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.880]   He's a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.080]   You used the Meevo for .NYCA last week.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.640]   It was really interesting.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.240]   And I used it again today.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240]   It's great.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.760]   It's really amazing to work with.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.080]   I turned off the auto features though and just do it by hand.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.080]   That's the case.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.080]   Oh, no.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.960]   The auto is a neat concept, but no, you want to do it by hand.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.200]   If you're all alone, then because auto follows your face and follows your face.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.640]   Even though, so Leo, I was thinking about this.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.840]   I don't want to delay Stacy's intro, but I was thinking about this.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.120]   When you were in the cottage, you switched yourself, right?
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.880]   I still do when I'm in my studio.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.880]   That's right.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.880]   Of course, in your office, yes.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.960]   So I wonder what it would be like to use the Meevo as...
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.920]   People look at this, "Oh, I have to have a producer."
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   I think it won't.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.920]   No, Leo does it.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.680]   No, in fact, I did it on Windows Weekly when I first unboxed the Meevo.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.680]   I had my iPad.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.680]   I've had it.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.680]   I've had it.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.920]   Because you get a big screen.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.560]   And yeah, I was switching while I was talking.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.560]   Easy peasy.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.360]   Do you know what, even on the iPhone, the guy who came over and did our first demo of the
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.920]   Meevo from Livestream at CUNY, you just iPhone.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.120]   But I delay the important moment of the show.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.040]   The most important moment, Stacy Higginbotham is with us.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.080]   Stacy on IOT.com, she's Gigas Stacey on the Twitter.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.880]   Jeff and I, obviously, as old men, have a crush on you, Stacy.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.880]   We're smitten.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.320]   Everybody adores Stacy Higginbotham.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.320]   Hello, Stacy.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   Hello.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.320]   We don't get out much.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.320]   It's...
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.320]   I was going to feel bad for you.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.920]   I'm really excited people out there.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.920]   No, no, no.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.920]   You're great.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.600]   No, we're such a good addition to this show.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   Everybody is good.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.600]   We love you because the network loves you.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.240]   Everybody loves it.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.080]   The comments that I made you see them too on Twitter, but I get them every week.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.080]   So happy Stacy's there.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.720]   I've listened to you as much Jarvis.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.720]   You know what I love.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.720]   John Oliver's...
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.440]   I think owed to local journalism, although there were some who did not think this was
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.440]   an owed to local journalism.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.840]   That wasn't fair.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.360]   On his this week tonight, he talks about the fact that his show, our show, most of the
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:17.440]   24-hour news networks depend on small local newspapers for the reportage.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.720]   And there was one point where somebody's talking, speaking on a panel, it says, "The
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.320]   day that we see a Huffington Post reporter in City Hall covering the City Council meeting
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.880]   is the day journalism will have survived.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.520]   But of course, you'll never see even Ariana.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.520]   She was on the panel.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.560]   And then a laughing.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.560]   We'll play a little bit of it because it's kind of a nice...
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.560]   So here's the funny thing.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.680]   I was at Aspen Institute, had a wither journalism thing when I was at this weekend.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.880]   And so we get there Sunday night, we have dinner, we drink, and then we all go off to
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.320]   our rooms.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.080]   And then the next morning we all woke up and if you didn't see the night before, I saw
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.080]   to my feet immediately.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.240]   You have to watch Oliver, you have to watch Oliver.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.560]   So he rakes over the coals, the company we've talked about here, Trunk, formerly Tribune
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.560]   Publishing.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.160]   The owner of Trunk was at the event.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.160]   Oh boy.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.240]   Michael Ferro, who's a very nice guy.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.080]   He took it with Great Grace and was a good guy.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.720]   However, the newspaper association of America has no sense if you were whatsoever.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.720]   Well, that guy...
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   I didn't understand it was a Valentine.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.640]   And by the way, he didn't come from journalism.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.160]   He didn't come from...
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.160]   Ferro.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.160]   Or you mean the A guy or the...
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.160]   No.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.520]   Yeah, the guy from the dissociation of whatever was some...
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.080]   Oh, it's newspaper association of America.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.680]   And efforts to take the paper out have failed.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.720]   Anyway, they're the old farts of old farts.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.760]   Well, but also the guy who runs it is not a newspaper.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   No, he's not.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.760]   No.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.760]   So...
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.800]   I knew his predecessor who I think was probably happy to be out.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.040]   Yeah, he didn't understand it.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.040]   Anyway, I don't know how much of this is on display.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.040]   But if you have watched it, it's 20 minutes.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.920]   The Oliver video is 20 minutes, but it's very funny.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.920]   Very cool.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.400]   Both of you were in the news in the report.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.360]   And the heroes that we root for in movies like All the President's Men, The Great Muppet
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.480]   Capre and most recently, Spotlight.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.080]   We got to nail these scum bags.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.480]   We got to show people that nobody could get away with this.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.640]   Not a priest or a carnal or a freaking pope.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.720]   Now, remember, Spotlight actually won best picture at the Oscars this year, meaning newspapers
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.480]   finally received the recognition that we normally reserve for subjects of such importance as
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.840]   the incredible bravery of real-life Hollywood filmmakers, the incredible bravery of fictional
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.160]   Hollywood filmmakers, and the incredible bravery of wanting to f*cking...
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.160]   Mmm.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.680]   Let me jump to the end because he then does a parody of Spotlight.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.520]   And it might go all the way to the top.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.080]   All the way to the top.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.080]   They knew.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.600]   And I think we could prove that they knew.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.480]   This is at the editorial meeting at the end.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.000]   Yeah, I'm just not sure what kind of clicks we're going to get on there.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Anybody else?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.960]   I've got a thing about a cat that looks like a raccoon.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.080]   Or it could be a raccoon that looks like a cat.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.080]   Wait, I'm not sure.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   Now we're talking.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's great.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:08.320]   So the one reporter left wants to cover Corruption in City Hall, but the raccoon cat
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.800]   ends up winning.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.000]   It's kind of true.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   It's kind of true.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   It's crushing, actually.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.080]   It's someone who sat in newsrooms in the meetings.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.380]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.200]   He also plays, and I have to be a little careful on this.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.840]   This is a clip.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.360]   Well, I'll let him set it up here.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.280]   Sentinel and the Chicago Trimpeas.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.280]   This is his team.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.240]   After acquiring the company, he spoke to the Sentinel's nervous staff outlining his
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.360]   vision and listened to one particular exchange with the journalist.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.640]   This is the prior over a few words.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.320]   Perhaps the most illuminating.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.320]   Before Toronto.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.480]   My attitude on journalism is very simple.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.760]   I want to make enough money so I can afford you.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.760]   Which is reasonable.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.760]   I'm sure Jeff Bezos says that.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.760]   It's really that simple, okay?
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.760]   You need to, in fact, help me.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.760]   You need to help me.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.760]   I'm being a journalist.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:02.320]   Now, this is the challenge by being a journalist that focuses on what our readers want and therefore
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.720]   generates more revenue.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.120]   A very brave young woman in the audience.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.040]   We also want to know.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.400]   Ask what if we just want to know about puppy dogs.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.120]   We also need to inform the community.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.600]   He says, I'm sorry.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   I can't, you know, you're giving me the classic, what I would call, journalistic evidence.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.760]   I'm deciding that puppies don't count.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.200]   He then proceeds to cuss her out.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.440]   So, and says eventually we hope that we get to the point where our revenue is so significant
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.440]   we could cover Iraq and puppies.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.440]   They're both right.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.440]   They're both wrong.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.440]   I mean, just say that we.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.160]   Well, you got to survive as a business.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.160]   You got it, right?
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.680]   A and B to say, oh, all the readers want us puppies.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.640]   Then why bother doing journalism for them at all?
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.600]   That's a gross insult to the public we serve.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.760]   It's not true and it is arrogant to say that.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.200]   I don't want to defend Samsel who ruined the company, but.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.200]   No person.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.360]   Well, no, I was just, I'm going to disagree with you a little bit in the sense that people
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.080]   value journalism, but they don't want to pay for it.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:15.680]   And there's in the models associated with journalism today, make it really hard to find
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.800]   people who are willing to pay for or your content.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.760]   Nobody ever really paid for journalism.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.680]   The journalism was paid for by the banner by the giant full page display ads that the
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:34.640]   journalism was meant to separate in newspapers and by the classifieds ads in the back of it.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.640]   That's what paid for it.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.360]   Even those of us who subscribe to the newspaper didn't pay for the newspaper in any appreciable
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.360]   way, right?
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.360]   Right.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.360]   Subscriptions.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.800]   Here's Jeff holding up his book, "Geek's Spring Gift," and re-imagining in few
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   futures.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.640]   In which I address that, Stacy, and what I argue is that the problem is we fancy ourselves
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.800]   entertainers and we think we're making unique products like Game of Thrones, or not.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.120]   We're in the information business.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.560]   And information, once it's known, is quickly commodified.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.720]   And a free society, once it that way.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.720]   You can't own information.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.280]   You can't control information.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.560]   And so we are trying to keep an old business model that just simply doesn't work anymore.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.040]   And this myth that people paid for our stuff, A, Leo's right, was always subsidized, and
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.680]   B, they paid because there was a monopoly involved.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.080]   And once you're in this world saying people should pay for what we do, well, why if there's
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.720]   a free copy that gives me the same value, two clicks away?
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.720]   No.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.920]   So we've got to find other structures of value.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.480]   And I work with these paper companies trying to do that.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:39.240]   But and there are some things people will pay for if they're really specialized, if they're
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.160]   unique, if they're really high value.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.920]   But generalized information, there's a guy climbing on the Trump Tower.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.920]   I don't need to pay for that.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.720]   I can find 100 places telling me that right now.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.240]   Interestingly though, the Olympics are going on right now.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:55.200]   And I just saw a report that said people were more interested in the presidential election
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.200]   than in the Olympics.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.840]   There was a lot more interest in the presidential election than there was in the Olympics.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.840]   People do.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.840]   I think people are interested in this.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.840]   It's the dope and the doped.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:09.840]   I wonder how many people are less interested in the Olympics because they can't see it.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.840]   Right.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.200]   Well, they're doing a terrible job, aren't they?
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   They always do.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   I don't know why people are so interested.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   I'm just curious.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.200]   Have either of you watched much of the Olympics out?
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   I have a lot.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.200]   I have a lot.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   I've seen any of the Olympics.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.200]   I've been used to see it in a minute.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.200]   I've watched our Oh, you don't have cable.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   You can't.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.200]   Right.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   Actually, you can.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   There's ways you can get the MBs.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   Oh, no, you can't.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.600]   So I can there are ways I could legally actually.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.600]   Well, okay.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.760]   I could quasi legally get the Olympics, but it's just not worth it to me.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.760]   It's a lot of work.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.480]   Oh, I mean, it's a lot of cable.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.600]   First of all, the first thing you realize is how much cable real estate Comcast actually
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:50.600]   owns because there's NBC, there's NBC Sports Network, there's USA, there's Bravo, there's
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:58.920]   MSNBC, they have half of my cable is Olympics right now, which really kind of brings home
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:05.080]   the fact that Comcast kind of really shouldn't be intermingling with NBC, but that's too late
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.560]   now.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.320]   I think the Olympics are well, here's what happened to me.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.280]   I was watching and I was thinking about it.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:19.360]   We always complain, but if I were a network executive, here's what I would say, the Olympics
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.680]   have no value minus the value we had.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.040]   It's just some people seeing who can swim the fastest.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:32.880]   You could go down to the local rec center and see that in and of itself, it isn't interesting.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.520]   We add, I'm speaking for NBC, a huge amount of drama.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.440]   And interest to it, that's what we're doing here.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:48.240]   And we're crafting it by the editing and time delay and pauses and we'll be back and all
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.920]   of the preview stuff that lets everybody know that Simone Biles is the best gymnast in the
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.920]   world.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.160]   I did not know that, in fact, I think I'm saying her name wrong, I did not know that
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.240]   if NBC hadn't told me that they make all the value of the Olympics.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.760]   They're actually creating the value the athletes are, but you know, there's a Paralympics right
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.760]   after that.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.760]   I don't see a lot of people squarmed in on that.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.840]   We make the same argument about football.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.840]   Yes.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.840]   You do it on high school.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.080]   So if you're complaining about, oh, well, the way NBC's doing it, you're missing the
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.080]   point.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.920]   It's all about the way NBC's doing it.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.120]   That's what's paying for this.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.160]   That's what's making this happen.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.840]   That's what it's all about.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.040]   It's like, you know, saying, I just wish they wouldn't cook my steak.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.040]   That's it.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.320]   There's a lot of people who hate the packaging.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.800]   Oh, it's highly packaged.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.720]   But as I said, so it might as well.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.720]   It's the packaging.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.360]   It's not that interesting.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.360]   I would beg to differ.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:47.440]   I think there probably wouldn't be as wide of an audience, but it's a huge social phenomenon.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.440]   So people watch it.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.280]   That's the thing.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.400]   I know journalists who are down there at the time and their tweet and say, what's going
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.400]   on?
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.720]   And of course, I've had armed members time delayed.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.440]   So it takes away the social phenomenon by syncopating it.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.800]   Oh, I know.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:06.600]   And by being all cranky about using the hashtags and everything else that NBC is proportionally
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.160]   the IOC is a horrifically corrupt.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:14.440]   The IOC is horrifically corrupt as bad as FIFA probably when we get down to it.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:21.200]   But it's the reason they're corrupt is because there's a lot of money flowing from NBC and
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.600]   the other networks all around the world.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.840]   It's manufactured as much as a movie is manufactured.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.280]   And when you it would be like saying, well, I really hate the way that the born identity
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.400]   is being as being delivered to us.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.360]   They really that's that's the deal.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.960]   You can't, you know, no, no, it is real time sports.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.240]   It is it is packaged.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.640]   It is not as much packaged as a movie is because it's it's more packaged like a newspaper or
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.720]   anything because they're still dealing with facts.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.600]   I mean, they are listening to people's life stories and they're they're telling that to
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.600]   you.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.920]   And I think that's great and there is value there.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.680]   But it's not like complaining about how movies delivered.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.280]   Well, I'm just saying first of all, you neither of you are watching it, which kind of proves
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.280]   my point.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:12.760]   So I should point out you could say that, but you obviously have no interest in it even
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:18.240]   with the packaging and you could watch you could watch an unfiltered stream of this stuff
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.680]   with no commentary.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.680]   Have you watched that?
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.680]   There's nothing is boring.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.200]   It's like, oh, yeah, I did that for ice skating for figure skating during the winter Olympics.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.200]   I've not.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.560]   Without Dick Button going, oh my God, she just did a triple Lutz axle.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.160]   I've never seen that before in my life.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.840]   It's just somebody doing that.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.000]   That's actually pretty cool.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Okay.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   You must know about skating.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.480]   I think gymnastics is awesome to watch both men and women.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:49.400]   I love no, I love watching it, but I think that we love watching it because of the drama
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.400]   that is.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   I think you're right.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.160]   I mean, I covered the LA Olympics many, many, many years ago.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.160]   And so good.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160]   I can go and watch the swimming meet.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.000]   You should have gotten to watch fencing.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   That would be awesome.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   That's it.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.880]   Only if you know, you have to know the sport so well that you know why that it was dramatic
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:17.440]   that he did this and the thing went, otherwise it's just a bunch of guys jumping around
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.000]   with pieces of metal in their hands.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.560]   It has no meaning.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.840]   It's meaningless unless we gloss it, I think.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.800]   Well, so let me ask you this, Leo.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.240]   What if you could have and the side has been talking about, but what if you had the Mystery
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.240]   Science Theater 3000?
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:37.400]   The chat room, the Twitch chat room of other, not NBC, tell you what's going on, but people
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.360]   you would like to enjoy.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   They won't do as good.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:45.200]   They won't, I think, do as good a job, frankly, because this is a lot more amusing.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.200]   Maybe.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.200]   Oh, it's so much better.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.280]   Some of those announcements are like idiots.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.720]   I hear people saying that, but I think this is what it is.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.040]   That's what the Olympics is.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.040]   Is that?
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.600]   Idiots talking about sports.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.600]   You can't get up like crazy.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.800]   You otherwise wouldn't possibly care about it.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.800]   Right.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   Yes.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   Right.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   I agree.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.000]   If you're like an archery buff or a fencing buffer, man, you love.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.560]   Then you're going to want to just, and you should go to the events.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.760]   You should go.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:21.840]   But for most people, if it weren't for the networks, ginning it up, it wouldn't feel
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.400]   like it could be that interesting.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.360]   And so I agree, I complain.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.280]   But I think if you think about it, what we're complaining is what we say we want.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.080]   This is, by the way, a huge problem in general.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:37.560]   People say they want something they don't really want it.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.000]   People don't know what they want.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.680]   And this gets us back to journalism.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.360]   We all say we want journalism, but we still really prefer puppies.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.360]   Right?
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.760]   You can prefer puppies.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.760]   I mean, yes.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:56.120]   I mean, there's just not a model for monetizing quality journalism.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.120]   Right.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.120]   It's really public service.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.840]   I can monetize my stuff because it's insights about business.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.240]   So that's less problematic.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.240]   Business is always monetizable.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.240]   Yep.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.240]   Yep.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.240]   So that's like...
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.240]   Right.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:16.040]   But stopping corruption at City Hall, which was part of his point, that's good for a wide
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.240]   number of the population.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.120]   But there's that whole concept that they're not all going, they'll get value from it,
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.080]   but they don't want to pay for that because it's kind of a, is it trashing into the commons?
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.960]   My God, I can't remember what it is.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.120]   No, that's something else.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.160]   That's when everybody over uses free resources.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.360]   Over uses something.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.120]   There's an economic thing that I cannot remember where if you don't...
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.040]   Okay, never mind.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.960]   I'm sorry, I can't remember.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.440]   But no, that was John Oliver's point.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.440]   I think you're right.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.680]   I think that was a very strong point, which is, in fact, I don't know, he had somebody
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.040]   on tape saying this is going to be a field day for the corrupt politician because...
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.600]   That was David Simon.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.840]   David Simon, the guy who wrote The Wire, that's right.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:04.560]   Who himself gets very old-party and defensive about the old ways of newspapers and all that?
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.600]   And mind you, I teach journalism, I care about this deeply, but we've got to find new models.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.120]   We shouldn't be presuming that we're preserving the old models as the right way to go about
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.120]   it.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.120]   But what if there's no role for journalists from a new model?
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.920]   What if there's only a role for puppies?
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.840]   No, I think that there is, but I don't think...
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:27.520]   The problem is, if you rely on mass on reaching frequency, then puppies is it.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.520]   That's it.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.520]   Puppies and cats don't find it out.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.640]   That's all there is to it because we know where that goes.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.600]   If, however, we see journalism as a service where there's a valued relationship, which
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.600]   is my argument in...
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.120]   Sorry, if the plug...
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.120]   Then there are other things...
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.120]   The hell does the book keep sparing gifts?
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.120]   Sorry, yes.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.120]   There are audio listeners who have no idea what...
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.120]   There's bad enough I didn't even video people.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.480]   Sure, I guess the sound effect was too good.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.560]   He's open to the door.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.920]   What the hell do I do?
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.080]   So my argument is that if you know people as individuals, members of communities, you
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.400]   can serve them with greater relevance.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.600]   You'll make more ad money because they'll come back more often because it's valuable.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.360]   You'll have higher targeting value, which is also good, but you'll also have other opportunities
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.360]   like Texas Tribune has with events.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.880]   I have to believe someday soon that Jeff Bezos is going to turn his knowledge about
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.440]   Washington Post consumers into a store.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.920]   You have membership, which the Guardian is working on.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.840]   You have a hell of a lot more efficiency and you don't have to...
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.840]   In the mass media world, you've got to rewrite everybody else's story to have your own page
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:33.680]   and page view in a quality-based service business than you won't.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.080]   You can't afford to do that.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.400]   So we're going to fundamentally change...
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.400]   I was just writing a post.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.920]   I haven't put it up yet.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.920]   Arguing, this is heresy.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.920]   This is high heresy.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.960]   If you know I get shot at a journalism school, this is why.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.800]   So I said, "Journalists are not storytellers.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.160]   We think that's our highest art, our great value is we tell stories."
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.680]   No, we impart information and we help people get to their own information and there's a
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.640]   lot of ways to do that more efficiently and effectively, but it's going to take time.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.320]   We can't presume that our old models of mass media advertising and circulation revenue are
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.320]   going to do it.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.320]   We have to reinvent.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.440]   Sorry, end of the field.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:15.400]   What I wonder is if we're not in a time where we're in the ultimate democracy, where the
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.680]   mass interests are what count that...
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:23.360]   Because what you're talking about is an elitist model versus a democratic model.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.760]   No, not necessarily elitist.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.240]   I mean, a paywall is an elitist model.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.640]   If you can afford to pay for the news and others can't, that's an elitist model.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.680]   I actually argued the contrary, Leo.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.440]   I've been thinking about this a lot lately.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.440]   This is the end.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.440]   What the internet kills is the mass media business model and with it dies the notion
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.440]   of the mass.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.120]   No, it's not about the mass.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.360]   It's about how 4 million Americans can vote in Donald Trump to be challenging the White
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.040]   House right now because they can find each other and organize and do things.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.280]   Black lives matter on the good side of this.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:57.480]   Can organize in a way that the big media didn't tell the truth of their story and now
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.040]   they can tell their own story as a community.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.040]   That's what's different.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.040]   That's fundamentally different.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.040]   Stacy wants to argue.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.040]   Just go.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.040]   I don't.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.440]   I actually saw a segue into one of our stories.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.680]   Oh, aren't you?
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.840]   The broadcaster.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.040]   This is me, man.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.200]   I'm like, let's move it.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:19.200]   So with Facebook, this ties in because you called it the end of the mass, but Procter
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:24.040]   and Gamble this week, basically, like, through a bomb in Facebook's business model and was
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.040]   like, you know what?
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.280]   You're targeted advertising?
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.200]   It's not necessarily working for us.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.240]   We actually want mass.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.800]   And so I'm not going to argue with you.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.560]   I'm going to let Facebook and Procter and Gamble do it for me.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.560]   Yes.
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:46.360]   So Procter and Gamble, the worst of the big, old, huge mass manufacturers who force you
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.240]   all to use the same toothpaste and all to eat the same snack, even though we don't like
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.240]   it.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.800]   They are dependent upon that.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:58.440]   Well, OK, that makes sense because a company that produces a commodity, and I would submit
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:03.200]   that dish soap, clothing soap, toothpaste, those are commodities.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:07.960]   The difference between Preston Colgate is really minimal, right?
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:15.200]   So those companies, it's all about brand and convincing you their brand is somehow magically
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.120]   better than the other guy's brand.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:23.560]   And maybe just it's really all about impressions, just a lot of impressions like tied, tied,
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.560]   tied, tied, tied, tied.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.560]   That's their argument.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.000]   They still need to just convince you to buy it.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   They don't have to say tied.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   It's better.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.920]   They just say, tied, tied, tied, tied, tied.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.680]   So this is why it stays at the exact same time.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:39.360]   Facebook is saying enough of tied, tied, tied, tied.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.920]   You know, we're going to let you get rid of detergent ads if you want to because you have
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:49.320]   to have more control over it as they, of course, Institute, an ad blocker blocker.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.320]   But they've got to give you more control over that because you do get irritated by all that
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.720]   mass stuff that's irrelevant to you.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.320]   Here's what I think.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.320]   Procter and Gamble.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.320]   Procter and Gamble.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.320]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.320]   I should shut up.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.320]   No, no, no, you don't have to label it.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.320]   Go ahead and just say it.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.320]   That's all.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.560]   Would you like to know what I think?
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.560]   Yes, I would.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.800]   Yes, I would.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.960]   I think there is.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.760]   Remember when Procter and Gamble speaks this way, they're not, this isn't the chairman
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.840]   of Procter and Gamble, the president of Procter and Gamble, the chief marketing officer of
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.840]   Procter and Gamble.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.200]   This is the agency, the ad agency.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.200]   Yes.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:33.320]   The ad agencies probably don't like the chairman and president of Procter and Gamble to know
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:37.280]   is how ineffective and inefficient their television ads are.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.800]   The problem with direct ads, the kind of ads you do on Facebook is you can measure them
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.320]   very carefully.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.200]   It's probably scary for them.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:53.160]   They'd much rather work in ignorance and in mystery than have real numbers about effectiveness.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:58.920]   Because if your right ads are not effective, they change their mind though because they
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:05.280]   saw sales of a certain product and I'm looking to see what it was, go down.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.280]   Because they advertised on Facebook?
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.680]   Well, hold on.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.440]   Because they took a save amount of money and they tried to focus and they didn't get the
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.520]   reach they needed for a commodity product.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:22.400]   A, B, they had to spend more money on the actual media buying than on the actual media.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   Yes.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.440]   Because it's harder to buy targeted advertising.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.320]   It's a lot easier to buy mass.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.760]   We don't get brand advertising on this show or I think most podcasts probably don't get
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.040]   much brand advertising either.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.320]   It's almost all direct response.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.280]   Facebook's probably all direct response, right?
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.360]   That's just the nature of the internet.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.480]   You do well when...
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.920]   You're provable.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:50.920]   You're all...
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.400]   And I don't know.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:05.480]   I think ultimately in the long run, this is a retro point of view that ultimately 10 years
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.600]   or 20 years when the next generation gets into Procter and Gamble, they're going to say,
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.600]   "But we have to..."
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.680]   A lot of our advertisers say, "We want to know more about your audience.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.960]   We don't want to know more about the direct response.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.840]   We want to measure our response more, not less."
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.400]   We want to know how...
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.920]   We interrupt with something here.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:26.600]   So ABC7NY is broadcasting the Trump guy on Facebook Live.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.600]   Yeah, guys climbing...
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.600]   So I didn't see that happening.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.440]   He's climbing Trump Tower and with suction cups.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.120]   I'm sorry, that was just a little Facebook Live that we don't know.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.960]   Is he wearing a superhero costume?
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.080]   Is he like the tick, but the get-go?
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.080]   No, he's wearing...
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   He's...
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.080]   He's...
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.080]   I don't...
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.080]   He's wearing...
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   He's wearing...
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.080]   He's wearing...
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.240]   What do you call those shorts that are now out?
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.240]   Cargo shorts?
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.600]   Yeah, he's on cargo shorts, but he has to run away in shame because he's wearing cargo
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.600]   shorts.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.160]   That's where you keep your suction cups.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.840]   No one told me cargo shorts are out.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.480]   Did you not read the Wall Street?
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.480]   He's not read this?
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.000]   I just bought a bunch of them.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Wow.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   You know what?
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   You know what?
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   That's why they're out.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   They're probably not the height of fashion.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   I'm just...
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.400]   I'm noting the baseball suspenders that I'm thinking.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.400]   You noticed.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.400]   They're baseball.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.400]   Yes, they're lovely.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.400]   So, let me see.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:24.520]   Let me see if Leo and I are going to do an old man moment for a moment.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.520]   So in my childhood...
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.480]   No, we don't do that all the time.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.320]   I know, Stacy, but you're too nice to say that.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:36.760]   In my childhood, Leo, I had a craving to go wear a Nairu jacket.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.760]   June?
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.680]   I might have actually owned a Nairu jacket.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.360]   And my parents wouldn't let me...
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.520]   My parents wouldn't let me until Johnny Carson wore one.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.520]   Oh, that was okay.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.520]   And they said it was okay.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.680]   And I said, "That's now why I don't want one."
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.440]   No, I don't want one now.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.280]   I wore a cape.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.280]   No.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.280]   Oh, do you have pictures?
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.280]   I guess it's child?
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.280]   In high school.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.520]   By the way, the only reason...
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.440]   The only reason that this is in the Wall Street Journal is so that they could make the pun
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.040]   in the headline.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.040]   Nice cargo shorts.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:17.440]   After sleeping on the sofa, fans of the roomy summer staple meet pockets of resistance.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.440]   Is there actual news in this story?
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.040]   No, it's like the typical summertime.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.280]   I think it was a Friday news story, right?
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.720]   It was like a New York country.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.280]   Relationships around the country are being tested by cargo shorts.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.760]   Loosely cut shorts with large pockets sewn into the sides.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.000]   Men who love them say they're comfortable and practical for the summer.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.360]   Detractors say they've been out of style for years.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.360]   It's true.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:44.680]   I wear cargo shorts to my son's father's son, Frat Day.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.080]   He said, "You're not going to wear those, are you?"
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.120]   That's all I have.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:59.360]   He said, "I know they're flat, out ugly and uncool and bulky."
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.080]   Even the Wall Street Journal says they're uncool.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.040]   Man.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.960]   What happened is she got such a response from this.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.040]   She actually did a follow-up article.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.480]   So there's the article declaring them out.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.920]   Then there was debate all over the world, apparently.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.400]   Then a follow-up article.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.880]   There's a Twitter meme.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:22.880]   Yes.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.360]   There was a data journalism piece on where they're bought.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.080]   Oh my God.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:33.600]   This ties back to journalism that is both clickbait and apparently servicing it up?
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.600]   I don't know.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.760]   If only you tried too hard on that was Daisy.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.760]   We're in a...
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.760]   We're in a...
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.760]   We're in a...
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.960]   We're in an unusual place because I think people are so...
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:51.000]   The real news is so aggravating and upsetting and emotionally charged that we kind of want
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.920]   to have light pieces.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.760]   That's why Pokemon Go took off.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.760]   True.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.760]   All right.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.040]   Facebook says we figured out how to get around ad blockers.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.480]   Because of yesterday, your ad blocker no longer works on Facebook.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.920]   Isn't it only on the website?
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.000]   Like if not if you're on the phone?
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.400]   So now I think yes.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.760]   That's top website, yes.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.760]   Yes.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.760]   Okay.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.720]   Because I mean, one of the reasons people like love ad blockers on their phone is because
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.400]   by God, that's where you need one.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.400]   That's where you need one.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.400]   Money.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.760]   Yeah, that's where you need one.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.600]   It's slow and it bogs it down.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.280]   Well, that's where it's Facebook and Google app.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.040]   There I bring that up.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.000]   They are trying to speed that up so that the experience has not so got awful.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.520]   It's kind of ironic because Facebook's ads, in my opinion, are not very intrusive.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:42.920]   They're not bothersome in the same way that a lot of blogs are just so unreadable because
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:43.920]   of ads.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.520]   Facebook, at least you could just the ads on the side.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.520]   You could kind of ignore it.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.360]   Well, you see them and you see the sponsor things in your stream as well.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.360]   But they're...
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.360]   Do you think, you know what, the stuff on the side does not work.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.800]   I think the stuff on the stream does work.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:59.440]   I noticed that I bought things on Instagram because every 10th Instagram post is if it's
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:05.480]   well done as interesting as the real posts that preceded it.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.680]   And sometimes I actually end up saying, "Oh, I want that.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.320]   I've done that a couple of times now."
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.680]   So they work.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.760]   But banner ads, I don't think work, right?
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.320]   I'm going to make my plug for Google Now's ads because those things are freaking amazing.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.880]   They're ads in Google Now?
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.320]   So they're not exactly ads.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.480]   They're based on stuff you've searched for and then they'll tell you if the price goes
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.560]   down.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:30.880]   And then you get a notification or a card basically that pops up and is like, "Hey,
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.160]   you know that thing you were searching on two weeks ago?
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.160]   It's 33% off."
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.440]   And then you're like, "Yes, click.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.440]   Bye."
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.440]   Are those paid?
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.440]   No.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.440]   That's...
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.440]   I mean, that's...
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.280]   I'm kind of like, "Dang, that's a really interesting opportunity."
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:48.200]   So it's all the downside of ads with none of the revenue.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.720]   I would say none of the downsides of ads.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.720]   None of the downsides.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.720]   None of the revenue.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.720]   None of the revenue.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.720]   None of the revenue.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.520]   They should be monetized or heck out of that.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.520]   You know what they call that?
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.520]   Content.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.520]   Yes.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.520]   Yes.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.520]   So leave me.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.720]   You know, I should be using now more.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.560]   I'm just looking at now the stories that I care about here.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.560]   So I should be using it more.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.800]   I don't think to use it.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.800]   Using what?
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.800]   Oh, now.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.200]   They've done a really good job now of surfacing stories you're interested in.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.680]   Yeah, I mean, they surface your commute times if you ask them to.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.360]   They tell you...
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.120]   They remind me of my trips.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.280]   So it's telling me I've got six days till I go to San Francisco.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.440]   A day before I go, it's going to give me the weather there.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:34.160]   When I arrive, it pops up with all this data about tourist sites, which I don't need.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.120]   So and it ties into my week system.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.720]   So when my door is unlocked at home, it's like, by the way, your door is unlocked.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   Nice.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.720]   Wow.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.720]   Nice.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.360]   And I didn't do any of that.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.360]   That's all Google.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.360]   Yeah, you're not a Olympic medal count.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.840]   I killed all that stuff.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.840]   I was like...
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.320]   Well, actually Google is trying other things.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.360]   This one's really interesting because I let Google read my email.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.760]   Don't forget this tomorrow.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:07.560]   Recent email mentioned that you should remember you only have one day left to watch this screener.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.560]   Zero days, it's about the Stuxnet flaw.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.720]   I guess somebody sent me a screener.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.720]   I didn't even know.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.720]   I didn't see that email.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.360]   So this is hugely valuable.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.360]   This is hugely valuable.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.400]   This is something for my email I didn't even know about.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:25.480]   If I'm getting delivered, recaps of the Olympics, which I did not delete, stock updates, weather
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.200]   updates, and then here's the lots of news.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.920]   Tesla opens flagship San Francisco store.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.280]   They somehow know that I'm interested in Teslas.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.680]   Oh, mine knows that I'm interested in Kim Kardashian because I can't help clicking every
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.680]   time it shows me stuff.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.680]   I'm like, "No!"
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.480]   That's the signal you're sending.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:43.920]   But there's an example of, see, that's better because instead of asking you whether you
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.760]   like puppies, it just notices you like puppies.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:52.040]   Although, I feel better because I've got hydrogen molecule falls to quantum computer because
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.160]   I've shown interesting quantum computing.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.560]   So those I don't feel as bad at.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:01.160]   I also get, every time the cocktail enthusiast updates their website, I get here.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.880]   None of this you signed up for just happens.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.240]   None of it is just like, that's why I love this.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:12.320]   And it also, I'm sure people, this is not new, but when I'm going to be late for an appointment
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.720]   or there's a traffic jam, it actually pings me and is like, "Yo, you got to leave."
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.800]   Like actually now.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.760]   So, oh, and Google Home, sorry.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.000]   What's so exciting about Google Home?
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.240]   I love the excitement, Stacey.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:33.400]   And if it comes, their video shows Google Now interactions happening, like, it'll ping
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.760]   you so that little cylinder will be like...
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.680]   That's what I want, yeah.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:43.360]   So Rychrist, who is a CNET journalist, did a tweet like two days ago and he was like,
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:48.360]   "You know what should happen?
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:53.360]   The echo could do that sort of notification with color on the top so it could blink a
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.360]   color and be like, "Yo, something's happening."
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:58.360]   So now I want to Google Now to build something for the echo, and it turns the echo colors.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.360]   And I want Amazon to live that out.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:03.360]   I used to have, this was 15 years ago, maybe.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.360]   It was a globe that glowed and you could program it to go to different colors.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.360]   Like if your stocks were up, it would be green stocks or whatever, red.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.360]   Remember that?
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.760]   Then that with Hue lights does the same thing.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.760]   Same thing.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.120]   Well, there's a story in the rundown about if this and that is going to basically compete
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.360]   with Google and Amazon and...
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.360]   It totally is.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.360]   An Apple on trying to run the home.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.360]   Mm-hmm.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.360]   Well, it already is really middleware that's huge.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.360]   Exactly.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.800]   I mean, it's already in there.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   They own that space.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.040]   There are others.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.720]   There's Zapier, which I actually like.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.600]   It's a little more business-focused.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.400]   But if this and that's making all the deals, right?
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.400]   They are.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.480]   They've got a business model.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:50.400]   You now have to pay to integrate with them is my understanding.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.400]   Not everybody.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.400]   They've got back-end deals.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.960]   But if you remember, there's a Twit Dude pin board.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.120]   People loved it.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:03.680]   Basically if this and that was like, "Hey, here are the rules for continuing to work
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.000]   with us as we scale."
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.960]   And it required him to do all the work on his side.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.960]   And he was like, "Yeah."
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.200]   And everybody was up in arms.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.120]   I was a little disappointed because I used pin board.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.120]   I love pin board.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.120]   Yeah, I do.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:21.440]   And he basically will no longer support.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.240]   He calls it my heroic and lazy stand against if this and that.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.040]   This was last April.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:32.160]   But Lyndon said, so the CEO of Ift said, "Uh-oh, there's a family.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.720]   Here comes the dogs."
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.800]   They said that they worked it out.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:44.440]   So I don't know what the deal was between them, but I'm giving my little shruggy.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.080]   I don't think it was because he had to pay.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.360]   It was just because he had to do the work basically.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.640]   He had to, okay, yes.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.640]   He had to do the work.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:56.760]   I think some people do negotiate is what my developer friends say.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:01.080]   So I'm not sure what negotiations entail exactly.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.200]   He didn't want to do the work and they would own the work that he did.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.200]   And there's no guarantee.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.200]   And the data.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.360]   And there was no guarantee that they wouldn't change it again.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.560]   So I kind of understand, at the same time, I kind of understand if this and that can't
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:20.840]   be expected to write interfaces for all the things that inter-operates with, right?
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.120]   Well that was kind of the plan in the beginning.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.360]   And we were all like, "Well, how are you going to scale that?
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.680]   That's crazy talk."
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.720]   And now it's kind of shifting is they've, I mean, they've done the same thing everybody
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.320]   else does, right?
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.320]   You gain an audience.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.840]   You gain people and then suddenly the power shifts to your court and then you make other
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.120]   people work with you as opposed to working with others.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.000]   I mean, it's not nefarious.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.440]   It's just how the world works.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.840]   I have a new model for this show.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:53.880]   We put a whole bunch of stories in there and you guys pick what you want to talk about.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.880]   You're the aggregator.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.880]   We're the curator.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.520]   Why should I be the one telling you what to talk about?
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.160]   So let's take a break when we come back.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.680]   Stacey, pick a story that you want to talk about.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.680]   We'll do it.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.680]   We'll be able to get it.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.680]   Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.680]   You're a broad one.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.680]   You're not doing his job.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.680]   I'm getting lazy.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.120]   Like Stacey has opinions.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.120]   All right.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.600]   It's not the problem.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.600]   Lazy.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.640]   You know all of a sudden I'm lazy with investments.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.000]   I used to be like very ambitious, right?
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   When I first started, you know, when you're young and you should be doing this, I hope
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.240]   you're doing this set, you start saving for your future.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:31.320]   You put in my side money for the, you know, for college fund for your kids or for old age
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:37.840]   for you or maybe you put aside money for a house or rainy day fund.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.800]   And when I first started doing this, I was young and I was ambitious and I read all the
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.360]   books and I said, I am not going to hire a broker.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.880]   I am going to learn how to do this and I'm going to manage my own investments.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.040]   And it really went well for the first, I don't know, maybe a year.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:56.200]   The problem is it's really important if you do this that you constantly monitor and rebalance
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:00.960]   because, well, let's say the stock market does really well for a period of time.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:05.200]   And now you're 90% of stocks instead of 70% of stocks and that's not where you want to
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.200]   be.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.200]   And so you got to kind of frankly, it's like a garden.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.200]   You don't tend it.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:13.040]   You're going to have a lot of weeds and I did not tend my garden.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:19.800]   Ten years later, I went, oh, now there's another way.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:24.800]   You could go out, you could go down to Main Street and there's a guy with a shingle out
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   front.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   He's probably in a strip mall there.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.840]   He says, I will help you.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.920]   I will do this for you.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:35.440]   I have learned the mysterious ways of the stock market and for merely one, two or even 3% of
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:39.280]   what you invest every year, I shall manage your money.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:44.520]   First of all, that means you have to make one, two or 3% more, which is not easy.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:49.960]   And if this guy's so smart, what's he doing to managing other people's money?
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.760]   It didn't work so well either.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.840]   Then I found wealth front.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.840]   Wealth front is brilliant.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.920]   Wealth front is exactly what you're looking for.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.400]   They manage your money not every month or every quarter.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.160]   They don't rebalance every year.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:05.560]   They manage it 24/7 every minute of every day because it's computers and because it's
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.720]   computers, they work cheap.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:15.080]   Not one or two or 3% of what you have invested one quarter of 1%, 25 basis points with no
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.400]   commissions and no hidden fees.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.320]   Wealth front does it right.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.720]   If you're wondering, well, how does the software work?
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:26.840]   They've encapsulated the best brains in the business, Burton Malkeum, who wrote the random
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.720]   walk down Wall Street, Charles D. Ellis, who wrote the Investors Guide.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:35.600]   I mean, these guys, they've got 200 years of investment experience.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.800]   They've got the best thinking.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:45.400]   They've got Nobel Prize winning technology, modern portfolio theory.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.760]   They've adjusted the portfolios according to your risk tolerance and your time frame,
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.720]   but they stay diversified.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.720]   Very important.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.080]   They also say tax efficient.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:59.480]   They do things that your broker probably never heard of like tax loss harvesting.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:06.840]   They have all kinds of long-term investments, all kinds of long-term investment, including
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.240]   529 college savings plans, which are kind of like Roth IRAs.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.640]   They manage $3 billion now in client assets.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.600]   They're growing rapidly every day because they really work.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.800]   Now I'm not asking you to invest, although you can start for as little as $500.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.320]   What I'd like you to do is go there and read up on it and take advantage of some of their
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.320]   free services.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:28.360]   They will do a portfolio analysis for you, tell you how diversified your current portfolio
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.960]   is, how much you lose to fees.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.960]   That'll be an eye opener.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.680]   I'm sorry to say.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:38.120]   They'll also even generate a portfolio for you, the sample portfolio of how they would
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:44.280]   invest your money based on just a few questions, but they do really do a great job of kind
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.320]   of figuring out what's right for you.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.320]   You're going to love this.

[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.360]   They won't call you.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.360]   It's a computer.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.360]   They don't like to talk.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.360]   They don't chit chat.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:05.600]   Just good, solid management of your wealth.

[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.520]   Go with the wonderful Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.520]   Stacey on IoT.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.920]   She does a podcast on IoT with Kevin Tofel.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.640]   He's in Austin, Texas, joining us from New York City from Manhattan.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.280]   It's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.960]   I'm sorry, from New Jersey.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.960]   He's in Jersey.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.640]   Everything's legal in Jersey.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:01.720]   He is a professor of journalism at CUNY down there on Times Square.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.800]   And also the author of many great books, including Geeks, Bering Gifts, Public Parts, Google
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.880]   Two, and Gutenberg, the Geek.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.240]   All right, Stacey.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.240]   Fire when ready.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.720]   What's your story?
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:17.080]   Okay, I'm really excited about two stories.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.560]   So we'll see if I can get to both of them.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.560]   You will, I promise.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.200]   It's okay if I don't.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.200]   Okay, first story.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.320]   Intel bought a company this week called Nirvana.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.640]   I think it's Nirvana systems.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.240]   That's N-E-R-V, Anna, A-N-A.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.800]   Oh, like Nervy.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.400]   Yeah, like not Kirk Kubein in Gertracht.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.840]   No flannel.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:40.080]   No flannel, to my knowledge.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:44.760]   So this is a cool deal because Nirvana is a company that is doing two things.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.920]   It's making a cloud for machine learning.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:53.480]   And it's also eventually going to make a specialized chip for machine learning.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.520]   And so there's a couple cool things here.
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:00.800]   One is Intel has been kind of like, where?
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.360]   Nowhere when it comes to machine learning.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.960]   And everyone's kind of like, wow, artificial intelligence.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.640]   That's going to be the next big workload in TELMIS mobile.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.120]   It's about to miss machine learning.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.920]   And the answer is maybe.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:18.080]   So this looks like a way to kind of stave off some of that talk.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:23.720]   It also brings more Qualcomm people into Intel's fold.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:28.440]   Intel actually hired a guy named, oh, his whole name is really epic.
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.240]   His name is Murthy.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:38.200]   He was like, let's see if I can look it up and say it because it's a beautiful name.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.840]   So, Murthy Renho.
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:42.840]   Oh, okay.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:47.480]   Now the thing to understand is, it's just pronounced exactly as it's spelled.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.480]   It's a southern Indian really long last thing.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.960]   Like Higgin' Botham's easy.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:56.920]   You know, it was no Higgin' Botham is maybe, well, that's pronounced, I guess, to us it
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.920]   is.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.920]   So, yeah.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.640]   Doctor of Entata, Ren de Quintala.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.640]   Very good.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.640]   I bet that's perfect.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.880]   Murthy, who was at Qualcomm, he left Intel paid him a lot of money to go.
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.280]   And it was during when Qualcomm was having all their kind of like executive turmoil with
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:19.400]   the board or their board of directors being like, oh, no, it was an activist investor.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.120]   So Murthy was like, eh, I'm leaving.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:22.360]   Going to Intel.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:29.160]   Nirvana was founded by the couple of guys who used to be in Qualcomm's R&D division building
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:32.080]   a neural chip for them.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:36.320]   And so these guys left Qualcomm because Qualcomm didn't really want to make it a functioning
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.600]   processor.
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:42.840]   And so they went over, formed Nirvana Systems, got some money from Steve Jervitson and lovely
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.240]   other folks.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.960]   And now it looks like TechCrunch has Intel paid 350 million for it.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.680]   So woo, woo, woo, on them.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.680]   So that's kind of that.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:46:01.160]   Other big thing to know, this last big thing, is they're using NVIDIA's GPUs right now.
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:06.840]   But big question is, will Intel actually a seed to using other people's GPUs?
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:07.840]   I don't know.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:08.840]   What other ones could they use?
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:13.400]   I mean, AMD owns Radeon, owns the ATI technology.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:19.080]   Well, Intel tried way back in the day to build these chips called Laraby that we're going
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.080]   to be- Oh, yeah, Laraby.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.080]   Yeah, remember Laraby.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.080]   Laraby.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:29.800]   So if you're building a machine learning chip, you've got to have two things that right now
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:34.120]   chips don't really have, which is massive parallel processing and really fast I/O.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.440]   So the data can move really fast.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.720]   Right now, chips are designed to kind of make a trade-off between one or the other.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.320]   So GPUs are massively parallel, but their I/O is in all that.
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.400]   You also have to think about energy efficiency.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:49.560]   So that's like big picture what Intel needs to do.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.040]   And I don't know if they're going to be able to do it.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:57.920]   This is not like, I look at this and I'm like, heck yeah, it's where they needed to go.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.080]   So Rendington, tell us they're really about for Internet of Things, right?
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.600]   I mean, that's what his expertise was.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.600]   Small devices.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.600]   Connected small devices.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:07.600]   Connected small devices.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:11.880]   All this stuff that goes into that because Intel was like, IOT, it's going to be big.
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.400]   We should really talk a lot about that.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:17.480]   Why would you connect this to buying a machine learning company?
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.960]   Do you think they want to put more intelligence in these IOT devices?
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:29.000]   So I connected those two because Murthy was from Qualcomm.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.520]   We may never know why she connected those two.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:37.320]   Oh, it's that moment.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:41.320]   You sometimes wake up in a cold sweat thinking you're in a Skype.
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.560]   No, I don't actually.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.560]   Because I never freeze.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:48.160]   I'm always here.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.120]   I'm the one who doesn't freeze.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:53.880]   I'm the one who doesn't freeze.
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.720]   I'm the one who knocks.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.720]   I will just call your back.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.720]   Never forget freeze.
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.000]   I never forget what Murthy was doing.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:09.760]   I'm a little T.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.960]   How's the car?
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.960]   Well I just got a text message.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.320]   The button you're trying to reach is currently unavailable.
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:18.320]   From Lisa.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.320]   I do love that accent.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:27.040]   With a picture apparently of the car screen.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.560]   Here it is.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:34.840]   She says this thing is a POS and I'm not driving it anymore.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:35.840]   Oh no.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:41.800]   Touch screen and responsive press scroll was she's had a lot of trouble with it.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:46.040]   You know what I think I don't have as much trouble because I'm used to driving a computer.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.040]   Driving a computer.
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:52.320]   And it's kind of like a computer where it just, you know, hey, touch screen is freeze.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.840]   What are you going to do?
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.400]   As long as the steering wheel works.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.280]   Ah, Stacy's back.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.680]   We were a Vampion Stacy.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.040]   No, that's okay.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.240]   That was my time Warner cable.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.240]   Really?
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.240]   What did they do?
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.240]   Nothing.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.000]   It's because it's hot.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.360]   Oh, you know, I hate that when the internet goes out because it's hot.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.360]   See exactly.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.760]   Like the plot of the stranger.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.480]   So it's so hot in here.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.280]   Oh, anyway, so you think I'm sorry.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:30.880]   Why you got cut off at the most inopportune moment you were going to explain why these
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:31.880]   two stories.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:36.080]   Oh, but what linking the stuff in my brain.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:41.920]   Between Nirvana systems, which is artificial intelligence hardware, I guess, and Venkata
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:46.800]   Rinducintala, who is really about chips.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.160]   So
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.560]   Murthy came over from Qualcomm.
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.560]   The.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.360]   I'm just teasing you by saying his name.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:59.920]   That's so mean.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.200]   I cut my teeth on Siva by Jonathan.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:06.400]   So yeah, yeah.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.440]   So what did Rinducintala have to say?
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.440]   Oh, stop it.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.440]   That's just mean.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:15.520]   I was I was simply making the point that he came from Qualcomm.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:19.960]   The founders of Nirvana were also developer or engineers at Qualcomm.
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.600]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:23.600]   Okay.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:24.600]   So it's a reunion.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:29.000]   Yeah, it's like Intel's pulling all these Qualcomm guys in, which could be good for them
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.880]   because they really need to ramp up with the Internet of Things and everything else.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:40.640]   Intel's big challenge, frankly, is that they missed mobile and they were so dominant for
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.000]   so long and desktop.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.800]   And now the end of the PC is nigh and they haven't really figured out a transit away to
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:48.800]   transition.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:49.800]   Stacey can speak best to.
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:53.640]   I heard from somebody this weekend who works very closely with Intel.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:59.160]   Is that the whole strategy is to be in every three quarters of IoT devices.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.360]   That's not going to happen because arm doesn't arm really.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:07.480]   So this actually does make sense because so Qualcomm and that kind of knowledge gives
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:11.080]   them at least something they can do to compete with arm, but what they will make which would
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:15.800]   be unique would be an artificial intelligence engine.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:19.920]   If you imagine what's going to happen the way the world's going to go, you're going
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.600]   to have all these like low power and nodes, right?
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.720]   Sensors, tablets, whatever, and those are all going to be powered by arm until kind of
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.760]   has to give that up.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:32.720]   They did have the basis peak is actually an arm powered watch, but they had that recall.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.680]   So that's not going well.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:42.760]   So then all of that goes up into the cloud where like magical machine learning algorithms
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:46.840]   say, oh my gosh, this data crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch means this and then they shoot
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:47.840]   an insight down and then actually.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.840]   Did you do that again, please?
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:52.200]   Crunch the data again.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.800]   So that's that is my magical crunching data noise.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:55.800]   So I love it.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:56.800]   I love it.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:03.520]   It feels kind of given up on the end and node piece for now because what they don't you
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.800]   have to be low power.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:06.800]   They don't have that.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.800]   So they're talking about security.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.200]   They're looking at being in gateways.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.200]   Right.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.720]   So they have a wonderful chip that powers a lot of the gateways.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.800]   The broad common on set market.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.360]   The gateway market?
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.400]   No, no, not the IoT gateway market.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.400]   Oh, IoT.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.200]   Oh, you mean like smart things, the hubs.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.200]   Well, so in industrial.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.200]   Those are ARM.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.080]   Are they mostly ARM chips?
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.120]   So inside the smart things hub is an ARM.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.840]   I want to say it's an A9.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:34.840]   Cortex A9.
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:39.080]   So it's a pretty powerful ARM chip, but I'm actually talking about in the industrial kind
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:45.040]   of business application where you're going to send like hundreds of thousands of sensors
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.720]   are going to send their data into this computer.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.600]   Lots of transactions, yeah.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.560]   And it's going to be crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch the data in that box.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:54.680]   So you need a powerful Intel chip and that's going to be plugged in.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:59.840]   And then in the cloud, you're actually going to need where Intel's doing great, the servers.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:00.840]   That's lovely.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.840]   It's got like 96% of that market.
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.600]   But where that's going to go is machine learning.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:10.520]   And right now they're like, Zion is not a great chip for that.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:15.320]   So they're going to go, they have to have machine learning or else in like five or six
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:18.720]   years instead of saying Intel is mobile, we're going to be like, God, Intel is mobile
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.800]   and machine learning.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.120]   And then you can't make two mistakes.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:30.400]   And Leo, no, no, you've actually made me think something I rarely do.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.760]   And so I had to lean back, get some blood.
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.960]   Stacy, can I bring up a lady question?
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:38.280]   So I asked the thing where I was this weekend.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.760]   It's under chat about rules.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.840]   You can't say who said what, which I hate because I want to give credit.
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:48.240]   But a very smart person, there was a lot of experience, talked about the civic internet
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:53.840]   of things separate from the medical internet of things and seeing these ecosystems and
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:54.840]   who could control what?
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:59.040]   And the person was arguing that we in local news should be trying to have a major role
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:03.320]   in the civic internet of things and how that operates if we, if we, you know, had any
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.320]   smarts.
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:09.280]   How do you see the ecosystem of IoT data breaking down?
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:15.240]   Well, that's a really hard question because it's too broad.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:17.400]   Can you get a little bit more specific?
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:20.760]   I can talk about like news, how news is, news is using sensors.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.040]   I could talk about architecture, like how people are.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.720]   I have a kind of more meta-thon.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.200]   Oh, hey.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:33.160]   And I'm going to make an analogy to the computing that we've, this revolution that we've been
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:39.280]   through where it started with discrete CPUs that weren't really talking to each other,
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.560]   you know, the PC, the personal computer.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:46.400]   And the explosion didn't happen until they could communicate and the rise of the internet.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:50.080]   And that was the real digital computer explosion.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.600]   That's really when it happened.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.920]   It wasn't them as individual pieces.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:58.560]   And IoT is very much in the same situation where, and currently we're in that early stage
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.200]   where I have a doorbell and I have a thermostat.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.920]   I have colored lights and you can cobble something together.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:06.000]   But that's not ideal.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.400]   That's the base station hub spoke model.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:13.400]   What you'd really like is more of a mesh model where all of these things are have enough
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:15.040]   intelligence, not much.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:19.400]   You don't want to make these expensive chips to communicate with each other and create an
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.800]   intelligent kind of.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.360]   Well, isn't that what Google tried to announce that I owe?
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.400]   I think it is what they were trying to announce.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:29.200]   And I think that that's exactly what this acquisition, what these two acquisitions are
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:33.120]   about or these, this is the guy and this acquisition are about, which is how can we
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:39.600]   make each individual item smart enough to communicate with all the other individual?
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:44.560]   Stacy, you think we could go hub free or do we, we have to have a hub?
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:47.280]   For the home, we could go hub free.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:51.920]   But if we do that, we risk losing everything when our internet goes up, which still happens.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:57.680]   No, no, that's the advantage because the home doesn't have to be connected to the outside
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:58.680]   world.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:55:59.680]   They're talking to each other.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:03.960]   So I talked on my show last week about a light switch that runs Erlang because everything
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.120]   can be distributed to P.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.120]   Wow.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.120]   Wow.
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.400]   Who would put Erlang in a light switch?
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:15.680]   A company called Plumb and the reason they're doing it is exactly that.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:16.680]   Smart.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.040]   Yeah, that's their goal.
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.280]   So that is one model.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:27.240]   We haven't come up with a way, like another model that, sorry, we have other models.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.880]   We haven't picked one model for the home.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:33.040]   And for the industrial, there's a lot of security stuff that people are worried about.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.800]   So we're probably going to get a little bit of a mesh, but it's all going to be like
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.320]   not connected to the actual internet.
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:38.880]   It's going to go back to that gateway.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:43.680]   And then it'll go back all that data will go then to some cloud thing with the Intel
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:44.680]   stuff inside.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:50.800]   I did want to say someone brought up in the chat room, Google's TPU, the TensorFlow, the
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.240]   Tensor Compute Units.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:58.240]   Yeah, Tensor Compute Units, which is Google has developed a chip that they don't talk
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:03.040]   much about the architecture, which makes me so sad, that is running their machine learning
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.240]   cloud.
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.680]   And it's more efficient.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:10.600]   And I imagined that is the sort of thing, well, it is the sort of thing that Nirvana systems
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.520]   is doing right now.
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:19.160]   They've kind of customized the firmware on an NVIDIA GPU and run their own compute cloud,
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:21.400]   much like Google is doing.
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.640]   So if that helps me--
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:27.240]   So Leo, you just answered the inverse of the question I'm actually asking, which is
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:31.800]   not what's going to tie the devices together, but instead, where's the data exhaustable
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:33.960]   these devices going to go?
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.680]   And how is that ecosystem going to work?
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:39.840]   Well, there's two issues that have to be solved, in my opinion, in the IoT space.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:41.640]   And, Stacy, you're more of an expert.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:46.840]   So correct me if I'm wrong, but security is one, and privacy is the other.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.640]   Right, but let's say you solve them.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:54.320]   Then what I'm trying to get to here is that then there are classes of devices and data,
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:55.320]   right?
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:56.320]   There's health ones.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.400]   There's all kinds of sensors in your body and things like that.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:05.720]   There are public space ones, traffic and crowds and noise and things.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:08.120]   There are transportation ones.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:10.240]   How fast is something going?
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:15.840]   These become nodes in a larger IoT ecosystem.
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:20.240]   Nobody's going to control, I don't think, all that data and have the access to all that
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.240]   data.
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:24.480]   But some players are going to find the ways to pull together to say, you know, "Ways"
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:28.520]   is going to try to say, "We're going to get every darn street sensor there is."
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:30.200]   Maybe they aren't, but they'll just pick it up.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:34.080]   We're going to get all this other kinds of data.
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:37.280]   We're going to know which gas stations people go to because they're cheaper.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.040]   We're going to know all this public stuff.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.960]   There's somebody else that's going to say, "We're going to do the best job of comparing
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.920]   you to your peers about your health."
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:46.920]   That kind of thing.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:47.920]   That's what I'm trying to understand.
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:50.720]   There's similar what's going on in the smart phones market right now, right?
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.200]   The Apple says, "We're just going to keep everything on device.
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:57.240]   You keep it to yourself, but we'll have all those things talk to each other versus Google,"
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:01.880]   which says, "Everything will go up to our cloud and we'll give you insights based on
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:02.880]   all of the things we can do."
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.280]   That's the question for the insights and who gets the insights and who doesn't?
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.280]   Stacey?
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.920]   This is going to be a commodity because it's so cheap to add a sensor.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:16.000]   Everyone originally thought that, "I'm going to be the sensor inside the car."
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:21.320]   I can buy an OBD port monitor, shove that in, and I've got my own sensor versus my insurance
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:25.520]   company might put their own black box in and they get their own data.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.800]   The data is a commodity.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:32.440]   The value will come from aggregating data and building really smart algorithms on top
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:33.440]   of it.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:35.280]   You'll see interesting things.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:42.360]   Apple with not health care kit, care kit, the medical device.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:45.920]   Places like that are really interesting because you're going to get a lot of data that's really
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:49.920]   useful to different parties and it's freely accessible.
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.600]   I'm looking for someone like Google to say, "Hey, that's awesome.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:54.480]   I'm not going to build my own because that's stupid.
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:57.040]   I'm just going to work with Apple on that."
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:59.360]   I don't know if that's actually going to break down.
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.640]   This is what people are fighting about all the time.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:08.520]   Jeff, because you asked, there is an IoT project that you should pay attention to.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.920]   It's called How Hot Is It in Harlem.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.160]   It's a WNYC is doing it.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:18.600]   They put sensors in Harlem in various different places and they're measuring literally how
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.640]   hot it is because there's no green space there and all this.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.640]   It's like a public works kind of thing.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:27.520]   Check that out because there is a thing called sensor journalism and some of the projects
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.520]   are really fun.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:34.080]   John Keefe of WNYC is a real leader in doing this and getting people to build things for
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.080]   that.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.120]   They also, when we had the cicadas come and YC had people build sensors, they put in the
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:43.040]   ground so they could predict where the cicadas were going to come out because it was all
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.120]   temperature based, which is all cool stuff.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.960]   I'm fascinated with what you said.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:51.600]   I'm really fascinated with that idea that people thought, "Well, if I can control the
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:56.120]   toaster data of America, that's going to be really valuable."
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.360]   What you're saying, I find fascinating, is that no, the data is the commodity.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.840]   The data is not going to be any big deal at all.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:07.120]   How you pull it together and how you handle it and how you act on it is going to matter.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.640]   Who's best positioned?
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.600]   I guess what this smart person at Esper was saying, that there are going to be players
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:19.200]   who are positioned well in certain domains and that he was arguing that local newspapers
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:24.240]   could be, could try, even though we have absolutely zero skills at this, zero, but could try to
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.880]   say, "Listen, we want to play in the civic and in other things.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:33.920]   We want to be a trusted player between private parties and houses and local government."
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.160]   What we've always done is gather information.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.320]   Why don't we gather this information?
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.760]   I was thinking about it.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:42.440]   Is there a business opportunity there or not?
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.440]   Yes.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.040]   We'll get you in on another question.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:50.760]   I think the Texas Tribune is actually working on some interesting things here around that.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.400]   The Daily Dot has been looking at data.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.920]   I'm not a fan of data.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.040]   There are a lot of data journalists.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.840]   I bet you even teach that a little bit at a scanning.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:00.840]   What we do?
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:01.840]   What we do?
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.840]   We do.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.400]   John Keefe, the way I see it comes in and teaches.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.400]   He's the real one.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:12.160]   But again, the value is saying it'd be something like, "I'm going to scan and have all of this
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:18.760]   information from City Hall and let's go with pulling permits for, give me something that's
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.520]   sort of building permits."
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:25.880]   So building building permits, the value the news organizations would bring is coming in,
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:30.040]   getting a reporter to say, "These are the keywords that you should look for, that you
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:36.040]   would want to flag is notable," in building that reference in the algorithm that would
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:41.960]   say that would actually allow you to input data and then get something useful.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:47.360]   I can see a tool like I could put in some moguls name and then find out all of their
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.160]   relationships based on Secretary of State data.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.520]   That would be really hugely valuable.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:57.840]   You could sell that in a newspaper could manage that.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.280]   I'm having a hard time thinking of cool citizen things like FOIA requests you could actually
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.960]   only make once.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:10.920]   Maybe you could get the people who like school districts and places to actually agree to
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:15.440]   send their FOIA stuff to places and then you could act as a repository for those.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.440]   I know.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.440]   Here's another example.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.440]   Here's an example.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:24.440]   So, FOIA did some really neat data work last week, which we don't have the rundown.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:29.080]   But they used their own data about who goes into what stores and the foot traffic and
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:33.680]   said that Trump's campaign is hurting the traffic to Trump-branded businesses.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.680]   That was really cool.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.600]   Now, so, FOIA has that data because it's in your phone.
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:39.600]   Who else has that data?
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.120]   Well, obviously, the phone company has that data because they know exactly where you are
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.120]   in your phone.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:50.200]   To an extent, on the road, not foot traffic, but car traffic, ways and Google Maps have
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.200]   that data.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:56.240]   Google has that data because they're tracking you, tracking is an emotional worm.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.240]   They know where you are in other ways.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:04.640]   In New York, we have these new oblisks going up with sensors in them that can probably
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:09.080]   just check on where there's more action by this door front or that door front or that
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.080]   front.
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.080]   So, they'll have that data.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:17.360]   It's really going to be valuable to stores to know how many people walked by, how many
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:22.880]   people stopped for three seconds and then kept going that they weren't drawn in, but
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.440]   they could have been.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:27.600]   Where was this person before they came here?
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.960]   You can imagine a lot of that.
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:35.440]   That might be civic data to the extent that it could come from public place sensors, but
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.160]   it could also come from private devices.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.640]   That's why I say data is commodity because all of those places can do it and I can name
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.560]   companies that are doing all of that stuff.
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:48.480]   Do you think though that given the awareness people have now that this will all just go
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.600]   ahead without intervention or that people are going to say, "Whoa, hold on a second."
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.880]   They're already saying that about all the cameras everywhere.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:00.960]   They go, "The cameras went around for a very long time."
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:05.320]   I wrote a story about Kansas City's connected Wi-Fi probably a month or two ago.
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:12.120]   They launched Kansas City, put in a Wi-Fi network and a new street train.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.120]   Is that what they're called?
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.120]   Trolley?
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.120]   Something.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.120]   Streetcar.
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:22.840]   They put this in and I talked to the CIO of Kansas City and he told me and I quoted him
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:30.840]   that the software they're using can see whose phone is walking down the street and they
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:38.600]   give that to, I think it's called Pin Drop, which is owned by Sprint and they give all
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.280]   that data over to them.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.760]   The city actually never sees this data.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:48.520]   I was like, "You know if I'm walking down the street, what if I was crying was committed?
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.520]   Could you get that?"
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.240]   He's like, "No, I'd have to subpoena the data from them."
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:57.200]   I was like, "Whoa, so you get all this data and you just send it right over."
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.840]   This is not uncommon.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:03.800]   There's companies like Euclid, there's others that like, "God, Peter Thiel put money into
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.360]   this Wi-Fi company and it's…"
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.080]   I want to say it's benefits but it's not.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.080]   It starts with a Z.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:15.120]   It's a San Francisco Wi-Fi company and they're basically tracking you individually using
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:20.880]   your phone in the Wi-Fi address, Wi-Fi hotspots that when it tries to ping a Wi-Fi hotspot,
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:26.040]   it's also leaking data about other Wi-Fi hotspots that you've been on.
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:30.360]   So all of this is actually happening without our knowledge, without our cooperation.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:37.040]   Often city governments release this information in ways they shouldn't, a private business.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.920]   Is there going to be a backlash or do people just not care and just go, "Oh, whatever,
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:41.920]   I don't care?"
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:42.920]   I was a little bell.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:43.920]   I was a little bell.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.920]   I was a little bell.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.920]   I thought people would care.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:46.920]   They don't care.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.920]   They didn't care.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.920]   There is value.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.360]   You and I know there's value but even then, I think if there weren't value, they don't
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:52.360]   care.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.360]   It's like I got enough to worry about.
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:54.360]   I don't care.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:07:00.080]   The only thing is that, and this is an argument I made before, that we shouldn't control the
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.720]   generation or the gathering of data.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:05.480]   What you have to control is the use of the data.
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.880]   Having cameras on the street.
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.280]   So data is going to happen no matter what.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.280]   It is anyway.
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.880]   So still having cameras all over everywhere, right?
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:20.680]   It would be bad if this was used to out people having affairs, but it's good when it finds
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:23.160]   missing children.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:26.360]   It's good when it finds the criminal who did something.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:30.360]   It's bad if it just reveals people and violates the privacy.
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.120]   So the question, the data is not bad.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:35.280]   The use of the data is the question.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.840]   And I think that we get into a position where we risk it into, especially in my European
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:42.720]   arguments, of saying that data is bad, that's saying knowledge is bad.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.720]   No, you want the data.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.480]   It can be really simple.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.640]   But what you do with it is quite another matter.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.080]   And yes, there needs to be regulation of that.
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.120]   I don't question that.
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.520]   It was regulation that allows the good to also occur.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:56.600]   I have very little hope of any of that happening.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.520]   I think it's, I think it'll happen and we'll just have some really egregious violations
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.120]   first.
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.120]   And then we'll have these like each other actions.
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:09.240]   I mean, if we were for list whistle blowers, we wouldn't have known that the NSA was gathering
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.880]   all the phone traffic out of AT&T in San Francisco.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.800]   We wouldn't have known that unless one guy came forward.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.000]   We just happen to know about that.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.480]   I can only imagine how many things we don't know about.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:22.600]   Let's also go to actual harm.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:28.600]   The fact that for most people, I think it's the Stacy's point, for the vast, vast, vast,
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:31.400]   vast majority of people, there's no impact on their lives.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:34.840]   It's say, oh, that could happen or I find that creepy or if I'd have wrong.
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:35.840]   Right.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:36.840]   That's right.
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:40.760]   But when it comes to this actually affected me, you know, here's an here's another one.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.040]   So what's we call it?
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.040]   Easy pass.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.600]   Do you have the same brand?
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.600]   Well, we have fast track.
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.600]   So those things.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.600]   Austin has easy pass.
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:55.080]   So obviously the government knows exactly where you've been and, you know, they could
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:09:01.120]   send your husband or wife a map at a timetable of where your car has been all the time or
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.400]   Tesla could do that in your case.
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.120]   Actually, I haven't put my Tesla.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.400]   I know where my Tesla is at all times.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:07.400]   Right.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:10.720]   So, you know, in certain circumstances, you can imagine that being used badly.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.800]   And so to maintain the trust and allow the system to operate, government has to be--
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.800]   Let me just tell you.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.440]   It's a lot harder to have enough fare than it used to be.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:22.120]   My wife has an app that shows where I am at every minute of the day.
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:26.040]   It's really, in my case, you know, it's harder just because I get older.
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.200]   I thought it was less hard as you got older.
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.200]   Oh, really?
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.200]   Oh, really?
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.200]   Did we go there?
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.200]   Just hit me.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.200]   Just hit me and--
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:39.880]   I might show up at the studio next week just to smack me and just say, "You are bad and
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.880]   wrong."
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:41.880]   You took it.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:42.880]   I always go there.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880]   I always go there, Stacy.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.880]   You are going to learn this about me.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.680]   I have a very bad habit of that.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:47.840]   And I'll just be like--
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.560]   I always go for the bad, dirty joke.
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:55.760]   There needs to be a little punching bag right next to you that you say it stays hidden.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.560]   Oh, I could totally connect something for this.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.720]   Yeah, with a little electric buzzer in my seat.
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.720]   The padlob.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:02.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.400]   That would help me a lot, actually, if you would do that.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.640]   No, that's what I have Twitter for.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.640]   There you go.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.640]   All right.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.160]   I talked to somebody this weekend, too, who is a fan of this show.
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.160]   This is the show.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:19.320]   Who's an investor in a shot spotter.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.320]   I think we've talked about that.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.320]   What's that?
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.320]   I don't know that.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.840]   So shot spotter has microphones on rooftops buildings.
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:26.840]   This is interesting.
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.000]   Because of privacy concerns, they don't put them on street level for the fear that people
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   can hear actual conversations.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.400]   They put them on rooftops and it triangulates the sound of a gunshot.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.040]   And sends the police to that.
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.280]   And he said there were all kinds of other great uses of this.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:49.040]   For example, people who use dynamite to hunt for fish and destroy coral reefs so they
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.600]   can locate where this is.
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:53.240]   It's not very sportsman-like, is it the dynamite fish?
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.240]   No, it's not.
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:55.240]   It's a very sportsman-like.
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.240]   It's a very sportsman-like.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.920]   Also speaking of sportsman-like poachers.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:03.240]   So they did an experiment in, I think, with South Africa with poachers.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.880]   And so this idea, please use this shot spotter.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:06.880]   Yes, they do.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:07.880]   Yes, they do.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.560]   And Chicago.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:12.200]   And I believe it's in Washington, D.C. or maybe it's Baltimore.
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.640]   And it's in parts of New York as well.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.480]   Oh, look, here's the map.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:16.480]   It's everywhere.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.040]   If it looks like it's in Petaluma.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.040]   What is that?
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.040]   What is that dot?
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.840]   Wow, there's a lot of there.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.840]   Wow.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.000]   The salesperson must live there or something.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.320]   Because I doubt there's a whole lot of shots being fired up here.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.640]   Wow.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.200]   That's interesting.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:41.280]   Yeah, I'm so-- I go back and forth on this about just like--
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:45.680]   we won't even know what benefits or interesting things can happen unless we just let it all
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:46.680]   happen.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:50.440]   I hate that they say, well, we don't want to put it on ground level because we don't
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:55.280]   want people to worry or we don't want to face recognition and because people will know.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.000]   And let's just do it.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.440]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.760]   I feel like we're missing out on some really interesting things.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.760]   We are too.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:04.760]   We find out.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:09.160]   I think South Korea, they've implemented some crazy stuff.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.480]   Oh, we talked about this already.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.280]   We talked about the property values going down.
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:13.840]   We talked about the affairs.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:16.400]   No, that was some other show you were on.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.400]   Or maybe I was on your--
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.200]   I was while I was gone.
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:20.200]   Okay.
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.200]   I was like, I remember this.
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.200]   I missed it.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:24.200]   Yeah, you did.
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:25.200]   It was good.
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.200]   Dang.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.200]   I have to listen to that show.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.200]   I'll teach you for leaving us.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.200]   Big stamp.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.200]   Big mistake.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.200]   Although I wasn't here last week.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.200]   He's Martin Us.
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.200]   By the way, great show.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:36.120]   Go see it if you're in San Diego at the old globe.
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.120]   Very funny.
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.760]   Well, you're going to meet your shower.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:40.760]   Very funny.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:41.760]   And it'll be on Broadway.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.120]   You'll get to see it.
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:48.200]   The actors apparently aren't fighting over whether they get to go to Broadway or not.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.200]   I what?
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.200]   I dips this.
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.200]   That makes sense.
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.040]   You get to get to go to Broadway with a show written by Steve Martin.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.040]   It's like gold.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.040]   It's like gold.
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.040]   You can't go wrong.
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.040]   All right.
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.040]   Let's take a break.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.040]   Come back with more.
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.040]   Lots of stuff.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.040]   Okay.
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.040]   It's your turn, Jeff, to pick your story.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.040]   Oh, oh.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:08.040]   Do we get both stories you wanted, Stacy?
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.040]   No, because I actually the story I want is the other story.
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.040]   Stacy wanted.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.040]   Oh, well, that's perfect.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.040]   You need broadband?
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.040]   Oh, no.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.040]   All right.
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.040]   We'll do Jeff, then it'll be your turn again.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:19.040]   Who is the, um, we got plenty of time.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:21.040]   Half an hour left.
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.040]   It is.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.040]   Yes, Stacy.
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:25.040]   You're right.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.040]   Kismit.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.040]   Kismit struck us.
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.360]   You're going to have to do it over my head.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.360]   Wait a minute.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.360]   I'll just duck.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.360]   Wait, I don't know which side.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.360]   That's the rub.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.360]   I got to go the other way.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:35.360]   I just, I can't.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.360]   I have no say you want to.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.160]   Oh, you just boxed my ears.
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.280]   That's what she wanted.
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.400]   That was a, that was good.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.120]   That was team boxing.

[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.480]   They're all kind of changing the world thanks to digital technology.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.920]   Your advertisers have to hit a certain mark.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.680]   Oh, they do.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.680]   They do.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:53.080]   Although, I think we've got an underwear sponsor coming.
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.560]   Oh, well, we use that too.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.520]   Hey, we got to use those too.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:58.520]   Yep.
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.240]   All right, Jeff, your turn.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.240]   Story of the week.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.240]   Stacey's story.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:06.640]   It was, I want to hear what she has to say about this too.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.640]   This is me off.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:08.640]   What did I just do?
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.640]   Oops.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:10.640]   Oops.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.640]   Now you look good.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:12.640]   No, I just turned on something.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.640]   There I got.
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:16.400]   USA Today, damn you, puts on auto.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.400]   Oh.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.400]   No auto play.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.000]   We're doing that too now where video starts.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.600]   Noise starts.
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.200]   Is it Bloomberg that's doing this too?
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.760]   He's in the number of the CMBC doesn't.
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.320]   They all do it and it just drives me nuts.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.920]   Luckily, I can only hear it, but it was driving me nuts.
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:35.680]   Speaking of being driven nuts, I'm very, very disappointed to see that the FCC lost its
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:44.120]   effort to enable states and localities to build municipal broadband.
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:48.320]   In fact, now states win the right inclusion, inclusion and corruption.
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:54.080]   States didn't win the right Comcast for rise in an AT&T won the right.
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:17:01.040]   It all started with Philadelphia doing municipal Wi-Fi in Comcast backyard and they and the
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:05.440]   big internet service providers went with bags of money to the state legislature and
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.400]   then they realized, oh, this is a good strategy.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:13.120]   They went to 40 different state legislatures have now passed laws against municipal Wi-Fi.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.320]   They're shocking.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:18.400]   The rationale is while you're competing against private enterprise.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:23.120]   Well, that's not what the laws say.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:26.560]   The laws are like what's the rationale and the law then?
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.560]   Oh, no, sorry.
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:33.680]   The legal rationale is things like they have to make certain amounts of money.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:34.680]   They have to.
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.880]   People play like Pokemon go.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:42.400]   No, they're things like, oh, man, I used to write about this.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.400]   They have to.
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.400]   Okay.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.600]   Getting my brain back in order here.
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.600]   It's the.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.600]   It's the heat.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.600]   It's the.
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:51.600]   It's the.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.320]   It's the margaritas last night.
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.960]   The heat and the margaritas.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:55.960]   That's a deadly combination.
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.760]   Well, we're having a party for the staff tomorrow at our house and I'm trying to decide what
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.240]   mixed drink to ply them with.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.400]   I'm thinking daiquiris.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:05.400]   I'm going with a room.
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:07.200]   That's so dainty.
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:08.200]   Dainty?
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.200]   Daiquiris are dainty.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:11.200]   I'll remember my parents.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.200]   That was a 60s drink.
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:15.240]   I want to know what you know, the Washington Post got me started with this because they
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:21.760]   did a whole thing on Havana club, which was castros actually before Castro Hemingway's
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:24.440]   favorite room, Made in Cuba.
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:28.640]   And then of course, when Castro came into power, the makers, the family fled.
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:31.280]   They live in Florida and they decided to stop making room.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:36.240]   So the Bacardi family, which had also fled Cuba said, all right, we'll make Havana club.
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:40.920]   Well now Castro is making Havana club in Cuba.
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:41.920]   And now the Cuba is open.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:45.680]   They're going to be two competing Havana clubs.
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.960]   And so I'm reading this great story, which is fascinating.
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:50.320]   And then the Washington Post does the right thing.
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:55.840]   They have a panel of rum tasters, taste the two and some other great rums.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:59.200]   And that and that guy and they talked about daiquiris, which Hemingway Hemingway has a
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:00.200]   daiquiri that he invented.
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.440]   It doesn't have any sugar in it.
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:07.600]   Just Maras, Maraschino, Liqueur, grapefruit juice and lime juice.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.000]   There you go.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   The rum more.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.680]   Anyway, back to Stacey.
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.440]   I was just giving a little time.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.000]   I was like, I was filling for you.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   And I enjoyed the cocktail.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.280]   And I ordered, I went online and I went, there's a rumtasting.com or something and I ordered
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.120]   the top.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:28.560]   There's one rum that's $30 that everybody says, this is the best deal in spirits.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.640]   It's the best rum for nothing.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.920]   And then I bought, I thought, well, I'm going to try one like $100 bottle and we'll see,
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.440]   we'll compare.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:38.360]   So maybe mojitos, but I think there's too much muddling involved.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:42.680]   The nice thing about daiquiri, you can squeeze the limes ahead of time.
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.480]   Were you considering margaritas too or that's dangerous?
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:49.640]   Lisa loves margaritas, but as you know, it should be a control center.
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.120]   Margaritas, tequila makes your clothes fall off.
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.520]   And this is a work event.
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:57.240]   So yeah, don't do that to your staff.
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.480]   Don't do that to you.
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:19:59.480]   Okay.
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:00.480]   So Muni broadband laws.
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:06.240]   So a lot of these laws are things like they have to give the telecom operator a chance to
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:08.600]   build a similar network.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.200]   So that's one way to get around it.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:15.480]   Another one is to require different voter referendums, which can be hard to do.
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:18.160]   And then so it costs money to do the referendum.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:24.240]   And then the ISPs oftentimes will pull out massive amounts of money.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.600]   It's like Uber did in Austin.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.400]   So to get that done.
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:31.000]   Yeah, because nobody would vote against me as a free municipal Wi-Fi.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.600]   That's like God in country.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:34.600]   That's like apple pie.
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.160]   Why wouldn't you want that?
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:40.120]   Well, that was also a long time ago when before people, I mean, like people were like, why
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:43.640]   if I would, I think I saw Intel show about that.
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:44.880]   They were not watching your show.
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:49.720]   And then the final law is laws that really suck and are written poorly.
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:53.360]   And they're just so you can challenge them in court and make it just like, you don't
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.760]   even want to bother doing a meeting network because you're going to get nice.
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:59.720]   These going to come after you.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:02.600]   So they figured that basically they rigged it.
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.600]   Yes.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.600]   It's very, very big.
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.600]   21 states have these.
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.200]   Oh, I thought it was more than that.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.200]   It's only 21.
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.200]   Okay.
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:11.200]   I thought it was 40.
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:14.520]   I had read 40, but that might be old.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.520]   Maybe it's 21 with certain types of restrictions.
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:22.880]   Texas has one that says no municipal agency can have its own wireless network, which screwed
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:25.120]   our ISP up, not our ISP.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.840]   I'm sorry, our utility up when it wanted to do some smart grid stuff.
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:33.800]   So these aren't just mini broadband as more things become broadband enabled.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:36.600]   They can actually, you can get into these.
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.280]   Run afoul of the law.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.280]   What is the network?
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.280]   What is the survey?
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:46.480]   So I guess, I mean, you could make the only case you could make is the kind of traditional
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:50.720]   conservative capitalist case, which is, well, you're competing against private enterprise
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:54.480]   and wouldn't it be better if private enterprise did it, which would be fine if private enterprise
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:59.200]   did it, but a private enterprise does it and they don't do it, right?
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:03.440]   I mean, for the most part, private enterprise says, there's no money in that.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.200]   I'm not going to do free public Wi-Fi.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.200]   And so they don't.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:09.560]   If you go to full libertarian want to eat with a double twist, you know, you say this
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:12.000]   is in the private roads and public roads.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000]   Right.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000]   So is this the road of the future?
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000]   We've had that idea.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   I am a student.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.080]   Texas and you will see that in action.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.080]   It's terrible.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.800]   Yeah, they have private roads, don't you?
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:22.800]   We have private roads.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:23.800]   We have things that government refuses to serve.
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:24.800]   It's special.
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:32.200]   I really feel like I am a big supporter of the idea of, and I should give credit to, I
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:37.400]   think it's Bob Frankston, the guy, one of the guys who created VisiCalc, who's been
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:42.640]   lobbying all over the country for this for municipal Wi-Fi, but not, or municipal internet,
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:50.160]   not municipal Wi-Fi, not free Wi-Fi, but the town and maybe even using eminent demand
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:55.040]   to take over existing wiring, but the town should own the internet infrastructure in
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.280]   that town.
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:02.160]   And then the town should invite private companies to provide over the top internet services.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:06.840]   Is that the way power operates now in many places like you're a new jury?
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:07.840]   It's how power operates.
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:08.840]   And how BT operates.
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:09.840]   So utility.
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:10.840]   So in the UK, right?
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:14.640]   Wi-Fi is a utility, but we add the competitive layer.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.640]   And you want the competition.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:18.600]   You don't want just one incumbent providing internet access.
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:19.920]   That's too dangerous.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:25.040]   So infrastructure is provided and maintained by the city, who then leases it out to private
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:27.880]   enterprise and anybody can play.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:34.800]   And then you have people like Sonic, NetAn, Comcast and AT&T all competing for our custom.
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.800]   I think that's a great system.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:39.000]   So it's not going to work.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.840]   Why is that not going to work, Stacey?
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.360]   It sort of works that way in the UK.
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.360]   It's a little different.
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:46.400]   The Netherlands actually has a wonderful Amsterdam has this.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:49.080]   And they have much better internet than we do.
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:50.080]   They do.
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:53.640]   The city owns the conduit and then people run their own wires through it.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:59.800]   It's Seattle actually owns its own broadband, like its own dark fiber.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:04.720]   And even then they were going to do a network with the gigabit network.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:10.040]   The mayor that pushed that really hard actually didn't get reelected instead someone who
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:13.840]   Comcast and others helped fund his opponent.
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:18.200]   So another thing that we're kind of forgetting about is the limited timeframe of a lot of
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:19.920]   the electric officials.
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:26.600]   But the big macro thing is we, when we decided on the 1996 telecom act, we decided we were
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:31.960]   going to have facilities based competition, which is cable companies versus the DSL telecom.
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:36.680]   And when we decided that, we basically said they're going to own the infrastructure and
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:37.800]   be able to do what they want.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.560]   And get a monopoly, a regional monopolies result.
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:45.840]   I'm surprised there hasn't been a proposition or a friend of in California.
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:49.760]   That's the one place in the country where the citizens could say, no, we are going to
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:54.240]   use our voting power to what to take their fiber.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:25:01.080]   I mean, that's like, to enable a local government to do so.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:07.160]   And, and, and, you know, the telcos would lobby like crazy, but you could imagine, especially
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:14.520]   in Silicon Valley, where there'd be money to counteract that, Google would counteract
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:15.520]   that.
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.880]   You know, I'm looking at this decision.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.040]   It's kind of complicated.
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:26.280]   So the FCC wanted to preempt those laws that would prevent municipal internet and, and
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.880]   Tennessee and North Carolina.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:32.240]   The federal appeals court says the FCC lacks the legal authority to do so.
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.680]   That's often, by the way, the way courts stop FCC mandates because the FCC can only do what
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.040]   Congress says it can do.
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.360]   But this is what's weird.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.320]   This comes from the decision.
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:49.080]   The FCC order essentially serves to reallocate decision making power between the states and
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:50.800]   their municipalities.
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:58.680]   Judge John Rogers says the FCC is attempting to reverse the pecking order.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:00.760]   Counties in cities must follow state law, which attends the court.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:05.400]   And if that state law forbids local governments from building networks or selling access, then
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:08.760]   the FCC has no business to say otherwise.
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:09.760]   Right.
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:16.280]   So this is basically saying the state law trumps the federal laws in this case.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:20.480]   And I mean, a lot of people would say that's the way it should go.
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:25.440]   I mean, if this weren't about meaning broadband and actually the state laws trumped the city
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:26.440]   laws.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:27.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:31.160]   The county laws, county laws, FCC can't dictate any of it.
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:32.160]   Right.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:34.040]   FCC's federal has nothing to do with it.
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:37.440]   And you can't upset that pecking order.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.440]   That apple carton.
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.680]   And that's a purely legal decision.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:44.960]   And I'm wondering if maybe there's a way to figure this out.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:47.200]   I bet there is.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:49.520]   I can talk to people and tell you next show.
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:53.200]   Well, it's something I have a great interest in because I really think that there's this
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.200]   should be fixed.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.640]   Chat Nougas, the classic case where chat news.
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:03.280]   That's who started part of this is they wanted to a couple cities near Chat Nougas were like,
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:05.640]   Oh, can we get some of your broadband?
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:07.680]   And they were like, yeah, I guess so.
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.200]   We got a larger way.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.720]   And then that's how this all came around.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:17.440]   Chat Nougas schools and students, students in formerly underserved areas have also benefited
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:18.840]   from the broadband service.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:22.880]   E.P.B. is the power utility in a Chat Nougas.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.720]   Initially, notes the judge by introducing E.P.B. to the marketplace.
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:33.280]   It's resulted in lower rates and improved service from existing providers in the area
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.280]   competition.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:36.640]   That's good.
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:40.720]   And counter to claims made by opponents of municipal broadband who say it's always a money-losing
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:41.720]   venture.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:45.400]   The court points points out that Chat Nougas also put more.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:50.400]   The E.P.B. has put more money to Chat Nougas coffers, which upgrade and as a result, their
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:54.480]   bonds were upgraded to double A plus in 2012.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.480]   So it's a good thing.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:00.160]   It's a good thing for everybody who doesn't win except, well, maybe they set it.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:03.160]   It can be money losing for the city.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:04.720]   It depends on how you think about it.
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.320]   It's an economic development.
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.320]   It's an investment.
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:12.080]   It's also more efficient for the city if they can manage the stuff on their own.
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:17.280]   But again, that's one of those highly nuanced, subtle things that when you're voting or trying
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:21.520]   to explain it to the average citizen, they're kind of like, "Ah."
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:22.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:29.400]   You know, fixing the roads is also a time's money sink for municipal governments.
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:30.480]   But they need to do it.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:31.480]   It's their job.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.480]   It's why we pay taxes.
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:38.240]   Well, if you're going to both Clinton and Trump are arguing for major spending on infrastructure,
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:41.160]   believe it or not, Trump is too, even more than Clinton is.
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:44.400]   And it's one matter of recent builds and bridges and roads, we need that.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:52.840]   But to me, if you truly built out world-class, best-of-class, broadband networks and enabled
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:56.320]   commerce to occur on top of them, businesses, a whole would benefit.
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:59.920]   And it could even reduce the carbon, the problem is the cable companies want to hold a strangle
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:01.160]   hold on it.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.160]   But in the long run, it will reduce their capital cost.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.640]   It can happen.
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:09.880]   So this is a blow to Chattanooga and North Carolina.
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:13.320]   But there's good news on the broadband fund.
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:14.320]   Yes.
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:18.400]   Google, in San-- I always get my sands confused.
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:21.240]   Is it San Francisco or San Jose that they're doing a fiber network?
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:24.920]   It's like I get the Austin and San Antonio confused too, yeah.
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:25.920]   Oh boy.
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:26.920]   Okay.
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:27.920]   That was kind of hurtful.
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:28.920]   That's cool.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:29.920]   I was confused.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:30.920]   Brooklyn and the Bronx.
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:31.920]   So there.
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.920]   Okay.
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:33.920]   There we go.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:37.240]   I can use my left for my right too.
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:43.520]   So this is kind of interesting because there's kind of some new technologies that-- and Google
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:49.200]   fiber is one of these-- this is why cable is actually getting so much faster and Comcast
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:54.880]   is telling people it's going to be super fast by 2017 that everybody should have a gig
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.440]   of it, I think it is.
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:57.440]   Wow.
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:58.440]   Don't hold me there.
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:03.440]   Comcast is making some crazy predictions and it's because Google fiber started coming in
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:04.520]   and pushing them.
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:07.760]   So this market does need competition.
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:12.640]   But we may not have to dig fiber anymore.
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:19.760]   We might be able to do this via kind of microwave and gigahertz wireless, like point to point,
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:23.400]   gigahertz wireless that doesn't have to be point to point anymore because of phased array
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:26.560]   of tennis, so new antenna technology.
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:31.880]   If this happens, it reduces the capital cost of putting fiber in and we could have gigabit
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:34.680]   connections like tomorrow.
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:35.680]   So that's exciting.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.680]   Sorry.
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:37.680]   I like it.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:39.680]   That was a random segue but I was going to make.
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:40.680]   All right.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:44.680]   Now we get to kind of like the little nitty gritty stories like new features.
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:50.720]   For instance, Chrome, according to the Google blog, the official Google blog is starting
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:58.440]   to deprecate flash going forward.
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:59.960]   They write Chrome will de-emphasize flash at favor of HTML5.
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:00.960]   I didn't know this.
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:01.960]   Not kill it.
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.640]   Not kill it, but boy, get close.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:08.440]   90% of flash on the web, according to the blog, loads behind the scenes to support things
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:09.600]   like page analytics.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:15.920]   I did not know that this kind of flash slows you down and starting in September, Chrome 53
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:18.240]   will begin to block it.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.240]   Block it.
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.720]   Block it behind the scenes flash.
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:27.840]   In December, Chrome 55 will make HTML5 the default experience except for sites that only
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.120]   support flash.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:32.000]   For those, you'll be prompted to enable flash.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000]   It won't just run.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.200]   Remember those videos you didn't like, Jeff?
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.200]   They won't just run.
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:40.720]   You'll be prompted to turn on flash first.
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:45.440]   Aside from that, the only change you'll notice, aside from that, besides that, the only thing
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:48.440]   you'll notice is safer, more powerful, efficient browsing experience.
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:50.720]   Flash does suck battery, it slows it down.
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:56.600]   It's a privacy problem and security problem as well.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:57.600]   I guess good news.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:02.840]   People are going to then say, "But Leo, you only use flash on your website to follow
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:04.040]   my Mac video."
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:05.560]   I wish we didn't.
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:07.520]   I wish we didn't have to.
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:13.800]   We do pay for one server, FlowSoft, that does an HLS stream, a non-flash stream.
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:16.440]   That's for iOS and iPad.
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:19.400]   But use stream and bit gravity.
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:22.400]   We have a number of providers on our pages and you can switch between them.
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:23.880]   Are still flash based.
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:28.000]   I think that this will hasten though, their move to HTML5.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.320]   As they go so go, we're dependent on them because we don't do our own stream.
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.440]   We can't afford to.
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.560]   We use those great people at use stream.
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.080]   They have some HTTP streaming.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:42.520]   I'm not sure why they don't know how exactly how it works.
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.520]   We'll get there.
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:49.280]   This helps, in my opinion, so good thing.
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:51.480]   Do you want to talk about emails?
[01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:52.480]   Inbox?
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:53.480]   We're talking about inbox.
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:54.480]   Inbox?
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:55.480]   Thank you.
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:56.480]   You saved me.
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:59.320]   I was going to talk about the Clinton emails and the close relationship.
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:00.320]   No, please don't.
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.320]   No, no.
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:02.320]   No, politics.
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:03.320]   It's not politics.
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.320]   Google's involved.
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:05.320]   Okay.
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:07.920]   No, I don't want to talk about it.
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:08.920]   But inbox.
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:09.920]   Inbox.
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:11.080]   I love to hear your opinions because I hate inbox.
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:12.080]   I love inbox.
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:13.080]   I don't think Jeff likes it either.
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:14.080]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.080]   I'm a convert.
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:16.080]   I'm a convert now.
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:17.080]   I'm fully in.
[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:24.240]   It's like switching from a stick shift to an automatic.
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:28.080]   You feel like you're out of control for a while, but it turns out you're not.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:33.200]   I tried it for like six months and I just finally was like, "Ah, no more."
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:38.080]   And I liked some features, but I like the automatic replies.
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.080]   Yeah, I love that.
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.080]   That's a good reason you use no box.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.080]   I use mutt.
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:48.400]   It's like pine only, more even more geeky.
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:49.400]   So.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:53.640]   No, but they, so they're adding Trello and GitHub integration.
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:57.320]   So that means it when you get, this is where, this is why eventually you're going to just
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:01.720]   kind of want inbox because they are, as they scan your emails, they can do into Google.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:05.440]   Now we kind of say, Stacy, Stacy, you're going to want this.
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.440]   I did.
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:09.040]   So I didn't like Google now.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:12.040]   It just feels very dev focused too.
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:14.480]   Well, it is Trello is a project manager.
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:17.360]   GitHub is a code versioning system.
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:22.200]   So neither of these will you probably use, but you might use, you might like having,
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:26.200]   you ever use Google alerts to scan for your name?
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:28.600]   Wouldn't it be nice if Google and their?
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:33.400]   So they, I, they do and they pull your shipping data on all your packages and together.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:34.400]   Yeah, I love that.
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:36.960]   I mean, I know what it does.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:39.560]   I just, I didn't like it for.
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:40.560]   You don't like the categorization.
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:42.800]   I didn't like the categorization.
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:48.960]   I didn't like trying to find things and get to things just by looking at my phone.
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:52.880]   When I, when I would pull up my phone, I want actually to see the most recent news items
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:54.960]   because of my job.
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:59.840]   And instead I would see like this clustering of things and they would pop back up to the
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:03.480]   top and I don't know, but I am, I suck at email.
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:05.320]   I've got like 36,000 on my business.
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:07.320]   Everybody sucks at email.
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:08.320]   So email sucks.
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:09.320]   I'm not you that sucks.
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:10.320]   It's email.
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:11.320]   It sucks.
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:15.440]   If you use Google Drive, you can insert drive links into emails, check and fix permissions
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:20.200]   for those links and save email attachments to drive, drag and drop contacts between two
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:24.960]   CC and BCC and compose on web, delete right from the inbox just as easily as you can mark
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.800]   done.
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:31.880]   I think, I think they're going to get this is, this is, this is the new Gmail inbox.
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:35.680]   It's also the new Google, this, this goes back to what I've said on the show for years,
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.440]   the first time I ever talked about the hyper personal news stream, you tie inbox to Google
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:43.640]   now, Stacy's beloved Google now and amazing things can happen.
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:49.560]   By the way, that's a bingo card, hyper personal news stream.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:50.560]   You can all have it.
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.560]   I think, yeah.
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.560]   Got you.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:53.560]   Oh, two drinks.
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:54.560]   Oh, nice.
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:57.560]   How many for the book, the book show?
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:58.560]   The book reveal.
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:35:59.560]   There are two of those.
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:03.360]   Oh, she got back to me for the Texas crack.
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:09.840]   Let's see what else.
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:13.560]   Self-driving car unit losing three key execs at Google.
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.840]   So what does this mean?
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:18.600]   That's a good question.
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:26.400]   I mean, I think Apple's self-driving car initiative is also kind of struggling a little bit.
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.560]   I think sometimes people just get tired of it.
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:36.360]   Chris Ermerson, who is the CTO in technical leave, has been there for seven years.
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:43.160]   What's interesting is he doesn't have another job.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:44.160]   I don't know.
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:45.760]   Maybe he's made enough money and he has kids.
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:46.920]   He just wants to take some time.
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:49.160]   I don't know.
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:54.000]   And then also, Jajun Ju, the team, which is a great name, by the way, Jajun Ju.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000]   Jajun Ju.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.400]   Jajun Ju, the team sounds like something wrong with me.
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:06.280]   Jajun Ju, the team's principal software engineer, is found in his own current startup.
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:09.160]   I think this is all kind of normal.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:10.160]   I think so too.
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:11.160]   I think people are making a big deal out of it.
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:13.680]   This is such a long-term venture.
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:17.880]   I mean, when you hear that he's been there for seven years already, it's just...
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:22.040]   So what I didn't know, I was with the head of consumer reports and also Craig Newmark
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:23.640]   this weekend was on the board of consumer reports.
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:30.040]   I didn't know that the reports had gone after Tesla.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:32.720]   They said they should call it autopilot.
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:34.720]   Right.
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:35.720]   This is not really that.
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:36.800]   And she said that all the...
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:45.440]   It was fascinating is all the fanatics from Tesla out in the field, you know, argue with
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:48.280]   them and then Musk said at first, no, and then he thought about it a little bit and said,
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:51.080]   "In fact, you're right."
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:57.920]   I think that's a smart call because it's driver assist and that sets up different expectations
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:58.920]   in people...
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:02.440]   You saw the story of the guy who's maybe had saved his life.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:03.440]   I think we had that...
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:04.440]   That's such BS.
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:05.920]   That's such BS.
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:08.200]   I think Elon planted that story.
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:11.640]   It said that Tesla drove him to the emergency room.
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:12.640]   No, no, no.
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.560]   It drove him to the exit.
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.560]   He had to take over then.
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:18.360]   It couldn't go all the way, but he just decided...
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:23.000]   But you understand that the nav system on a Tesla is not in any way connected to the autopilot,
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000]   right?
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000]   Right.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.400]   So it didn't drive him anywhere.
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.400]   It just kept him from...
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:28.840]   He just stopped having to drive.
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:30.000]   He was plowing into something.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000]   Yes.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.080]   And he at some point had to sit up and go, "Oh, there's the exit to the emergency room and
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:35.640]   drive yourself the rest of the way."
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:38.240]   The argument is that if he didn't have that aid, if he hadn't drive the whole way, he
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.960]   couldn't have done it, he would have had to stop and get an ambulance, weren't taking
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:42.520]   too long, he wouldn't have conked.
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:43.520]   Right.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.520]   So the argument is that this got closer to the hospital.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.840]   I think it sounds like an attempt to counter...
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:48.840]   Yes, I think so.
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.760]   The negative publicity myself.
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:59.040]   My mom, she actually had like crazy thing happen to her that caused internal bleeding.
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.280]   She passed out, ran her car into a guardrail.
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:02.280]   She survived.
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:03.280]   So that wouldn't happen with a Tesla?
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:05.560]   But with a Tesla, that wouldn't have happened.
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:07.560]   If she had autopilot auto-steer...
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:08.560]   Right.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:09.720]   But what I wonder is, Stacey...
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:12.960]   So if God forbid your mom had lost consciousness, would the Tesla...
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:13.960]   She did.
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:15.640]   Would have just kept going?
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:16.640]   Yes.
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:17.640]   Right?
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:18.640]   It stops.
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:19.640]   Doesn't it stop?
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:24.320]   Well, if she loses the causes and her hands aren't in the wheel, eventually it will slow
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:26.120]   down and stop or...
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:29.520]   Well, it first alerts you.
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:33.600]   And I think also if the road gets more curvy, it alerts you.
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:37.160]   I've gone long distances without it telling me to put my hands on the wheel, so I don't
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:38.480]   know.
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:41.120]   They say it's supposed to, but yeah, I've heard from people who are like...
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:42.120]   Doesn't seem...
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:43.720]   You don't have autopilot in yours, right?
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:44.720]   I don't.
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.240]   Which is a shame because I pass out a lot.
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:48.240]   No.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:51.160]   It could be handy.
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:53.080]   I think those are called the Vipas.
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:54.080]   He's just...
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:55.080]   I'm a swooner.
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:56.080]   Ah, a swoon.
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:59.080]   Oh my goodness.
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:02.880]   Yeah, I mean...
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:04.840]   I think it's really oversold.
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:07.120]   It's a very good cruise control.
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:10.200]   It has some steering capability.
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:11.200]   And it has...
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:12.360]   This is probably the weirdest one.
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:14.480]   It has auto lane change.
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:17.720]   It is not by any sense the word autonomous.
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:20.920]   And I think that Consumer Reports is right.
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:24.600]   And Elon was incensed about what they said, but I think they're right.
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:28.360]   I think calling it autopilot is a marketing term.
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:31.240]   And it's really designed to make you think you have a self-driving car.
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:37.600]   And so naturally, there are going to be some buffoons who will get in the back seat or
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.600]   take a nap or watch a movie.
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:40.600]   Watch Harry Potter.
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:43.000]   Terrible idea.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000]   It's not.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.200]   It's more assist.
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:49.200]   And by the way, computers crash.
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:50.960]   My wife, I showed you the picture.
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:54.160]   My wife sent me, she says, "I'm..."
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:55.600]   She really doesn't like the Tesla.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:58.320]   She makes her nervous all the computerization.
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:01.480]   And the touchscreen crashed while she's driving.
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:04.600]   And says, "Press and hold the selection wheel until it reboots."
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.400]   She said, "I've pressed it a really long time."
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:07.480]   You don't need the touchscreen.
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:09.520]   It's not a critical system.
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:13.980]   But it doesn't inspire confidence when you're driving what is essentially a high-level
[01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:18.160]   high-powered go-card with a big computer running.
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:20.360]   And if the computer isn't reliable...
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:23.400]   There's several computers.
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:24.720]   So think about it that way.
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:26.080]   It's not just one computer.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.080]   It's a bunch of computers.
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.600]   Like it says, "Doesn't bother me.
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:30.560]   I love my Tesla.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:31.560]   I love it.
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:33.520]   Some of them are more hard than others, though, Jeff."
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.520]   Yeah.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:38.120]   And if I have to go down driving, I'd like to go down driving in my Tesla.
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:39.800]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:41.040]   I enjoy the Tesla.
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:42.520]   You know what I needed for, Leo?
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:43.520]   What?
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:45.980]   I needed to do autopilot and go in and cross the go-and-get bridge.
[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:46.980]   Yeah.
[01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:47.980]   Then you close your eyes.
[01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:48.980]   Yeah.
[01:41:48.980 --> 01:41:49.980]   It actually...
[01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:50.980]   The thought of it right now?
[01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:55.980]   The thought of that scares me, but that's not the case.
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:58.340]   Even when I use it all the time, I use it all the time.
[01:41:58.340 --> 01:41:59.340]   I love the autopilot.
[01:41:59.340 --> 01:42:00.620]   Yeah, it doesn't bother me at all.
[01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:01.620]   It's just good.
[01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:03.700]   Think of it as really good cruise control.
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:04.700]   That's all.
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:09.340]   That slows down and keeps the distance between you and the car in front of you.
[01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:10.340]   That's good.
[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:11.340]   I like that.
[01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:12.700]   And a lot of other cars offer stuff like that.
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:13.700]   My Audi did that.
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:14.700]   Yeah.
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:21.440]   Although I had a friend who was trust driving my Tesla and he started running it towards
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:24.180]   a brick wall and I was like, "What the heck are you doing?"
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:26.040]   Oh, he's testing the emergency stop.
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:29.380]   And I was like, "Oh, it doesn't stop like my Audi?"
[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:31.800]   And I was like, "No, no it doesn't."
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.300]   Don't find out the hard way.
[01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:38.100]   My Audi, it actually scares the hell out of you because it jams the brakes on.
[01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:41.800]   The Tesla does the same thing, by the way, even with autopilot not turned on.
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:44.000]   The yours doesn't, but mine does.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.320]   But it will only slow you down to 25 miles an hour.
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:48.960]   It will not stop you.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:53.340]   The idea being they don't want to come to a full stop in the highway if that's a mistake.
[01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:57.060]   So it slows down to 25 miles an hour and they presume that you notice that it jammed
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:43:00.060]   the brakes on and are now taking over.
[01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:02.260]   The rear end it, however.
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:03.260]   Right.
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:07.420]   Google Maps for Android, getting some nice new features, a Wi-Fi only mode.
[01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:14.600]   This is good if you travel and you're worried about using data and SD card download options.
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:19.320]   You can download the Maps for offline use on your SD card.
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:20.320]   That's nice.
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:23.080]   Some nice new features.
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:26.540]   I like Maps and Maps is great for travel.
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:32.200]   This is really mostly for entry level smartphones that don't have a lot of storage and for people
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:36.560]   who have to pay extra for their data.
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:40.280]   Let's see, Facebook we talked about.
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:43.420]   You can now email the White House over Facebook Messenger.
[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:51.300]   Sorry, if you're using Eve or Tesla, they now have an if this then that channel.
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:52.780]   I need to use Eve.
[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:54.060]   Everybody tells me I should use Eve.
[01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:55.460]   Do you use Eve?
[01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:56.720]   I've used it before.
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:59.540]   It was really slow, but they assure me it's gotten faster.
[01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:05.180]   It's supposed to give you like Android notifications and it connects your house to your Tesla.
[01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:08.580]   If you have a link, I don't really want to do that.
[01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:11.640]   Sorry, Facebook Messenger.
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:13.340]   You don't want to do that either.
[01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:14.740]   I think this is all risky.
[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:18.020]   They should pay attention to what you're doing on the road.
[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:20.820]   The connecting your house is things that you can automate.
[01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:25.220]   You can set up a recipe that says, "Yo, when my Tesla comes in, open the door."
[01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:26.220]   The Tesla already does that.
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:28.220]   You can say, "Unlock a door."
[01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:32.020]   I do love it that when I drive up my garage door opens and when I back out it closes behind
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:33.020]   me.
[01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:34.020]   I really like that.
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:38.420]   It drives away so it opens this much and then it's like the Wi-Fi signal or the signal is
[01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:39.420]   disrupted.
[01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:41.980]   It's like, "That's kind of annoying."
[01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:43.180]   It's super annoying.
[01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:45.780]   Yes, so you turn that off, right?
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:48.180]   Sometimes it works.
[01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:48.940]   I haven't turned it off.
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:50.940]   I just left.
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:55.140]   I think that's probably why Lisa is less enamored to the Tesla than I am.
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:45:00.380]   I'm used to technology not working very well, having issues.
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:06.260]   I don't mind because the value it adds and the coolness is worth it, right?
[01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:09.020]   Is part of this because you also have an early off the line X?
[01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:10.980]   No, it's not that early.
[01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:12.740]   That's his doors won't open.
[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:15.340]   That's that issue.
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:16.340]   That's another issue.
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:17.340]   They fixed that.
[01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:20.820]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:25.580]   Probably my husband loves the Tesla though and he hates 90% of the gadgets I have in
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:26.580]   my house.
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:28.140]   But you love the Tesla too, right?
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:29.140]   I do.
[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:30.140]   I love it.
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:31.140]   It's so nice.
[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:32.140]   Yeah.
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:33.140]   Okay.
[01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:34.140]   So I stand.
[01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:38.580]   We will use virtual poker dogs.
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:39.580]   Explain this one.
[01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:40.580]   I don't even know.
[01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:43.300]   To find a way to stop VR trolls.
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:44.300]   Okay.
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:45.900]   I didn't know there were VR trolls.
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:46.900]   I...
[01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:51.300]   Are those the people who run up to you and show you gross things that you can't see?
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:52.500]   Yeah, they're griefers.
[01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:53.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:57.300]   Online harassment is nothing new, but when it comes to VR environments, users can get
[01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:03.180]   extremely close to one another and that can lead to uncomfortable infringement of space
[01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:05.660]   and a bad experience that drives people away from VR.
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:08.980]   This is actually Carmen running in the verge.
[01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:11.820]   Google's experimenting.
[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:13.220]   So here we are in a virtual world.
[01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:16.740]   Apparently we're dogs playing poker, you and me.
[01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:21.420]   Oh, that was it.
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:25.380]   Google's Daydream Labs, that's their VR initiative is experimenting with ways to combat abuse
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:26.380]   in VR.
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:30.540]   The best one has to involve the creation of virtual poker dogs demonstrating that one
[01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:36.060]   way to deter users from harassing fellow players is by creating personal space.
[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:39.460]   When players left the poker table in Google's experiment, their screens turned to black
[01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:42.860]   and white and their avatars disappeared from their opponent's view.
[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:48.100]   A glowing personal space bubble then guided them back to their seat.
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:49.780]   This is so not my world.
[01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:50.940]   I don't even know.
[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:51.940]   You know what?
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:53.540]   I have all this stuff and I still not my world.
[01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:54.540]   Okay.
[01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:55.540]   Let's see if we can see.
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:47:00.300]   They're playing now, they're playing poker, waiting for your opponent and soon he's going
[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:03.500]   to leave the table and a glowing personal.
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:04.500]   Oh, no.
[01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:06.500]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:08.260]   I'm done here.
[01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:09.260]   I'm done.
[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:10.420]   See, I'm out of here.
[01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:14.700]   Glowing personal space bubble and he can't see me because all he sees is a glowing personal
[01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:16.700]   space bubble.
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:17.540]   Okay.
[01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:19.620]   You're right.
[01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:22.180]   Welcome to the future.
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:25.180]   Jeff, this is what's coming.
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:31.580]   And back and this this, these moments make me feel like an old fart.
[01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:33.660]   That will snapchat.
[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:34.900]   Quadruter.
[01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:36.220]   We should talk about this, I guess.
[01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:38.500]   This is a flaw that infects Android phones.
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:43.020]   You probably heard him talk about it yesterday on all about Android.
[01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:48.820]   Almost a billion Android phones are infected or I'm sorry, are affected, not infected.
[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:54.140]   There are four exploits, three out of the four have been patched.
[01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:59.540]   The fourth won't get a patch until the security fix next month.
[01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:01.420]   Quadruter is what it's called.
[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:05.500]   It was discovered by the security firm Checkpoint.
[01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:10.620]   They showed it off at Defcon on Sunday, of course, the attacker would have to talk you
[01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:13.540]   into your tricky and installing a malicious app.
[01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:17.660]   The good news and this you should really remember, you probably have it turned on, it's on by
[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:19.500]   default.
[01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:25.100]   Your Android device, and most Android devices will scan, Google will scan apps before you
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:26.860]   install them.
[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:30.100]   That scan will detect Quadruter, Google says.
[01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:34.540]   So if as long as you have that scan turned on, you're not going to have to worry.
[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:39.860]   You should probably not, at least until this is fixed next month, download apps from third
[01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:42.180]   party sites.
[01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:46.060]   The attacker would get full access to your device, including its camera, its microphone,
[01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:48.220]   and all the data.
[01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:53.340]   By the way, the new Blackberry, the DTech50, the company calls it the most secure Android
[01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:54.340]   phone.
[01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:56.260]   Yeah, it's vulnerable.
[01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:57.900]   Oh, wow.
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:49:04.180]   It's hard for Google because they would love to push this Android update.
[01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:08.740]   It's why at this point I would not recommend getting an Android phone if the company that
[01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:14.500]   the phone makes a phone doesn't commit to accepting the monthly security updates.
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:19.100]   By the way, so far, the two smartphones I really like that are $400, the OnePlus 3,
[01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:23.620]   and the ZTE, Exxon have not said that they are going to do that.
[01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:26.420]   So Samsung says they will, LG says they will.
[01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:29.980]   And of course, if you buy a Nexus phone, that's a guarantee.
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:33.860]   In fact, I'm almost starting to wonder if we shouldn't just say, if you're going to
[01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:35.020]   use Android, use Nexus.
[01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:40.820]   Well, except if you want to use, you know, the latest camera, yeah.
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:42.180]   Yeah, I love this.
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:44.220]   This operates with a Samsung phone.
[01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:48.660]   I did order the new Nexus 7, the Note.
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:49.660]   No, Nexus.
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:52.820]   I wish they would be one too.
[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:58.540]   And I wish that they would just offer as they did once the Google experience ROM for
[01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:00.220]   the Galaxy Note 7.
[01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:03.020]   And then that's what I would do because I want the hardware.
[01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:08.420]   Displaying it just today, it's the best screen ever made on a smartphone, the Note 7.
[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:14.500]   It's a super AMOLED screen, gorgeous, 518.s branch.
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:17.700]   I will get mine in about nine days.
[01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:20.820]   So I'll give you a review in two weeks.
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:24.700]   Now here's, we'll wrap up with this one because I want you to explain.
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:29.860]   Somebody will explain.
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:36.820]   Remember that the FCC has proposed that cable companies allow you to use a third party set
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:38.700]   top box.
[01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:41.460]   In fact, you don't even need a cable card.
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:46.260]   So these set top boxes that are rented to you by the cable companies, in most cases,
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:47.700]   are terrible.
[01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:50.180]   I actually bought a Tivo and put a cable card in it.
[01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:51.180]   It's my set top box.
[01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:56.940]   It's so much better than Comcast's really terrible X1 system.
[01:50:56.940 --> 01:50:58.940]   The FCC wants to make a rule change.
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:05.740]   It would require cable companies to allow that kind of thing.
[01:51:05.740 --> 01:51:12.660]   It will cost cable providers $21 billion a year in rental fees, which by the way, awe,
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:14.820]   too bad, you're gouging us.
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:23.420]   Five, exactly, exactly like Bob, you're the phone, which was a whole for years and years.
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:30.940]   And some people will still use their existing cable box because most people will use their
[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:37.220]   modems.
[01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:40.820]   So the copyright, so this is the FCC's proposed rule.
[01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:47.980]   Now the copyright office weighs in and they say, "Oh, this is an attack on copyright.
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:50.740]   We are not for this."
[01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:54.100]   This is Mike Masnick writing in a tech dirt.
[01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:56.700]   And by the way, I highly recommend you read tech dirt.
[01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:58.260]   My is super smart.
[01:51:58.260 --> 01:52:02.860]   Yeah, Andy's got Karl working for him, too, working with occasion.
[01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:09.180]   And he says the copyright office is lying.
[01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:11.540]   Lying.
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:16.980]   There's also a very good post on public knowledge's blog with a list of all the ways copyright
[01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:19.220]   office has failed us.
[01:52:19.220 --> 01:52:24.180]   Endor scene, SOPA.
[01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:29.700]   I will call the whole decarbonance, but this is just one more in that string.
[01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:33.640]   The copyright office rights, the office's principal reservation is that as currently
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:39.020]   proposed, the rule could interfere with copyright owners' rights to license their works as provided
[01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:40.020]   by copyright law.
[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:45.500]   In other words, make it easier for pirates and restrict their ability to impose reasonable
[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:48.380]   conditions on the use of these works through the private negotiations.
[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:56.100]   This is it, by the way, the private negotiations that are the hallmark of the vibrant and dynamic
[01:52:56.100 --> 01:53:01.180]   MPVD marketplace, MPVD, of course, cable operators.
[01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:04.900]   The hallmark of the vibrant and dynamic.
[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:08.980]   Do you not think that somebody from the cable industry lobby wrote this?
[01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:09.980]   I know.
[01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:12.220]   Mailed it and said, "Here's a thousand dollars.
[01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:15.500]   Would you make this your opinion?"
[01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:26.340]   I think that probably we could make it so that there are copyright protections and DRM in
[01:53:26.340 --> 01:53:27.340]   these two books.
[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:29.460]   Oh boy, they're dragging the guy.
[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:30.460]   He's in.
[01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:31.460]   Oh.
[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:32.780]   You were watching this the whole time?
[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:35.060]   Well, I have dehydrated from my palm sweating.
[01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:37.820]   Was it all on the side?
[01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:39.380]   What was he wearing?
[01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:41.500]   Suction cups or was he just free climbing?
[01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:43.580]   He was using suction cups, yeah.
[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:45.180]   That's a stupid thing to do.
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:48.340]   So they grabbed him and he tried to hold on, but they got him in.
[01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:51.340]   I don't think they can't really...
[01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:58.060]   What are they going to trespass things all they can charge him with, right?
[01:53:58.060 --> 01:54:00.660]   Public nuisance.
[01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:08.140]   If anyone does something stupid, there are some other things.
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:10.940]   General idiocy, is that something?
[01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:15.420]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:16.420]   Too bad.
[01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:21.180]   SeaWorld took down the picture of the dolphin taking the iPad out of the lady's hands.
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:22.180]   Oh.
[01:54:22.180 --> 01:54:23.980]   I didn't get to see it.
[01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:25.660]   I didn't either.
[01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:31.300]   SeaWorld Orlando, a woman tries to take a picture of a dolphin with her iPad.
[01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:39.460]   The dolphin, clearly an Android fan, jumped up, grabbed the iPad and dropped it.
[01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:43.420]   He took it away from her, unfortunately.
[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:47.980]   This video has been removed by the user.
[01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:51.940]   Okay.
[01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:56.180]   You are a violation of a copyright of taking pictures inside SeaWorld.
[01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:59.100]   Is that why it was removed?
[01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:00.100]   I betcha.
[01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:01.100]   I betcha.
[01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:03.940]   It was taken by another patron.
[01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:04.940]   But don't you...
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:07.500]   I'm pretty sure they have rules about, you know.
[01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.180]   You are on private property, right?
[01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:11.260]   You can't just take pictures.
[01:55:11.260 --> 01:55:20.100]   What would this world come to if you just take pictures willy-milly violating my copyright?
[01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:24.460]   You might as well, next to me taking pictures of the Eiffel Tower.
[01:55:24.460 --> 01:55:26.460]   How dare you?
[01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:29.180]   All right.
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:30.180]   Let's take...
[01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:31.300]   Oh, no, no, there's no break to take.
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:32.780]   Tell you what.
[01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:37.820]   Let's wrap this sucker up with the back of the book here.
[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:42.620]   Stacey, you want to start with a pick or a tip or an IOT thing or a rock band or anything?
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:44.260]   Oh, gosh.
[01:55:44.260 --> 01:55:46.060]   So I was slacking.
[01:55:46.060 --> 01:55:49.860]   I'm going to be honest, totally slacking this week.
[01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:51.620]   I could show the ring, but I haven't tried it out.
[01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:53.060]   But if you want to see what it looks like...
[01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:54.540]   Yeah, the stick-up cam.
[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:59.340]   This is the stick-up cam, which looks exactly like the ring doorbell.
[01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:04.260]   Clearly, they've basically taken just the doorbell part off.
[01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:05.900]   Yes.
[01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:06.900]   It's just as heavy.
[01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:07.900]   I'm trying to...
[01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:09.620]   It's kind of battery, but then if you use the soap...
[01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:13.380]   By the way, we should say this is a sponsor and we're not doing an ad for it right now,
[01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:16.060]   but Stacey has a review.
[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:18.260]   I have lots of these crazy...
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:19.260]   I like cameras.
[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:20.740]   I like testing about each of them.
[01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:22.140]   I think they make you paranoid, though.
[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:26.740]   I have a brother-in-law who has cameras all over.
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:28.140]   You go to dinner with him.
[01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:31.220]   He's always doing his phone and seeing if somebody's bothering his house.
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:32.220]   The whole time.
[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:33.220]   Oh, you know what?
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:34.420]   Actually, I lied.
[01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:36.540]   This one isn't my camera.
[01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:37.540]   This isn't my pick.
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:44.260]   So my pick is the NetAtmo Welcome Camera, which is 199.
[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:46.580]   I don't have it with me because...
[01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:52.140]   I can't show you my visual because there are people down there and they would be sad.
[01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:57.580]   So it's kind of lame pick, but it's awesome because it has facial recognition.
[01:56:57.580 --> 01:57:02.860]   So it disarms itself and arms itself based on the length of time it's been since it's
[01:57:02.860 --> 01:57:05.540]   seen a recognized person who lives in the house.
[01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:06.540]   Oh, wow.
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:07.540]   Yeah.
[01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:10.300]   That's kind of cool.
[01:57:10.300 --> 01:57:15.980]   The other thing that everyone would love is NetAtmo is very privacy-focused.
[01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:20.500]   So what they do is all of my data doesn't go to the cloud.
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:24.420]   I can store it on an SD card or I can run it from my own FTP server.
[01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:25.420]   Oh, me.
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:26.980]   So let me just...
[01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:28.420]   I'm checking.
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:31.420]   Back, back.
[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:33.220]   It's asking me to validate people.
[01:57:33.220 --> 01:57:34.220]   NetAtmo.
[01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:38.820]   So the idea is once it knows it's you, it says, "Okay, fine."
[01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:39.820]   Yes.
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:44.420]   That's kind of cool.
[01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:47.620]   So I'm looking to see if anyone's there.
[01:57:47.620 --> 01:57:53.420]   It works with if this and that.
[01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:54.420]   And the general...
[01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:55.420]   I hope my Gibo does this.
[01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:57.100]   It'd be nice if my Gibo does this.
[01:57:57.100 --> 01:57:58.100]   It says, "Oh, hi, Leo.
[01:57:58.100 --> 01:57:59.100]   It's okay.
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:01.060]   Then I won't bring out the guns."
[01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:04.500]   It's a nice thing about it.
[01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:05.500]   Oh, yeah, you're...
[01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:07.460]   What does it do if it doesn't recognize you?
[01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:09.380]   It vibrates to alert me.
[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:12.380]   So then then I go to...
[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:14.780]   There's somebody in the house.
[01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:16.180]   There's somebody in the house.
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:20.020]   And when your brother-in-law's gonna get this any second.
[01:58:20.020 --> 01:58:24.340]   So it basically is like someone's in the house and then you go to...
[01:58:24.340 --> 01:58:26.380]   It shows you video, which it stores.
[01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:27.620]   It takes the video.
[01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:28.620]   And then it...
[01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:30.860]   It just makes me more paranoid.
[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:31.860]   I don't want to know.
[01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:34.500]   Okay, I was gonna try to show you what it looks like.
[01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:35.500]   Let's see.
[01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:37.500]   Can't do it?
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:38.500]   Well, here.
[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:39.500]   It's hard to do.
[01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:40.500]   I know on a Skype call.
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:42.700]   Like, this is so difficult.
[01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:46.460]   Okay, so this is what it looks like.
[01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:50.020]   It's green because my blinds are down and there's kind of...
[01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:51.020]   That's not what it looks like.
[01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:53.020]   What a lovely home you have.
[01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:54.220]   It's got night vision.
[01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:55.220]   Very modern.
[01:58:55.220 --> 01:58:57.820]   It is very modern.
[01:58:57.820 --> 01:59:01.380]   And there's pictures of people.
[01:59:01.380 --> 01:59:02.380]   So yeah.
[01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:03.380]   Cool.
[01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:06.500]   Did you train it to recognize you and your daughter and your husband?
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:07.500]   I did.
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:08.500]   Oh, this was the live view.
[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:10.300]   No one's there though, so you can't see anything.
[01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:11.940]   It's not vibrating.
[01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:12.940]   See, there it is.
[01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:14.900]   There's not all the thought.
[01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:15.900]   Nice.
[01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:16.900]   Are you upstairs?
[01:59:16.900 --> 01:59:17.900]   And that's downstairs?
[01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:18.900]   That is downstairs.
[01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:19.900]   Nice.
[01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:21.780]   I found, by the way, the video, thanks to the chat room.
[01:59:21.780 --> 01:59:22.780]   Here's the dolphin.
[01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:24.340]   Just 'cause it'll make you feel good.
[01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:25.340]   Oh, good.
[01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:26.340]   Oh, good.
[01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:29.140]   I'm not about to watch closely.
[01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:31.700]   This lady's trying to take a picture with an iPad.
[01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:34.780]   And the dolphin quite rightly says, "I'm sorry, madam.
[01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:37.180]   No one should take pictures with iPads."
[01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:38.180]   Boom.
[01:59:38.180 --> 01:59:39.180]   Splice.
[01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:40.180]   Slams it in the water.
[01:59:40.180 --> 01:59:41.180]   Then goes...
[01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:44.180]   The most ladies laugh.
[01:59:44.180 --> 01:59:49.220]   Dolphins are real jerks.
[01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:50.220]   I can see that happening.
[01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:51.220]   Yeah.
[01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:52.220]   I kissed a dolphin.
[01:59:52.220 --> 01:59:53.220]   I probably shouldn't have done it.
[01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:54.060]   Now I realize it's...
[01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:56.380]   They say it's cruel and blah, blah, blah.
[01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:57.540]   But I swam with a dolphin.
[01:59:57.540 --> 01:59:58.540]   I kissed a dolphin.
[01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:01.340]   It was a very cool experience.
[02:00:01.340 --> 02:00:03.580]   This was earlier this year in January.
[02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:04.940]   It was really fun.
[02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:06.260]   Okay, there you go.
[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:08.180]   That's just a little something.
[02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:09.180]   Not my pick or anything.
[02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:11.420]   Jeff Jarvis, do you have a number?
[02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:12.420]   I think I do.
[02:00:12.420 --> 02:00:14.700]   I didn't talk about Occupy Democrats last week.
[02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:15.700]   Did I?
[02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:16.700]   No, we'll think I did.
[02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:17.700]   Okay, good.
[02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:18.700]   You did that.
[02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:21.580]   So I don't know if you see this passing by your Facebook feed, but there's a Facebook
[02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:24.340]   group called Occupy Democrats.
[02:00:24.340 --> 02:00:26.140]   And they make memes.
[02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:27.140]   That's all...
[02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:28.140]   Pretty much all they do is make memes.
[02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:31.060]   They made like 15,000 of them.
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:35.460]   And as memes go, they're very effective and very good.
[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:39.740]   And so I was curious about this because I wanted to teach a lesson to my media friends
[02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:42.540]   that we've got to stop thinking we always make destinations.
[02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:45.980]   We have to make things that people can use as part of their own conversations.
[02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:49.580]   A point I've made about YouTube videos, these are social tokens.
[02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:51.500]   So these guys do a really good job of it.
[02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:53.060]   Clearly, they're partisans.
[02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:54.060]   So I talked to...
[02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:57.820]   I'm going to forget his name suddenly.
[02:00:57.820 --> 02:00:58.820]   Oops.
[02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:04.300]   Rafael Rovaro, who is the co-founder with his twin brother Omar, they're 29-year-old
[02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:05.300]   Mexican Americans.
[02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:08.780]   So they're really enjoying going after Trump right now.
[02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:11.340]   And they make memes that pass around.
[02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:15.580]   So each meme gets about a million impressions.
[02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:17.780]   Total of 100 million memes.
[02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:20.300]   I'll explain that in a second.
[02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:23.860]   A week and much higher as well.
[02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:24.860]   Wow.
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:27.980]   What's fascinating to me is that they...
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:31.300]   My point there, Leo just showed a front page of the New York Daily News.
[02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:35.740]   What I was a journalist friend of mine argued that that's actually the original meme.
[02:01:35.740 --> 02:01:36.740]   Yeah.
[02:01:36.740 --> 02:01:37.940]   A tabloid front page is a meme.
[02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:39.380]   Yeah, and it is, isn't it?
[02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:41.580]   Top of his body in a headless bar or whatever.
[02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:44.740]   And Jim Rich, who's the current editor of the Daily News, has been doing a brilliant job,
[02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:46.980]   very anti-Trump with his page one.
[02:01:46.980 --> 02:01:47.980]   I'm with stupid.
[02:01:47.980 --> 02:01:50.140]   Yeah, rude, making huge statements.
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:52.700]   People pass in, they're not passing the story around.
[02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:54.300]   They're passing the from page.
[02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:55.500]   So I can buy double-crash shows.
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:56.900]   I think there are lessons.
[02:01:56.900 --> 02:02:00.020]   So I was fascinated that they also have a webpage.
[02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:02.700]   But to them, it's just, it's a byproduct.
[02:02:02.700 --> 02:02:05.700]   No big deal because that's where the ads are.
[02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:08.700]   And the ads are sufficient that both brothers quit their work.
[02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:13.500]   They hired another, I think, about three people, including fact-checkers now, to put
[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:15.260]   out the memes.
[02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:17.540]   And they've made a business out of it.
[02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:20.260]   And I found this utterly fascinating.
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:29.980]   So today on Dot NYC, the second half of it, we interviewed Rafael Rivera on it.
[02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:31.820]   And you can see it on my Facebook feed.
[02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:33.820]   You see what I want to see it.
[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:34.820]   Meevo!
[02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:42.980]   And also on the Dot NYC feed, Dot NYC show feed, you'll see the nice cameras feed.
[02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:46.660]   But anyway, so I found out quite Democrats really, really interesting.
[02:02:46.660 --> 02:02:48.300]   They have 3.5 million likes.
[02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:56.620]   He says that it's the most popular political page on YouTube being both Trump and Clinton.
[02:02:56.620 --> 02:03:00.900]   And only one media company has ever approached them and offered them a web TV show.
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:03.460]   But they also said, "No, we don't really care about that.
[02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:05.100]   We care about our memes."
[02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:09.420]   So all of the things that we do is make a destination with articles on it.
[02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:10.420]   Yeah, okay, we do that.
[02:03:10.420 --> 02:03:11.420]   But no big deal.
[02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:12.420]   I want a TV show.
[02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:14.340]   Not too busy.
[02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:16.300]   They make memes.
[02:03:16.300 --> 02:03:19.820]   And so I was at this aspen thing this weekend.
[02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:24.260]   And it's chat about its rule, but I can say, except I can say who was there.
[02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:30.140]   And so I'll quote myself, not him, but I saw Nick Christoff in the New York Times, who's
[02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:32.500]   incredibly advanced with social.
[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:34.780]   And he asked me, "What's next for me?
[02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:35.780]   What should I do?"
[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:38.740]   Because Nick's been great on Twitter and great on Facebook.
[02:03:38.740 --> 02:03:43.420]   And I said, "I think that the Washington Post and the New York Times need meme desks.
[02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:47.020]   I think they need to be able to take some of the ideas out of columns and stories and
[02:03:47.020 --> 02:03:51.220]   put them out there in a mechanism by which people can share them on their own."
[02:03:51.220 --> 02:03:52.860]   So I just found that interesting.
[02:03:52.860 --> 02:03:57.660]   And if you're interested too, I wrote something on Medium and there's the interview on .NYC
[02:03:57.660 --> 02:03:58.660]   today.
[02:03:58.660 --> 02:04:02.140]   What was the first internet meme?
[02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:03.140]   Good question.
[02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:06.500]   Was it the little dude with the Star Wars thing?
[02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:08.180]   Star Wars guy, no.
[02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:09.180]   How about this?
[02:04:09.180 --> 02:04:10.180]   This is the hamster dance.
[02:04:10.180 --> 02:04:11.180]   Hamster dance?
[02:04:11.180 --> 02:04:12.180]   Wait, no.
[02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:14.180]   Remember on the GeoCities?
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:15.940]   What's her name?
[02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:16.940]   Ally McPeal.
[02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:17.940]   Ally McPeal.
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:18.940]   I was like, "What's up, rocker?"
[02:04:18.940 --> 02:04:19.940]   Do you have my audio?
[02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:20.940]   Because we got to hear the...
[02:04:20.940 --> 02:04:29.380]   I think this was the first internet meme.
[02:04:29.380 --> 02:04:32.820]   It's predates YouTube.
[02:04:32.820 --> 02:04:34.340]   It predates.
[02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:36.740]   It almost is like the earliest days.
[02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:38.980]   When was Ally McPeal, right?
[02:04:38.980 --> 02:04:39.980]   I mean...
[02:04:39.980 --> 02:04:43.300]   Shruggen, don't know.
[02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:50.300]   Oh, good check.
[02:04:50.300 --> 02:05:00.580]   The original hamster dance site, which is gone.
[02:05:00.580 --> 02:05:02.580]   It was also incredibly stupid.
[02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:05.140]   Oh, my daughter loves this one.
[02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:07.140]   It's called Korgi Orgy.
[02:05:07.140 --> 02:05:08.860]   Korgi Orgy.
[02:05:08.860 --> 02:05:15.260]   Korgi, except she pronounces it Korgi Orgy, and we don't actually want to change that.
[02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:18.780]   It's incredibly stupid, and you can make your own ones, but that's the big thing.
[02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:19.780]   Her kids, her friends.
[02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:23.380]   That's what all the nine-year-olds are doing is Korgi Orgy.
[02:05:23.380 --> 02:05:25.020]   That's a great one this week.
[02:05:25.020 --> 02:05:28.540]   Somebody's going to type home.
[02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:30.540]   Ooh.
[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:31.540]   This is it.
[02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:32.700]   This is Korgi Orgy.
[02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:33.700]   You can make your own.
[02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:35.660]   So you put your own animation in there.
[02:05:35.660 --> 02:05:36.660]   That's okay.
[02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:37.660]   I'll go with the spot.
[02:05:37.660 --> 02:05:38.660]   I'll go with the spot.
[02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:44.980]   Well, if you're going to make your own, you have to go to my.korg.com.
[02:05:44.980 --> 02:05:49.820]   So our journalist on speaking of our earlier cargo shorts typed in cargo shots, but accidentally
[02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:51.940]   typed in Korgi shorts.
[02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:53.940]   Go ahead.
[02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:55.940]   Do it.
[02:05:55.940 --> 02:05:56.940]   CORGY.
[02:05:56.940 --> 02:05:57.940]   CORGI.
[02:05:57.940 --> 02:05:58.940]   Hi.
[02:05:58.940 --> 02:05:59.940]   My sister has Korgis.
[02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:00.940]   As does the Queen of England.
[02:06:00.940 --> 02:06:01.940]   Look on the images.
[02:06:01.940 --> 02:06:02.940]   There's Korgi shorts.
[02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:09.380]   Apparently they make them.
[02:06:09.380 --> 02:06:10.860]   Oh my God.
[02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:13.300]   And for your daughter.
[02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:14.300]   Yeah.
[02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:17.260]   Korgi, but is a lot like human butt.
[02:06:17.260 --> 02:06:19.460]   And so I could see why the Korgi.
[02:06:19.460 --> 02:06:24.820]   Leo, how the hell did you cope that observation?
[02:06:24.820 --> 02:06:28.420]   I just, I think you need to be reported to somebody.
[02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:30.260]   I'm not sure who.
[02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:33.860]   I'm looking at Korgi asses and coming up with that conclusion.
[02:06:33.860 --> 02:06:34.860]   Frightens, Leo.
[02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:35.860]   Oh dear.
[02:06:35.860 --> 02:06:39.060]   Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
[02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:42.180]   Well I was going to do a quick unboxing of this.
[02:06:42.180 --> 02:06:43.180]   You already have it.
[02:06:43.180 --> 02:06:46.980]   If you had it for several weeks, this is the Samsung 360 cam.
[02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:52.220]   And you know, the downside to this is you have to have a Samsung phone, a Galaxy S7
[02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:56.660]   or you can record the video to the card and then use software on APC.
[02:06:56.660 --> 02:06:58.940]   But you don't get all the benefit.
[02:06:58.940 --> 02:07:05.260]   Now the one thing I was interested in is it is better than the Ricoh Theta S, which I've
[02:07:05.260 --> 02:07:06.260]   really loved.
[02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:08.020]   I also have right here.
[02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:09.020]   Yeah.
[02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:11.980]   And it's a little bit cheaper.
[02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:14.540]   I think it's 300, not 350, something like that.
[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:15.860]   No, I think this was 350.
[02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:16.860]   Is it the same?
[02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:18.780]   Maybe that's the official price now.
[02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:21.100]   I bought, I bought at VidCon.
[02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:22.860]   They brought 500 of these Samsungs.
[02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:25.060]   You couldn't get them in the States till about now.
[02:07:25.060 --> 02:07:26.060]   Right.
[02:07:26.060 --> 02:07:27.060]   So that's why I would.
[02:07:27.060 --> 02:07:28.540]   Yeah, I think I got mine from Korea or somewhere.
[02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:29.540]   Yeah.
[02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:30.540]   They're coming soon.
[02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:32.140]   But the quality seems pretty good.
[02:07:32.140 --> 02:07:33.140]   Very good.
[02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:34.140]   Very good.
[02:07:34.140 --> 02:07:35.140]   Which is kind of nice.
[02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:40.580]   And you can record to the phone when Samsung showed this with the release of the S7, they
[02:07:40.580 --> 02:07:47.140]   demonstrated live streaming from the phone to the S7 and the way they did it was a kind
[02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:52.100]   of a couple of guys walking around Paris and their friend couldn't come.
[02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:56.060]   And so their friend was wearing his VR helmet.
[02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:59.940]   And they was as if he was with the guys in Paris because they're walking around and
[02:07:59.940 --> 02:08:02.940]   they're taking him with them.
[02:08:02.940 --> 02:08:05.060]   But you said it doesn't do live streaming.
[02:08:05.060 --> 02:08:06.060]   I don't think so yet.
[02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:07.060]   It's coming.
[02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:08.060]   Okay.
[02:08:08.060 --> 02:08:09.060]   I don't think so.
[02:08:09.060 --> 02:08:10.060]   It's a very nice device.
[02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:11.060]   It's well done.
[02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:12.060]   Quality looks pretty good.
[02:08:12.060 --> 02:08:16.420]   And I saw a friend Dana Brunetti's stream of his office.
[02:08:16.420 --> 02:08:17.420]   And I was so impressed.
[02:08:17.420 --> 02:08:19.340]   I thought, well, that's pretty good.
[02:08:19.340 --> 02:08:21.180]   I love these ideas.
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:33.340]   I think this is where in our school at CUNY, you know, our Dean Sarah Barnlett and I were
[02:08:33.340 --> 02:08:36.220]   talking a few weeks ago, where do we start with all this?
[02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:38.940]   Because we got to worry about this.
[02:08:38.940 --> 02:08:44.540]   My view is that we start with 360 photography students and just get them to think in a
[02:08:44.540 --> 02:08:45.540]   different place.
[02:08:45.540 --> 02:08:46.540]   I still photography.
[02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:47.540]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:48.540]   Yeah, still.
[02:08:48.540 --> 02:08:51.380]   I've been doing a lot of advanced video and then AR/VR will mention the come, but you don't
[02:08:51.380 --> 02:08:52.380]   need all those tools.
[02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:53.380]   Uh oh, what's Stacey?
[02:08:53.380 --> 02:08:55.340]   You're laughing at the real I hope.
[02:08:55.340 --> 02:08:56.820]   Yes, yes.
[02:08:56.820 --> 02:08:59.940]   I was looking at something else and then boom.
[02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:00.940]   What?
[02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:01.940]   Myder Leo came up.
[02:09:01.940 --> 02:09:05.660]   Oh, but you know what you should do?
[02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:10.820]   Every VR camera or the back of all phones now with VR, they should have little googly
[02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:11.820]   eyes to be pasted.
[02:09:11.820 --> 02:09:12.820]   Oh, yes.
[02:09:12.820 --> 02:09:13.820]   Googly eyes.
[02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:14.820]   A must.
[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:17.500]   So speaking of what you're...
[02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:21.660]   Do you think the next generation of phones will have 360 on them?
[02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:22.940]   Two equal cameras on either side?
[02:09:22.940 --> 02:09:23.940]   No, because you have to...
[02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:25.500]   Look how big the...
[02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:28.500]   It has to be for the fish eye, you know, I mean, that's two...
[02:09:28.500 --> 02:09:31.420]   Well, and that's double the data and that's...
[02:09:31.420 --> 02:09:32.420]   Yeah.
[02:09:32.420 --> 02:09:33.420]   We still haven't made the...
[02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:34.420]   It's fine to have a...
[02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:37.580]   This is the perfect compromise, where if you want it, you can buy it and it ties to
[02:09:37.580 --> 02:09:39.140]   your phone and...
[02:09:39.140 --> 02:09:41.780]   It has a weird built-in tripod, although you can remove it.
[02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:43.260]   You can take it off as a standard mount.
[02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:45.820]   Yeah, so you could put it on a regular tripod.
[02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:50.980]   In fact, I bought the MIVO tripods, so it'll go right on there as well.
[02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:54.820]   You know, I'll do some more images with this in recording.
[02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:57.980]   It's not as compact as the Theta, you know, but...
[02:09:57.980 --> 02:09:58.980]   Right.
[02:09:58.980 --> 02:10:03.540]   The Theta, it's as tall as a Theta.
[02:10:03.540 --> 02:10:04.540]   Yeah.
[02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:05.540]   Almost.
[02:10:05.540 --> 02:10:07.140]   You see the bulge and the Theta lens?
[02:10:07.140 --> 02:10:08.700]   That's the problem with putting that on the phone.
[02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:10.460]   Okay, all right, but imagine it's a little smaller.
[02:10:10.460 --> 02:10:12.460]   That's not that bad.
[02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:15.620]   And I bet you that'll be a specialized phone.
[02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:16.620]   Maybe.
[02:10:16.620 --> 02:10:17.620]   I'll just before you name it.
[02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:20.020]   And Google would probably do it because Daydream is, you know, a big initiative.
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:21.020]   Exactly.
[02:10:21.020 --> 02:10:22.020]   Yeah.
[02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:23.820]   Maybe the new Nexus will be a 360 in Nexus, huh?
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:24.820]   Nexus 360.
[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:25.820]   I'm hoping that...
[02:10:25.820 --> 02:10:26.820]   30-year first.
[02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:27.820]   I want to bring...
[02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:30.900]   You had good experiences traveling in Europe with a Google Fi stuff, right?
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:31.900]   Yes.
[02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:32.900]   And so did Mike Elgin.
[02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:33.900]   He's had...
[02:10:33.900 --> 02:10:34.900]   Not perfect.
[02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:36.740]   Some places faster than others.
[02:10:36.740 --> 02:10:39.740]   But this was before they moved up to the 4G.
[02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:43.620]   And now you pay the same price in most of those countries that you would pay if you
[02:10:43.620 --> 02:10:45.300]   were at home, which I really like.
[02:10:45.300 --> 02:10:47.420]   You don't have international data expense.
[02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:51.140]   So I'm hoping that a new Nexus phone comes out before we go to Europe on September 22nd.
[02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:53.060]   I might make that.
[02:10:53.060 --> 02:10:55.260]   We might be able to do that.
[02:10:55.260 --> 02:11:00.140]   My friends, we have come to the end of this fabulous episode.
[02:11:00.140 --> 02:11:01.580]   Thank you so much, Stacey Higginbotham.
[02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:05.420]   You'll find her online is Stacey on IOT.com.
[02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:09.020]   And Stacey's spelled with an E-S-T-A-C-E-Y.
[02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:14.620]   She's also the host of a fabulous podcast about the Internet of Things with Kevin Tofel.
[02:11:14.620 --> 02:11:15.860]   It's great to have you, Stacey.
[02:11:15.860 --> 02:11:17.220]   Thank you so much.
[02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:18.860]   There's the IOT podcast episode.
[02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:20.220]   So that's the one with the...
[02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:23.940]   That's the light thing that comes with a voltage meter and has Erlang.
[02:11:23.940 --> 02:11:25.540]   Buh-bye!
[02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:28.000]   Can you write in code to the Erlang?
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:33.380]   Can you get a shell on the light bulb and code in it?
[02:11:33.380 --> 02:11:35.180]   That's what I want.
[02:11:35.180 --> 02:11:37.260]   You can right now know.
[02:11:37.260 --> 02:11:39.660]   They are going to open it up.
[02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:40.660]   That would be kind of cool.
[02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:41.660]   See?
[02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:42.660]   Wouldn't it be cool?
[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:43.660]   Yeah.
[02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:44.660]   Okay.
[02:11:44.660 --> 02:11:45.660]   Yeah, that'd be really cool.
[02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:46.660]   Anything else you want to plug, Stacey?
[02:11:46.660 --> 02:11:48.620]   I feel like I've plugged a lot of things.
[02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:52.980]   I will say this next week's podcast, I've got a guy from Defcon.
[02:11:52.980 --> 02:11:57.820]   So if you're really concerned about hacking and IOT, the Thursday show is the one to listen
[02:11:57.820 --> 02:11:58.820]   to.
[02:11:58.820 --> 02:11:59.820]   So tomorrow morning.
[02:11:59.820 --> 02:12:02.780]   I'm looking forward to your interview with Dr. Venkata, Renducintala.
[02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:04.780]   That is Wednesday.
[02:12:04.780 --> 02:12:08.980]   So make sure you treat it with respect and do not call him by his first name.
[02:12:08.980 --> 02:12:09.980]   Call him Mr. Renducintala.
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:12.420]   I'm very best up there.
[02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:13.420]   Every time, Stacey.
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:14.660]   I know him.
[02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:17.340]   So it's doubly bad.
[02:12:17.340 --> 02:12:18.900]   It's really shameful.
[02:12:18.900 --> 02:12:20.420]   There's just words I can't say on air.
[02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:23.420]   I just might like, like, epidemiology.
[02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:25.220]   There you go.
[02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:26.220]   There you go.
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:28.300]   So it's just self-contimitation.
[02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:31.660]   Unfortunately, whenever I look at epitome, my brain says epitome.
[02:12:31.660 --> 02:12:32.660]   Oh yeah, epitome.
[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:33.660]   Because it looks like epitome.
[02:12:33.660 --> 02:12:35.660]   It looks like epitome.
[02:12:35.660 --> 02:12:36.660]   Yeah.
[02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:37.660]   I say episiotomy.
[02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:40.580]   So there's a problem right there.
[02:12:40.580 --> 02:12:44.860]   Thank you so much, Jeff Jones.
[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:46.340]   We're going to get you that buzzer.
[02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:47.780]   We're going to get you that buzzer.
[02:12:47.780 --> 02:12:49.780]   It's going to go right to my chair.
[02:12:49.780 --> 02:12:52.540]   We're going to adapt one of those sex toys.
[02:12:52.540 --> 02:12:53.540]   Yeah.
[02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:54.540]   Non-lethal does.
[02:12:54.540 --> 02:13:03.260]   I don't actually want to be in that position anymore.
[02:13:03.260 --> 02:13:04.260]   I know.
[02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:05.260]   My sensor.
[02:13:05.260 --> 02:13:06.260]   That's all right.
[02:13:06.260 --> 02:13:07.260]   I'll give it to Carsten.
[02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:08.260]   He can do it.
[02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:09.260]   There you go.
[02:13:09.260 --> 02:13:10.500]   He'll be zapping me all the time, though.
[02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:12.940]   I know Carsten.
[02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:15.860]   You pronounce it epitome.
[02:13:15.860 --> 02:13:16.860]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:18.860]   We do the show every Wednesday, 3 p.m.
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:22.660]   I'm sorry, 1.30 p.m. Pacific, 4.30, 18.30.
[02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:23.660]   And what is it?
[02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:25.220]   20.30 UTC.
[02:13:25.220 --> 02:13:27.060]   I just probably confused the heck of it all year.
[02:13:27.060 --> 02:13:28.260]   Let me do that again.
[02:13:28.260 --> 02:13:33.180]   We do this show every Wednesday at 1.30 p.m. Pacific, 4.30 p.m. Eastern.
[02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:34.180]   Time.
[02:13:34.180 --> 02:13:36.900]   20.30 UTC.
[02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:37.900]   You can watch live.
[02:13:37.900 --> 02:13:40.780]   Join us in the chatroom at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:43.700]   If you can't be here live, though, don't worry.
[02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:49.660]   We have on-demand audio and video of every show on our website, Twit.tv/Twig, and wherever
[02:13:49.660 --> 02:13:53.940]   you find finer podcasts.
[02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:58.620]   Next week, Stacey is going to be at the Intel Developers Forum, and she'll, I'm sure, have
[02:13:58.620 --> 02:14:00.140]   some fun things to say from there.
[02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:02.260]   I hope that'll be fun.
[02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:06.300]   If you can make it back to the hotel or find a place to light.
[02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:09.780]   We've had Jeff do shows on his bottom and the middle of the-
[02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:11.780]   I've done them with smoke signals.
[02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:17.860]   Yeah, at a pool while there's a model shoot going on, Jeff will work anywhere anytime.
[02:14:17.860 --> 02:14:19.340]   Mine might not be that exciting.
[02:14:19.340 --> 02:14:20.340]   It is IDF.
[02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:23.860]   Not a lot of models there, it's to my knowledge.
[02:14:23.860 --> 02:14:26.100]   Well, it's IDF, you don't know.
[02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:27.900]   You don't know.
