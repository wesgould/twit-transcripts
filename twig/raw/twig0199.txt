[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Matt cuts fills in for Gina Trapani.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.600]   We'll talk about the aftermath of Google I/O, the new voice search that's in the new Chrome,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.300]   and a whole lot more. This week in Google is next.

[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.100]   It's time for this week in Google.
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.100]   The whole of the show that talks about, not just Google, but everything in the cloud, Facebook, Twitter, and more.
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.100]   And Jeff Jarvis is here, professor of journalism from the City University of New York, the author of "What Would Google Do" and his latest public parts.
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.100]   Hey, Lou, Mr. Jervy.
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.100]   Hello. It was so nice being with you.
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.100]   Oh, I just...
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.100]   So wonderful. I feel so far away now.
[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.100]   I loved hanging in meat space, man.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.100]   It was great.
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.100]   Fun.
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.100]   Now, unfortunately, both you and Gina caught some sort of bug on the plane ride.
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.100]   No flu.
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.100]   That's what she called it.
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100]   And Gina's really a little under the weather, plus her babysitter's sick.
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.100]   So that's really more to the point.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.100]   So she's with Ed at lying in bed moaning, but she'll be back next week, I'm sure.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.100]   But we've got a good replacement.
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.100]   You bet.
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.100]   Almost as lovely, but certainly as talented, Mr. Matt Cuts of Google, one of the earliest employees.
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.100]   Hey, everybody. Good to see you.
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.100]   Good to see you, Matt.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.100]   And let us note that you are a Pixel Sand, which as Matt put it earlier.
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.100]   Oh, God, I hate you guys.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.100]   So both of them are using Chromebook pixels.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.100]   Both of them are using Google Hangouts.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.100]   Oh, no, Google Talk for the video.
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.100]   Is that going to be deprecated, Matt, with the new Hangouts?
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.100]   Or are we going to have to move to something else?
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.100]   I think that the trend that we heard at I/O is that it will definitely be moving toward
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.100]   Hangouts being the unified solution.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.100]   So, you know, it starts out with Messenger and Hangouts itself.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.100]   And then there were indications this past week that things like SMS and Google Voice will
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.600]   eventually be folded in, which makes it a lot more useful if it truly unifies all the different
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.100]   ways of talking.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.100]   I can't wait.
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.540]   I mean, SMS is huge, and they do verify your phone number when you sign up for Hangouts.
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.900]   So I'm presuming that will be the case.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.900]   And then I have not yet switched to Hangouts from GTalk on my Gmail because I, you know,
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.900]   it's funny.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.060]   I heard all these, does anybody really make calls from Gmail?
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.420]   I do it all the time.
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.140]   It's my home phone.
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.620]   So I don't want to mess with that.
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.900]   And I even use something called the O-Hi.
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.100]   Do you know about the O-H-A-I?
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.100]   It's a little device.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.300]   It's so cool that lets me use Google Voice to make...
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.300]   What is it?
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.300]   The O-B...
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.300]   What does it call?
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.300]   Oh, no.
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.300]   I can't remember the name.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.300]   The O-B-1 Kenobi.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.300]   The O-B-I.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.300]   That's it.
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.300]   O-B-Hi.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.300]   Now I remember.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.260]   O-B-I-H-A-I. And so what I do is that uses Google Chat.
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.260]   It's kind of weird.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260]   It's using a weird kind of variation on Google Chat.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.460]   In fact, it has to patch itself into GTalk to work.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:05.780]   But then phone calls coming into my Google Voice automatically ring a phone.
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.020]   It looks like a landline phone in my house.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.020]   There it is.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.020]   It connects the internet.
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.700]   So it's a VoIP solution that's free because I'm using Google Talk and Google Voice.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.700]   It's really cool.
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.900]   But that would break as well as the ability to just make phone calls from within Gmail.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.780]   So the solution is not to upgrade on Gmail and everybody agrees that that's coming, right?
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.940]   I think it's safe to assume we're working to unify things and make them very seamless
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.140]   and work together well.
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.140]   It's always...
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.140]   I think that...
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.940]   And you guys know this, but I think really because of the death of Google Reader, everybody
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.700]   gets a little nervous.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.700]   We all dealt with...
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.940]   Google Voice, I'm dependent on it because I have many phones.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.980]   I'm always changing cell phones.
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.380]   Google Voice is a unified number that rings all my phones.
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.380]   I need it.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.180]   And if were you guys ever to kill it, I would just fall over and dead fade.
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:02.740]   Well, I've noticed ever since Reader, the web has been a little bit angry, cranky, irritated.
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.180]   And it's become this meme about, well, is Google going to shut down this product or
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.860]   that product almost like back in nearly days, it was like, oh, Gmail's beta.
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.860]   Don't use it because it's beta.
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.860]   Right.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.860]   It was clearly really good software.
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.860]   I hear they're going to get rid of search.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.540]   I don't go over it.
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.900]   I think search is pretty safe.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.540]   The end of searches we know it was what Amit was saying.
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.260]   That was his tagline, right?
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.260]   That's true.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.940]   Amit Singhah was saying it's the end of the searches we know it.
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.820]   By the way, I don't think I'm stealing anybody's thunder, but the current versions of Chrome
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.820]   have voice search.
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.020]   They don't have the hot words yet, right?
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.980]   No, you can't say, okay, Google.
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.860]   But I can't wait for it.
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.860]   I know.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.820]   It's going to be fun.
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.820]   It's there.
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.820]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.620]   And if the only real difference is, right, she answers back to you.
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:55.540]   Well, you and I are probably part of the, what was it called, the Gmail lab test or whatever.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.260]   No, because I use apps.
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.220]   Oh.
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.860]   So I was in the field trial.
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.100]   We beat up the Google plus guys about this problem.
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.740]   So I had this voice for a while.
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.740]   Yes, it is.
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.940]   But let me show you check.
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.780]   Can you see my computer now?
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.780]   Yeah.
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.860]   So I have a little microphone here, right?
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.860]   No, we can't.
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.860]   Oh, crud.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.340]   I just, as soon as I moved it, it went out.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.340]   So I have a little microphone and said, and if I highlight it.
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.780]   Yeah, the pixel, man.
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.660]   No, that was why we stopped using the pixel because it wouldn't work.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:30.220]   Women, now it's doing the search.
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.220]   That's a weird search.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.420]   I am not your wife's sister or daughter came up the result.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.220]   Let's go back.
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.260]   So when I, and I have not done any switches.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.100]   This is the first time I've used it, it just worked.
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.860]   So I highlighted it says, "Search by voice."
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.340]   What's going on in Santa Cruz today?
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.340]   And what's going on?
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.340]   They go.
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.260]   Unfortunately, it doesn't have the contextual stuff.
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.380]   So I can't say, how do I get there?
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.020]   I think it actually has some contextual stuff there.
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.020]   Not all of it.
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.180]   So this, she, Joanna was able to say, how do I get there?
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.100]   And I would then say, know that it was Santa Cruz from the previous search.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.100]   Right.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.100]   What's in there now?
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.980]   I think you can do something like, how old is Barack Obama?
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.900]   And then maybe you can say, how tall is he?
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.380]   How old is Barack Obama?
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.380]   Barack Obama.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.340]   Oh, she was talking to me because it was a knowledge graph, right?
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.780]   She's talking back, right.
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.620]   How tall is he?
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.380]   Barack Obama is six feet, one inch tall.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.380]   He's one inch tall.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.580]   No, I'm six feet, one inch.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.580]   That is so cool.
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.780]   So I guess if it's a knowledge graph.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.780]   Right.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.740]   It has to be one of the Google Now card.
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.980]   Well I think what's live now is conversational search.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.340]   And conversational search is this idea that instead of typing in one search and then the
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.580]   next time you type in a search, Google has forgotten everything about what you just said.
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.580]   Right.
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.220]   If you start to refer back to a previous search like, who is he married to or who are their
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.060]   daughters, then we start to disambiguate what the pronouns are and what you're talking
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.060]   about.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.660]   Or grammatically, I would call it antecedent search.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.660]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.660]   That's true.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:05.660]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.660]   He's a professor.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.980]   You'll just have to forgive him.
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.940]   Sometimes it slips out.
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.260]   So I have Matt Cuts.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:19.820]   I mean, Danny Sullivan just said, Matt Cuts, tell Leo about in Twitter and then I have
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.980]   to click the link to see.
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.820]   So let's see what Danny Sullivan said we should be checking out here.
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:26.820]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.780]   In fact, I cribbed some of the examples.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.340]   Danny Sullivan, he wrote a great article about the conversational search and he was sort
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.340]   of saying.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.100]   He went through three or four steps.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.100]   Great example.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.380]   And it was kind of funny because when he did the demo, it worked sometimes but not all
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.380]   the time.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.780]   And we were like, oh no, we want to work all the time.
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.220]   And I think Danny's attitude was, hey, it worked a lot more than I expected.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.220]   And I know what it was.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.220]   It's pretty cool.
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.220]   Yeah.
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.340]   In fact, that's what he's pointing to.
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.500]   He's pointing to the conversation.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.940]   He says you can go on with a Barack Obama thing.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:56.940]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.940]   Wow.
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.660]   You can do three or four levels deep if you want.
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.620]   His wife, I think, is one of them.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.620]   He did.
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.620]   Well, you can do it with anything.
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.940]   So you can say, how old is Barack Obama and then who is he married to?
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.700]   And then you can say how tall is she?
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.540]   You know, and so you can chain it along conversations.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.660]   Yeah, so Danny did this.
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:14.660]   So he said, who is his wife?
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.100]   And he got Michelle.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.100]   How old is she?
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.780]   Then they got her age.
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.020]   Wow, that is really cool.
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.460]   And I love that it talks to you.
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.940]   And so is it your understanding, Matt, that they're going to, by the way, we should mention
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.140]   Matt Cutz is here.
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.140]   You did.
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.140]   Did I say he's here?
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.140]   You did.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.700]   Matt works for Google.
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.100]   And he works to stop web spam.
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.700]   And he does these great webmaster videos that everybody should see.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.660]   In fact, we're going to play with the philosophy one a little bit.
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.020]   But so Matt knows a little bit of where he speaks, but we should always, as I always
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.180]   point out when he's on, he's not speaking for Google.
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.660]   He's just speaking as a friend.
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.900]   He has a cattle prod under his chair.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.140]   And if he does anything wrong, you're going to see him start buzzing.
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.460]   Please don't fire me.
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.340]   Please don't fire me.
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.260]   Now I got to do this.
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.660]   I'm sorry.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.860]   Who is Matt Cutz?
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.780]   Oh, I doubt that'll work.
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.700]   According to Wikipedia, Matthew Cutz works for the search quality team in Google, working
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.500]   on search engine optimization.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.700]   Whoa, my mind.
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.700]   Who's the old?
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.020]   How old is he?
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.780]   I don't think that's in Wikipedia.
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.220]   No, it doesn't.
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.980]   So that was from your Wikipedia.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:35.100]   Yeah, basically a lot of the knowledge graph comes from Freebase and a lot of that in turn
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.100]   comes from Wikipedia.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:40.500]   So if you have a Wikipedia entry, we're more likely to be able to answer questions.
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.500]   And it's neat.
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.900]   We'll highlight in the knowledge graph the attributes that we think are important.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.660]   So you'll see different stuff for Justin Bieber than for Barack Obama, for example.
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.660]   I got to do it.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.660]   I'm sorry.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.340]   Who is Leo Laport?
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:58.620]   According to Wikipedia, Leo Gordon Laport is an Emmy award-winning American technology
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.860]   broadcaster, author, and entrepreneur.
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.100]   I'm the Emmy award-in-the-air.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.740]   Yeah, thank you, Google.
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.660]   Of course, who is Jeff Jarvis?
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.660]   Uh-oh.
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.660]   Who?
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.500]   According to Wikipedia, Jeff Jarvis is an American journalist, professor, public speaker
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.900]   and former television critic.
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.540]   Right?
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.540]   That's pretty good.
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.460]   I should, from now on, this is how we're going to introduce all you guys.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.860]   I'm just going to play that.
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.580]   I'm going to pass Google.
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.580]   Who are you?
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.580]   That's so cool.
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.340]   I love this.
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.460]   And you know, of all the demos, we saw so many cool demos, and it's hard to pick just
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.460]   one.
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.260]   But of all the demos at the keynote we saw last week, I felt like this one was the one
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:43.740]   that was, to me, the most astounding, the one Joanna did, and the one that was perhaps
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.500]   less covered than it ought to have been, because that's the talk about the Star Trek
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.500]   world.
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.500]   That's it.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.500]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.500]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.940]   And you know, it's funny because a lot of these examples are sort of toy examples like
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.900]   Barack Obama, but you can try, you know, who is the prime minister of Turkey?
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.780]   And you'll still get really good info, you know.
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.660]   Who is the prime minister of Turkey?
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.140]   You made me do that.
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.900]   The prime minister of Turkey is Receptiar, Dilgan.
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.460]   So he recently met with Barack Obama about Syria or something like that.
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.740]   So it's getting to a point, and then we'll have hot word detection soon.
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.980]   And a hot word is basically when you say, okay, Google, and that wakes Google up, you
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.500]   know, Chrome so that it's listening for a question.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.140]   So you know, you're in the car or whatever, and you can just say, okay, Google, I heard
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.140]   about this.
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.060]   You can think about this question and the barrier for doing a search is much lower and the
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.300]   results you don't even have to hit your chest.
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.300]   Yeah.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.460]   When does, you have a communicator.
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.900]   When does this, when does the, the always on voice go come up?
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.780]   Do you know, I mean, you probably have it already at Google, but normally Chrome puts
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.660]   out updates every six weeks or so.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.300]   So, you know, I think you're honest.
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.020]   It's a new one just later this summer.
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.020]   Okay.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.020]   So it's going to be six weeks or so.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.020]   Yeah.
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.020]   Twenty seven just came about yesterday.
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.020]   Okay.
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.060]   So it needs a Google update, a Chrome update for this to work.
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.060]   Usually.
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.540]   Yeah, that's not a word, but I'd assume that.
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.540]   And this is only in Chrome.
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.140]   I noticed it's not an Internet Explorer.
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.340]   I tried to try to get it to work.
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.340]   Well, no.
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.340]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:13.980]   That Internet Explorer is normally like hot words.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.980]   Would it come out in the beta before it comes out in the stable release?
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:18.980]   Yep.
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:19.980]   Or they just pull off.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.620]   Normally you'd see it show up in what they call Canary and then Dev and then beta and
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.620]   then stable.
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.820]   So if you really want to live in the future, you can sign up for the Canary build and you
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.020]   can see everything just as it's being checked in.
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.820]   Is Canary pretty stable?
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.780]   Whenever I've done it, I've usually done developer.
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.460]   Canary is basically like a nightly build.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:45.500]   And so you can't have occasional trouble, but it's, you know, if I found a little bit.
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.660]   Dev was pretty dicey for me.
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.580]   So I've been beta and happy, but that was.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.020]   You cannot downgrade.
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.020]   You can downgrade.
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.980]   But I've been using developer for a long time and I've had to downgrade the beta maybe
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.220]   twice because of various like a bug in Google Docs or something.
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.140]   Actually, if you go to Canary, which is really is the daily, right, is the daily.
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.660]   It says at least here it will run in parallel to any other channel you've installed.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.500]   So you'll get two browsers.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.980]   So you don't even have to worry about it downgrade if Canary's wonky that day.
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.540]   So I'm going to install Canary right now.
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.980]   That'll give you the best shot at having always a.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:26.260]   My fellow pixel mate, well, we can't do that on pixel though, right?
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.220]   Because it's yeah, it's a little trickier.
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.580]   Yeah, because they want, I mean, the last thing you ever want to do is brick your computer,
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.860]   which if you if you upgraded to a Chrome that wasn't stable, that could have consequences.
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.100]   I think that's a good point.
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.580]   If Chrome is your only interface, you really don't want to break it.
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.220]   You like, but that's not why people get Chromebooks in the first place.
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:50.300]   Anyway, they get a Chromebook because they want reliability security.
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.660]   So beta, I mean, there is a developer.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.500]   In fact, that's how Jeff had been running his developer month.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.500]   So he could use Skype.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:01.660]   Well, I've still got it in development case is a backup to this, but I'd like to get normal
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:02.660]   reading.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.460]   Matt, you want to mention your 30 day challenge you're on right now?
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:10.420]   Yeah, so I'm actually my every month I do a different 30 day challenge to try something
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.460]   new and my 30 day challenge this month is actually to use a Chromebook pixel for 30
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.420]   days as my primary computer.
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.980]   And it's been really easy.
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.340]   There's only been a couple times when I wanted like a Linux laptop.
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.700]   That was a loaded that was a loaded question.
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:31.980]   Actually, having having received it, I should say this is was my free pixel from going to
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.540]   Google I owe.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.540]   It's really great.
[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.740]   I'm not I'm not dissing it.
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.740]   I like it a lot.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.780]   I just it's merely my only, you know, thing is you probably don't want to get it.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.660]   If that's going to be your only computer, it's hard to, you know, there's been my only
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.660]   computer for.
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.660]   You're not a programmer.
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.660]   You're not a photographer or not.
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.100]   You're a writer and writers needs are few.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.340]   There are very few programmers in the world.
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.340]   They're strange.
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.340]   All right.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.380]   I've just shifted to Canary.
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.380]   I'm excited.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.420]   Anything could happen at any moment.
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.900]   So Matt, what have you, what have you like I've spent?
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.300]   Oh my goodness.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.780]   Well, one's really obscure, but the one that was the funniest to me is I don't know if
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.460]   you guys saw earlier this month John de Vorex blog got hacked.
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.460]   Yes.
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.460]   Yes.
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.340]   And then personally he thought Google was wrong and it was Google false.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.820]   I can't well, you have this whole conspiracy theory.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:23.820]   Right.
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.540]   Because you'd written something negative about Google.
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.260]   John, you're running WordPress.
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.260]   What a surprise.
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.260]   You got hacked.
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.260]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.260]   Well, or version of WordPress.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.260]   Exactly.
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.340]   You got to keep it patched.
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.340]   Yeah.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:38.460]   I wanted to use the program called W get just to fetch the page so I could show him, hey,
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.580]   here's the part of the page that's hacked.
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.860]   And that, you know, there's no W get.
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:42.860]   There's no W get.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:47.300]   There is a terminal, but you can't install arbitrary Linux commands in it or you'd have
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.340]   to install Linux or something.
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.380]   But I could have SSH to a computer and then use W again.
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.940]   I was a little lazy.
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.820]   So there is in fact, there is an SSH for Chrome extension.
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:58.820]   I've used that.
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:59.820]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.820]   Yeah.
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:01.820]   Yeah.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.820]   There's an on the Chromebook pixel.
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.820]   There's an SSH built in.
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:04.820]   Oh, okay.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:05.820]   Like secure shell.
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.980]   I think they call it and it works really well.
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:08.980]   So.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.380]   Do you, can you, are you, are you coding on it?
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:17.260]   I have done a little bit of, I'm trying to tinker with my blog and sort of reconfigure
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.260]   it a little bit.
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:24.100]   And so I have been SSHing into my word, my, you know, press host, my web host and like
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.020]   tinkering with configurations and stuff like that.
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.700]   A lot of people at Google use it for, for coding and really.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.700]   Yeah.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.700]   They've actually been pretty happy.
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.340]   What do you, what do you use?
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.900]   You know, programmers often just stick with like, via email or something.
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.740]   They're using via in terminal.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.740]   Nevermind.
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.780]   I don't know what's wrong with EMAX.
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:43.780]   Come on.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.540]   I mean, you should be happy a little list coding and you can do anything.
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.540]   Exactly.
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.540]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.540]   Okay.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.540]   Yeah.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.540]   You're right.
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.540]   What am I asking?
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.540]   Do not using IntelliJ.
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.540]   They're, you know, right.
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:55.540]   Yeah.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.540]   But that's the, it's things like that.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:02.780]   If you're using the computer as a more serious tool, you know, you need an idea or something
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:03.780]   to be.
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.780]   With your judgmental ways.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:10.180]   What do you, Lord, in yourself about the, your uses are more serious than mine.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.740]   And Trey Rakcliffe was sitting here on Sunday and he said that he didn't say it replaces
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.420]   Lightroom, but a camera awesome and all of the things that it's, that it's, that's,
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.900]   that's whatever it is, is doing.
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:21.900]   I agree.
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.900]   Those are great.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.700]   I love the automated, automated GIFs.
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.100]   I love what it's doing.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.700]   I like the automated GIFs too.
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.700]   Yeah.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.700]   Aren't those cool?
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.700]   Yeah.
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.700]   A little gift joke.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.580]   I got the gift, Jeff.
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.580]   I am not going to be, I do not believe in the tyranny of the programmer, just because the
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:42.180]   guy wrote it doesn't mean he gets to say how it's pronounced.
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.460]   But you called it GIF, right?
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.580]   I did because I, I feel guilty.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.500]   So, so we get to call you Leo LaPorte.
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.100]   Just because it's your name.
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.500]   That's my name, not the, well, I don't care.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.340]   So you call it GIF, Jeff?
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.740]   No, it's, he's GIF, Jeff.
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.580]   No, because it's not a J. It's a G. It's a gift.
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.500]   What a giraffe spell GI.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.860]   I have to admit.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.420]   I pronounce it GIF.
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:11.780]   And like on Twitter, all the people who call it GIF are like, oh, you people are so smug.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:16.940]   I can't believe, you know, language evolves and all the people who call it GIF are like,
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.540]   of course that's the right way to do it.
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.940]   You can only do it this way.
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:24.500]   Well, there is, you know, English does not give us a clue because gift, G.I, F.T, gift
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:31.140]   and giraffe GI both have, you know, there's two ways to do it even before an eye.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.380]   So English helps us not a wit.
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.420]   I don't think just because you wrote it means you get to say how it's pronounced.
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.580]   Frankly, I think I get to say is the guy who is the only guy who pronounces most of these
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:46.820]   terms on the air and has been for since 1991, I, Leo LePort and the guy who gets to decide
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.300]   how things are pronounced.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.300]   Here's what I want.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.740]   I am president of the Internet.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.740]   No, but seriously, until recently, people weren't talking out loud.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.420]   It was all the written word.
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.420]   Right.
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.620]   And so there was, you know, nobody knew how to pronounce it.
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:00.620]   We fought in offices.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.620]   Oh, we fought.
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.220]   It was somebody who's dutch to say it.
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:11.620]   If, if, like Van Gogh and Hawke, it's a if.
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.460]   This is the G, the nerdiest discussion.
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.460]   We need G to hear.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.460]   I love it.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.460]   The G is the guy.
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.460]   I love it.
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:21.260]   So we are going to get at some point in the summer, you think we'll get that.
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.980]   Now let me ask you about the always on in search because one of the things that some
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.900]   people have brought up doesn't bother me is that, well, that means Google is always
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.900]   listening.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:33.460]   Is it always scanning all of the sounds that here's looking for okay Google?
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.460]   That's a good question.
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.860]   I think if you, if you were to enable the hot word thing, I think it would be listening
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:38.860]   to the pattern.
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.860]   Yeah.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:40.860]   But of course you don't have to enable it.
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.180]   And it's at its local.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.180]   It's local only.
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.180]   Right.
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.180]   That was interesting.
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.180]   It's local.
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.620]   Well, I would assume that the hot word detection runs locally.
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.620]   Yeah, it's not on Chrome.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.620]   Yeah, it's not on Chrome.
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.700]   It's a bunch of audio over the net like that.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.220]   That would reassure people.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.740]   So it's just some audio grip going on in the Chrome.
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.740]   Right.
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.500]   And you know, it's funny because Chromium is open source.
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:07.020]   So I love these when people get paranoid and they're like, Chromium is watching or Chrome
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.620]   is watching everywhere I go on Google.
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.620]   It's like, okay, number one, it's open source and number two, you can turn on Wireshark or
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.220]   Etherall or whatever you want to call it.
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.220]   See what it's got.
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.220]   And watch as you're surfing.
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.220]   Yeah.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.220]   I, exactly.
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:24.100]   That's one of the reasons I like open source.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:32.100]   So you can, by the way, the Blink team this week removed 8 million lines of code from WebKit.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.500]   Was it Blink or was it Apple?
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:39.340]   I think Apple did it because that was, I thought the reason that they were forking WebKit is
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:45.540]   so that Blink could take out all of the code for platforms they didn't care about.
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.540]   Right.
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.540]   Well, and that's true.
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.700]   And so for people who don't know, WebKit recently forked.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.500]   And so there's Blink which has got a lot of Google contributors and WebKit continues to
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.020]   have a lot of Apple contributors.
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.500]   Opera went with Blink.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.580]   You know, different people are sometimes slightly picking sides.
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:04.620]   But both sides have started to clear out code that's not maintained.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:09.860]   So I think something called Shadow DOM got deleted on the Apple side because there wasn't
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.620]   a main painter for it anymore.
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.220]   Well that seems fair.
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.420]   By the way, can you check, can you call Danny Sullivan and see if he wants to be on the
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.420]   show?
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.420]   He keeps tweeting me.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.420]   Absolutely.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:24.340]   He was tweeting before he sounded like he was his nose was at the window.
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.900]   Kevin Marks says this every once in a while, please come on the show Danny.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.700]   So one of the things he says is of course, okay Google is only heard by Chrome but everything
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.460]   after has to go to Google for the search.
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.660]   But now that's like you know that.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.500]   Well but Danny wanted to make that clear and that's completely appropriate.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.500]   He does.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.420]   At the same time like with Android voice recognition, it tries to be accurate and it sends it over
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.420]   the network.
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.420]   If you don't have a network connection, your Android phone will try to do voice recognition
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.420]   locally as well.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.380]   And so you can imagine having those sorts of fallbacks.
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.780]   But yes, it's true to do the best voice recognition.
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.780]   You want to sit it over the network.
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:57.780]   Alright I get Canary running.
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.780]   Let me just try here.
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.500]   I'm going to talk to Canary.
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.540]   Okay Google.
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.540]   Nothing.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.500]   Well it's your Windows machine no doubt.
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.500]   Yeah it is.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.500]   But no Canary Windows.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:09.500]   Canary on Windows.
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.500]   The other one worked.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.100]   Well you don't should turn it on.
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.660]   I think you have to turn it on the function Leo.
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.300]   You got to go into flags.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.300]   Oh yeah.
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.020]   I'm not exactly sure.
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.620]   It might be a Chrome extension for now.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.460]   I don't know exactly how they plan to roll it out.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.460]   That's alright.
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.460]   I'm sure it's not in here.
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:27.820]   Is it about what is it Chrome colon slash slash flags?
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.580]   What do I have to do?
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.580]   I think so.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.580]   But that would know better.
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.580]   Yeah there it is.
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:33.580]   Careful.
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:34.580]   These experiments may bite.
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.580]   Wow.
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.580]   Wow.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.580]   Wow.
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.100]   Canary has a lot of extra crap in it.
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.100]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.100]   Yeah.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.100]   Ooh.
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.100]   Wow.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.780]   I am not going to mess with this.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:46.780]   The Mollie.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.860]   I don't know what any of this stuff means.
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.260]   I could turn the script bubble off and on.
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.980]   I saw Rick Byers at I/O and he had one that was just for the purposes of a demonstration
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.860]   so we could show where things moved.
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.060]   And so it left traces of his fingers across the screen.
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.060]   It was fun.
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.060]   So I hear you were unhowered last night or yesterday morning.
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.060]   Oh I was.
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.660]   Oh I brought Gina's point up on Howard.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.460]   What did you what?
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.500]   Because what Zach Braff was on.
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.500]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.700]   And talking about Kickstarter and Howard was trying to understand.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.700]   Kickstarter and all that.
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.860]   And so I called and I said I don't agree with this because I like Kickstarter.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.860]   I like to use that.
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.540]   I like what you're doing on Kickstarter.
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:30.580]   But I've heard some people, Gina Tmedi, say that they fear that Kickstarter will be
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.180]   taken over by famous big Hollywood mobile types like you.
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.180]   And he insisted not.
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:43.940]   And he said he's been spending the last month explaining Hollywood financing to people.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:52.020]   And said that one new Kickstarter told him was that Veronica Mars and Zach Braff brought
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.940]   a huge number of new contributors to Kickstarter.
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:55.940]   Of course.
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.100]   Who in turn contributed more than $400,000 to other things.
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.060]   Oh that's interesting.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.060]   Isn't that?
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.060]   That's very interesting.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:07.220]   I have to admit I did join in on the Kickstarter for the Zach Braff thing because.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.220]   Did you?
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:13.060]   Yeah well he had some tier that said at this much I will record 20 seconds of video with
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.340]   you saying whatever you want.
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.180]   And so he would almost do like your telephone answer machine message or something.
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.180]   Oh that's awesome.
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:26.580]   Wouldn't it be great to have Zach Braff talk about the importance of White Hat SEO.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.500]   Has it happened yet?
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.300]   I'm waiting to hear back on you know how to redeem my sponsored level or whatever.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.300]   So.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.220]   Hi this is Zach Braff for Google.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.700]   That would be awesome.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.700]   It would.
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.700]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.300]   Well I hope you get it.
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.140]   I believe in two factor authentication.
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.060]   You should too.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.820]   Hey speaking of which Twitter has turned on second factor authentication they did it today
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.860]   and that's why my phone was going off before the show.
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.420]   Because one of the things you have to do is turn on SM.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:04.060]   Remember the old days of Twitter it was all about SMS and 404 was their short code and
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.180]   you could get all your tweets in text.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:11.660]   Now that would be a very bad idea today because as I found out your phone goes off constantly.
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:16.060]   So when you so you have to authenticate your phone you're going to use because that's
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.580]   how they're going to send you the second factor it's six digit code just like Google
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.060]   Authenticator.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:25.140]   And so I turned on my phone and then there's a check box in your settings.
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.660]   It's on apparently I believe it's on everybody's Twitter account now.
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:32.340]   And from now on when you sign up for Twitter as I just did on this machine for instance
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.740]   it'll say hey whoa you got a what's the code and you have to have your phone and it'll
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.380]   send you six digit code.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:41.580]   So that's good news after all the Twitter hacks over the last few years.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.580]   It's a great idea.
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.420]   I'm really glad they added that.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.420]   Yeah.
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.580]   Well you guys set the stage in many ways.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.020]   So now Facebook doesn't, Microsoft does it without look.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:54.620]   Google of course is one of the first to do it and now Twitter does it and I think that's
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.620]   great.
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.620]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.620]   I think that's really great.
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.220]   Turn it on as I have it all for.
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.740]   And we were also talking before the show and I think it's worth bears repeating that Google
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:09.660]   authenticator which I run on Android is just a version of this is a standard this this
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.980]   form of authentication.
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:11.980]   Yep.
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:12.980]   Yeah.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.460]   It's called a like TOTP time based one time password or something like that.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:21.100]   And so any piece of software can implement this standard.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.540]   Google authenticator is a really good one.
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:27.700]   But the beauty of it is that now someone has a client for Windows phone and so you can
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.340]   do it all on that.
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:34.740]   And you can even take the secret the QR code and you can scan it with multiple phones.
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.820]   And so you can have the same you know secret on three or four phones and then whichever
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.860]   one you have with you you can just say okay based on the current time stamp this is my
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:43.860]   password.
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.340]   This is my six digit number.
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.860]   So it really makes things secure.
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.620]   But a lot of people have this misconception.
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.060]   Oh I can't get texts.
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:53.220]   What if I'm in a foreign country you don't need to have an internet connection.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.820]   It all runs locally on your phone.
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:59.300]   Well and unfortunately right now Twitter doesn't seem to be using that although that
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.820]   doesn't mean they wouldn't.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:01.820]   Right.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:05.340]   Yeah it sounded like maybe Twitter's my guess is maybe they're in a hurry to get it rolled
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.420]   out quickly.
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:10.380]   And so they're sending texts for now but there's no reason why they you know in theory couldn't
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.500]   use this as a way to do it as well.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.780]   And then a little approach so there's my and I can show these because without my password
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:20.820]   the codes are worthless every 30 seconds they change but yet I have one for last pass one
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.220]   for Gmail and one for outlook.com.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.080]   And that's the Google authenticator running and every 30 seconds you get a new six digit
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.300]   code which you'll need if you want to re-authenticate any of those.
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.860]   In fact I've got it set up on my WordPress.
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:37.540]   So the standard is is implemented by a lot of people.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:42.220]   I did a blog post a little while ago that talked about the number of people that support
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:47.420]   it and I think it's a last pass word press drop box Amazon Web Services Drupal Stripe
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.420]   Dreampost.
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.420]   Wow.
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:53.660]   Yubike uses it and then that's in addition to all the folks like like Microsoft and stuff
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.660]   as well.
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.660]   Isn't that great.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:59.240]   It's a hassle but it really gives you so much more protection.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.000]   Every bank should be using it.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.760]   Amazon please we're begging you Amazon start using it.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.600]   I mean all of these places you're giving you know these passwords important and having
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.400]   a second factory just makes it so much.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.560]   So you're now let me ask you so before that means before you do admin on your WordPress
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.720]   blog you're asked for the code.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.200]   Yeah every time I try to log in it says give me your password and then it's the exact
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.800]   same type in the six digit number and it changes every 30 seconds so I just whip out my phone
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.540]   and then it remembers it for you know I don't know 30 days or something like that so it's
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:31.000]   not like I have to type it in each time I want to tweak my WordPress blog.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.080]   What is the do you know the plugins name?
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.640]   I'm going to look at that.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.640]   Yes.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.640]   Yes.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.120]   I believe it's called well it's just called Google Authenticator.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.040]   Oh okay cool.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.920]   Yeah so if you use WordPress to search for a plugin called Google Authenticator then
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.040]   look for the one that has a lot of downloads.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.480]   Not the one that for downloads.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.200]   Google Authenticator will protect the site.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.280]   This one the one I'm looking at is 17,517 downloads that sounds right.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.280]   Yeah I think that's the one.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.000]   That is really great.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.200]   Matt Matt Matt so let me ask you this since I happen to have you here just as it just
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:12.960]   happened on Twitter there's this thing I'm getting now where Russian accounts find old
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.600]   tweets and then retweet them.
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.840]   Yeah that's happening to me.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.840]   Out of nowhere.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840]   I get a ton of those.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.400]   What do you think what what are they trying to do?
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:26.240]   Well okay if you're writing a bot for Twitter you can write nonsense or you can cycle through
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.960]   like e-book like what is it?
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:28.960]   Horsey books.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.960]   Horsey books yeah.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:34.800]   Where you can you know have a list of a thousand predefined tweets but the easiest place to
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.120]   get tweets and content would just be to mind the history of Twitter.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:41.760]   So I suspect they're trying to look real by just recycling your content.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.480]   And so what that but I've always wondered what is them what is what is the value in
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.120]   these Twitter bots?
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:51.880]   Well if you're a spam fighter at Twitter you probably say well most most Twitter spam accounts
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:56.000]   are probably two days old so now if you're a smart smart spammer you probably say oh
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.240]   I'll leave my account around for a long time make it look normal tweet three times a day
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.480]   right and then and then you know three months from now ha ha I'm ready to attack people and
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.000]   I look like a real Twitter user.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.440]   We're waiting for Horsey books to do that.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.080]   Certainly this is a very long term strategy from them.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:19.080]   They've got 17,000 tweets and they're still just random.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.960]   I think they've realized hey wait a minute we're getting a lot of traffic.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.080]   Now every once in a while see a millionaire speaks that is a plug for a book right that's
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.080]   spam.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:36.680]   Yeah yeah so it's so mad to you and other spam fighters like the fabulous four get together.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:41.280]   You know like whenever we came up with the realm no follow attribute it was great because
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.120]   there was a lot of people I think we met at Yahoo and you know a bunch of people were
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:50.600]   all at a round table but at the same time you have to worry about you don't want to
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.600]   be accused of collusion or anything like that.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:57.600]   We often see each other at search conferences but it's not like we compare what do you think
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.600]   of these guys oh yeah we don't like them.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.600]   That's sort of stuff.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:04.840]   That's a big issue isn't it you can't companies you know have to be very careful about that.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.680]   You need a lawyer or the room.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.960]   Well and it makes sense that if we can cooperate with other search engines on like how to reduce
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:17.720]   malware you know so we're completely open standards all that sort of stuff so we've
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.000]   done some of that but you have to be a little bit careful.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.480]   Which makes sense yeah it is but yeah you know.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.560]   I just imagine this fun thing where they all get together and play whack a mole.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:33.560]   What do you hear what do you know who says where's ebooks what's going on.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.880]   So let's take a break.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.720]   By the way how is that 30 day challenge going man how many days in are you on it.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:44.040]   I usually start at the beginning of each month so I'm 22 days in.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.400]   And it sounds like you like it would now here's the question.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.880]   June 1st.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:55.360]   Right so that's the interesting thing I honestly was planning to go back to my Linux thinkpad
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.600]   and then I remember it was May 12th May 12th was the day I was like you know what I could
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.680]   just stick with the scrum book so what we'll have to see for sure but I'd slap it.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.560]   I mean the screen is so nice.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.240]   It is the battery life is better.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.720]   So it is gorgeous.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.040]   It'll be a tough call.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.880]   Yeah it is gorgeous.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.880]   Alright we're going to take.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.880]   Once Matt.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:19.440]   I've been living love eat a Google solid on three months it's worked I don't even work
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.720]   for the place and I'm I've got the pot on my back works.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:27.400]   You're the most senior guy living in the Google cloud with the pixel I think.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.400]   Him and Rupert Murdoch.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.560]   Yeah no.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.200]   Why is this.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:38.640]   Get it out of here.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.280]   So can you see my screen now Chad.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.280]   Alright this is a wonky set up here.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.600]   Are we how about Danny are we get I think Danny said he'd do it.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.720]   No Danny Danny is unavailable he only had a few minutes.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.720]   Oh he was just in there.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.960]   Yeah yeah yeah yeah he said he tweeted that his kid was in the room when I mentioned it
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.720]   and his kid last.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.400]   Yeah yeah that oh Danny they're talking about you exactly.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.400]   I love it.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:10.680]   Hey let's talk about Ting Ting is cell phone service reinvented no BS mobile service.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:16.240]   They're an MVNO that's a mobile virtual network operator means a resell a sprint network.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.760]   So if you've got a good sprint coverage where you are you really ought to look at replacing
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.840]   your current carrier with Ting.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.800]   Here's why there's no contract.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.800]   It's always month to month always month to month.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.560]   There's no early termination fees.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.000]   There's no bundling or ride along services.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.960]   They don't charge extra if you use more bandwidth.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.400]   They rebate you the bandwidth actually they don't even charge you in the first place if
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.400]   you use less bandwidth.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.760]   I'll show you how that works.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.360]   You get a credit for unused service.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:51.440]   It includes with all Ting phones voicemail caller ID tethering hot spot no charge three
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:56.720]   way calling call forwarding nothing mysterious and it's and it really works great.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:04.120]   If the best thing to do is go to twig.ting.com and do the little savings calculator bring
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.840]   yourself bill or you could just go directly to plans and kind of go a sample.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.400]   Let's do one right now here.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.400]   It's six dollars per phone.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:14.200]   So this is great for companies or families that want to have a lot of phones.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.480]   Let's say four phones a family of four.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.200]   So that's twenty four bucks a month with the phone.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.520]   We'll choose our plan.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.520]   We don't need a lot of minutes.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.400]   Let's say a thousand minutes.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.640]   We do need a lot of messages.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.800]   Let's say two thousand messages and let's go all the way up on data.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.640]   This is going to be a shared pool.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:35.040]   So with three gigabytes of data, two thousand text messages, thousand minutes.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   The total for the family for all four of us is a hundred ten bucks for phones included
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.880]   a hundred ten bucks.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.200]   Now here's the beauty part.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.200]   You don't use as many minutes.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.200]   No problem.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.200]   They don't charge you.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.080]   What they do is they send you a bill at the beginning of the month and they adjust it
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.800]   at the end of the month.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.960]   You use more messages.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.960]   No problems.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.960]   They just move you up to the next tier.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.360]   The four thousand message tiers, three bucks more.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.600]   So they just move you up to the next tier.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.520]   It's under thirteen dollars.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.680]   Use more data, same thing.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.800]   Use less data, same thing.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:07.440]   So you never pay for more than you use and you never get a penalty if you use more than
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.960]   you said.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.160]   There's a wonderful online control page.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.120]   Geeks love it because you get all, you know, are you an information junkie?
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.760]   You'll know everything about what's going on with your phone service.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.560]   No whole customer support during business hours if you call the TING help line, a real
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.920]   person empowered to solve your problem.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:29.400]   We'll pick up the phone and we'll stay on the line with you until the problem is fixed,
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.400]   which I love.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:34.840]   They also have great customer forums, helped system video tutorials and startup guides
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.840]   and more.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.840]   So here's how it works.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.520]   You're going to go to TING, bring your bill to the savings calculator just to see how much
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.520]   it's going to save you.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.080]   Then go to their device page.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.520]   Now remember, these are unsubsidized.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.080]   So these phones cost a little more, although I'm going to save you some money.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.480]   And they have a big variety of phones.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.200]   I mean, they have inexpensive phones.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.080]   They have my-fi style bandwidth devices.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.160]   They have used devices.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.360]   So you could find a phone that's right for you.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:01.320]   You might give a used Galaxy S2 to the kid and you might get a Galaxy Note for yourself,
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.920]   that kind of thing.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:06.960]   Note two for yourself or a Galaxy S4 for yourself, whatever it is you want.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.120]   You can even bring your own.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:14.400]   Eligible Sprint devices can be converted to TING or take your old device, sell it to TING
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.320]   and they'll give you cash to help you buy the new phone.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.800]   There's lots of ways to do this.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:25.440]   And if you go to twig.ting.com, whatever you do, you're going to save 25 bucks on your
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.440]   first TING device.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.440]   So they've got all the big brands.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.600]   Let me just see what the newest stuff they got.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.560]   Yeah, they have the Galaxy S4.
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.000]   It's called "Deerly Beloved."
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.760]   They also have the HTC One, which I have to say I'm really liking that HTC One, but
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.840]   I carry this for most of the time.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.560]   Both excellent.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:49.600]   And by the way, I paid $800 for my S4.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.120]   That's $571 with the TING discount that we're going to give you.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.720]   So that's a good deal.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.800]   In fact, it's considerably less than Google's going to charge you next month for the Galaxy
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   S4.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.960]   Twig.ting.com, try it today.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.520]   You're going to love it.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.800]   And I love it that they're changing the way cell phone companies work.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.520]   Or maybe they're not, but at least you can do it with TING.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.880]   So far, the cell phone companies don't seem to be backing down.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.880]   I don't know why.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:16.880]   I don't know why.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.800]   Well, I saw Tony Hale from Sharp Beat said that he goes the opposite of what Google
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   do.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.200]   He tries to just do nothing that Google would do.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   Oh, really?
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.600]   Nothing that Google would do.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.600]   It was a good post.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:33.560]   So Leo, on the rundown under your tip just so you can find it, my good friend from the
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:38.760]   Netherlands, Bart Brows, put up the announcer for GIF.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.760]   But he's Dutch.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.760]   So this is the Dutch.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.760]   I know that's what I wanted.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.760]   Oh, you want it?
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.760]   Okay.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.840]   And he did it like that.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:46.840]   So you'll see.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.840]   All right.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.840]   Well, let's see.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.840]   Oh, he put it on sound class.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.840]   So it's not GIF.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:51.840]   It's not GIF.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.280]   It's just GIF.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.280]   I want an animated GIF.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.280]   GIF.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.280]   GIF.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.280]   I mean, animated GIF.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.680]   He gets the web-ness in it.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:10.560]   Now, Jeff, did they do that in real time in the amount of time that you asked for it?
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.560]   He tweeted me a little joke.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.560]   It's CHCHCHCACIS.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.240]   I have a sound cloud.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.240]   So Bingo, Bart was there.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.240]   That's for sound class.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.080]   Bart is the new favorite guy from Amsterdam.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.080]   He's wonderful.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.080]   I'm so...
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.080]   Thank you, Bart.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.080]   Thank you.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.080]   Thank you.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.080]   Thank you.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.080]   Thank you.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.080]   The power of the cloud is strong in this show.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.080]   It's...
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.080]   We can find out anything you want.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.080]   Okay, everybody.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.080]   Flush at the same time.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.080]   Let's see what happens.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.280]   How do we keep media and make a new person?
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:44.080]   Somebody in the chat room says Google Now, Flag, and Chrome Beta.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.680]   I guess I could turn on Google Now cards or I guess notifications, right, in my Chrome
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.680]   Beta.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.160]   So I'll have to play with that a little bit.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.360]   Wow.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.440]   That's a good reason to go to Canary.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.440]   It's nice.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:02.200]   It puts a little Canary or you could say Gold, Chrome icon in your taskbar to go next to
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.440]   the Google colored one.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.440]   Let's see.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.080]   What other news do we have from the Google verse?
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:13.640]   As long as we've got Matt, I'm just trying to think of some Google I/O stuff we could go
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:17.840]   back over.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.840]   I think it's the case.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.320]   Babel, which we kept hearing about, that's Hangouts, right?
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.320]   Babel.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.320]   No.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.320]   Is it Babel, really?
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:32.960]   Good, because that's what I was calling it until the chat room said it's Babel.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.960]   But Hangouts.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:34.960]   Hangouts.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.960]   Hangouts.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:36.960]   Hangouts.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:42.320]   Babel is pronounced Hangouts, in case you wonder.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:46.720]   And are you going to get access to the quantum computer and why the hell is Google buying
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.120]   one?
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.480]   That's a really interesting question.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:55.880]   So quantum computers are good at exploring a space all at once in parallel.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:00.640]   And so instead of doing iterative computation and trying out one thing at a time, they explore
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.560]   the whole space kind of all at once.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.560]   Like the human brain.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.160]   Yeah, like the human brain is massively parallel.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.040]   It's not fast, right.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.040]   But it's massively parallel.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.040]   Speak for yourself.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.640]   Well, we have serial brains.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:18.640]   And Google is really good at, hey, the query is Katy Perry, send that out to thousands
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.800]   of machines and everybody do their computation and then come back with the best result.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:28.560]   So if you read that article, it talks about artificial intelligence and Larry really enjoys
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.520]   anything related to artificial intelligence.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.520]   So there might be a couple different angles there.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.520]   I don't like it.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.520]   They're interesting to them.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.440]   Hey, I mean, Ray Kurzweil is now Google.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:42.400]   So he's kind of the most famous AI researcher out there.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:50.120]   Would you say that things like voice search and Google now are using AI techniques?
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.120]   I would.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:55.320]   In fact, Jeff Dean, there was a good session at Google I/O and I think the video is live
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:02.720]   now that had Jeff Dean and several other Googlers and they talked about how they're doing deep
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.720]   learning.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:08.120]   They have a project called Google Brain that basically tries to do massive neural networks.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.720]   So the idea is you don't just have a single level neural network, but you have multiple
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:17.000]   levels and you just sort of set it loose on things like YouTube and it learns to identify
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.880]   cats.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.080]   And so you can use that for a lot of different applications.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.880]   Specifically, they've improved the voice recognition.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.960]   And then once you figure out all the right weights for the neural network, then you can
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:27.960]   bake that down.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:32.560]   And so that's why your Google phone gets a lot better in terms of voice recognition because
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.400]   the model takes a lot of computation to do, but then it's pretty small once you've figured
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.400]   it out.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.600]   It's pretty exciting.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:45.080]   I mean, for a long time, you know, AI natural language, all of this has been a hot topic
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.400]   in computer science.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.360]   And then it felt like it was they were giving up, frankly.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.760]   Like, we tried it and it's not really working out.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:59.720]   Well, it seems like there was a sort of a blighted zone for a while.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:04.000]   Like, you know, when I went to grad school, it was like, oh, don't study artificial
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   intelligence.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.280]   And they have to like rebrand it to machine learning and stuff like that.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:12.840]   But Google is definitely a haven for people who want to target really interesting applications,
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:16.080]   including like, you know, image recognition and stuff like that.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.080]   There's the cat.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.520]   There's the neuron that learns, you know, to recognize a cat.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.080]   I've seen some videos of this.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.720]   It's pretty spectacular as it refines the vision.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.320]   It gets better and better and better.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.600]   You know, I guess you showed a lot of cat pictures and it starts to say, oh, this is
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.600]   kind of the platonic cat.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.480]   Well, and the beauty is you don't even have to segment it.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:40.560]   So you don't have to do any training and say, hey, people come up with 1000 pictures of
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.560]   cats.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:45.440]   Instead, you just literally set it loose on like either the web or, you know, the images
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:49.440]   on the web or YouTube and you let it pick out what are the distinctive things.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.920]   So like, if our brain has a neuron for Jennifer Aniston, then you would assume that the deep
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:57.160]   learning would eventually develop a neuron for Jennifer Aniston.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.160]   Wow.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.360]   I think I did that already.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:05.880]   There's something every time I see her, I go, wow, wow.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.880]   Did you see this?
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:13.200]   The Fiat photo bomb on the Volkswagen headquarters in Sweden.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.560]   Some smart Fiat employee.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.960]   They saw the street view coming down the street.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.560]   It's like, oh, hurry, hurry.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:25.760]   And they drove right up in front of the sign that says Volkswagen headquarters in Sweden.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.360]   And they put a Fiat there.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.280]   Oh, man, that's good.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.680]   I want to see more of that.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.880]   Yeah, that's fun.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:38.120]   Down there on the page, I think Leo's photos of you can see the car coming going there.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.120]   Also caught by the car.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.120]   You can see the whole thing.
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.120]   It's documented.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.120]   Here it comes.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.120]   He's driving in.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.920]   That's so funny.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:52.560]   God, you know, anybody who sees that Google Street view car, you got to get a photo.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.240]   You got to find a way.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.240]   Do something.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.120]   You can't wait to see one on the wild.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.120]   So here's another one.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:04.200]   Leo, today Google had a big tent event in the UK where they do these things as policy
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.200]   events as what I went to New Delhi for.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:09.560]   So it was about a bunch of topics today, but they invited Ed Miliband, the labor leader
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:15.240]   who came and knowing full well what he would do, he spanked Google on this tax thing, which
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.240]   I also--
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.240]   Because Apple's getting spanked right.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.240]   I'm already in about this.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.240]   I've been on BBC about this.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:25.080]   Apple's getting spapped right now, too, but also-- well, the absurdity of this is
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.480]   it's not the problem of the company.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:33.840]   It's a matter of-- so there's often now-- of lawmakers writing new laws and diplomats
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.360]   negotiating new treaties with other countries.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.600]   But it's not up to Google to decide how much they--
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.080]   Oh, we think we should pay this, right?
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.400]   They're minimizing what they need.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.760]   But nevertheless, I thought it was fascinating that they would go ahead and invite this guy
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:52.040]   without challenge to come on and challenge them at their own event.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.040]   Good.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.040]   So I thought it was cool.
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:46:01.520]   So what you ought to do, the courage of your convictions-- in Apple's case, they're not
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.680]   doing anything illegal, but boy, even more than Google jumping through hoops, they created
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.600]   an employee-less Irish subsidiary.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:12.000]   There's nobody working there to store the money.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.320]   And Ireland-- there are complete errors with Ireland that they enabled this, but the Ireland's
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.760]   financial situation right now, Ireland ain't going to change that.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.680]   Yeah, but the irony is Ireland gets no tax money from them either.
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:26.320]   It's a stateless entity, so they pay zero tax.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.880]   I think, you know, far be it from an engineer to talk about anything legal.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:34.720]   But Google does have-- I think it's European headquarters in Dublin.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:35.720]   Right.
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.160]   And so we have a large number of Spanish writers in Dublin.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:41.480]   So I've been to Dublin to visit them, and they do a fantastic job.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.480]   Right.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:47.400]   And I thought the tax rate in Ireland was 12.5% or something like that.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.280]   No, it's a little different what Google's doing.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.000]   You're still doing the Irish reach around in the Catalan jump or whatever the hell it's
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.200]   called, but you have employees.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:01.320]   I mean, the thing that's kind of blatant with Apple is it's a zero employee entity in Ireland.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:05.640]   So it's clearly created for one reason only.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:11.080]   Now Google did transfer its intellectual property to this Irish subsidiary to offshore
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:15.000]   the tax liability, but it's a little different.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.800]   In any event, and we talked about this yesterday on Mac Break Weekly, it's probably un-publicly
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:25.920]   held company anyway, a fiduciary responsibility of the people who run the company to maximize
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:30.960]   profits, and among other things minimize tax liability, or they would have problems with
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.120]   the stakeholders.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:38.000]   And as long as what they're doing is not illegal, it's really up to the US government
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.320]   to change the laws if this is an issue, as opposed to have-- I mean, the companies kind
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.320]   of have to do it.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.600]   At the same time, there's doing it and there's doing it.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.520]   I mean, at least Google has employees there.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.360]   Apple has nothing.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.360]   So it's an odd--
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:56.120]   I debated Margaret Hodges.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.200]   Margaret Hodges member of Parliament in the UK who's been going after and calling Google
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.080]   every nasty word you can come up with.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:04.280]   I debated her in the Guardian, and then last week they had me-- believe it or not, they
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.480]   had me back on the BBC of another world channel to--
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:08.480]   Really?
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.480]   Oh, they probably love you.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.480]   Are you kidding?
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.920]   That drives traffic to have somebody go, "You, you know, to go off on them, it's great."
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.200]   You know, they're not babies, they understand.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.560]   Here is-- we don't have a change law because we don't have Gina, but for a change law
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.160]   point of view that you don't have to have Gina because the Google Developer blog has
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.600]   a very nice summary.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:29.040]   Scott Kannaster, thank you, Scott.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.040]   We're going to get him on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.040]   He wants to be on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.240]   He's an old Mac guy.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:38.920]   He works now as a developer evangelist at Google, and he has summarized everything from the
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:43.040]   developer's point of view from Google I/O, Android Studio based on IntelliJ, Google Play
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:48.720]   Services 3.1, Google Play Developer Console, Google Maps Maps APIs, Google Compute Engine,
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:55.240]   now open to everyone, PHP Runtime, Google Cloud Datastore, Instant Buy Android API,
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.240]   Wallet Objects.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:59.280]   When am I going to get my gosh darn wallet, by the way, Matt?
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.920]   You know why?
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:05.200]   My T-Mobile or AT&T phones, none of them--
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.160]   I want wallet.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.160]   That's tough.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.160]   That's kind of like--
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.160]   Is it the carriers?
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.160]   --why do you video chat work on AT&T, you know?
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.040]   Sometimes the software, you do the best you can.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.120]   What's interesting to me about this post is it runs through in a lot of detail what happened
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:24.120]   at I/O, but a lot of individual sessions at I/O had announcements that still didn't
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.880]   even make it into this little bit of a post.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.280]   This was the richest I/O ever.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.280]   Amazing.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:34.720]   For developers, I have to say, just speaking my opinion personally, I think it had gotten
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:39.400]   a little out of hand with the free devices and a little consumer and bringing it back
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.120]   to developers, I think was really smart.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.880]   So they had a couple of great announcements.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:48.160]   They had something for webmasters that's called request auto-complete.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:53.080]   So Chrome actually looks for something called auto-complete on form fields.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:57.120]   And so if you want to make it easier for people to buy things, it's literally an hour
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.400]   to annotate your web form.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.240]   And now they've introduced a new standard called request auto-complete.
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:06.640]   And if you're using Chrome and you have a Google Wallet account, then it's basically
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.120]   two clicks to buy something, no more filling out forms.
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:14.600]   And they've got an equivalent standard for Android applications, which is called Google
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.840]   Wallet Instant Buy.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:21.200]   And so there's no reason why a webmaster shouldn't annotate their forms at the very
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:25.720]   least to make it lower friction and easier to buy and get shipping addresses and all
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.080]   that sort of stuff.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:31.000]   So that's one thing I wish more people had heard about out of I/O because it's a really
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.160]   cool standard.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:38.920]   Are all the videos of all the sessions going to go up eventually?
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.920]   I think almost all of them are up.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:47.440]   If you go to developers.google.com/live, there's a lot of sessions there.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:53.640]   I've been watching them slowly and it's so great that you guys publish all that stuff.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:54.640]   It was great.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:57.800]   And plus you couldn't get into anything related to Glass to save your soul.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.880]   And even get into a moment of the logic.
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:02.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:07.320]   The logic of the developers that you see the room was full.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:10.400]   And nonetheless, they filled four deep all the way down the hall.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.200]   Guys, couch, you're not going to make it in.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.200]   Give it up.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.720]   Go have coffee.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.040]   The fire marshal will not let it happen.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:22.280]   But Leo, I think you did a blog post earlier today about the number of simultaneous people
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.560]   who were watching Twitch during the keynote.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:28.480]   Yeah, but that was a fraction of the total who watched the YouTube direct, right?
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.480]   What was the talk?
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.760]   You know, Larry mentioned this number that was something like 1 million.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:37.680]   But if you've only got five or six thousand people in the actual room and you have 180,
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:42.480]   200,000 people and there's a million watching on YouTube, your audience becomes that larger
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.480]   group.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.480]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.200]   And so I like that they put the sessions up within a week or so.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.200]   I think that's great.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.120]   And I can trust that again a little bit to Apple.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:53.800]   Apple throws out journalists after the keynote and all of the stuff is closed and NDADed
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:56.520]   so that developers can't talk about what they learn.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:59.920]   And just an interesting contrast in the style.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.640]   And I like open source.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.640]   I like open.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.640]   I like APIs.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.880]   I like it that Google publishes all this.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:07.080]   Anybody wants to develop?
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:08.080]   Can.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.240]   That's just fantastic.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:14.400]   I wish I had the time to watch all of these videos, but they're just I would only understand
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:16.080]   about 1% of them.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:20.080]   You know, a lot of it is very accessible.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:23.680]   People should not be scared off by any of it.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:26.240]   A lot of it is extremely accessible and it's really great.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:33.160]   But I enjoy seeing the people because it's very easy with any company, Microsoft, Apple,
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:37.960]   Google, to just kind of make it a monolith and forget that it's made of people.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.320]   That's why I love the fireside chat.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.680]   Yes, the Android team fireside chat.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.320]   Did you really get a chance to cross the app?
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:45.240]   It was a Google plus fireside.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:53.720]   And there's a huge diversity and they're quirky and interesting and obviously all of them
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.880]   super smart.
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:56.880]   It's just fun.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.880]   It's really neat to see that.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.160]   I really applaud that.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.040]   And I like that a lot of them stick around afterwards.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:05.920]   You can say, well, I really wish this featured that this and they're like, oh, okay.
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.680]   Well, let me think about how we can do that.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:10.680]   That's kind of nice.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:11.680]   Really, really cool.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.040]   So thank you, Google.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:16.680]   Let's talk about Tumblr because that's within our realm.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:20.520]   Tumblr, David Carp's company, little company, David's 26 now.
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:24.720]   He started when he was a 19 year old dropout, high school dropout.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.720]   I love this.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:26.720]   He was a mom.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.120]   He was 14 going to Brooklyn science or whatever.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:32.480]   And his mom said, you know, you're too smart.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:33.480]   Just dropout.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.480]   She was a teacher.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.280]   I'll teach you home school.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.960]   H, of course, I'm sure all that happened was he just sat down at the computer more.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:42.800]   And he also went to work for Fred Cyber.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:43.800]   That's right.
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.800]   So next to networks to Google not too long ago.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:46.800]   That's right.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:50.720]   And Fred, you know, kind of had a warm embrace for him.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:53.880]   And that's where he started working on companies and eventually on Tumblr.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:54.880]   It's a wonderful story.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:59.840]   Marco Arman also writes his memoirs at Marco.org about he was one of the, I think the first
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:04.600]   employee David had before Tumblr and then helped create Tumblr.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:06.760]   $1.1 billion.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.840]   Carp apparently has about a quarter of the stock.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:13.800]   So he's going to get a considerable amount of cash, about $250 million in cash.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:17.160]   Union Square Adventure has got a 5,000 percent return.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.160]   Fine.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:23.840]   You know, they took $125 billion in venture capital, valued the company at $800 million.
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:24.840]   Sold it for $1.1 billion.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.440]   It's a great success story.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:31.200]   The real question is what's Yahoo going to do with it?
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.600]   You know, a lot of people concerned because of the way Yahoo treated Flickr.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.680]   But I think it's a new, I think it's a very new Yahoo and I think Marissa Meyer.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.320]   Oh, I think Marissa, Marissa, it's very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:40.320]   demonstrated.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.800]   I mean, and this acquisition and, but they could not have got it without Marissa.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:43.880]   I think we talked about that.
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:49.520]   I mean, she wooed Carp and most importantly, I think reassured him, this is not Flickr.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.360]   This is not the same Yahoo.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.200]   She won't make him purple.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:56.880]   And yet, you know, you hear a lot of dissent on that and saying this is not a good, you
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.000]   know, well, we'll just have to see.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.480]   I think there's a lot of Tumblr people who are nervous.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:06.160]   Matt Monway immediately posted the next day on WordPress.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:11.000]   We got, what is it, 72,000 people moving over from Tumblr in the first hour?
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.800]   You know, it's not the thing doesn't close for six months.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:14.800]   You got plenty of time.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.000]   But I am so, let me see.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   I'm also happy for New York.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.640]   This is the first big New York exit.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.800]   And that's a wonderful thing for the scene here.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.800]   Is it really?
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.240]   That's the first?
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:29.720]   Well, you had a lot of companies that didn't quite do it.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:35.520]   All the four square and I forget the list, but it's a long list.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:39.240]   I like that Yahoo, the press release said something like, we promised not to screw it
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.200]   up or something like that.
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.600]   She put up an animated GIF.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.600]   It's very authentic.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.400]   And, you know, Marissa is whip smart.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.040]   So you have to think she's on point.
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.280]   She's going to be paying a lot of attention to this.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:58.320]   And I think earlier today I saw the Yahoo also rolled out Flickr Pro.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.880]   And someone had taken an offense and said, oh, well, you're saying photographers aren't
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:04.960]   pros or they're no pros on Flickr or something like that.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:09.320]   And she responded on Twitter and said, hey, I worded that really not well.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.800]   Of course, we want to have photographers on Flickr.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.400]   Just something like any normal person would do.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.400]   Good for her.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:18.640]   But from her, like that really shows she's plugged in.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.800]   She's paying attention.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:23.000]   And you know, nipping that stuff in the bud really makes a big difference.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.760]   So she's a real person.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.760]   She's a real person.
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.240]   It's hard with CEOs.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:33.280]   It's very rare that a CEO will do something that, you know, let her hair down and do something
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.280]   that real.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:37.760]   Well, and it feels like you had the CEOs who didn't know what email was.
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:38.760]   Right.
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:39.920]   And now they have to know what email is.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.920]   But the CEO's.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.920]   The Tumblr is.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:42.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:47.600]   But the ones you need somebody who can like respond on Twitter, like, you know, for better
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:51.440]   or for worse, Jonathan Swartz at Sun seems like one of those guys who was like, he was
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:54.880]   willing to get in and get into the scrubs.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.080]   There's definitely pros and cons.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:59.960]   You don't want to come across as bitter or sarcastic.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:06.880]   But someone who's plugged in and really savvy enough to use it well, I think that can generate
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.880]   a lot of good wealth.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.040]   There's the Carol Bart's side of it.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.920]   There's the there's a Marissa Myers.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:14.920]   You can go either either way on that scale.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:18.600]   But yeah, no, I think it's I love the new Flickr.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:19.920]   I do not love the pricing.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.480]   I think it's extremely confusing.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.480]   I can't figure it out.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.200]   I'm a long time pro user.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:30.560]   And I've got one plan that's different from the doubler plan or the free plan.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:35.120]   And it's it's clear that they're going to put ads, a lot of ads on there.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.120]   That's going to be to me.
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.960]   That's going to be the thing to watch on Flickr.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:43.400]   I hate to sound like you know, Google boy, but but now that my phone is just sending
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.400]   automatically Google.
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.400]   Love Google.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.400]   It's hard to see these switching.
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:49.880]   I think Google plus has a huge advantage here.
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:50.880]   And I love the new layout.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:53.240]   I started posting more because I feel more engaged with it.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.920]   I think it's more fun to read.
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:59.640]   The funniest thing though is they've got a real they'll fix it.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.600]   But the scroll bar to read comments in the pop up window.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.200]   There's something on the rundown.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:05.200]   I put up there.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.160]   And I'm not sure if you can get the
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:09.160]   first one.
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:11.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:17.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:21.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:23.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:25.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:27.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:33.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:37.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:39.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:41.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:43.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:45.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:55.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:59.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:01.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:03.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:05.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:07.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:11.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:15.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:19.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:25.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:29.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:33.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:37.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:45.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:53.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:55.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.160]   I'm not sure if you can get the first one.
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.160]   I didn't know this, but when Twitter announced vine,
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.160]   Red Vines posted a six-set in Vine about Red Vines.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:08.160]   [laughter]
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.160]   I love this when brands do this.
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.160]   This is so smart.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:17.160]   Anyway, I'm sorry.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:20.160]   I just derailed the conversation, but I saw that.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.160]   Can I go to glass for a second?
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.160]   Glass, please.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.160]   Where's your glass, Jeff? Did you get glass?
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.160]   I haven't got notification yet.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.160]   I get you some glass.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.160]   I'm waiting.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:34.160]   I actually sat outside my optometrist here that they wonder if I should go in and get contacts.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.160]   Somebody at I/O had regular glasses.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.160]   I tried to talk to them about it.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.160]   They kept on saying, "Talk to the PR guy. Talk to the PR guy."
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:44.160]   They said, "Red badge. We can't talk to you. We're going to kill.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.160]   We're going to kill you."
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.160]   Those red shirt people.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:52.160]   Nick built, had I think the most ridiculous thing.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.160]   He has turned into Mr. Cranky.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.160]   I'm sorry, but I love Nick.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.160]   I adore Nick.
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.160]   But he's decided he's Mr. Cranky.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.160]   Yeah, he's going to be contrarian all the time.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:07.160]   So he wrote this post about, "Oh, I went into the men's room and I was freaked."
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:12.160]   And I tweeted back, "Nobody wants a picture of your junk Nick. Nobody ever did."
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.160]   That was funny.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:16.160]   That was my response too, is if they want a picture of my junk, take it.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.160]   Go ahead.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.160]   So he actually called me yesterday to talk this through.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.160]   He said, "Well, it's the most frightening technology I had. I said, "Frightening.
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.160]   Let's write. You kidding me? This is frightening?"
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.160]   And I said, "What you're scared of is your other people."
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.160]   I said, "Then you should talk about this with your shrink."
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.160]   He laughed.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.160]   So I waited for his column, but I thought it was the...
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:38.160]   Nick's tried so hard to be contrarian about this stuff.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.160]   He got all mad at me on Twitter and stuff, but I thought it was the most
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.160]   ridiculous, birthful piece.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.160]   But also, there's an XKCD on this, which I think is wonderful.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.160]   That was my favorite piece.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.160]   I didn't see it.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.160]   Let me see it.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.160]   It's on the rundown, under glass.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.160]   Okay.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:54.160]   That's hilarious because...
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.160]   You want to read it?
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:02:00.160]   Maybe before we rush to adopt Bracket, Google Glass Bracket, we should stop to consider
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:05.160]   the consequences of blithely giving this technology such a central position in our lives.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.160]   Don't have any insights about a new technology? Just use this sentence.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:13.160]   It makes you sound wise, and you can say it about virtually everything.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.160]   That's true.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.160]   That's true.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.160]   That's true.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.160]   The implications.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:23.160]   And the hover over even says that the beauty of the problem is that everyone will project
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.160]   their worst fear and assume you're being smart and addressing their worst fear.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.160]   Exactly.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.160]   It's happening like the techno panic over this is just getting weary.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.160]   It's happening in media like crazy.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.160]   That's why somebody like Nick, who's smart about technology, understands technology,
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.160]   covers technology, and I said, Nick, you've got a responsibility as a journalist too.
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:45.160]   If under media pressure people panic too much because he was getting this idea when we
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.160]   talked about somebody taking a picture in public.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.160]   And I said, yeah, Nick, that's public.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:52.160]   You don't want to restrict that definition as a journalist.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.160]   You never should want that.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.160]   Because otherwise when you catch the mayor going into the Opie of Enden, or I should
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:00.160]   say, given Toronto's news recently, the crack den.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.160]   And they don't know, I had an expectation of privacy in the public.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.160]   You can't take my picture.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.160]   You don't want that.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.160]   You want public to mean public, and it's okay.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.160]   Even a public restroom?
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.160]   No.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.160]   That's for me to the norms.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.160]   Give me anyone who wants to take pictures of junk in men's rooms.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.160]   There are people who do that.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.160]   Well, okay.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.160]   But you know, glass is hardly a therapist's place.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.160]   It's not exactly a therapist.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160]   Okay, glass.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.160]   Take a picture of his junk.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.160]   It isn't exactly secret.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.160]   No.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.160]   But yeah, I saw that XKCD and immediately thought of you, Jeff, because it seemed like the techno
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:41.160]   panic is still down to one very convenient cartoon that you can use from now.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.160]   Really is.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:47.160]   I want to spray you on a hand it out every time somebody comes up with a new panic.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:53.160]   And we've seen that happen, especially with, say, Street View, because, you know, Street View is incredibly useful.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:57.160]   Now that we've had it for a few years, people realize how helpful it is.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:03.160]   But, you know, when Street View is not available in some countries, people, all they had to go by was what they were reading.
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:10.160]   And so if there was a, you know, something that was a little too, you know, strident or techno panicky, where people were writing,
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:19.160]   and up, and people hadn't actually had a chance to experience it yet, then they got more stressed and more worried about it than they really needed to be.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:27.160]   I mean, I think there's a larger discussion about the glass itself and how useful it is and all of that stuff.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.160]   But I mean, I'm not too worried about the price.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.160]   Well, Nick told me a story.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:35.160]   I won't use the names because it was a private conversation.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:41.160]   Here I am, you know, ruining probably the anecdote in the story, but there was one entrepreneur who ran into another entrepreneur,
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:48.160]   two entrepreneurs walking a bar, one's wearing glass, and they started having a conversation, and the one said to the other,
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:52.160]   I'm not having this conversation with you with class on, and the other one said, "I'm not taking it off."
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.160]   It's like a conversation.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:56.160]   I said, "Okay. That was a negotiation of norms.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.160]   That's the way it turned out."
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.160]   And it worked out perfectly.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.160]   Everybody's happy.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.160]   It is kind of a consensual thing.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:12.160]   You know, we got a pair, but I let Jason, as you know, I let Jason have him because he's got a baby and it's perfect for him.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.160]   He's going to take the last of you.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.160]   Mad have you worn them much?
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:22.160]   I have gotten a chance to try them out a little bit talking about, you know, people with babies who have them.
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:28.160]   It's really funny because there was an internal post by someone who, her grandfather, I think, turned 100.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.160]   And so she put them on her grandfather to record.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.160]   That's great.
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:40.160]   Wow. It's actually, you know, I'm like a little kind of jaded technology guy, but you get to see the first person perspective.
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:47.160]   All the people gathered around to say they love them, and then they, you know, sing Happy Birthday, and then he blows out the candles.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.160]   He blows them all out.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.160]   And it's, so yeah, we do have to figure out the norms.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.160]   Absolutely.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.160]   But there's a lot of interesting potential there as well.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:59.160]   I like what Trey Radcliffe's doing and others with the virtual photo walks.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.160]   I think that's really cool.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:05.160]   You don't need glass to do this, but they did it at the photo walk on Tuesday.
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:09.160]   It actually wasn't, it wasn't Trey.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.160]   It was somebody else was wearing the glasses.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:18.160]   And there were people at home in a hangout who were in this hangout online and watching as they walked around and did the photo walker.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.160]   People who couldn't, for one reason or another, move around or couldn't get out of the house.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:24.160]   And I just think that that's a remarkable use for this.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:30.160]   The person I always want to plug when we talk about this is a woman named Emmonica on Google Plus who was, who was a real great debt as an artist.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.160]   She has trouble moving around.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:39.160]   And so a lot of these first photo walks were done with Cluji phones attached to cameras so she could direct them.
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:42.160]   And now you can take people on tours anywhere.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.160]   It's really neat.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.160]   So I think there's some real uses for it.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.160]   But I mean, I'm not going to wear them.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:52.160]   It's, I find it a little headache inducing and distracting.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:55.160]   But I could see driving maybe if they allow us to.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:58.160]   It'll be very useful for nav for walking around.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.160]   There's certain, there's certain uses to it.
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.160]   I mean, I love Google now.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.160]   And I think as a Google now delivery device, it's pretty darn good.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:10.160]   Well, and also if you go to the Google voice search now, you get, I think you get a sense of how glass is going to operate.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.160]   Yes.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.160]   Yes.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:18.160]   Well, and I was talking to a journalist at Google I/O who basically said it reminded him of the Apple One.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.160]   You know, like, okay, yes.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.160]   That's what Scobel said as well.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.160]   But you could imagine how it would go.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.160]   Look at that.
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.160]   Okay.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.160]   I'm really glad that's public because I was hoping that it wasn't really anything secret.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:33.160]   And if you skip to about, I don't know, halfway through, you can see where he blows out the candles.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.160]   But it's like you can tell.
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:39.160]   You can see who the, you know, you can sense the family.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.160]   Which this is, and that's what Scobel said.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.160]   Scobel said I have the same thing.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.160]   Go ahead.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.160]   We'll listen.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.160]   Anything you want to say?
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.160]   It's your birthday.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.160]   What's it?
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.160]   Well, first make a wish.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.160]   First make a wish.
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.160]   First make a wish.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.160]   I'm glad you can't make a wish.
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.160]   Should it be a silent wish?
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:03.160]   It's pretty cool to think that somebody was born in 1913.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.160]   Wait, wait.
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.160]   Whoop.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:08.160]   He's wearing on his head.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.160]   The computer, which is.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.160]   That's great.
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:14.160]   Recording video of his hundreds birthday.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.160]   Happy birthday to the people.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.160]   And then posting it globally.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.160]   Might not have had electricity.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.160]   Might not have had.
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.160]   1913.
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.160]   You know.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.160]   I mean, this is, didn't have planes.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:30.160]   You know, probably didn't have air conditioning.
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:36.160]   Somebody said that, um, that history begins with the digital camera.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.160]   That's when real history is going to be, is beginning.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:45.160]   You know, speaking of the, of the, you know, so I've got my 30 day challenge with my Chromebook
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.160]   Pixel and you talked about digital beginning.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:52.160]   Like this month I've actually paid a lot of attention to trying to, I've digitized my
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:57.160]   photos.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:00.160]   I used a scan cafe.
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.160]   You know, I've digitized all my DVDs.
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.160]   And for the first time I had them just on my bookcase and I started to upload them all to, you know, Google Drive and another service or two just for backups.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:11.160]   And so, and I even went through and I scanned, Goodreads has an Android app that lets you scan all the ISBN numbers on your books.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:14.160]   So you can upload all the titles of all the books you have in your library.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.160]   So I've got 1200 books in our house.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.160]   Oh, what a good idea.
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:25.160]   And then once you've done that, Goodreads lets you export that as a CSV and then you can import that into Google Play and then you can have a library and you can slice and dice.
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:35.160]   So for the first time, all these things that were analog between books and pictures and DVDs, I'm finally kind of making all of that digital and that's sort of helpful.
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:46.160]   I forgot to mention, and we've had Gina been here, I would have mentioned this, but Tumblr, David carp credits, actually Marco credited Gina Trapani with the explosive growth of Tumblr because it's a great thing.
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:48.160]   And I think that's a great idea.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:57.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:14.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:27.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.160]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.160]   Have you been auto awesome, Leo?
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.160]   Oh, I'm loving auto-wossoming.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.160]   We're talking about Google+'s photo stuff.
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.160]   The automatic GIF creation.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:49.160]   By the way, that's why everybody's talking about GIFs, I think.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:53.160]   The automatic GIF creation in Google+ is so awesome.
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:58.160]   If I look at my photos here, I actually --
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.160]   I think I knew that this would do this.
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:04.160]   I took a picture of my dryer drying clothes.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:09.160]   It generated an automatic GIF.
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:12.160]   It's not the most interesting GIF ever.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.160]   It's awesome automatically.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.160]   But it did it automatically.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:21.160]   On the rundown is a collection of the auto-wossum tag on Google+.
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.160]   Oh, all right.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.160]   Let me go find that.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.160]   That's really cool.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:32.160]   So auto-wossoming is doing enhancement too, right?
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.160]   Or is it just the GIF we're talking about?
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:36.160]   It's also enhancement, I think.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.160]   But I --
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.160]   There's a bunch of GIFs.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:44.160]   A lot of the times you're taking multiple pictures of people.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.160]   And so you might have five pictures that are almost identical,
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:51.160]   and it'll cycle through those, and then you get a GIF for free.
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.160]   So I've been intentionally taking multiple pictures.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.160]   If you use the burst mode on your camera, it'll do that automatically too.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.160]   It's GIF.
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.160]   Or GIF.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.160]   It stands for graphics interchange format.
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.160]   Good, good, good, good graphics interchange format.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:17.160]   So also if I post this on Google+, will it use the hashtag auto-wossum automatically?
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.160]   Or do I --
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:20.160]   I don't think it will auto-woss.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.160]   I have to --
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.160]   Because it does some auto-hashtagging, right?
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.160]   It does.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.160]   So it tries to -- whatever you talk about, it tries to do very smart.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:30.160]   Oh, he's actually talking about, you know, the sports team or something like that.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:34.160]   But I guess his auto-wossum, you'd need to label that explicitly.
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.160]   Let me do that, because I want to join the auto-wossum,
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.160]   even though that's the most boring.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.160]   It is.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.160]   You go way down the floor.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:46.160]   There's a happy couple like the wedding company.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.160]   Are they kissing?
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.160]   That's cool.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.160]   That one right there, yeah.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.160]   That one's okay.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:55.160]   On the bright side, now that people know this, they can start to make really easy animated GIFs,
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.160]   which it used to be kind of a pass-hold before.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.160]   Right.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:02.160]   And I don't think I've ever made one, and I accidentally made one from some duplicate photos
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.160]   yesterday.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:07.160]   I also find them evil and horrible, and so it corrupts our world.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:13.160]   Well, I admit, when Google+ came out and it was obvious that animated GIFs were going to be a big part of it,
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:15.160]   I had some concerns.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:21.160]   One of our professors here at CUNY, John Spock, is doing a small kind of course in how to do it.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:25.160]   And I've made ruthless fun of him for ruining journalism.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:30.160]   And the net as we know it.
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.160]   Auto Awesome is awesome.
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.160]   Now how's it doing that?
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:38.160]   So these were taken so closely together.
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:43.160]   This was, he mentions in his side, apparently if you take enough photos that look similar enough,
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.160]   Google+ will automatically combine them.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.160]   That's really cool.
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.160]   This is one guy with somebody different coming in and out.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.160]   Right.
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.160]   We should explain for the audio listeners.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.160]   So it looks like this may be like the father of the bride or something like that.
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:57.160]   Maybe a professor with his students or something like that.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.160]   Very cool.
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.160]   I think people are going to get creative with this.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.160]   Oh, yes.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.160]   We haven't scratched the surface at all.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.160]   Oh, yes.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.160]   Oh, yes.
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.160]   There's definitely, we have to figure out what the parameters are.
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:12.160]   Like when it will do it, how much has to be the same.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.160]   Clear?
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:19.160]   I mean, that's an eye opener because the dad stays the same, but the other guys, he's taking a picture with her similar.
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:23.160]   So we're getting some idea that it doesn't have to be 100% the same.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:26.160]   Well, and then it can be one more in time.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:34.160]   I think it might have to do with the timestamp because this is, there's a very different in this where it looks like this was sort of.
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.160]   So it is just time.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.160]   Right.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:39.160]   Because that's something exploding.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:40.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:47.160]   If auto upload notes, the timestamp's on when it's uploading, then it knows, oh, these are five taking in a short window or something like that.
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:50.160]   Well, I've been using burst mode, but I guess maybe I'll start to play.
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.160]   Yeah, let's play with it.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.160]   Let's see what'll happen with auto awesome.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:59.160]   And I just, in the new edit tools and everything, well, I don't know if it's going to replace Lightroom.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:05.160]   I do agree with the tagline at Google I/O that the, what was it, the data center is your new life room.
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.160]   It's not too far out.
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.160]   Not too far out.
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:16.160]   Well, the other thing that happened is Trey talked about glass and said that his taking of photos has increased just exponentially.
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.160]   And only Trey could ever, one of them could be beautiful.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.160]   Well, he can HDR glass, which is amazing.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:30.160]   Should we, do we have the cat beards?
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.160]   I don't know how that got in here.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.160]   I threw it in there.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.160]   It was just one of those.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:36.160]   I just couldn't resist.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:41.160]   And then do we want to play a Matt's philosopher philosophy?
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:48.160]   Cat Beards is a photo meme where people place a cat in front of their face to make a free beard.
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.160]   The cat has to be looking up.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.160]   Oh, that works pretty well.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.160]   Mm-hmm.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.160]   There's a cat beard.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.160]   I like it.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.160]   I need a cat.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.160]   Oh my God.
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:58.160]   This is hysterical.
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.160]   This girl?
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.160]   The internet is just amazing.
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:04.160]   Bless the internet.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.160]   Who would have thought that?
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:08.160]   You have cats, right?
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.160]   Wow.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.160]   Oh my goodness.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.160]   I have to try this right now.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:14.160]   I need to get me a cat.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:17.160]   That's, that guy's looks like Santa Claus, but it's the cat's nose.
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.160]   Actually, it's a girl.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:24.160]   And it's the cat's nose and it looks like a beard.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.160]   Some of them, someone's great.
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.160]   That would really work.
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:31.160]   Some of them really work.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.160]   What a world.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.160]   What would we have done without the internet?
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:37.160]   You doubted me, Oleo, or president of the internet.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:43.160]   I want you to run over to Vin Surf's office, show him that and say, "Thank you, Mr. Surf."
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:47.160]   Without you, there would be no cat beards.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:51.160]   Next time I see him, I'm sure he'll be like, "What are you talking about?
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.160]   Oh, van, van, van, van."
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:56.160]   Vin's been wearing glass for two weeks, I was talking about it.
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.160]   Has he?
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.160]   Oh.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:02.160]   Yeah, it just shows you these old guys, they could pick up these trends like that.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:07.120]   We're going to take a break, come back with a tool, a tip, a number, whatever, a
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.120]   number, whatever you got.
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:12.120]   Matt's got some recommendations.
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.120]   Oh, and you get, should we play the philosopher?
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:16.120]   I've been looking for it.
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.120]   Is it on your web, web masters?
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:19.120]   No, it's not.
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:23.120]   I'm not sure which philosophy video we were talking about.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.120]   Oh, is this not a new one, Matt?
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:26.120]   I thought it was a new one.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:28.120]   It was your philosophy of search.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.120]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:31.120]   Lauren, why do you find that?
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.120]   I tweeted it, or plus it.
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.120]   Is it this?
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.120]   Oh, interesting.
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.120]   Okay.
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.120]   Is that new or is that old?
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.120]   Look at him.
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.120]   That's pretty new.
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.120]   It's like 12.
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:43.120]   Oh, okay.
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.120]   But it's a little long, I'm not sure.
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:47.120]   Well, we'll just point people to it.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.120]   How about that?
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.120]   All right.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.120]   All right.
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.120]   Did you study philosophy in college?
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.120]   No.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.120]   Well, I did some humanity stuff.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.120]   Humanities.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.120]   That didn't really count.
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.120]   Weren't exactly a philosopher.
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.120]   Wow.
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:05.120]   Our show today brought to you by 99designs.com.
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:11.120]   It's a marketplace where designers get together with people who need something good looking.
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:16.120]   And it worked really well for us when we did our Twitch t-shirt design.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:21.120]   We asked designers at 99designs to come up with some t-shirt designs.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.120]   And they did.
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:24.120]   Then we had a vote and then we sold a bunch of them.
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.120]   And it's just really great.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:29.120]   We're actually working with them right now for app design.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.120]   It connects you with great graphic designers to create fast, affordable designs.

[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:57.120]   And a very affordable logo design started 299 bucks.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:08.120]   Web design 599 bucks. Digital marketing collateral like landing pages, Facebook cover design, banner ads, info graphics starts at $199.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.120]   This is different.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.120]   These are different typefaces.
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:17.120]   And this, and then you get to work back and forth with the designer to refine the design and pick one, then pay for it.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:22.120]   Apparel design $199, mobile app design $599.

[01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:01.120]   It's 99designs is on a mission to make the world better looking.
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.120]   99designs.com/twig.
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:06.120]   You know, it's kind of thing I need because I have ideas.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:09.120]   I can maybe even program, but I am not a designer.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.120]   I cannot make it look good.
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.120]   And nowadays you gots to.
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.120]   That's a big, big part of it.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:20.120]   99designs.com/twig to get that free $99 power pack.
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:24.120]   Let's see here.
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:30.120]   I had some interesting stuff to talk about, but maybe should we start?
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.120]   Normally we'd start with Gina's tips, so Matt, do you want to give us a tip?
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.120]   I've got a tip.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:41.120]   With Google I/O, people were paying a lot of attention to developers and the future of search, you know,
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:47.120]   answering questions, conversational, anticipating questions with things like Google now.
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:51.120]   But it's also safe to assume that we continue to work on core search quality.
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:55.120]   So my tip is just to check out Google's Webmaster videos.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:21:00.120]   If you search for Webmaster videos, we have a channel that's gotten something like 12 million views.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:07.120]   So recently, for example, we put out a video about what to expect for SEOs and web developers over the coming summer.
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.120]   And it's actually going to be a pretty busy summer.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.120]   It'll be pretty eventful.
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:15.120]   So for example, the rest of the world doesn't, you know, pay much attention to this stuff,
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:21.120]   but if you're an SEO, a search engine optimizer, we've got an algorithm called Penguin.
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:25.120]   And we're releasing the next generation of Penguin in the next few hours.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:30.120]   So after I get off this program, we're going to go back and we'll start to press the red button.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:34.120]   And it's going to have a pretty big impact on Web spam, for example.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:39.120]   So if you want to keep up on the latest updates, you can search for Webmaster blog or Webmaster videos.
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:42.120]   And we'll always be posting updates on those.
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:46.120]   So it's 2.0. It's a leap, eh?
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:50.120]   It is a leap. It's a brand new generation of algorithms.
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:55.120]   The previous iteration of Penguin would essentially only look at the home page of a site.
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:58.120]   The newer generation of Penguin goes much deeper.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:02.120]   It has a really big impact in certain small areas.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:08.120]   So I think something like 2.3% of English queries will be affected to the degree that a regular user might notice.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:12.120]   So look for that to come out in the next few hours.
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:16.120]   Yeah, and on the screen you see Google Webmaster Central.
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:23.120]   So if you go to google.com/webmasters, that is, if we put a manual spam action on your site,
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:26.120]   that is where you'll get a notice, for example.
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:31.120]   So Penguin is an algorithm, but if we manually say, "Oh, you were cloaking or selling links that pass page rank"
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.120]   or something like that, you'll get a message to find it.
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.120]   Watch out to Borac!
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.120]   Yes.
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.120]   Joaquin John, Joaquin.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:45.120]   No, he wouldn't do that.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:49.120]   You're number of the week, Mr. J.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:52.120]   Well, I thought this one, a whole bunch of fives.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:56.120]   Google put up Google.com/trans/topcharts
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:00.120]   is, I think, a monthly compilation of top searches.
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:04.120]   And we see this stuff all the time, we see it in various lists.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:10.120]   But there's some funny ones here that just make no sense, like car companies, cars, chemicals, chemical elements.
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:15.120]   Gold is the most searched chemical element followed by silver, iron, carbon, and aluminum.
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.120]   And then Bitcoin.
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.120]   Right.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:24.120]   So just a silly little thing for Martini is the number one sign up for cocktail followed by Bloody Mary,
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:27.120]   Mitt Jewell at Manhattan and my tie.
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.120]   This reminds me of Zeitgeist.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.120]   Exactly.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.120]   But it's kind of a monthly new Zeitgeist.
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:35.120]   Dogs pit bulls, number one, which scares me.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:38.120]   Bulldog, Labrador Retriever, German Shepherd, Siberian Husky.
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.120]   That's neat.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.120]   Oh, this is...
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.120]   I saw Trey's invitation to Zeitgeist.
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:45.120]   It looks like a giant mouse trap game.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.120]   Did you see that, Matt?
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:49.120]   Oh, a little bit.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.120]   Yeah, Zeitgeist has come and went.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.120]   When is it?
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.120]   Oh, you know what I think.
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:56.120]   Zeitgeist is through the sales department, so I never get an invite.
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:59.120]   Do you get not get invited to Zeitgeist?
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.120]   I've never been to a single Zeitgeist.
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.120]   And you know, it's a sales thing.
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:06.120]   It's like a thought conference for people who work with sales.
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.120]   And so that's fine.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:08.120]   That's appropriate.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:09.120]   It's not fine.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.120]   No, it's not fine.
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.120]   You want to go?
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:12.120]   I think, Jeff.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:15.120]   I write a suck up, kiss, ask Google book.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:16.120]   I never get invited.
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.120]   I'm all this fuck-ass shit.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.120]   No, you should go.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.120]   Kiss up.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.120]   I'm sure...
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.120]   Okay, watch this.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.120]   I don't get invited.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.120]   Watch this.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:25.120]   I'm sure Steven Levy got invited.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.120]   Oh!
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:27.120]   Oh!
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.120]   Oh!
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:29.120]   Oh!
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.120]   That was me.
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:32.120]   Oh, man!
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.120]   Oh!
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:37.120]   You know, I love Zeitgeist the page, and we can all get to see that.
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:40.120]   But I think Zeitgeist is more like a sales event, right?
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:43.120]   It is, but they do new things there.
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.120]   Yeah.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.120]   Well, the invitation is super cool.
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:49.120]   They do invite a, you know, a blogger or a journalist or two.
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.120]   No, they do a lot of neat stuff.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.120]   It's just it comes out of the sales side.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.120]   But yeah, Jeff, I agree.
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.120]   They should...
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.120]   If I ran the world, if I ran Google, I'd be going to Zeitgeist.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.120]   But you will soon go myself.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.120]   So let me see if I can find Trace.
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:06.120]   I can see you, Matt, as an evil bond character.
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:10.120]   Be nice to Matt, or he's going to release all the spam again.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:15.120]   Trace said he couldn't take it with him because he's going off to China.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:17.120]   I think he did get his visa, by the way.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.120]   But this was the invitation that he received.
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:23.120]   So he said he wants to give it away to one of his followers.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:26.120]   So if you live in San Francisco, send him a note.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:30.120]   He's going to pick randomly and then left it at his hotel this morning when he left.
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:32.120]   That's pretty good.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.120]   It's like Mouse Trap.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.120]   I think that's cool.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.120]   I don't know what it is.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:36.120]   I like it.
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:38.120]   Where is it being held this time?
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:41.120]   Don, doesn't say here.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.120]   Do you know Matt?
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.120]   No, I don't know.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:46.120]   Well, we're not invited, so it doesn't really matter.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.120]   Does it, Jeff?
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.120]   No, we certainly are not.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.120]   We don't.
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.120]   You and I, we should get together and have a pizza.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:53.120]   We're on the need not to know this.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.120]   No.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:57.120]   Well, we'll learn whether any sales side folks listen to this weekend.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:58.120]   Yes, we'll find that, won't we?
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.120]   That's the test.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.120]   And they'll say how much money does Jarvis give us?
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:03.120]   Nothing.
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:04.120]   So that's it.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:05.120]   Nothing.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.120]   Nothing.
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:09.640]   You'd have to come under the thought leader category, which, you know, there's a significant
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.120]   number of people who do that.
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:14.120]   Hey, I bought my Pixel.
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:17.120]   You spent real money for it.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.120]   Now you have to.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:22.120]   I wanted, I wanted to, to have a t-shirt that affected, and I owe.
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.120]   I already got one.
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:24.120]   Thanks.
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.120]   Something like that.
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.120]   You can keep it.
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.120]   Keep it.
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.120]   I don't want it.
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.120]   Same like that.
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:30.120]   Same for mine.
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:31.120]   What are you going to do with the second one?
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:33.120]   You're just going to have to like, want to work on it home?
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.120]   That's what you should do.
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.120]   Because it's all in the cloud, right?
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:38.120]   That's one of the beauties of the Pixel.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:40.120]   Having more than one Pixel is not a burden.
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:41.120]   No, true.
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.120]   No.
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:46.120]   My tool actually, we already talked about it, but I wanted to make sure it got in early
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.280]   as the new Twitter's two-step authentication.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.760]   You must turn it on.
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:53.600]   And actually, might as well point out that you can download Google Authenticator on Android
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:55.640]   or iOS for free.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:59.160]   It's a great way to keep track of those second factor authentication.
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:02.120]   Twitter doesn't use it yet, but will soon, I'm sure.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:05.840]   And Matt and I were talking about this, and he endorsed this.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:11.560]   Very frequently, the secret, you add an account to Google Authenticator by taking a scan of
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.760]   a QR code, which gives you your secret number.
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.640]   It's a very quick, easy way.
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:19.920]   But what I would suggest is when you get that QR code, whether it's from Google or Microsoft
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:23.720]   or LastPass or whatever, you save it and put it in LastPass.
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:28.080]   I keep it in my LastPass vault where it's completely secure and you want to secure it because that's
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:31.080]   all people would need to duplicate your second factor authentication.
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:33.680]   By doing so, I can add, as Matt said, multiple phones.
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:37.440]   And since I always have a new Android phone, it's important for me to have that QR code
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.440]   ready.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:42.800]   But boy, I love it because it literally takes me a minute to add all three authentications
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.800]   to Google Authenticator.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:46.640]   I hope everybody starts using this time-based authentication.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.480]   It's a really great technique, and I hope Twitter does too.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:50.480]   Meanwhile, turn it on.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:55.360]   You need a cell phone on your Twitter account, and you'll get a text message with the six-digit
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:58.160]   number that gives you the second factor.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.760]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:00.760]   Matt, it's so great to have you.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:01.760]   What a great feeling.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.760]   Yeah, it's great to have you back.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.320]   It's been way, way, way too long.
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.280]   It's really good to have you back in the film.
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:07.280]   Always fun to be on Twig.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.760]   I'm really glad that it worked out where I could stay with my Pixel.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.000]   I didn't have to root it and install a Skype.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:17.840]   Yeah, we should point out that this is the first All-G Talk episode.
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:22.200]   If I could put Ubuntu on my Pixel U-code.
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.000]   That's true.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.040]   Well, I just have to say, Matt, Geek props to you for putting the crew on on.
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.040]   It's pretty impressive.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.040]   It's pretty impressive.
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.040]   It's really impressive.
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:34.480]   Yeah, and did it all by himself.
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:36.640]   Amazing fellow.
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.040]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:45.320]   Matt Cutz, who is in charge of fighting and rooting out evil in the Google search results.
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:49.440]   Thanks to Jeff Jarvis, he blogs at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:53.200]   By the way, everybody should look at Matt's Webmaster videos.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.200]   They're just fantastic.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:57.640]   If you have a website, it's such a useful tool.
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:02.440]   People always are calling the radio show saying, "Well, I've got this deal with S&SEO company
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:04.320]   and they're going to tell me how to raise my Google ranking."
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.880]   I said, "You don't need that.
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:06.880]   Just watch Matt."
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:09.840]   He'll tell you everything you need to know free.
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:10.840]   It's free.
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:11.840]   They're very generous.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:12.840]   Webmaster tools.
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:13.840]   There's a little bit of a...
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:14.840]   Find it.
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:15.840]   Watch it.
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:16.840]   Learn.
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:22.560]   We do this show every Wednesday, right after security now, 1PM Pacific, 4PM Eastern time,
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.920]   2000 UTC on Twitch.tv.
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:25.920]   Please watch live.
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:26.920]   We love it if you do.
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:30.160]   But if you can't on-demand audio and video is always available after the fact and forever
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:32.720]   more, they will be always available.
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:36.840]   Hundreds of years from now, people will be watching this very show.
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:40.520]   And remember when people had to wear glass instead of just plugging it into the base
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.520]   of their skull?
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:45.920]   Those were the days.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:52.120]   And that's at twit.tv/twig or wherever finer podcasts are aggregated and delivered to you.
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.920]   Thank you for joining me now.
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:55.920]   Let's wrap it up.
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:56.920]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:57.920]   We'll see you next time on Twitch.
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:00.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:04.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:06.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.460]   you
