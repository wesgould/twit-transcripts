[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   This week in Google, the show where we talk about Google,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Facebook, Twitter, the cloud, the 49ers, anything like that,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   anything in that sphere of influence.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Joining us right now, of course, as always, Gina Trapani
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   from SmarterWare.org.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   One of those things is not like the other.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   (laughing)
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Very good.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   You caught that.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Great to be here.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Good to have you.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   As always.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   She's, right now, she's Googling Super Bowl.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   You was playing?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Is that one word or two?
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   No, I know it's super.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I just didn't know who was playing.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   I needed to know what cities.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   So now that I know it's San Francisco.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Yeah, that's why I care.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Otherwise, I probably wouldn't be so excited.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I would watch it on TV.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Right.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   But I would be so excited.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Also, with us, Mr. Jeff Jarvis,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   are you a Jets or a Giants fan, Jeffrey?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   My son is a Jets fan.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   There we go.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I'm a Jets fan.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Next, the Sad Fate.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Next year, when the Niners go to the Super Bowl again,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   it will be in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Yes.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Yes.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Which, here, I'm thinking, that ain't the Meadowlands.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   That must be the Jets stadium.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   That's the Meadowlands.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Same thing.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   That is the Meadowlands.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Same stadium.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yeah, it's one stadium.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I knew the Meadowlands was in East Rutherford.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I moved to New Jersey.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I didn't know it was East Rutherford.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Yes.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   They should just say, "Metallands."
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   The New York Giants is the friggin' New Jersey Giants
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   and the New Jersey Jets.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Yo.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   The New Jersey--
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   The place where Jimmy Hoffa sleeps is what I call it.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Yes.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Jeff is the author of "Public Parts,"
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   a wonderful book about living in public,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   "What Would Google Do?"
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   and blogs@buzzmachine.com,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   but is also best known as the man who went to Davos.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   He's back.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I'm back.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   We'll talk back.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I have a sexy voice because I have a cold,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   a little scratchy.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Some high-falutin' germs.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Very high-falutin' germs.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I'm figuring it was a Nobel Prize winner.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   We're Chancellor Merkel.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   You could have the Chancellor Merkel cough.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   His guy, I won't say what it was,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   but he leaned toward me so I could hear him at the Sean Parker party
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   and the spritz occurred.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Oh!
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   No.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Actually, you knew when it occurred.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   That moment I said doomed.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Come on, who was it?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It was at the scene in "Big Bang Theory" where you could see the green
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   kind of like plowed and blue.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Did you pull a Sheldon?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Just like, "Ah-ha!"
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   There's nothing I could do.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   It was too late.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   It was there.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Who was it?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   We have to sing "South Kitty."
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   That's it.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   You're not supposed to talk about it.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It seems to me, because I think, well, I can't say a name,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   but it was on path, you know, which is supposed to be private.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And the person who said it said "path only" and then talked
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   about the party and wasn't this supposed to be the Davos of austerity
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   and nobody was supposed to have parties in that Sean Parker has a
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   multi-million dollar blowout party?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   With a flying in famous DJ from London who was suddenly forgetting
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   and John Legend and taxidermy galore like a 13-foot bear.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   That's creepy.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Mooses with laser eyes.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I saw the picture of the laser eye moose.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And I got one on my Google+ feed of me with the...
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Ah, laser eye.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And amazing wines, incredible wines.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And they were...
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Nosh's from Jean-George von DÃ¼richten, the invasion of New York Chef.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   No, it's quiet.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And here's the kicker.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Here's the whole thing.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   It was called a party for philanthropy.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Oh.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   You got to spend money to give money.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   No.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Or something.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Yeah, it was a...
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Davos was trying to tamp down the party.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Did they say that...
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Did they say that there weren't any big parties?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Well, Yahoo!
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Marissa took over Google's spot.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Google's party was canceled.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   The Excel wine party, which was amazing.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   The rear was canceled.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And some other things.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   But then, yeah, Sean Parker outdid himself with his co-host, Mark Benioff,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   and Ian Osborne from London.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   He can afford it.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   He's worth over $2 billion I saw.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   So he's doing all right.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Hey, let's welcome...
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Joining us now, Matt Cutz of Google.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Back from the real world.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Spamfighter.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   You know, Matt, I just want to say that when Kevin Mitnick, the famed hacker,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   who was Served Time in Jail 4 Hacking, and then was on probation
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   and not allowed to use the internet for some years,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   when he came back off of that internet drought, he did it live on the screensavers.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And you're following in his footsteps in only that one respect, I might add.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And it wasn't such a long drought.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   I committed it or anything like that.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   No, it was a week off.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   You took a week off the internet.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Yeah, I took a week off the internet, and in fact, this entire month of January,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I haven't done any news, no social media, no Twitter.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   So I feel like a caveman who's, you know, sort of emerging,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   and he's like, by the side of the interstate, and he's like very confused.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   There's a lot of noise in actual...
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   It's very distracting.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   So my monobrow is sort of scrunched like, "What's happening?"
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   You know?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Matt, were you awesome work?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   How do you work at Google and not do the internet for a week at the same time?
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   So I did take a one-week vacation at the beginning.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   And I love to read, so I just took like 10 books with, you know,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   and what you read from home.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   John dies at the end, which is, you know, your classic tale of spoiler alert,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   horror comedy like Buffy, and the guy did his own stuff, and he got a post-gen deal,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   and he got like a major motion picture with Paul Giamatti, so Moonwalkin' with Einstein,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   just a whole bunch of different stuff.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   So you only read novels with people's names in them?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Pretty much.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Actually, that's about right.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   It's a new music.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   So how was it?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Was it fun?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Was it great?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Were you glad to get back?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Were you kind of not happy about getting back?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   You know, it's kind of interesting how there's a lot of tempests in a teapot
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   where if you're not there, somehow they magically kind of blow over on their own.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And so I'm dreading a little bit coming back and people saying,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   "Oh, I can't believe this horrible thing has happened."
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And you're like, "Well, that's the 17th time that's happened."
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   So that's not a huge surprise.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   But it is kind of wild.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Like, you don't make as much time for taking care of business.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And so I've like worked down most of my email.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   I've taken care of most of my tasks around the house.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   So I feel like my attention span has doubled.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   You're making all the rest of us look bad, Matt.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Stop it.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   It's going to be fun to see what I've missed, though.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I'm kind of curious.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Who was to tell them about Google being sold, huh?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   So Rupert Murdoch bought Google.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Oh, I knew Mission Impossible was the problem that we did.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Matt, the dark, dirty secret is that you missed nothing.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Like, I've taken time off the internet before and I felt that worry that I was missing something big.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And, you know, unless it's like Sandy or 9/11 or something, you know, really huge.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   You really just don't miss stuff.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   You know, you just don't miss much.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Well, and even when there was, you know, some stuff that was actual news in my sphere,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   people would email me.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   So I'd find out about it either way.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   So it's a good chance to sort of pick a step back and say,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   "How much do we really need to be consuming the news?"
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And with that, let's consume some news.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   What do you say?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   You know, I certainly, I don't, I used to watch the news kind of compulsively on TV.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   And boy, that was just, that's a cesspool.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   And it is true that if you stop watching it when you go back, you go, "Wow, this is awful.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   This is, they do nothing but report, you know, they search the world for the worst possible stories to..."
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And there's no actual utility to it.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Because my favorite thing about TV news is standing in front of the place where nothing's happening.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Nothing's happened for the last 12 hours.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   But I'm standing here to act like I'm where things are happening.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   But nothing's behind me.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   But I'm just here wasting a lot of money standing here so I can make video.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   The ones that frustrated me the most are the sort of human interest stories that are reported as if they're actually news.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Like, you know, if one person, you know, the Casey Anthony type stuff,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   it's like a large fraction of the news when you get back.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   And it's like, this is, this is not really going to affect anybody else's life unless you want to wallow in it.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   So...
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   I haven't...
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Let me try this out on you.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   I have a new theory about the paradox of news.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   All right.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Get your no-dose out, folks.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   [laughter]
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   That information that has an impact on your life that is really useful for you or your community,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   in a sense is the most valuable, but it's also the most easily commodified.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Because it's just information.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Everything else is entertainment, right?
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   The New York Times special thing about avalanches.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   I don't go to avalanches.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   I don't ski.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   It has no effect on my life.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   You want to read it?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   You really don't.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   You don't.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Right?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Columns and opinions.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   It's all entertainment.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   And that maybe if it's really, really good, like a movie, maybe you could actually charge for it.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   But the highest value is in the thing that you...
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   that will become modified immediately.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And it's interesting.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I allowed myself to look at like, what?
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   You know, these are things that are actually directly really useful for you.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   And what was interesting is even trying to go off the internet,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   I keep a lot of stuff in the cloud.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I had to struggle with whether that was, you know, on the internet or not.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Yes, it's on the internet.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   What's the struggle?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Well, I keep my to-do list.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   I used to keep it on a...
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Sorry.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   My pocket.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   You don't get it anymore.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   It's a good buy to-do list.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   So that's a little strange.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   But I do agree, Jeff, like there's so many things we can't really affect.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And so worrying about them or struggling with them doesn't really matter.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   There's a very sliver, fine sliver of stuff where you actually can make a difference.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   That's maybe worth paying attention to.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And it's pretty local.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   It's like right here.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   You probably don't need the internet to use it to look at it.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Or about your company or something.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   This is part of your 30 days, your 30 days thing, right?
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Something new every 30 days.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   That's right.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   What's next?
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Next month is gluten free.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Oh, no wheats.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   I'll be, you know, at the end of the month, I'll be like, give me bread or...
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   No, you won't.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   You won't.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   It's easy to give up gluten.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Cool.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   It doesn't even say, that's why they call it gluten.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Because it doesn't even sound appealing.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   It's like glue.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Oh yeah, I can give up glue.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   No glue for a month.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   I know, if I give up bread though, bread.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Oh, bread.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   That's different.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I'm not giving up bread.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   So I go to pizza places now.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   They have gluten free pizza.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   I don't know what the hell it is.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   I've got a whole store near me that's almost all gluten free stuff.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   I could eat a little gluten.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   I don't need that.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Eat all...
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I think that it really is wheat, but they don't want to say it, right?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Because that would be like gluten I can give up.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   But this is lent, right?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   You can give up something like really good for lent.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   My wife, I've been alternating.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   So like an exercise one and a diet one and an exercise one and then a nutrition one.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   So this is, it's a nutrition month.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   We're actually doing February because it's a short month.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   If we really love bread, then we can get back to it more quickly.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Yeah, well, I noticed you didn't do 30 days minus the internet.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   That's a long, especially since it's your job.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Yeah, that would be hard.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   That's a lot.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   I'm dreading the month when Matt gives up fighting spam.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   You know, the nice thing is other people, the people on my team do a much better job than
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   I would do at this point on fighting the spam.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   That's a bad sign.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   You've worked your way out of a job.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   You're supposed to do that.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   But I always thought that seemed like a counterproductive.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Me thinks Matt is very humble.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Yes, he is a very humble guy.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Good engineers need a good leader.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Google plus now number two after Facebook.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   As Victor and I each said at the same time, that's a lot of ghosts.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Yeah, he really vicks said that.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Yeah, he did.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Because that's kind of acknowledging something we've all thought, which is, well, yeah, if you make everybody
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.800]   or encourage everybody who gets a Gmail account to make a Google plus account, then they're
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.600]   technically Google plus users.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.640]   But are they really using it?
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.000]   Number two social network, better than Twitter.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.880]   What's your current attitude toward Google plus Leo?
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.000]   You know, I keep trying to use it.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.360]   And it's just, you know, it's nothing wrong with it.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.680]   It's wonderful.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.560]   It's just it's it's it's.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.200]   You forget about it.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   You forget about it.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   Communities.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.200]   I thought, hey, this is great.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   This is going to turn it around.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   And I just never get over there.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.000]   But you don't forget about Twitter.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.600]   No, and you don't forget about it.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.440]   And then Twitter comes up with this thing called Vine.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.520]   And that's kind of, you know, there's something missing and I can't figure it out what it
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.800]   is because it's possible to create a new social network like Vine and be very compelling.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.800]   And you really want to use it.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.760]   Now I doubt I'll use it after a few weeks, but you really want to use it.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.120]   Google plus it just doesn't.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.120]   What's wrong?
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.120]   I don't understand.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.120]   What is wrong?
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.440]   Matt, you don't have you can recuse yourself because you couldn't say there's something
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.720]   wrong with it.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.680]   You know, I have to say one of the very first things that I hit after my my fast of internet
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.920]   was over was Google plus.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.240]   But it was also internal Google plus.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.400]   There are versions of that's different.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   So that's different.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.400]   It's within your company.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   Right.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.480]   But to me, and I actually follow a lot of people within Google and it turns out that makes
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.640]   it a really fascinating conversation.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.480]   And it's incredibly interesting to me.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.920]   And so I think part of the challenge is finding the right people.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.920]   Absolutely.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.800]   These years finding the right people to follow on Twitter or coordinating who to contact
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.400]   with or get together with on Facebook.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.280]   And so making that an easier thing to do is always going to be difficult.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.520]   But if you can find the right people, I think you really can get a hotbed of interesting
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:16.520]   stuff going on because I've seen people talking about Tesla inside of Google and it's incredibly
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.520]   interesting.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:22.160]   And it makes me want to borrow somebody's Tesla and try it out and swap notes and all
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.160]   those sorts of things.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.400]   It must just be me because to me, it's kind of like the mildly interesting magazine you
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:32.240]   get at a dentist's office that's better than just stirring into space.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.240]   But not much.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:38.080]   I say I baited you so you can get in trouble Leo.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:43.640]   But I mean, I'm being honest and it's just and I and maybe am sure it's just me.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.880]   But that's kind of how it feels like.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.840]   Yeah, that's mildly interesting.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.480]   It's not that engaging.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.480]   And then I quickly move on to something else.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.560]   Am I the only one who feels that way?
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.520]   No, but it doesn't have the addictive hook for me either.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.520]   I have to say.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.840]   It's not missing and I don't know what it is.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.840]   I go back to it.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.240]   I mean, it's a very efficient way to get the attention of Googlers, which is very handy
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.240]   to me.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:10.760]   You know, there's I mean, there are a lot of Googlers like that are very active on it.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.440]   And you know, this is what we do.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.280]   So I like being there for that.
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.240]   There's a lot of really great tech folks.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.720]   But yeah, I have to remember I have to kind of force myself to remember to go there.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.840]   And it's just that addictive kind of hook.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.920]   It used to be my start page and it isn't anymore.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.920]   Tech meme is.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.920]   Yeah, OK.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.960]   This is this way you have a start page and your browser still don't you?
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.960]   I don't.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.800]   I just I have a couple of you open a blank page.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.000]   That's worse than the dentist's office.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.240]   Yeah, I have a couple of pin tabs and then yeah, I have a blank I have a blank page.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.240]   I don't know.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.760]   I I I by the way, I am not rooting against Google plus I am rooting for it.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.320]   I love I think it should be it's you know, I always thought threaded discussions would
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.160]   be the best.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.320]   I just I wanted to succeed.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.040]   I think there should be I don't like how Twitter runs its business.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.320]   I've always been critical of that Facebook.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.280]   Oh my God, it's a nightmare.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.840]   Google has you know, Google plus should be wonderful and I just don't it's not compelling
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.840]   to me.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:13.300]   I think one one thing you have to consider and let me let me try this out on you and
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.160]   see whether you buy it is you know, Facebook's been around for nine years.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.160]   Been around for quite a while.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.400]   If you look at how far Google plus has come in roughly a year and a half, it's it's pretty
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.160]   good amount of velocity.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.880]   And so if we can get the people on there where they're interested, it's kind of funny.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.360]   I was exercising with somebody recently and they sort of mentioned out of the blue that
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.960]   they really liked the Google plus app on the iPhone and it you know, that it was really
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.440]   richly compelling and you know, very nice and a good experience.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440]   It is gorgeous.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.180]   So to feel like, you know, as Google keeps working on trying to make sure that Google
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:52.080]   plus is completely integrated into Google, then over time, hopefully there is more value
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:58.320]   at there and people find it more addictive and enjoyable and they just find it more compelling.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.880]   So I think if you if you compare against people that have been around for a very long time,
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.540]   yeah, that's always tricky because they've got a pretty far lead.
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.760]   But if you look at how far Google plus has come in in, you know, 18 months or something
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.960]   like that, it's pretty good by that yardstick.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:17.180]   Well, certainly, but then the article that we're referring to that says is the number
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.260]   two social network.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.220]   You can't have it both ways at the number two social network or is it just this youthful
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.260]   thing that's just trying and starting and isn't yet great.
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:32.180]   That's what I mean is that yeah, it's number two in raw numbers, but but that's mostly because
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.980]   of Google strategy to incorporate into every damn thing Google does.
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.220]   And so separate there.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.220]   That's it.
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.380]   That's it was interesting to me that YouTube is separate in that in that.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:46.160]   So I'm interrupting you which which would make me think, oh, is this any clarification
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.000]   on that number is the Google plus number across all the products or is that people going
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.520]   to plus dot Google dot com and interacting there.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.960]   You know, it's kind of fuzzy, right?
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.400]   And the one nice thing about Facebook being kind of a wall garden, it's very clear you're
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.440]   either on Facebook or you're not, you know, you're liking from someone else.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:05.240]   I mean, the other thing about that chart too is Facebook is by far number one, like far
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.080]   and away number one, like double double Google plus at number two and then everything else
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.880]   kind of trails off your points.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.660]   Well taken you add Google plus in YouTube.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.180]   It's close to Facebook size.
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.180]   Right.
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.180]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.860]   If you look at Google for years and years and years, we didn't even want to know who
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.980]   you were right in any way, shape or form.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:23.980]   You come to us.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.020]   We give you search results, maybe some ads.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.180]   You click on either one.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.180]   You're happy.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.180]   We're happy.
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.180]   Life is good.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.220]   And so I think Google was actually very slow to sort of wake up that if we know a little
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.980]   bit about you, if you're willing to tell us a little bit about where you are, what you're
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.300]   interested in, we can return better search results.
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.040]   We can find more interesting content for you.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.520]   So it's kind of interesting.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.420]   It's like all these independent groups came up with their own silos of like a version
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.420]   of identity.
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:51.520]   And only now are we getting around to kind of getting that unified, which is a lot of
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.520]   good.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.720]   I've been working with this thing with media companies that they only saw us as a mass.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.680]   And the only way they're going to succeed is by learning from that lesson and treating
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.080]   us as individuals, which means you know about us so you can feed us relevance.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.520]   Google's goal is to give you relevance.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.000]   The only way it can is if it knows you as a person.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.340]   I also, I'm just, I'm suffering from from total speaking of not remembering to go there.
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.500]   I'm just suffering from serious social network.
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:22.540]   Yeah, like I just, it's like Twitter and Tumblr and Facebook and Google Ploths and path and
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.540]   Quora and like so many of these are really good.
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.860]   You know, Quora, I love I could spend, I could spend two hours in Quora every day just reading
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.780]   answers and questions.
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.780]   But I forget to go there.
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:37.240]   And I wind up just going to the thing that sort of popped up in my face at the time, which
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.840]   I don't, I don't like reacting that way.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.360]   I don't like to, I like to be more mindful about where I spend my time and what I do.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.600]   But it's just, it's so hard to figure out.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.140]   And it just turns out to be the thing that's like the easiest, you know, that I get the
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.800]   most amount of value with the least amount of effort.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.280]   And so far that's been, that's been basically Twitter for me.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.960]   But I, you know, but I hate that too, because there are a lot of things about Twitter I
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.960]   don't like.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.120]   So it's, it's, it's hard.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.740]   I just, I just feel like so many things are competing for our attention at all times.
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.980]   And there's so many great communities out there that sometimes I just feel like, Oh,
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.140]   I'm going to take a week off the internet.
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.460]   I think that's really it.
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.860]   And I think if anything, maybe the, the only thing that Google plus did wrong is it came
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.660]   to it came late.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:19.060]   If it had, you know, I mean, I would have loved to have seen it best Twitter and Facebook,
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.460]   because it is more, I feel more open and more friendly.
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.460]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.780]   Although I still want to write API.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.380]   Now, didn't we hear a rumor?
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.760]   I heard somebody say, Oh no, there's a right API.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.300]   It's coming any minute now.
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.300]   Did we not hear that?
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:39.880]   I don't know if we heard that at maybe I keep thinking like next Google IO, there's going
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.240]   to be a huge API announcement, but I thought that last year and it didn't, didn't quite
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.240]   happen.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.180]   So I understand Google's reluctance because what you don't want to be is just a place
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.960]   where people port their tweets.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.960]   Right.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.960]   Right.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.960]   And we saw that with buzz.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.960]   Yes.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.240]   That's, you don't want to just have it get polluted.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.240]   So yeah.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.320]   That happens to almost everywhere.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:03.060]   So I completely understand that, but it does mean that you can't have a client.
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.400]   You know, you have to use the Google client.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:11.500]   I mean, just there's, you know, that's how Twitter built its passionate fan base with
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.520]   third party clients.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.600]   So and then they killed him, of course.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.480]   But that's another story for another day.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:24.100]   I think the reason we maybe Gina in it like Twitter is it's supposed, the way it's turned
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.580]   out to be is a signaling engine for everything else.
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.540]   So by looking at my tweet stream or flip board, which is essentially looking at my
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:35.780]   tweet stream, I see all it's aggregating.
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.220]   It's an aggregator.
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.860]   And so it's not just now, I guess in theory, so is Google plus, but even when I go to the
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.660]   explore button on Google plus, you know, people might say, well, you just following
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.780]   the wrong people Leo.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.300]   So I go to explore, which is the hot stuff on Google plus.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:53.740]   I even find that just kind of mildly interesting.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.260]   But nothing that I would just say, well, that tells to have too much power is helping for
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.260]   my taste.
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:03.100]   Well, maybe I need to make my own explore feed.
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.540]   Here's a pure white gold Mercedes Benz fascinating.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.220]   There's friction in the posting, right?
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.740]   Like to do really good Google plus post.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.260]   You want to have a giant image.
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:15.020]   You want to have a video, you know, that the app looks great because it's kind of multimedia
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.260]   focused.
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.900]   You want to put in the little bolding, you want to have a link.
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.060]   I always feel bad about sharing something without saying something about it, but on
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.700]   Twitter, you can just retweet without doing that.
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.700]   So there's a little bit of friction with that.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.180]   And you don't use it to say this happened and that happened.
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.180]   You don't live blog there, you know, the world.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:35.020]   By the way, Matt, there's a strange thing that happens not to put you in the spam bucket
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.020]   here.
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.020]   That's cool.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:42.460]   Learning from Elgin that big pictures work and I put a big picture up and then a lot
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:48.140]   of times suddenly a one post, which was a really sad post about a girl suicide, a picture
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:54.140]   of Amanda Palmer there and I had 350 spam comments, mostly from some fake Asian names
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.460]   saying, wow, hip, good picture.
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.900]   What's the benefit they get out of doing that?
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:01.900]   That's what I don't understand.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.900]   I'm not going to logic of it.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:04.900]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.540]   And it's a slightly different team, but I'll give you my best guess, which is, you know,
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.500]   they're trying to look real because if they can build up some signals where they look real
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.620]   over time, then maybe when they finally do their big payload and they drop a biagra link
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.060]   or something, then the algorithms might be a little more reluctant because they're like,
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.940]   oh, well, you know, this guy has commented 50 times and nobody's, you know, claimed
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:23.940]   that it's spam.
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:27.620]   But a lot of the times people are just trying to build up some reputation that they'll then
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.980]   abuse later.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:30.980]   Thank you.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:31.980]   That makes sense.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.220]   I've been waiting for somebody to explain this to me because it seems like a zero.
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.620]   There's no benefit at all.
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.620]   All right.
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:41.660]   It doesn't work that well, I would guess, right, because don't, doesn't everybody go
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.820]   through those posts and go spam, spam, spam, spam, spam.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:45.820]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.900]   In some ways it could have a counterproductive effect.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.660]   It's identifying you.
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:54.300]   Well, and if you're really smart as a spammer, you might do some tests posts, you know, and
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:58.700]   you might figure out the people who don't mark things as spam and then comment on those.
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.660]   So, you know, it's always an arms race where whatever we do, they try to figure out how
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.660]   to get around it.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:04.660]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.660]   What, what a fun job you have.
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:07.660]   It is fun.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.660]   I do enjoy it.
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:09.660]   All right.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.660]   Let's talk.
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:11.660]   We're going to take a break.
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:12.660]   Come back.
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.060]   What about Blackberry?
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.060]   Not Rym, by the way.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.060]   They don't call them.
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.420]   They don't call themselves Rym anymore.
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:28.260]   Mostly because people just felt it was weird to say, I want to get a job at Rym.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.380]   I'm glad somebody got that.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.300]   But now, now they're.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.140]   Show title.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.900]   But now that was a Rym shot, by the way.
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:41.140]   But now they're calling it Blackberry.
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.620]   And we'll look at it and actually I want one, but maybe you can talk me that.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:45.620]   You want everything.
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:46.620]   I want everything.
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.340]   So maybe you can talk me down.
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.500]   I'll tell you what I would love to have.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.300]   I would love it that I would never have to go to the post office again.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.300]   Well, I don't.
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.300]   Hey, wow.
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.300]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.460]   Thanks to Stamps.com.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:03.620]   Stamps.com is like the pro tip for people who do a lot of mailing.
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.200]   You don't need a postage meter.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.200]   You don't need special ink.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.020]   You certainly don't need to go to the post office.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.020]   Everything you could do at the post office.
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:14.380]   You could do from your desk, print your own US postage with your printer, your computer.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.620]   You got it all at Stamps.com.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.820]   And yes, the rates are going up at Stamps.com handles that automatically.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:24.260]   In fact, with that great scale, you never pay a penny more in postage than you have to.
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.020]   You plop that letter of package on the scale.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.020]   It's a USB scale.
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.300]   Tell Stamps.com.
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.740]   You then print out the postage if it's a package or you can even put right on the envelope
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:37.060]   if you're just sending out invoices or mailers or whatever.
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.980]   If you do a lot of that, boy, it's fantastic.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.740]   Prints not just the address, which it can get from your address book, from QuickBooks,
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:47.380]   from the website you're using, but it also prints your return address, prints your company,
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.940]   logo if you want, and it prints the stamps.
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.580]   I mean, it is a total solution.
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.180]   Click Print and Mail.
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.580]   And the best part is even if it's a giant package, the mail carrier comes to you, picks
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.580]   it up.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.580]   You don't have to get up from your desk.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:02.460]   You can even schedule free pickups.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.460]   You get discounts.
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.660]   You can't get at the post office.
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.580]   It prints out the forms for international mailing.
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:13.100]   If you're an eBay Amazon PayPal, Etsy seller, you can use Stamps.com and it will automatically
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:18.820]   take the recipient data, the mailing information from the website and put it right in there.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.580]   So it just saves you a lot of time.
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.060]   You use Express Mailer Priority Mail.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:27.180]   Not only do you save, you also will get automatic emails to the recipient with tracking numbers
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.180]   and all of that.
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.180]   So here's the deal.
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:32.260]   Go to-- if you want to try this and you really auto if you're a small business, if you do
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.580]   mailing it, you know, if you do maybe more than five or ten letters a day, actually if
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.100]   you do more than a few letters a day, it's probably worth it.
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.260]   Go to Stamps.com.
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.420]   Click the radio microphone.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.300]   Certainly worth it to the trial offer.
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:50.900]   And enter our offer code TWIG, TWIG, and you'll get $110 bonus value including more postage,
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.820]   $55 in free postage.

[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.580]   You also get a free digital scale.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:58.580]   It's really pretty.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.820]   $5 supply kit, four week trial.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.500]   All you have to do is go to Stamps.com.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.300]   Click the microphone, use the offer code TWIG.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.180]   If you've heard me talk about it before and you've been putting it off, don't put it
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.180]   off any longer.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.420]   I've tried them all.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:12.420]   This is the one.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.060]   I've been a Stamps.com member for ten years.
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.500]   Stamps.com.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:23.140]   So we actually-- Tech News today got up early.
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:30.020]   Got up early and did a special edition, 7 AM R-time covering the BlackBerry announcement.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.220]   BB10, the new operating system.
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.420]   Looks very sweet.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.460]   Did Gina have you looked at this at all?
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.740]   No.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:40.740]   This is the problem.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.540]   I don't know.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.140]   This is the problem nobody else has.
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.620]   Wall Street, tanked rim stock by 12%.
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:54.940]   So maybe even Wall Street isn't excited about this.
[00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:59.660]   Really the problem is it won't be available in the US till mid-March.
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.220]   It's already late, delayed.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:07.020]   And frankly, there's Android, there's iPhone.
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.580]   I mean, even Windows Phone has a lead.
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.340]   It's got to be tough.
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:15.540]   I make fun of all my Canadian friends for holding on dearly to the BlackBerrys.
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.980]   Even an active patriotism.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:21.420]   I have to say this is a pretty modern operating system.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.420]   It's a real time.
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.420]   It's fast.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.740]   It's got some nice features, some nice redesigned features.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.740]   There's two models.
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:33.180]   The Z10, which is a keyboardless version of the BlackBerry.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:37.740]   And then the BB10, which has a keyboard.
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.740]   OK.
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:43.740]   Just can't get anybody interested in this.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.740]   We talked a little bit about this on all about Android last night about.
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:52.740]   There's a new number that 92% of smartphones shipped maybe last quarter was either iOS or
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.740]   Android.
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:59.180]   And I've confirmed what I was feeling is that as long as my interest is concerned at least,
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.580]   it's still a two horse race.
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.540]   4.2 inch screen.
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.300]   That's kind of tiny.
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.300]   Yep.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.460]   1280 by 768 though.
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.540]   It's a good resolution.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:14.940]   That's more pixel density than an Aretina iPhone 356 pixels per inch.
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.500]   Dual core 1.5 gigahertz processor well.
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:23.700]   Gee, Dual core seems a little, not too many given that we're about to see the Galaxy S4
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.020]   with eight cores.
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.180]   Two gigs of RAM though.
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:30.660]   That's good 16 gigs of storage and micro SD card slots so you can expand it.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.860]   It's really got beautiful multitasking.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:38.460]   70,000 applications, although that number is a little deceiving because a lot of them
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.180]   reported applications.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.700]   They were paying literally paying developers to port their stuff over.
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.540]   Does it run Chrome?
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.540]   I think that's the litmus test.
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:49.540]   Right.
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.540]   I want to use.
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.540]   Well, it has Angry Birds.
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.540]   It has Skype.
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:59.420]   No, it goes from.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.020]   Audio Angry Birds.
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:02.580]   Did I say Angry Birds?
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.260]   It's got Kindle.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.260]   No Chrome.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.260]   No Chrome.
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.260]   Google Maps probably.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.260]   No.
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.940]   You know, that's actually that's a what does it have for now?
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.180]   I don't know.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.180]   It has Bing.
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.180]   Sorry.
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:22.500]   I think it didn't mean to hurt you.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:28.020]   That was the funny moment at I went to a Facebook thing this week yesterday to show off graph
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:32.820]   search and they had all these media people was an entire table of they went around to
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:33.820]   introduce themselves.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.820]   Hi, I'm social media from NBC.
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.580]   Maybe see from yes from all social media people big table.
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.420]   So anyway, they show and then they show web search and it comes up with Bing and the whole
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.060]   room kind of quietly chortled as once.
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.300]   Oh my God.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.620]   You know, Devorak went for this was years ago.
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:53.500]   Devorak would ask people what search engine you use and if you said Alta Vista or Yahoo,
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:54.500]   he'd know you weren't a geek.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.380]   If you said Google, he'd go, you know, but this was like when Google was first starting
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:03.060]   out, but it Google has been the litmus test for 10 years.
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.060]   It still is.
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.060]   Yeah.
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.860]   If you say it out to Vista today, people would really laugh.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.620]   Well, I'm a mental block.
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.300]   What was the one that came out of Berkeley?
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.300]   Ask.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.300]   No, Berkeley.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.300]   Ink to me.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.300]   Ink to me.
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.300]   That was that.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.300]   Yeah.
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.300]   I think you thought it was in Tommy.
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.140]   I don't think it might be.
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.140]   Yeah.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.340]   No one knows and no one cares.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.820]   There's people that it's gone.
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.540]   They got bought by Yahoo.
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.540]   I think Yahoo.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:30.540]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.580]   Oh, well, we know what happens then.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.820]   And then of course Yahoo no longer does search.
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.620]   So in fact, somewhere there's a machine with the Ink to me code sitting on it.
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.100]   It's not turned on.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.100]   Fourth.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.100]   That's it.
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.100]   Goodbye.
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.900]   It's purple somewhere.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.900]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:46.900]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.500]   What happens to old search code?
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.500]   What?
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.500]   What?
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.500]   No, Yahoo bought.
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.100]   Overture, all the web, all to Vista and broadcasting.com.
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:33:00.940]   And Ink told me it's like all the other search engines Yahoo caught up, you know, sucked
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.300]   together and then they decided, oh, we're just going to turn the search code off and
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.300]   use Microsoft.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:11.420]   And so I kind of wish they would like, you know, open that code up or, you know, kind
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.980]   of increase the diversity a little bit because you're just running along and then suddenly
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.940]   for the people you're running with all landed on the same team.
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:21.940]   Do you think when Marissa went to, you know, first started her job, her first day, she
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.980]   goes and they say, here's the keys to the executive washroom.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.060]   You know, here's, here's your office key.
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.420]   And here this is the key to the closet where we've stored all the old search technologies.
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.580]   It's in there.
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.620]   And I would like open the door and look.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:37.620]   Yeah.
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.420]   I would be unzipping that.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.420]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.420]   For sure.
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.420]   Give me the tarball.
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.420]   Yeah.
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.180]   Open source it.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.180]   Do something.
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.180]   Let's see.
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.180]   What repository?
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.180]   CVS most likely.
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.180]   Yeah.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.180]   CVS.
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.180]   Yeah.
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.180]   Yeah.
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.180]   Probably to, to all forget.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.180]   Oh God.
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.180]   Yeah.
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.180]   And in some version, it was just a gleam in Linus's eye.
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.180]   It's true.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:04.300]   I think Linus was just a gleam in his father's eye.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.180]   We're talking a long time ago, internet time.
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.660]   Um, so all right.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:11.500]   So there's literally no excitement whatsoever for Blackberry.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.500]   I tried.
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.500]   I did folks.
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.500]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.500]   I tried.
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:16.500]   I tried to gin up some excitement.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.340]   I wish it well.
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.340]   Okay.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.340]   Here's another exciting thing.
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.340]   Microsoft offices here.
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.340]   Wow.
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:24.340]   You're just.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.980]   You're a barrel of laughs.
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:30.300]   I don't want to sit next to you at the football game.
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.980]   You know, I, I'm an older person.
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.700]   And I remember when these were important products.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:37.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.980]   Like three years ago.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.540]   What happened?
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:44.500]   This is so funny how this stuff changes.
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:48.380]   Microsoft had a big tent in Bryant Park in New York.
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:52.860]   I wonder over, but then why?
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:57.900]   Office is still alive and well in corporate environments.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.340]   I'm paying for it.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.340]   Big organization.
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:01.340]   I bought it.
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.860]   It's a hundred bucks a year and you can install it in five computers.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:08.540]   Microsoft won't be happy to hear the three of them are Mac and Tasha's, but they count.
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.260]   And it does cloudy things, doesn't it?
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:13.260]   Oh, by default, it saves the sky drive.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.020]   Microsoft's cloud solution by default.
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:19.380]   So if you're not paying, paying attention, you're not saving your documents, your hard
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.820]   drive at all.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.220]   Oh, isn't that interesting?
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.220]   Yeah, it is.
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.620]   Interesting.
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:29.820]   The power of defaults on a Microsoft platform.
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:30.820]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.620]   Well, more so than anywhere else, right?
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.620]   Yeah.
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:34.620]   Yeah.
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.660]   So how many people still use the Internet Explorer start page?
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:38.660]   Everybody.
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:39.660]   Eric Schmidt.
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:46.020]   Well, Leo, yeah, we need to get back some life back in the show up for those two topics.
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.020]   Would you?
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.180]   Jeff, please, Jeff, I know you're sick.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:52.540]   I know you're dying, but you got more cheerful and chipperness than I do.
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:53.540]   Give us some.
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.140]   Well, you were about to go this.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.140]   Eric Schmidt, Eric Schmidt, futurist.
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.140]   Now, here's the problem.
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.300]   This is going to depress you too.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.300]   Oh, no.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:07.140]   Oh, yes, because the future is cyber terrorists targeted by drone strikes.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.700]   Online identities taken hostage and held for ransom.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.100]   Parents explaining online privacy to their kids before sex.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.100]   Oh, gosh.
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:20.500]   I'm trying to imagine sitting at it down.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.820]   Virtual is my favorite one.
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.540]   Virtual kidnappings.
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.980]   Ransoming your ID for real money.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:27.980]   I am.
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:33.460]   Rather than keeping captives in the jungle, groups like FARC may prefer a virtual hostage.
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:37.820]   That's how important online ID is somebody needs to goose Eric.
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.780]   By the way, when he says FARC, it's FARC.
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:48.380]   They're a Colombian rebel group, not the FARC report out of FARC.com.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.300]   I was like the goons.
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:57.900]   I can see a host of renegade FARCers doing that.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:58.900]   There's another one.
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:02.900]   Terrorists and criminals could use drones to carry improvised explosive devices that
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.460]   could result in conflict between civil and military drones.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.260]   Well, over the US-Mexico border.
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:13.620]   Isn't that what Eric, I mean, Daniel Suarez wrote about in.
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.140]   Yeah, kill decision.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.140]   Kill decision.
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.180]   It was all about privatizing the drones.
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:23.300]   So that brought a lot of happiness to the show.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:28.460]   So he was speaking to a student group at Cambridge University.
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:34.460]   The first of a number of speeches get ready.
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.820]   I don't think he's going to be invited back.
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:40.220]   That was really great, Eric.
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.980]   And I think it was so good you could stop right there.
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:49.620]   We don't need any more of your uplifting futurism.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:53.980]   I talked to many people and it's easy to have a dystopian vision of the future.
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.740]   It always has been.
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.180]   Look at George Orwell and so forth.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:02.300]   This is odd for Eric because Eric is usually, of course, technology is good and leading
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.300]   to good things.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.100]   But maybe it was the trip to North Korea just made him defra-
[00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.100]   He said that.
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:12.860]   Kind of said, you know, after coming back from North Korea, I guess it was kind of bleak.
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:17.260]   A five billion people not connected to the internet.
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:18.820]   Not in all of North Korea.
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:19.820]   Five billion?
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:25.580]   But at the same time, it feels like, yes, it's true that you can see a lot of this happening
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:26.580]   already.
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.820]   There's all kinds of reports of people getting their identity hijacked online and offline
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.980]   and all that sort of stuff.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:35.020]   But for me, this represents some opportunity.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:39.740]   If you can be the company or the entity that helps people protect their identities, then
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:43.700]   that's a huge way that you can protect people going forward and then you can unlock all
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.420]   kinds of interesting things.
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:49.380]   I just realized my passport's about to expire in August.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:54.660]   So I'm filling out a paper form with a picture of me and doing all this sort of stuff.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:59.580]   In theory, if you could do a better job of that, then life could be more seamless and
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:00.580]   more interesting.
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:05.340]   And part of it, when I do work with around the Postal Service and all that, part of the
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:10.820]   thought about the Postal Service, is identity could be a huge, important job for them.
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.860]   That's depressing.
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.460]   That's uplifting.
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.100]   Oh, good.
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:22.340]   Okay, well, let's flip it over then, Leo.
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.140]   Suppose we know who you are.
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:29.940]   You can walk up to your Tesla or whatever and the door automatically pops out, right?
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:33.820]   And it already knows who you are and it already has all the preferences you like.
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:37.260]   You walk up to your computer, it unlocks, it knows who you are.
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.580]   It's maybe doing fingerprint or it's looking at your eye doing a retiniscan and all this
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:42.860]   sort of stuff becomes seamless.
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:46.860]   And now you don't have to carry around all this junk in your pocket.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.860]   You can get better stuff.
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:51.620]   You walk up to anybody else's computer and you can get the programs you're used to using.
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.220]   So there are positive aspects to this.
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:59.980]   And I think it's probably the case that you think about things like climate change, the
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:05.540]   fact that there are, what is it, three automobiles per person that are unused or whatever that
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:09.180]   is.
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:13.460]   The way humans are, you have to have a crisis before we acknowledge it and say, okay, let's
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.460]   fix it.
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:15.460]   Right.
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:16.460]   We have autonomous vehicles, perfect.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.460]   I mean, we know how to do it.
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:18.980]   The technology exists.
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.580]   It's clear the benefit.
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.220]   You know, private ownership of automobiles is really wasteful.
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:29.340]   It's really dumb, but it's not going to happen until there's a crisis, right?
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:30.340]   Or maybe am I wrong?
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.660]   It just feels like that's how humans work.
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.820]   We have to live in crisis mode.
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:40.300]   I want to go hang myself now.
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.660]   I am not helping.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.660]   Am I?
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:45.140]   But no, I'm trying to turn this into a positive.
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:50.500]   I do, you know, because for every bad thing that's coming, like, you know, drone warfare,
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:55.980]   there's amazing medical breakthroughs, you know, breakthroughs in the understanding of
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.540]   how the brain works, technology breakthroughs.
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.980]   They're still wonderful amazing.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:00.980]   It's just choice.
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.980]   That's what the society is making choices.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:07.100]   We're figuring this right in a session at Davos on norms.
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:10.260]   And we're just negotiating our norms and figuring out, given the choices we have, how
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:11.580]   we should operate together.
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.700]   What societies do?
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:17.740]   But who makes that choice and when do they make it?
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.940]   We all make it together.
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:19.940]   We negotiate.
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.940]   Right?
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:25.380]   I mean, how do you negotiate that we in America all walk on the right side of the sidewalk?
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.380]   Right.
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.780]   Unless there's a Brit coming down the sidewalk.
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.980]   It's funny because somebody did that a long time ago, I guess.
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:31.980]   Yeah, right.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:40.380]   You know, I was doing my usual camera 1890s Kodak or Stik in Davos.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:45.060]   And somebody said he saw, you know, if he saw somebody in a park taking a picture of
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:49.460]   his kid, he'd, you know, smash norm is you don't do that.
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.460]   Really?
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:51.460]   What?
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.460]   Really?
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.700]   You don't take a picture of your kid in the park?
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.060]   No, somebody else's kid.
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:58.140]   You don't take a picture of somebody else's kid in the.
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.140]   Yeah.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.140]   No wonder the world's depressing.
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.340]   Is that really true?
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.300]   Is it is not, is not okay to take a picture of somebody else's kid?
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:11.020]   Aren't there laws about you can't even be at a playground in some cities unless you're
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:12.020]   with a child?
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.220]   Like, like, just an adult kind of on your own?
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.500]   You mean not, you don't even have to be a sex offender.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.220]   Do you like, does anybody?
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:22.460]   I think just that I know I'm not allowed there, but anybody.
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.740]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.740]   That was a joke bad joke.
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.740]   Sorry.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:30.980]   It was funny when I visited China, a lot of people wanted to do I was with, I was with
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:35.820]   a group of Americans who had some of them had children, some of the children were visiting
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.540]   the orphanages from where they were adopted.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:41.940]   But the, the Chinese wanted to take pictures of the kids and the, and the Americans I was
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:44.140]   with were kind of uncomfortable with that.
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:48.180]   And so at one point, right, I heard one sort of explaining while, you know, in the US,
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:52.260]   you ask permission or that's not something, you know, you don't take pictures of other
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:56.020]   people's kids because, and the Chinese person was kind of like, why?
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.020]   Really?
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.020]   Why?
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.020]   What is wrong with you?
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.260]   Are you, you know, sometimes bad things happen.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.020]   They're like, no, that doesn't happen here.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.180]   Terrorists one, the terrorists one.
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:07.180]   This is, this is proof positive.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.780]   The terrorists one.
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:13.180]   So I put a picture of myself and my Android hat up on Google Play and somebody came in
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:17.820]   and said, um, from China said, in China, if a man wears a green hat, it means his wife
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:18.820]   is cheating on him.
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.820]   Oh, oh, yeah.
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.420]   And somebody does this voluntarily.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.420]   How about a green headband?
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:30.220]   Is that, is that why, wait a minute, tell me the truth.
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:31.220]   Does that make any sense?
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.620]   So like your wife's cheating on you.
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.020]   So you say, I know what I'll do.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.820]   I'll wear a green hat.
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:36.820]   I know.
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.980]   Is that cheating on you with a newer Android phone?
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:49.380]   I'm using a note too.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.220]   She secretly ordered the Nexus four, which is now.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.380]   Oh, did you do it?
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:54.380]   Did you do it?
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.380]   Ah, I did.
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:56.380]   I didn't do it.
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:57.380]   I'm trying to be really responsible.
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:58.380]   I got a kid now, Jeff, come on.
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:43:59.380]   Last year's model.
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.380]   I'm trying to, I'm trying to get out to Nexus.
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:02.380]   It's good enough.
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:05.780]   I'm trying to, I know I egg you on, which is doing.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.780]   Which one are we trying to get her to buy?
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:08.780]   Well, I'm next.
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:09.780]   She was to be.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:10.780]   Now you can get the Nexus four and now it's back.
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:12.180]   Only 300 bucks and it's beautiful.
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.980]   I played with one yesterday.
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:14.980]   Really is nice.
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:15.980]   It is nice.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:19.180]   But you know, and by the way, it was Gina who said, no, no, Jeff.
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.180]   Go ahead.
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:21.180]   Open up the box.
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.180]   Go ahead.
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:24.180]   She's a push a man.
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.380]   But why do you have two, Jeff?
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:26.380]   Ruth is.
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:27.380]   Oh, I see.
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.380]   There's two different.
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.380]   You're right.
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.380]   It's not was the fact you couldn't tell the difference.
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:31.380]   It's not that different.
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.380]   Right.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.380]   It's nice phone.
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.380]   But no, you can probably wait for the next.
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.380]   It's that wireless charger thing with the daydream.
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.740]   I mean, I know I've got daydream on the wireless charger.
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:41.980]   They'll really kind of tempted me.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:46.540]   But yeah, I think I'm going to try and just I'm going to try and wait kind of get try
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:47.540]   to be restrained here.
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.940]   But man, it is a nice looking phone.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:50.940]   It is nice.
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:51.940]   It feels good too.
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.820]   Once I figure it out, taking off the plastic or on the edges, it really feels good.
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.820]   As.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:56.820]   Yeah.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.580]   I've never been Nexus except for the 10 and the four I've had every Nexus.
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:02.180]   So I've kind of I feel bad about like breaking my Nexus streak.
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:04.980]   Although I'm not as interested in the 10, but definitely the four.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:08.220]   I think I think it's the host of all about Android.
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:09.940]   You actually have to get it.
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:13.100]   I know this is a dangerous road to go down.
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:14.820]   I think you do.
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:18.980]   If I have so many Android head tansets around the house that my wife is just like, okay,
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:21.180]   no, really, what what is going on?
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.180]   I'm like, I have to test.
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.420]   I've been developed.
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:24.660]   She's not in the tech industry.
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.660]   Is she?
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.100]   She's not a big fan of the extra cosy.
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:32.020]   You know, every device has a charger and the cords and the case and the thing, you know,
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.100]   that everything has kind of extra craft.
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:39.060]   I actually I actually have a large piece of furniture in my house that's designed to
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.420]   hold things that are charging.
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.420]   It's a shelf shelf.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:43.420]   It was built.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:44.420]   It was built.
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:45.420]   It was built.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.420]   A room with that.
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:50.420]   Yeah, this was purpose built by the wood whisperer Mark Spagnolo for me.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:51.940]   It's beautiful wood.
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:52.940]   It's this big.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:56.900]   It holds like 12 phones all with your USB cables.
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.380]   It's gorgeous.
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.620]   That sounds really nice.
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.580]   Get that and your wife will say, Oh, it's a beautiful piece of French.
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:04.580]   Right.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:05.580]   Right.
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:06.580]   Get more problems.
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:09.060]   I'm going to make a confession here.
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.500]   So we have a shelf when you come into the garage mudroom there.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.740]   There's a closet and there's a shelf that is just one long strip where we can charge
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:17.220]   everything, which I love for years.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:22.860]   Now when I wake up, I pick up my Nexus 7 or my phone so I need to charge it next to the
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:23.860]   bed.
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:24.860]   Yeah, that's kind of sad.
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:27.140]   And that means it glows, which is not good.
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:30.740]   Yeah, it's like I'm trying to cut down the glow.
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:34.660]   After you have about five or six phones at your bed, it actually brings them.
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:35.660]   It's like daytime.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:39.980]   And it's like by believing your brain while you sleep as well.
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:43.300]   I, well, when I do is I put a plate of eggs there and they're scrambled in the morning.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.300]   It's fantastic.
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.300]   They're ready to go.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.140]   A couple more phones I could fry bacon.
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:51.340]   And I'll be set.
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:52.340]   I love this guy.
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:56.380]   Stephen J. Crawley, consulting engineer.
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:59.100]   He says he's a consulting wireless engineer.
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.740]   He says Google, you know, Google, I didn't know this file and application at the FCC
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:10.860]   last week seeking permission to conduct secret testing of an experimental radio system.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:11.860]   Okay.
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:14.700]   Somebody tie down Matt cuts until he tells us what it is.
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.260]   You have a tell us Mr. Kots.
[00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:18.620]   Kots is one of those.
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:21.540]   If I say then I'll get fired.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:22.540]   Do you know?
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:24.500]   Can you say if you know?
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.820]   So yes, I do know.
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:30.060]   But the beautiful thing about working at Google is that they trust you, right?
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:34.260]   So these sort of stories come out in the Wall Street Journal and every week we have a
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:37.460]   TJIF which is actually on Thursdays now instead of Fridays.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.460]   So I don't know why they still call it.
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.460]   They're always ahead of things at Google.
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:42.460]   Yeah.
[00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:46.780]   Well, they did it so that people could dial in from around the world and not have it be,
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.780]   you know, you know, the weekend or something like that.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.500]   So that was actually the number one question.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:56.580]   And because, you know, they trust you at Google pretty well, they told a lot of people.
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:00.100]   Yeah, this is what was going on with that particular thing.
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:03.860]   So I can't actually talk about it, but I can say, hey, you know, in Google, you'll
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:05.420]   learn about all kinds of cool projects.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:06.420]   Okay.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:07.940]   So Chad, I want you to zoom in.
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:11.100]   Zoom in on Matt.
[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:13.100]   You can see the screen.
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:17.380]   Now I'm going to read some stuff, Matt.
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:19.380]   And just listen.
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:25.380]   No, no, I won't do that to you, Matt.
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:32.580]   And, you know, I'd be able to look in her glasses, which were the thick 70s coat bottle
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:37.700]   type glasses and you could read her cards right across a game or two.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:40.100]   And then I felt guilty and had to tell her about it.
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:41.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:45.460]   No fun playing D&D with somebody you can read their cards and exhibits.
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:49.900]   Now, so, so Stephen J Crowley, consulting engineer, did I mention that he's a consulting
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:57.620]   engineer in his blog post says, you see, Google requested that the application be held confidential
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:58.620]   by the FCC.
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:03.340]   In fact, even the request that it be held confidential has been redacted.
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:07.380]   So you don't, they don't even want you to know it's confidential.
[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:11.500]   So he says based on what he could see in this, they're going to test.
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:16.780]   It's going to be around the campus and Mountain View up to 50 base stations, 200 user devices,
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:20.140]   there'll be indoors and outdoors where they range each of 100 to 200 meters and 500 to
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:26.340]   1000 meters respectively, both directional and non directional within a two mile radius
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:27.340]   of the campus.
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:34.100]   So it's a dense network that is might have could be supposed to have a very high carrying
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.700]   capacity for data.
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:41.220]   The bands requested are currently allocated to the educational broadband service and the
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:49.580]   broadband radio service, which happens to be Clearwire's frequencies.
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:53.620]   Google did sell at stake in Clearwire, but remember that there was this whole thing going
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:58.340]   on where dish was trying to buy Clearwire sprint wants to reabsorb Clearwire.
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.740]   These frequencies are kind of interesting there.
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:04.020]   They might even be in play.
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:12.220]   So he supposes it could be a super dense LTE network using the Clearwire frequencies.
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:14.220]   Density affecting what?
[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:19.220]   Well, it could be TV.
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:21.700]   I don't know, could be just high.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.420]   Density gives you more bandwidth?
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.220]   Yes, yeah, no higher carrying capacity.
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:27.860]   So it's it's higher bandwidth.
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:31.500]   Very high bandwidth.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.740]   It's their first experimental radio application.
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.380]   Okay, so Matt, Matt, answer me this.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:36.380]   There's 200 devices.
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:37.380]   It's reported.
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:42.340]   Do you guy is like, do you go side up and be nice to somebody in the hopes that you
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:43.340]   want one?
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.340]   Yeah, you want one.
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:45.340]   Yeah.
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:49.820]   Well, I love working at Google because you get, you know, I was playing with something
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:54.540]   on Google apps earlier in Gmail and something new popped up and I was like, ooh, and then
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:58.300]   you have to search the string to see whether it's available to the outside world, which
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:02.900]   is why you never want to project your screen because you might have some little weird experiment.
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:07.460]   Yeah, but I do love one one real perk of having been at Google a while is when there's
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:11.100]   something neat going on like some device or something like that.
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:15.540]   I'm like, ooh, I would be a happy dog fooder and give you lots of feedback.
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:18.740]   And usually there there people have been very nice about letting me try to do that.
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.740]   Because you're the Matt cuts, of course.
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:21.740]   Yeah.
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:22.740]   Yeah.
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:26.380]   Well, they actually do open up to a dog food for a lot of different people because it helps
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:31.460]   them if they can test any sort of, you know, whether it's a new, you know, laptop or a
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:32.940]   new tablet or the dash.
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.180]   Show us your wrist.
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.340]   You have a Google watch on.
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:36.900]   He's got something on.
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:37.900]   I do not.
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:40.700]   His disguise is a Nike fuel band, but I don't buy it.
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:41.700]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:42.700]   No, it's just a Nike fuel.
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:43.700]   Wow.
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:44.700]   It's a good disguise.
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:45.700]   It's a very good disguise.
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:46.700]   Oh, it's a big deal.
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:47.700]   You've been lazy today.
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:48.700]   Get to work.
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:49.700]   What's your goal?
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:50.700]   That's just a shell.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:51.700]   Oh, just 2000.
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:52.700]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.620]   I need to keep working.
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:56.580]   I used to have, I used to have my goal of 3000.
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:57.580]   I never won.
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:58.580]   I paid my goal.
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:51:59.580]   I low it.
[00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:00.580]   Oh, look.
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:01.580]   What's your goal?
[00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:02.580]   2500.
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:04.580]   Yeah, that's what mine is to 2500.
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.500]   It seems like a good number.
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.460]   I can get that many, many days, but not all.
[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:14.540]   It's BS because the truth is I just stickulate like an Italian work.
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:15.540]   That's work.
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:19.660]   You're still the day and you're sort of doing this in place and you're not even moving your
[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:21.460]   legs and you're like, yes, fuel band.
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:22.460]   I am running.
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:25.620]   Yeah, it's a little easy.
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:26.860]   It doesn't sound like that big a story.
[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:30.660]   It sounds like you're going to test some sort of high speed data, wireless data network.
[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:31.660]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:32.660]   Well, cool.
[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.700]   Of course, there's a lot of stuff going on like this.
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:36.580]   Like we're testing these gunk projects.
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:37.580]   Yeah.
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:41.540]   So it's nothing like, you know, it's like, come on, big deal, right?
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:42.540]   I like this.
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:52.260]   Google giving is giving a grant of $1 million to fund free Raspberry Pi for school kids.
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:57.580]   I think sugary treats for school kids is a great idea.
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:01.860]   This is not the Raspberry Pi you're thinking is a micro computer, of course.
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:05.300]   15,000 UK school children are going to get Raspberry Pi.
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:09.100]   This is the kind of thing you want to promote STEM.
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:11.460]   Give people give grants to schools.
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.580]   The Raspberry Pi is 30 bucks.
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:14.580]   Yeah.
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.580]   Yeah.
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:18.900]   I think it's like half of it is for the device and the rest is for training, which is important.
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:19.900]   So good.
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:20.900]   It's you choose.
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:21.900]   That's right.
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:25.220]   You see that all the time where they dump technology in a school say, good luck.
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:26.220]   Have fun.
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.220]   You got to train them.
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.780]   You got to show the teachers how to use it.
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:29.780]   That's so great.
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:30.780]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:33.220]   It's like the, it's the pies plus support and teaching materials.
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:34.220]   Yeah.
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.220]   Yeah.
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.220]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:40.540]   People have get people really hooked on it, but my favorite is they're giving $1 million
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:44.780]   to Pi hackers and they're giving Pi million to Chrome OS.
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:48.740]   That always loves those numbers.
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:49.940]   I love it.
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:56.820]   $3.14159 million actually goes out to several more decimal places.
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:57.820]   Yes.
[00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:01.980]   It'll give you a fraction of a cent.
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:06.940]   So it sounds like the idea behind this one is, you know, Google has given money if people
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:11.860]   are able to crack, you know, at Chrome, you know, we try to make sure it's very secure,
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:14.020]   runs in a sandbox, all that sort of stuff.
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:19.580]   So they are now giving up to $3.1 million for successful attacks of Chrome OS.
[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:20.580]   Wow.
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:25.860]   And I think you can earn up to $150,000 for the most successful exploit.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:30.740]   So if you can crack that version of Chrome OS, you know, in a persistent way, at that point
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:33.580]   you can pretty much take the rest of the year off of the test.
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:36.180]   Because you've earned your 150k salary for the year.
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:37.180]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:38.180]   Wow.
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:43.060]   Does that, I mean, I imagine that that's a very popular among Googlers and they kind
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:45.500]   of line up, but it's not just Googlers.
[00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.460]   It could be anybody, right?
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:48.460]   It's open to anybody.
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:52.660]   And I think Googlers are obligated to actually just disclose the bug if they want.
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:53.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:56.580]   But there's a contest in March called Ponium.
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:55:00.860]   And it's one of my favorite things because it's like the Super Bowl of Chrome hackers
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:04.940]   and, you know, other hackers because they see if they can hack these machines.
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:08.900]   And so every year you're like, is somebody going to come up with a new attack for Firefox
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.340]   or Chrome?
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:14.980]   And last year they came up with two attacks on Chrome and they changed like 12 vulnerabilities
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:15.980]   together.
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:19.820]   And the Chrome guys to their credit love to find out about that because it makes things
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:21.300]   more secure for everybody else.
[00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:22.580]   Yeah, no, it's great.
[00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:25.700]   This is, every company usually does something like this.
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:27.060]   It's a really good idea.
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:30.660]   But Google is easily the most generous of any company I've ever seen for paying for
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.780]   these bugs and these bug hunts.
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:33.780]   That's really great.
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:37.580]   I presume Ponium will be on Pi Day, March 14th, right?
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.180]   Oh, that would be cool.
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:40.180]   Yeah.
[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:41.780]   And they can award it.
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:44.620]   No, I don't think we can go on too much on that.
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:46.460]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:51.700]   Is YouTube launching a pay per view channel?
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.180]   Interesting thought.
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:55.820]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:56.820]   It's not a law firm.
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:04.260]   It helps you get your business, your legal business done self help legal documents, business
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.780]   and personal.
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:10.820]   And by the way, if you feel like, gosh, I'd like to talk to a lawyer about this, they've
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:14.100]   got a great legal network with fixed rate pricing.
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.980]   So you can talk to a lawyer as well.
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:17.300]   But so much of this, you can do yourself.
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:19.420]   I did it myself for the LLC.
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:25.780]   So if you want to start a corporation, LLCs at LegalZoom start at $99, try that at a law
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:27.500]   firm.
[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:28.500]   And it makes a big difference.
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:31.460]   I got to say, it's a very easy to step through on the website.
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:34.380]   You walk through the Q&A and you're really, you're there.
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:36.100]   You're done sooner than you think.
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.100]   You can do an S corp.
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:39.500]   You can do a will too, a last will in Testament.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:40.500]   Trusts.
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.540]   If you're a blogger, did you trademark your blog's name?
[00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:46.220]   It's not a bad idea.
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:48.460]   Trademark your logo, easy to do, copyrights.
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:52.940]   They've even got patents, NDAs and more.
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:58.020]   A living trust at LegalZoom or a will, $69 for a will.
[00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:01.380]   If you don't have a will, you know, if the government decides what happens with your
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:05.540]   money and your kids, if you have kids, you really should have a will.
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:11.100]   In the past 12 years, 2 million Americans have used LegalZoom for LLCs, wills, trusts,
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.740]   trademark and more.
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:17.420]   They've happily gotten this stuff done without paying big legal fees.
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:19.300]   In most of these cases, it's so simple.
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.540]   You can do it yourself.
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:24.180]   But if you do have questions or you need advice, you can access their extensive network or
[00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:28.020]   attorneys through their legal plans available in most states.
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:31.300]   And by the way, when you're choosing a legal plan attorney, of course, they've vetted them,
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:35.940]   but you then also have access to their online profiles and completely unedited customer
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:37.180]   reviews as well.
[00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:39.940]   So you really, you know, can choose with confidence.
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.940]   This is such a great service.
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:42.940]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:49.100]   They're not a law firm, but you can get self-help services at your specific direction or speak
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:53.580]   to a legal plan attorney to get your questions answered and get ongoing advice for a special
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:54.580]   will.
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:55.940]   Thank you for mentioning us.

[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:04.300]   It's, you know, I know it's not a huge amount, but it's just a way of saying thank you for
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:08.500]   letting them know you heard this on this week in Google.
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:14.780]   T-W-I-G is the offer code 10 bucks, you know, that's a lunch Starbucks.
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:16.300]   LegalZoom.com offer code twig.
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.500]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:19.500]   Really is a great company.
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:27.220]   I've known them and use them for years and I can recommend them.
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:32.060]   You know, this is a rumor unless Matt wants to confirm it.
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.420]   This one I have no idea about.
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:34.420]   Okay.
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:35.420]   It's YouTube.
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:37.020]   YouTube is really kind of run autonomously, isn't it from Google?
[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:39.780]   It's like a separate company.
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:48.580]   So according to adage, a new revenue model for YouTube, YouTube is prepping launched
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:53.700]   to launch paid subscriptions for individual channels.
[00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:57.300]   And really where the information comes from is the channel producers have been approached
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:01.460]   by YouTube and asked to submit applications to create channels users would have to pay
[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:03.340]   to access.
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:08.740]   Most paid channels according to adage will cost somewhere between $1 and $5 a month in
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:11.340]   addition to episodic content.
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:13.340]   And you know, actually this makes a lot of sense.
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:20.820]   If you've had a show you've been pitching and you want to go direct to your audience,
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:25.820]   this gives you the ability to do that.
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:27.460]   Still what I think Howard Stern should do.
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:28.460]   Yeah.
[00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:29.460]   Imagine.
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:33.740]   I can do that, but I can imagine a Howard Stern huge.
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:36.380]   Think how much he'd make more than he's getting I'm sure.
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:37.380]   And right in his pocket.
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:38.380]   Yes.
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:39.380]   No middleman.
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:41.620]   Well, YouTube's kind of I'm sure YouTube takes a cut.
[00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:42.620]   Yeah.
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:47.100]   YouTube is also considering charging for content libraries and access to live events, Allah
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:50.940]   pay per view as well as self help or financial advice shows.
[00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:53.740]   You know what I want to try.
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:58.940]   You know, G4 recently changed format and there's they have all this old tech TV content.
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.940]   If you think people if we took if we were able, we're trying, we're talking them, try
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:04.340]   to get the tech TV content.
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:08.380]   If we put it on YouTube and charged a buck a month, you see people who pay for it.
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:09.380]   No, it's too old.
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:11.380]   It's probably too old.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:13.740]   Oh, it's some absolutely one of the questions.
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.740]   How many?
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:15.740]   Yeah, not enough.
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:16.740]   Yeah.
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:17.740]   You have fans.
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:21.380]   Now, machinima maker studios, those kinds, those guys are already, you know, millions
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.180]   of views.
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:25.580]   Is it because it's free?
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:35.780]   Salah Kamengar at All Things D last year talked about the potential to poach second or third
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:40.260]   tier cable networks that were having trouble building big enough audiences on cable, which
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.900]   is very expensive.
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.380]   Move them to YouTube.
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:52.460]   Charged subscriber fees directly or maybe even to internet distributors, other internet
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:53.960]   distributors.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.320]   And he said at the time, if we have a subscription model, then that's absolutely something that
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.320]   becomes possible.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.000]   So obviously YouTube has been thinking about this for at least a year.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   They have had rentals.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.760]   They have video rentals, right?
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.960]   You know, the one hand it's depressing to think, oh, well, you can get nickel and dime
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.960]   to death.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:14.960]   But the truth is that's what happens with cable.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.320]   I pay for all these channels I don't use.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.320]   Pay all the cards.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.560]   And, you know, a lot of $1 a month, so you could get 100 channels for.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.760]   It's not going to work for everything.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.160]   I mean, pay walls.
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.160]   So like, we could never do.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.280]   I don't think we could ever do that.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.760]   We could maybe make, you know, special content.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:34.400]   You get direct access to Jeff Jarvis's brain.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.960]   Something like that.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.960]   But there are big fans out there like I've been training for a big race.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.280]   And so I did a 24 mile run.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:45.480]   And so what I listened to were through twigs.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:49.200]   And you know, because if I listen to music, that's too pulse pounding and then I run
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.200]   too fast.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.200]   So Twitter is a sorry to that.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.360]   I'm sorry, you know, run marathon.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:53.360]   We slow him down.
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.360]   We make him go marathon speed.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.360]   Moderate speed.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.800]   So, you know, I can imagine a lot of people paying for like all the equivalent of back
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.800]   issues, you know.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.800]   I like it.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:04.800]   I like it.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.800]   All right.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.720]   Let's get the change log.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, break out the trouble.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.960]   Somebody said I look like a sriracha bottle.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.520]   What's a compliment?
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.200]   It's a racha is delicious.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.800]   It is delicious.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:18.800]   And spicy.
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:19.800]   And spicy.
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:24.120]   I got a red for those of you listening at home.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:29.840]   I've got a bright green headband on like the top on a sriracha bottle and a red Niners
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:34.320]   jersey like the bottle of a sriracha bottle.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:37.320]   I'm Google image searching.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:43.960]   I'm testing out a new item in the change log.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:50.960]   You sriracha right there.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:57.960]   Now ladies and gentlemen, we bring you the trumpets which signals the change log.
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:09.800]   You should go to Google image search right now and search for a sriracha bottle because
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.880]   you'll see that it looks like it.
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.720]   You'll see that Google is slowly rolling out.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:16.720]   I got it.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.920]   So I think it's pretty far rolled out.
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.840]   Google is rolling out a new image search interface.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.920]   It's very similar to their tablet interface to image search.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.920]   It's really nice.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:31.160]   It reduces the number of clicks that you have to see the larger version of an image.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:35.840]   You can use your keyboard to move from one image to quickly like kind of flip through
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.480]   a set of images.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.480]   Really nice.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.000]   You have to click on an image and then it would load the page, the originating page
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   in the background.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   This is so much better.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   It's way, way, way back.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.600]   I always hated that transparent background of the page that we saw.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.000]   Yeah, I did too.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.960]   That's some copyright complaints here.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.400]   Yeah, because I guess that was why they did the page, right?
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.400]   You, the source.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.160]   But there's still a link to the source.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:03.560]   In fact, there's four times as many links and I think the blop said that the net average
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.280]   click-through rate actually went up.
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.280]   Okay.
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:07.280]   I'm going to go with that.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.280]   Yes, I agree.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.280]   Hey, lawyers got to eat.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.280]   You know, Matt?
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.280]   Yeah, it was interesting.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:18.360]   Google's blog post introducing this kind of had this whole section for like webmasters.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.840]   Don't freak out.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.840]   This is what's going on.
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:24.560]   So yeah, beautiful image search going on there.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.760]   And I have it and you have it Leo.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.480]   So it looks like it's going out to everyone.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.360]   Google Forms gets updated.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.520]   Google Forms is one of these like awesome drive products.
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.000]   I feel like that just doesn't get the kind of attention that it should get.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.240]   Like a Google Forms is just a way to kind of create a questionnaire input.
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:45.320]   So easy way to ask to do a survey or to collect information into Google's sheets.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.920]   And it got a couple of little updates.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:51.080]   You can collaborate with others during while you're editing a spreadsheet.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.680]   You can chat with people and you can see real-time edits.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:58.040]   So you can, you can edit, collaborate on a form with the coworkers at the same time.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:00.280]   And a nice Google+ functionality.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:05.840]   If you share a form directly on Google+, anyone in your circles can respond without leaving
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:12.760]   Google+ or they can do it inside Gmail as well, which is really nice.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:13.760]   Let's see.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.760]   What else do we have?
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:20.960]   Google added a couple of kind of cool flags in the latest Chrome beta for Android.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.400]   I have you guys seen this?
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:29.080]   And on Android, the latest Chrome beta, if you type in Chrome colon slash slash flags,
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.080]   you get a few different options here.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.680]   And one of them is that you can enable WebGL.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:40.040]   It's a JavaScript animation technology that lets you kind of see animation without an
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.040]   extra plugin.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.960]   And you couldn't do that on mobile before?
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.280]   Could not do that on mobile before.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.160]   So you have to get the latest, and it's the Chrome beta.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.160]   Okay.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.960]   So it's the latest Chrome beta for Android.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:54.600]   You go to Chrome colon slash slash flags and you can enable the WebGL.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.800]   And then reload the browser and then you can see WebGL.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.880]   How's the performance on your Galaxy Nexus?
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.880]   It's great.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.080]   Chrome beta is my default browser.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.160]   But I mean, WebGL site pages.
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.200]   Because it's basically animation, right?
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.200]   Basically animation.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.200]   Not bad.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.200]   It's not bad at all.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.200]   That's cool.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.280]   I always assumed it wasn't enabled because the phones weren't fast enough to handle it.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.280]   Right.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.280]   Right.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.240]   That could be kind of slowly introducing it to see.
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.880]   It just goes while they optimize.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.880]   Right.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:28.800]   I think they might have also needed, and they might still need more time so that the Chrome
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:34.240]   on mobile can sort of know what the capabilities of the CPU or the GPU are.
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:39.000]   Because if you can pass it through directly, like as direct calls, you know, that's very
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   fast.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.440]   If you're relating it, then that doesn't work quite as well.
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:45.880]   Does that make sense at all?
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.880]   Yes.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.880]   Absolutely.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:52.400]   Two quick iOS, a Google app iOS updates.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:57.400]   YouTube Capture, which is that shoot direct to Web application now supports 1080p uploads,
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.920]   which is nice.
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:01.440]   And Google Currents got a new UI update.
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.920]   I believe this is 2.0.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:07.200]   It's got a new sidebar that sorts editions by category.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.280]   It's got new controls.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:12.280]   You can swipe vertically to scan an edition or horizontally to skip to the next one.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:17.640]   It's got a new catalog design, breaking stories from Google News and the ability to save
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.520]   articles by labeling them with with stars.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:21.960]   A couple of couple of updates.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:25.360]   I'm not a huge current user, but Leo, you're a flip board guy, right?
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.360]   Or do you use that?
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.400]   Currents a lot though.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:33.640]   Currents number two only to Google Plus for great iOS design.
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.840]   But this makes it even better.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.360]   It's still not quite Google plus.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:40.800]   I'd love to see that Google Plus interface percolate throughout all of Google's iOS apps.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.800]   It's just great.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.240]   Well, speaking of Google Plus, and this literally just came in.
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:48.400]   Thanks, chat room for letting me know during the show earlier, the Google Plus app Android
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.080]   just got an update, kind of a small update.
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:54.160]   But you get a couple of nice community features you can--
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.160]   Yes, yes.
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:59.640]   --can now promote, remove, or demand members from their community from the Android app
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:03.000]   and restore, remove posts that were marked for review.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:09.920]   And separately and by popular demand, you can attach clipboard links to posts.
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.200]   So it's kind of easier to share links.
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.760]   And there's more room to read your notifications as well.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:18.880]   So I literally just updated this on my phone and haven't had a chance to play with it too
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.880]   much.
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:24.440]   But if you've already got the Google Plus app installed, you'll get the update notification
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:28.080]   from the Play Store very soon if you haven't gotten it already.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.080]   That's it.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.400]   That's all I got.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:34.680]   And that's the Google Change Log.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.560]   Do you like that feature, Matt?
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:39.560]   Which one?
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.560]   The Change Log.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.560]   I do.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:42.560]   I love the drums.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:46.640]   You know, I listen to Twig usually rather than watch it.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.720]   So when you hear the boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.720]   you know.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:51.720]   You know.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.200]   You're just doing a little focus group test in here.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.760]   And I do love the music at the very end.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.760]   It's sort of the light, you know, trilling, you know.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.280]   You guys keep talking about replacing it with some techno or something.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.280]   Oh, you do.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:04.280]   You like the music.
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.280]   You like our little fugue.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.280]   The little medieval, yes.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:10.280]   So it's so stupid.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.280]   I'm a fan.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.720]   I'll stand up and say I'm a fan.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.720]   All right.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.000]   We're not changing it.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.800]   I was going to have Jonathan Colton do a cover.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:21.800]   Oh.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:26.400]   All right, let's talk about it.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.760]   Miss Cleek here.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.760]   This is good.
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:33.800]   This is going to challenge your nerd, your nerd loyalty because you've got two things
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.560]   that you love in the world.
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:36.560]   Yes.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.560]   Well, more than two.
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:38.560]   You've got Edda.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:39.560]   Yes.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:46.040]   So that's three, but you got, but you do love Glee and you.
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.640]   I want that hat.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:54.040]   Oh, sorry.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:58.040]   Oh, Lord.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:03.360]   Chad just put a spicy sriracha bottle up.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.880]   That's a, I want that for Halloween costume.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.880]   That's good.
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.840]   It's a little sriracha costume.
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.600]   We know what a green hat means, don't we?
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:15.480]   Oh, gee.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:18.040]   So let's give you the Jonathan Colton story.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:23.560]   So Joko, who we all love, is very popular with the geek crowd because he writes very
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:28.560]   cerebral lyrics, but he's also very musical, really writes wonderful music and a former
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:33.240]   programmer who decided he did not want to go the traditional music route.
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.240]   He talked to his wife.
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.960]   He said, "I'm bored of tears programming.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:37.960]   I like music.
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:38.960]   I'm a musician.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:42.760]   Can I quit my job and pursue a musical career?"
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.160]   She said, "Okay."
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:48.000]   He was smart because the first thing he did is he did something called a thing a week.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.640]   Where he would just come out with a song every week.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.080]   It's kind of like your thing, Matt Cutsby.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:56.760]   If you do something continually for 30 days, it becomes a habit.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:00.800]   So he knew that if he just forced himself, he had a deadline every week, he would get
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.920]   in the habit of creating music.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.000]   And he did some covers as a result because you run out of musical ideas.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.080]   He's done some wonderful covers.
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.080]   One of them was Sir Mixalots.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:11.480]   Baby got back and it was great.
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.520]   Banjo, it's beautiful singing.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.520]   It's really hysterical.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.520]   It's really goofy and funny.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.800]   So now give us the Gleas side of this story.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.000]   Well, the Gleas side of the story.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.880]   And I just want to say I was a really big Gleas fan, but recently the show has been atrocious.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:30.880]   I mean-
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:31.880]   I stopped watching last year.
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:32.880]   I'm friggin' so-
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:36.480]   I think it's a lot of plot problems just because of music.
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:39.760]   But now I can't even.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.560]   The music's not even worth the plot problem.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:46.600]   So my feelings about the Gleas side of the story is that in the last episode of Gleas,
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:51.880]   I think it aired some time last week, there was the show choir at the school in New York
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:55.040]   where Kurt and- Kurt go and Rachel go now.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.400]   Do this version of Baby got back.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:02.600]   It's a really funny, like, slowed down, you know, led by sort of this, this like goofy
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.920]   white dude.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:09.640]   And it's very funny and it sounds very familiar to Colton's version.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:15.760]   In fact, when John and the Colton did it, he changed one line in the song.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.480]   And Gle and included his name.
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.600]   It's like Johnny's coming home or something like that.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.800]   And Gle actually had that exact line.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:29.800]   It was a direct, direct, unapologetic cover of basically the Colton cover on Gleas.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:35.760]   But no attribution, no credit, no mention, nothing, nothing like that.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.800]   Just straight, straight kind of rip off.
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.880]   And I guess Joko had seen, because you know, Gleak, like, Gle will publish previews of
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.160]   the songs that are going to air for that episode that week to kind of tease the episode.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.160]   And he had seen it.
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.240]   And he was like, that sounds like mine.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.320]   And then he watched the episode and was like, that is, that's my cover.
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:59.400]   And I guess the gleif folks had contacted him and basically said, like, hey, you know,
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.160]   this is well within our rights to do.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.440]   And I hope you'll take it as a compliment and, you know, consider it free PR.
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.440]   You're welcome.
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:10.080]   And Koko was kind of like, what?
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.320]   And so Joko has actually kind of taken the high road.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:16.760]   He hasn't really made a big deal about this, but his legion of internet fans has, has flipped
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:17.760]   out.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.160]   And so over the past couple of weeks has gone for a couple of weeks, people have been asking
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:24.560]   me like, how, how come you haven't commented on the gleif thing, you know, gleavers is
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.840]   Joko, which one are you?
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:29.240]   And it's like, I'm so clearly like team Colton on this one.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.440]   Now his, his songs are Creative Commons licensed.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.440]   Are they not?
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.760]   Leo, I'm pretty sure that he Creative Commons licenses us.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:37.760]   Interesting.
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.040]   So, but that would demand attribution.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:43.200]   And it's, and yes, it is because he said it's non commercial.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:45.320]   And this is obviously commercial use of it.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.480]   This is commercial use, right?
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:50.520]   So, so then of course, uh, Glee is a, is a selling machine.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.840]   Every single song that they do, they release on iTunes.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.840]   It's usually extremely popular that generate tons of tons of tons of revenue.
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.680]   But so, so Jonathan Colton went ahead.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.040]   I guess he had done this baby, got back cover a few years back.
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:05.800]   He went ahead and released, released a new version of it.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:12.560]   And he called it the Glee version kind of in the title version as outsold the official
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:18.440]   Glee version, which has suffered from many angry one star reviews from Joko fans and
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.440]   iTunes.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.840]   So, yeah, a little, little Glee.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:25.400]   I love that he's out selling the, the official Glee version.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.400]   That's great.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.480]   And we played on Twitter a couple of weeks ago.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:34.200]   We played the Glee version and the Jonathan Colton version exactly the same time.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.000]   They're the same song.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.800]   There is no, it doesn't sound like two songs.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.120]   It's this, it's matches perfectly.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.120]   Yes.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:46.600]   So they didn't even, it wasn't a recreation of it.
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.600]   They took it.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.600]   Yeah.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.040]   But, and we have, we've talked about this before.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:54.720]   I mean, cause we have a fan who actually mixes the music on Glee.
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.520]   That's how we got some of this Glee music early on.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.040]   And he said, no, they never ask permission of anything for any of this stuff.
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:01.040]   Right.
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.040]   They pay fine.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.560]   Like they basically don't ask, they do songs.
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:07.640]   And then once they get to stuff that they have in bottle license where they pay for after
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:08.640]   all.
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:09.960]   So are you going to do that?
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.560]   Is this both of them together?
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:12.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.640]   So this is both of them playing at the same time.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.000]   Exactly the same time.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:24.280]   And it's, I believe if you're listening in stereo, which is, you hear the other.
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:25.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.680]   But we, we actually mixed down our audio to mono.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:31.680]   So for anyone listening to the recorded podcast.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:34.360]   You noticed that, but we're stuck.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:38.120]   It's not a, can you tell it difference?
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:39.120]   An homage.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.120]   It's not a re-creation.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:44.120]   It's the same song.
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:52.280]   And a great song too, I might add.
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:55.960]   And then, and the line you were talking about Gina is Johnny season trouble.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:56.960]   Oh, it's you.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.840]   It was normally a Sir Mixle lots and trouble.
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:00.840]   They didn't change it.
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:01.840]   But of course they didn't change it.
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:02.840]   You know why?
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.840]   It's the same song.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:04.840]   They just took it.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:09.840]   But inside of had given him, it's a match.
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:12.800]   This was a cover of, of another song to begin with.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.560]   So this wasn't like John and the Colton song that they took.
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.040]   I mean, it was, it was his arrangement.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.040]   It was his, it's fine.
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.040]   It's a match.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.320]   They need to give him a heads up, give him attribution.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.320]   They needed to talk to him about the creative.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.040]   If it was a non-commercial license, then there might be some sort.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:29.120]   I mean, I'm not a lawyer, but there might be some, some, some legal issues there.
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.360]   But they were just jerks about it.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:36.000]   And I'm, I'm, I'm disappointed because from what I've seen, Glee is a pretty internet savvy,
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.040]   uh, um, you know, production and crew and writers seemed to be.
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:44.040]   So you would think that they would just handle it better.
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:47.120]   This was an issue of communication and just kind of give them a heads up.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:48.840]   I mean, this could have been a completely different story.
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:52.560]   This could have been him saying, Hey, you know, cool thing happened this week.
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.600]   My songs is on Glee.
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.800]   That could have been the story, but Glee just mishandled it.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:57.800]   Totally.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.000]   Mr. Fancy Pants next week, that's what I want.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.600]   And I could, I could start it.
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:15.120]   So, um, Google, Google, uh, says you want, you want our Gmail, you get a warrant.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.800]   Yes, Google.
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:17.800]   Yep.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.800]   Right now.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.480]   Now, is that new behavior, Matt, or is that just rea rea, rea assertion of what they've
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.800]   always said?
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.560]   I think that that's actually existing behavior.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.560]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:32.800]   You know, way back in the day, the Department of Justice back in 2005, 2006 tried to get
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.840]   two months worth of user queries.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.400]   And we were like, look, that's way too broad.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:41.800]   So Google has a long history of fighting overly broad or, you know, come back with a warrant,
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:46.680]   you know, but I guess the hidden story here is there's something called the ECPA.
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:49.820]   I think that's the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:53.080]   It was written in 1986 and it's incredibly outdated.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:57.240]   It assumes that if you leave things, you know, on a server for six months, oh, you're not
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.600]   using that email anymore.
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:01.720]   Well, we all leave our email on servers now.
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.120]   It's all in the cloud.
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:09.280]   And so the ECPA needs to be revamped to have better protection legally for your email,
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.280]   basically.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.880]   Now, what's interesting is that's the spin on this story.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:18.120]   On the other hand, if you read the story, Google also announced that more than two-thirds
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:22.960]   of the user data that Google forwards to government agencies is handed over without a warrant
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.960]   at all.
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:24.960]   Right.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.440]   I think those are subpoenas.
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:29.520]   So I think for criminal cases, we require a warrant.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:33.240]   I'm not a lawyer, so maybe some Google lawyer will come hit me over the head later.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:36.320]   But I think if it's something criminal related, then we do require a warrant.
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:41.000]   But some of the consumer data doled out without a warrant, according to Wired, includes names
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.320]   listed when creating Gmail accounts.
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:47.120]   The IP address from where the account was created, where and what time a user signs
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:50.320]   in and out of her Gmail account.
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:54.520]   Google hands over without warrants, the IP address associated with a particular email sent
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:59.200]   from a Gmail account or used to change the account password.
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:05.400]   The non-content portion of the account, and this is all probably Google has no choice.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:09.240]   I suspect this is all stuff that's covered under the Patriot Act.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:13.720]   But the non-content portion of email headers, the from, the to, and the date fields, those
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:16.720]   are not considered content, so that's handed over.
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:21.360]   And by the way, this is kind of SOP, certainly all the phone companies do that too.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:24.400]   Well, Gmail does different things.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:28.080]   So for example, Hotmail and Yahoo is, I understand it.
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:32.640]   When you email, if I email you Leo, it passes along my IP address.
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.760]   Gmail does do that by default.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:37.120]   So by default, it's more private.
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:42.360]   But if you actually want to get the content of an email or do a criminal case, there are
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.080]   definitely cases where we can make a good argument.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.600]   Look, you need to come back with a warrant.
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:52.000]   But if it's something like, what was the IP address that this email came from and all
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.120]   the other email providers are providing the IP address with the email, then that might
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.920]   be a little bit of a harder thing to push back on.
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:07.240]   In six months, United States agencies demanded 8,438 times the Google fork over data on some
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.040]   -- almost 15,000 accounts.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:12.800]   This is in six months, ending December 2012.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:25.600]   In those requests, probable cause search warrants were issued 1,896 times subpoenas, 5,784 times
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.760]   the remaining 758.
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:33.840]   No one's talking.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.640]   By the way, requests under the Patriot Act do not show up in the transparency report because
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:41.680]   the Patriot Act does not allow it.
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:45.320]   One of the features of the Patriot Act is you can't even tell people that somebody's
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:49.880]   asked for their information.
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:51.080]   I don't blame Google.
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:54.520]   I blame our federal government, obviously.
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.920]   This law has to change.
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:03.480]   I know Google is among many companies leading the fight to change this so that you are protected
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:06.240]   to update the ECPA, in other words.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:12.560]   It would be really nice if national security letters -- I don't know.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:15.200]   This is just me speaking personally.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:20.040]   If we were to get one of those, I know nothing about the actual request.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:23.080]   If we were to get one that was crazy, I think it would be great if we could challenge it
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:28.800]   and say, "Hey, this is not the sort of thing that people shouldn't even realize that the
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.440]   government is asking for."
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:34.400]   I have no idea I assume the vast majority of these are actually responsible, but the
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.000]   problem is you don't know.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.560]   Sunlight is the best disinfectant.
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:44.840]   It feels like hopefully in a few years that kind of mentality will peak a little bit and
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:48.160]   then people will realize, "Maybe we do need to make sure that there's checks and balances
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.320]   in place here."
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.800]   But that's in a larger effort.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:54.960]   That's not something that Google could easily do by itself, try to fight a court case for
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:55.960]   something like that.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:02.120]   I really have to kudos to Patrick Leahy, who's the Vermont Senator, Chairman of the Senate
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.400]   Judiciary Committee.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:07.200]   He's trying to sneak this in on the Netflix bill.
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:12.200]   Congress acted quickly when Netflix lobbyists said, "Hey, you really ought to make it okay
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:17.760]   for Netflix users to share their video viewing habits on Facebook."
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.400]   Man, that law went through.
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.880]   Boom, boom, boom.
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:28.280]   So Leahy, over the objections of law enforcement, put a clause in the Netflix bill requiring government
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:32.600]   officials to get a search warrant for emails over 180 days old.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:38.520]   Of course, it was stripped out before the bill was passed and signed by President Obama.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:43.680]   So you can now share your Netflix, though that's the good news on Facebook.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:48.600]   The bad news is they can still get your emails if they're more than three months old or six
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.400]   months old.
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:53.640]   Leahy says he's going to reintroduce that legislation.
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:56.600]   We'll keep an eye on that and we'll let you know when he does and we can start a letter
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:58.240]   writing campaign or something.
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.240]   Cool.
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.920]   The FBI says, "Don't make our jobs more difficult."
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:09.920]   Please, it's hard enough.
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.320]   We should have to go to a judge and all that stuff.
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:15.560]   It's just too much to ask.
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:20.920]   Yahoo also asks for warrants when appropriate.
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:21.920]   Let's see.
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:24.160]   Mark Zuckerberg is holding a fundraiser for Chris Christie.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.160]   What?
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.160]   Really surprised me.
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:27.160]   What?
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.160]   What?
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.160]   What?
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.480]   I don't know what to say.
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:34.360]   Everybody has the right to do whatever they want.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.400]   It's an odd couple.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.400]   It's a very odd couple.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:39.400]   It is.
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:44.120]   Actually, it's more like three people, really, but that's another story.
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.680]   Do Jersey people just stick together?
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:46.680]   Is that this?
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:47.680]   No.
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:48.680]   No.
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:49.680]   Yo.
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:55.280]   Zuckerberg became a fan of Christie and as the governor geared up for his 2013 election
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:59.120]   bid, reelection bid, the tech mogul approached the campaign about helping him get another
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.120]   term.
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:08.600]   Mark and his wife Priscilla expressed their interest in supporting the governor for reelection.
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:13.600]   You know, I do love that whenever people have given Christie a hard time, he's like,
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.560]   "Look, I'm less worried about the politics.
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:18.040]   I'm more worried about taking care of my people."
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:22.160]   He comes across really well whenever you're watching him engage with somebody.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:26.480]   He's done brilliantly with the storm and everything else I got to say.
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:30.920]   And apparently it's his education policies at the Zuckerberg's particularly.
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:35.320]   And don't forget, Zuckerberg gave him a hundred million dollars to Newark schools.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.320]   Right.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:38.320]   This is a big thing for them.
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.320]   Jersey.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:40.320]   Jersey.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.320]   Jersey.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.320]   Jersey.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.320]   Jersey.
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:44.320]   Jersey.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.320]   Jersey.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.320]   Jersey.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.320]   Jersey.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.320]   I'm just looking through the Facebook stories.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.320]   There's so much stuff.
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:52.320]   I guess we could talk about the fact that Facebook withdrew access to Vine.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.560]   What's the story there?
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.640]   It's interesting.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.640]   It's interesting.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.120]   Yeah, Vine is a Twitter-owned.
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:06.640]   That probably is of value to this story, at least an understanding of the story.
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:12.520]   Vine is an application that like many iOS apps says, "Would you like me to find Vine
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:14.800]   users amongst your friends?"
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:15.880]   And you can look on Twitter.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.040]   You can look on your contacts and you could.
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:20.440]   When you first got it, look on Facebook.
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:25.520]   But Facebook cut that off right away saying, "Well, our policy is you have to reciprocate
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.320]   it."
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.800]   But the thing is you could post it through Vine on Facebook.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.840]   So I'm not sure what the reciprocation is that they're looking for.
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:35.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.680]   I've inherited Jarvis's rage about this.
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.800]   This isn't about, this is our data, right?
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:42.800]   If you say, "Find my friends," no, no, it's good.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:45.200]   Your job is to infect others with your rage.
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:48.480]   But not your cold, just your rage, please.
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:50.040]   I'm sick to be able to read that.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.040]   Yeah, not your cold.
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.040]   This is why we're on Skype.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:56.560]   No, but this stuff just bugs me so much because this is not Facebook's decision.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:59.400]   These are my friends I made on Facebook.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:02.360]   So I should be able to access it from wherever.
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:03.360]   It makes me crazy.
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.160]   So what was their reasoning?
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.160]   They wanted reciprocation?
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:12.200]   Yeah, but there is where it says they modify their platform policy to say, "Facebook platform
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:16.120]   enables developers to build personalized social experiences via the graph API that's getting
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:17.800]   your contact list."
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:23.200]   If you use any Facebook APIs to build personalized social experiences, you must also enable people
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:25.880]   to easily share their experiences back with people on Facebook.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.880]   But it does do that.
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:28.880]   But it does that.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:34.400]   I really don't get the reciprocity thing because for a long time, you'd take your contacts
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:39.280]   out of Gmail and put them in Facebook, but Facebook wouldn't let you export them back.
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:42.560]   And then Google put reciprocity in place, which is why we said, "Look, if we're going
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:48.040]   to let you export contacts directly to some other network, then they ought to provide
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.040]   that back."
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:53.680]   But even when Facebook provided your friends' exports, it was clear text names of your
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:54.680]   friends.
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:56.800]   It wasn't the actual links or the URLs or anything like that.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:02.960]   So it's very weird to hear reciprocity being cited as the reason why Vine and Yandex get
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.640]   cut off.
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:12.280]   For instance, they allowed Snapchat to do this until they had Polk, which was a direct copy
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.280]   of Snapchat.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.440]   And then suddenly, Snapchat, "No, you can't."
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:20.400]   It's an anti-competitive move.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.400]   It really is.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.200]   And Instagram and Twitter don't get along.
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:26.560]   I mean, it's just anti-competitive move.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:27.560]   It sucks.
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:32.160]   It's not user-- it's not-- but it's not but the user first.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:36.400]   This is a relatively new thing in the past couple of years.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.200]   A Neil wrote that post about the web we lost.
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:43.040]   There was a time when everybody wanted to generate file formats that were easily importable
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.040]   and exportable.
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:46.800]   I mean, people wanted to share data with their other services.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:50.840]   It was a feature that your data could go in and out.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:55.040]   And now it's flipped, and it's becoming this who's cutting off who.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.040]   It's so frustrating.
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.880]   It makes me really-- I really inherited the rage, Jeff.
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:27:59.880]   I hope that--
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:00.880]   Wow.
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.880]   I don't spend a lot of time angry.
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:04.680]   I choose my battles carefully.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.760]   This one is under my skin.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:07.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:12.520]   There's a really good t-shirt from Maker Faire, the Make Magazine guys.
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:15.120]   And it basically says, if you can't open it, you don't own it.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:16.600]   Oh, I like it.
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:20.400]   They're talking about getting inside of physical boxes, but the same thing applies to your
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:21.400]   data, really.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:22.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:23.400]   Yep.
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:24.400]   Twitter's taken a page from Google's Playbook.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:29.680]   They have a now Twitter Transparency report, which is greattransparency.twitter.com.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:38.880]   1,858 requests from governments and right holders, 48 removal requests, 6,646 copyright
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.360]   notices since the beginning of the year.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:41.840]   That's in the month of January, essentially.
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.080]   I hope you have a copyright notice.
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:45.520]   I guess a photo.
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.680]   We can drill down.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:51.240]   Because a tweet is not exactly copyrightable.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.240]   Yeah.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.240]   You must be--
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.240]   Yeah.
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.240]   I don't know.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.400]   I think it's a Twitter for doing this.
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.440]   I think it's fantastic that there--
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:03.360]   the more people realize that these things are going on, the more educated they are about,
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.440]   OK, well, maybe we want to push back on this.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:09.640]   Because this is the sort of thing that makes you feel like, OK, Twitter was acting in my
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:10.640]   interests in this case.
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:17.360]   To let me know how often they have to take stuff down or how often they get DMCA complaints
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.360]   or whatever.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:25.880]   Dalton Caldwell is trying to get more people to use app.net, the paid Twitter clone.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:31.200]   Now he's added an API for a storage, 10 gigabytes of cloud storage and 5.0.
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.200]   OK.
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:37.640]   So since we all signed up, who's actually used it since then?
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:38.640]   Matt cuts.
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:39.640]   You use everything.
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.640]   That actually is what it is.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:42.400]   We're at networks where I forget to go.
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:43.400]   I'll admit that.
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:47.560]   And I would like to go there more because the conversations are great there.
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:48.840]   But it's just too-- we have too many.
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:49.840]   It's the overload thing.
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:50.840]   It's the overload thing.
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:51.840]   It's the overload.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:54.080]   I have one month of using the app instead of Twitter.
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:56.360]   That's actually a pretty good one.
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:57.360]   Maybe I'll do that sometimes.
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:58.360]   That would be good.
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:05.360]   To be a test to see if it's just getting convenient or if there's really something better about
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:06.920]   Twitter.
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:11.480]   By the way, don't use the phrase hashtag in France.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:13.600]   It's a mode the as.
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:14.600]   I love it.
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.600]   France, I don't think any other country does this.
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:22.760]   They have the commision gÃ©nÃ©ral de terminologies et de neologism.
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:29.200]   The commision on the gÃ©nÃ©ral commission on terminology and neologisms.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.200]   They have a committee.
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:34.120]   Of course, there was always the academy, fronces, that would keep track of the French language
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:36.960]   and make sure foreignisms didn't migrate in.
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:42.840]   This committee has decided that the word hashtag is too American.
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.680]   It's an anglicism.
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:47.040]   And they've said, please use mo ds.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.120]   I guess ds is sharp.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.920]   So it's the sharp word.
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:31:00.600]   And of course, you see a lot of that on Twitter with French people saying, good lord.
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:02.240]   It's technically incorrect, by the way.
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:05.640]   Now I have to learn how to do the e with the fancy finger.
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:07.680]   Yeah, the exon gras.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:12.280]   It is a sharp sign, which was a left leaning hashtag.
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:14.480]   The hashtag leans right.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:15.480]   Okay.
[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:23.440]   Bazinga.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:27.960]   To break this tie and say, no, no, just call it hashtag.
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:30.440]   It's pronounced GIF.
[01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:31.840]   Oh, God.
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:41.600]   My name is Lena Storvalds and I pronounce lean.
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:50.720]   That's the web we lost right there in a nutshell.
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:55.080]   Elon Musk says the dreamliner is fundamentally unsafe.
[01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.680]   He should know, he knows he does batteries.
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:02.440]   He builds those Teslas are with lithium ion.
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:08.920]   He says, unfortunately, the pack architecture supplied to Boeing is inherently unsafe.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:12.000]   The way it's built is wrong.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.640]   Well, I that's not good.
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:16.640]   That's alarming.
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:19.640]   Well, they're all they're all, you know, they're all, they're not flying.
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:23.040]   They've got the pull down the dreamliner, well, pulling down is not the right word, but
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:27.680]   they, they took it out of service until they figure out why they're, you know, the batteries
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.440]   are catching fire.
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:36.240]   By the way, a professor of electrical engineering at MIT, Donald Sattaway said, I would have
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.920]   used the same words of glad someone with such a big reputation as Elon put it on the
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:42.480]   line.
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:45.640]   The Tesla's engineered to prevent that domino effect.
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:50.480]   Boeing apparently doesn't have that engineering.
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:54.520]   It was very strange to me that Donald Sattaway is a professor of electrical engineering at
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.880]   MIT and yet he's citing someone else.
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:58.320]   I'm like, it's okay.
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.320]   You can be an expert.
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:00.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.520]   You professor at MIT.
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:02.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.320]   I believe you, Donald.
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:11.320]   I do.
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:16.120]   Well, and he's actually, I think Donald Sattaway, yeah, he's the guy that did a TED talk about
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:19.120]   like this huge molten battery.
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:23.960]   It's actually a really good TED talk about, you know, how you can save the energy and
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:25.720]   get it back very efficiently.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:29.840]   But his idea is you have like a battery that's the size of a cargo container and you heat
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.040]   it up with a molten salt kind of thing.
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.760]   So he should know what he's talking about for sure.
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:36.920]   I'd like to see that experiment.
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:39.400]   Yahoo made money.
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:40.960]   Marissa's done well.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:49.800]   Yeah, she saw her speak at Davos where she was popular and she's still an impressive
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:50.800]   Marissa.
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:58.040]   Her three goals for Yahoo, a better UI, bigger international reach and broader demographics.
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:00.240]   What do you think Yahoo's demographics are these days?
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:01.240]   Is it older people?
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:02.240]   I bet.
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:09.400]   But she also said she said she would list all for friends all of the top uses of a mobile
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.680]   phone and then people would say, well, what are you describing to me?
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:12.680]   Yahoo's features.
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:18.800]   So she clearly sees mobile is a big area for where they go.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:22.960]   She also said when asked, I'm not going to get the list.
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:29.320]   There's one of four things you need, a mobile OS, a web OS, a browser or a sleepy-dope-crumpy
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.760]   fourth thing.
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:35.160]   And she said, no, we don't have those things, but that means we can partner with people.
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:36.160]   I'm thrilled.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.800]   I mean, actually, you rarely do you see this kind of instant result.
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:40.800]   That's fantastic.
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:41.800]   Well done.
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:43.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:46.800]   Well, she's doing great.
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:47.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:54.720]   I love it that the New Yorker has hired Matt Buchanan from the esteemed literary journal Buzzfeed.
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:00.240]   Leo, please go check out the hashtag BuzzfeedNew Yorker.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:01.240]   Oh, boy.
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:02.240]   Oh, it's great.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:03.240]   That's a good guy.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:04.240]   You know, Matt?
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.240]   I do.
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:06.240]   He looks like he's 12.
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:15.240]   He's got that funny red hair, but he's actually very, he's, he's smart and he's, he's a good
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:16.240]   writer.
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:17.240]   I'm happy for him.
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:19.240]   What's the hashtag BuzzfeedNew Yorker?
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:20.240]   Buzzfeed New Yorker.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:23.360]   And it's pretty funny.
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:26.080]   So what is his new job at the New Yorker?
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:28.360]   Is he in charge?
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:29.360]   No.
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:35.600]   Oh, this is a funny hashtag.
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:37.520]   He is going to be editing their tech section, I believe.
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:38.520]   Oh, well, that's good.
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:39.520]   That's appropriate.
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:41.520]   Yeah, it is.
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:48.560]   I was on Buzzfeed recently because someone had complained about there was some, you know,
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:52.000]   why does Google still reward content scraping that?
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.120]   Someone was, was asking about the issues involved in that.
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:36:00.280]   And the number one story was 25 things that cats are secretly obsessed with.
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:01.280]   You know what?
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:02.880]   That's a perfectly legitimate article.
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:06.240]   And I look forward to seeing that as a cover story in the New Yorker soon.
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.240]   Yes.
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:13.480]   28 parents who love embarrassing their kids is the current headline on Buzzfeed.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:18.040]   I'm right in the middle of 35 great moments to ever seen on Ellen DeGeneres Show.
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.040]   Oh, love that.
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:20.680]   I'm still in the middle of it.
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:22.200]   I'm on 22 here.
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:23.200]   Oh.
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.200]   There we go.
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:25.200]   Yeah.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.040]   Mm hmm.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:31.340]   So this Buzzfeed article, I don't know, everyone even give it credence, how a copied
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:35.640]   and pasted excerpt of a story can still outrank an 8,000 word original and why publishers
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:38.280]   aren't the ones to blame.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.400]   You've seen this complaint before.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:45.520]   We've spent a fair amount of time talking about it this week inside of the ranking group.
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:50.360]   And I think it's important to realize that originally, I think Huffington Post put up
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.680]   basically an exact duplicate of an article.
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:57.040]   And so you had the article on two different places and you have to guess which one is
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.520]   the real copy, so to speak.
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:01.240]   And so you make those kinds of ranking decisions.
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:06.200]   And then later, Huffington Post gets, you know, Joshua Topolsky says, "Hey, please take
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:07.200]   this article down."
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:09.360]   Then we might still have decided which one's which.
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:13.920]   Anyway, the nice thing is that often when we look at these kinds of cases, like several
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:19.240]   different things have to go wrong for us to sort of see, "Oh, this is a quirk and okay,
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:20.920]   what do we need to do to fix it?"
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:24.640]   And we're continuing to talk about, "Okay, we always want, you know, whoever wrote the
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:29.080]   content, we want that article to be returned rather than someone who scraped it."
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:32.720]   But fundamentally, that's a hard problem because if someone scrapes it, then immediately
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:36.520]   posts it somewhere else, then it can be hard to say where it comes up first.
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:37.520]   Right.
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:41.840]   Now it's just an excerpt which is a much more common, you know, John Gruber does it every
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:45.240]   day on a daring fireball.
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:50.360]   It does make it better search results based on the Huffpo having more links.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:52.720]   I mean, is that...
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:55.040]   Do you do anything to say this is the original?
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:57.160]   We should point to that?
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:01.880]   You know, it's difficult to do, but yes, we do try to figure that out.
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:04.000]   I wouldn't claim that we do that perfectly.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.760]   There's actually a Russian site that analyzes different search engines and you can see over
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:10.600]   the last year, we've gotten much better at that.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:12.720]   But it's a really hard problem.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:16.080]   So we do try to figure out ways that we can do better at it.
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:19.000]   A human can do it, but you're doing it algorithmically.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000]   Right.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.880]   And there's just too much on the web where a human could try to do all of it.
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:24.880]   Right.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:27.720]   But there are people in Zurich and now there are going to be some extra people in Mountain
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.480]   View kind of trying to tackle this.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:34.320]   Now are you encouraging people to use rel canonical?
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.640]   Rel canonical is awesome.
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:40.240]   Yeah, it's basically a way where you can put a meta tag on a web page and you can say,
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:45.320]   there might be different versions of this article, but here is the one true version of
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:46.320]   this article.
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.880]   You can also do what's known as a 301 or permanent redirect.
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:52.120]   And those are all just hints that we try to use.
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:55.280]   There's lots of different ways that you can try to tell us that you've got original content,
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:58.360]   including sininess pings, all that sort of stuff.
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:01.200]   And we try to incorporate a lot of that information.
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:05.040]   Ironically, Huff put rel canonical in its link.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.040]   Yes.
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:09.000]   So you can't, I mean, if somebody's going to lie and say, no, this is the original, this
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.920]   is the canonical version of the article.
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:14.160]   I mean, that's an outright lie.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:16.880]   Well, and yes.
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:18.320]   In this case, it was.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:21.960]   And I think they were only trying to make it correct within Huffington Post.
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:23.880]   They weren't thinking about other copies.
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:27.000]   But even then you could say, oh, this is contested because different people both say that they
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.640]   have the canonical version.
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:31.120]   The tricky thing is those pages can change over time.
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:33.560]   People can add comments, content rotates in and out.
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:37.920]   And so finding out exactly what the duplicates are can be a really hard problem.
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:42.640]   Well, at the end of this Buzzfeed article says Google's head of a web spam and longtime
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:45.840]   search quality point man, Matt Cutz has not responded to a request for comment.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.440]   Well, now he has.
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:51.720]   Well, John was very nice to email me and I, you know, I was trying to reduce my.
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:54.280]   This was the week you were offline.
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:56.600]   So he was, he went ahead and wrote that.
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:00.960]   But I pointed him to, you know, the official press alias to ask for future sort of stuff.
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:01.960]   Yeah.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:03.800]   And you got, I mean, I don't know.
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:07.800]   I've always thought that having a post was a little bit over the line in the aggregation
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:09.240]   of other people's content.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:14.000]   And I can understand Josh was upset over the entire article appearing on the Huffington
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000]   Post.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.940]   And so, so rel canonical would certainly be something the verge would use on original
[01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:21.640]   content on the verge post.
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:27.120]   And in theory, no one else should use that on their content on their on their link to
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:28.120]   it.
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:30.600]   And if everything works well, it wouldn't happen.
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:31.600]   Right.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:36.280]   And the fact that most people don't see this happening where you search for, you know, a
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:40.880]   snippet of text from your blog post and you get something from a Russian or, you know,
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:43.480]   a Hungarian or whatever scraper.
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:44.840]   That means it normally works well.
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:47.560]   It's just it attracts a lot of attention when we get it wrong.
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:48.800]   And we do appreciate the feedback.
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:52.200]   You know, we've actually been talking to folks at BuzzFeed and taking suggestions and
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:56.160]   huddling on the engineering side to say, okay, how do we make sure that the right people
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:58.040]   do get credit as much as we can tell?
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:40:59.040]   Right.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.320]   I can see how it's a tough problem.
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.840]   We're going to take a break.
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:04.760]   Come back with Gina's tip of the week.
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:09.080]   Uh, Jeff's number of the week.
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:13.360]   And in man, if you'd like to do a tool or a tip or a number, you can do that too.
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:16.280]   But first a word from carbonite.com.
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:21.240]   We talk about the cloud, but you know, the cloud is a great place for backup as well.
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:25.280]   I talk to people all the time who say I lost my, I talk to a guy.
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:29.520]   He was sailing to Catalina Island in Los Angeles.
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:33.360]   And he has laptop was on the deck and they hit a wave and it went overboard.
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:36.320]   It's gone by my sinking away.
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:40.240]   And he called to say, but I wanted you to know I was using carbonite thanks to you and
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.320]   your ads.
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:44.040]   And I didn't, it was, I lost the laptop, but I didn't lose the data.
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:47.800]   And sometimes it's the data that's the stuff that's irreplaceable.
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:52.240]   The, you know, the great pictures of your baby being born or the, uh, your wedding or
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:55.400]   your financial records, those emails you've been saving.
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:58.480]   Carbonite keeps it safe in the cloud.
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:01.200]   It also gives you access in the cloud.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:02.720]   You can always get to your carbonite data.
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:06.600]   Just log on to your carbonite account on any computer or use their free apps.
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:09.080]   And it's just like cloud storage of any kind.
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:10.760]   But it's very affordable.
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:16.680]   $59 a year for everything on your Mac or your PC, $59 a year, less than five bucks a month.
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:20.320]   For, and there's no, it's not like for the first five gigabytes.
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:21.320]   It's unlimited.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:25.560]   After 200 gigabytes, they slow down the uploads, 200 gigabytes, probably too much for most
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:28.680]   people to back up to the cloud anyway, just based on your upstream bandwidth.
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:31.720]   So don't think of this as an infinite storage thing.
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:36.160]   But for most people, those precious records, that precious data, the stuff you've got no
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:40.240]   other copy of, that's important to make sure you got a copy on the cloud.
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:44.920]   Automatic, continuous, secure carbonite cloud storage.
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.360]   I want you to try it free right now.
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:47.360]   No credit card needed.
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:50.880]   Two weeks free, just go to carbonite.com and use Twig as the offer code.
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:56.600]   If you do that and you decide to buy, you'll get 14 months for the price of 12.
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:58.280]   And by the way, there are numerous plans.
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:03.320]   There are small business plans, unlimited computers and servers.
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:08.720]   You can get external drives, et cetera, et cetera, all at a low flat monthly rate.
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:14.520]   But the basic plan, $59 per year for a Mac or a PC is the one most people want.
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:15.520]   It's really great.
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:21.440]   And boy, when the time comes that disaster happens and they always do, you'll be really
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:23.360]   glad you've got carbonite.
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:25.920]   Carbonite.com, use the offer code Twig.
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:28.200]   Janet Trapani, your tip of the week.
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.720]   Tip of the week.
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:36.560]   You can now get notified on your phone if there's been any suspicious activity on your
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:40.000]   Google account or fail login attempts.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000]   This is kind of nice.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.480]   If you're worried about your account getting hacked, you just have on too off, not too
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:48.760]   off, which we've talked about before, two step off, excuse me.
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:54.840]   But now if you have a fail login attempt, if you go into your Google account settings,
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:59.800]   you can get notifications for a password change and for a suspicious login attempt,
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:00.800]   excuse me.
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:04.240]   So you get a notification via email and now you can get a notification for your phone.
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:07.920]   So you just, you check off phone and then you have to re-enter your password and you
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:09.800]   re-verify your phone.
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:13.200]   And so you get a little notification if that happens.
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:18.680]   This appears to be only available for vanilla Gmail accounts, not Google Apps accounts yet,
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:22.560]   but I enabled it for that and hopefully it'll show up for apps users as well.
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:23.560]   Cool.
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:29.640]   And that's an account, your Google.com/settings security.
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:31.840]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:34.400]   Well, I found this interesting.
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:40.080]   Google and Facebook led the private tech M&A of 12 companies each last year out of a total
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:41.080]   of 2,200 deals.
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:42.920]   But this is what it is to me.
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:50.520]   According to the next web, 76% of the companies bought out of the 2,200 did not rate any capital.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:55.480]   What happens to the VC business?
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:57.120]   How many, what percentage?
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.640]   76% raised no capital.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:02.120]   They bootstrapped.
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:03.120]   We're bootstrapped?
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:04.920]   Yep, you are.
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:07.920]   You know, we're not exactly a tech startup, but it's interesting.
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:11.760]   The number of companies, I look at the Gabrivera at TechMim who said, "I don't want to take
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:12.760]   any capital.
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:13.760]   I want to own it.
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:14.760]   I want to control it."
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:16.760]   Because he wants to take an afternoon nap.
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:20.600]   He doesn't want somebody snooping around.
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:21.600]   76%.
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:25.240]   And that's not because of a lack of the capital.
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:26.840]   I mean, there is money out there, right?
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:27.840]   No, there is.
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:29.600]   They're saying, "Oh, I couldn't get capital."
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.160]   They didn't want it.
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:32.160]   Who wants to deal with VCs?
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:33.160]   You don't have to.
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:35.360]   A, B, there's things that go ahead, Matt.
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:36.360]   Oh, sorry.
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:40.480]   I was just going to say, it's so much cheaper to do a startup or, you know, try to do a
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:41.480]   company.
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:44.840]   You can throw something up on the web or do a very fair time.
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:46.840]   And you know, it's very low.
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:47.840]   It's very low.
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:50.800]   So there were two zulably successful companies because they got bought.
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:51.800]   Right.
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:54.720]   But there were two reasons that people would get venture capital, partly the money.
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:59.240]   And you know, if you're a web company and you just scale, a lot of times it just means
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.760]   you need a lot of money right up front.
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:01.760]   You know, dig.com.
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:02.920]   You got to have servers.
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:03.920]   You got to have bandwidth.
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:05.560]   And you're just not going to have that revenue yet.
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:10.280]   But the other reason they always tout, you know, people like Paul Graham always say, "Well,
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:11.440]   you put the, we're mentors.
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:12.720]   We help you make connections.
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:14.320]   We bring in the right people."
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:15.320]   And all of that.
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:17.600]   And people have decided, "Yeah, I didn't really need that."
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:18.680]   And now they don't need the money.
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:19.680]   See you.
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:22.040]   Well, it's also, it's also being desegrated.
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:27.440]   You can go to General Assembly in New York and get the training that Y Combinator gave
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.400]   you without having to give up any equity.
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:30.400]   Right.
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:33.000]   So kids, the moral is keep that equity.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.440]   You can do it.
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:40.040]   Use EC3 or Google App Engine and do it yourself.
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:41.760]   It's cheap.
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:44.360]   And you know, that's what happens is they do a demo.
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:45.360]   Like look at Vine.
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:47.120]   Vine was not made at Twitter.
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:49.080]   It was bought by Twitter.
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.880]   But nobody ever saw it until Twitter bought it.
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:55.880]   It was like they probably, you know, they probably did a proof of concept on EC3 or
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:57.480]   Google App Engine.
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.960]   People looked at it and said, "Yeah, that's good.
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:46:59.960]   We'll buy it.
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:00.960]   We'll take it."
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:01.960]   Next.
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:04.440]   I love that.
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:06.000]   That's, see?
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.760]   Something positive, Jeff.
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:08.760]   Yes.
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:09.760]   Forget.
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:10.760]   Yes.
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:11.760]   I think there's two numbs this week.
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:12.760]   Yeah.
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:14.200]   Matt, do you have anything you want to share with us?
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:15.560]   Anything you're excited about?
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:16.560]   Sure.
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.560]   Absolutely.
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:22.720]   Before I was off the internet, I used my free time to work down my to-do list.
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:27.440]   And so a natural question is, "Okay, well, what's the best to-do list app for an Android
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:28.440]   device?"
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:30.800]   And there's one called Tasks.
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:34.560]   And so if you try it out, it can use multiple accounts.
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:39.200]   You can slide back and forth so you know, you can work on different sort of things.
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:43.320]   If you've learned that Raspberry Pi has gotten some funding and so you want to make that more
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:45.440]   important, you can just click and drag it up.
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:47.600]   It syncs with Google Tasks.
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:51.200]   The only downside is it costs 99 cents, so it does cost you a dollar.
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:55.640]   But there's also a free version that will be completely unrestricted for 10 days.
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:57.880]   And then after 10 days, it will start showing ads.
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:00.280]   So that's plenty of time to decide whether you like it or not.
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:03.000]   I've used a lot of different to-do kind of apps.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.320]   And this one's really nice because it uses Google Tasks for the back end.
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:11.040]   But it's just got a very polished, very jelly bean, fresh sort of UI and it works very well.
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:12.040]   It's okay, Gina.
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:13.760]   We'll never invite him back again.
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:16.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:17.720]   I'll take care of it.
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:18.720]   Don't worry.
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:21.720]   No, this is good to know because I often have people say like, hey, I want to sync
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:22.720]   the Google Tasks.
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:23.720]   Like, what's the best app to do it?
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:24.720]   That's the key for me too.
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:25.720]   And I just didn't know.
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:26.720]   Yeah.
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:31.920]   And to be fair, Gina, I had used to do, you know, in the past for a little while.
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:36.040]   It's just I really want to try to use all the Google Tasks kind of stuff.
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:38.040]   And so that was kind of a weird thing for me.
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:39.040]   Oh, of course.
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:43.600]   Yeah, this has like due date reminders.
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:47.760]   Yeah, this has got kind of like the extra to do features, which it looks really cool.
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:53.040]   And syncing the Tasks is a really nice, you know, a text file only kind of goes so far.
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:54.040]   You know what I mean?
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:55.040]   Right.
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:56.040]   With to do so.
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:57.920]   But it can work really well for simplicity.
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:00.760]   So it all depends on where you're looking, you know.
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:01.760]   Mm-hmm.
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:07.040]   Todo.txt is also for those who want to work in text files available on Android and App Store.
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:09.600]   And it's written by somebody named Gina.
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:10.600]   Trapani.
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:15.040]   I like this is this task app that was made by team tasks.
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:17.360]   I'm waiting for Google to release their official.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:20.160]   Why isn't there a Google Tasks app?
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:22.320]   The official Google Tasks to do app.
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:24.480]   I keep waiting for that to drop.
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:25.480]   That would be nice.
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:26.480]   Yeah.
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:27.920]   This looks almost like Google did it.
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:31.480]   It has that Google blue and it does look like googly.
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:32.480]   Mm-hmm.
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:33.480]   Googly.
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:34.480]   You can give me googly.
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:36.440]   Well, I want to thank you Matt Cutts for a.
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.440]   Yeah, it was great to have you back Matt.
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:40.200]   Yeah, it was good to have you on.
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:44.840]   Popping your internet cherry or whatever you call it with us here.
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:48.120]   It's nice to have you back.
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:51.360]   And anytime, anything you want to plug that you want people to know about that you're
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:54.680]   up to there besides fighting the spam on the web page there?
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:58.000]   Oh, you know, if you search on Google for webmaster video channel.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.160]   Oh, I love those.
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:02.800]   We do these webmaster videos and we haven't pushed any out for a month because I haven't
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:03.800]   been around for a month.
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:06.400]   But we're going to start consuming to push those pretty soon.
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:13.760]   If you don't already go look at that, Google webmastercentral.blogspot.com or it's on YouTube
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:16.360]   Google Webmaster help.
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:21.480]   Matt is a superstar on those and they're really great to watch.
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:23.920]   Who's this guy?
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:25.280]   That doesn't look like you.
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:27.080]   That is Jack Menzel.
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:28.640]   He'd look good in a sriracha costume.
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:30.640]   I just want to point out.
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:32.480]   I'll pass that on.
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:33.480]   When Jack.
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:34.480]   And then he'll be offended.
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:35.480]   He's like, "Why?
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:36.480]   Who's cheating on?"
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:38.480]   You know, in my country.
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:39.480]   Oh, wow.
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:47.880]   That's the Statue of Liberty sriracha bottle.
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:49.400]   Thank you very much, Matt.
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:50.400]   Cuts.
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:51.400]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:53.000]   I hope you feel better from the Davos flu.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000]   I will.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.640]   I could see you're fading fast.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:57.720]   We're going to put you to bed right now.
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:58.720]   Tuck in.
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:50:59.720]   Aw.

[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:07.520]   I wake up for a plug.
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:09.840]   And lots of-- boy, more and more I see your speeches.
