[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   Coming up on this week in Google, I.G.
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.560]   and Howl, I'm joined by Ron Richards and Matthew Ingram.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.280]   We're going to talk about a bunch of leaks ahead of Google's big hardware event that
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.880]   happens next month.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.240]   Also, we talk about the EU regulatory issues that Google's dealing with and how that might
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.200]   translate into problems here in the US.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.200]   And, you know, a whole lot more.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.640]   This week in Google is next.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.640]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.120]   Netcast, you love.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.400]   People you trust.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.760]   This is Twig.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:44.600]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.680]   This is Twig.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.600]   This week in Google, Episode 423, recorded Wednesday, September 20, 2017.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.080]   I can't hear you over the internet.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.160]   This episode of this week in Google is brought to you by Qualcomm Snapdragon Gigabit LTE.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:08.000]   To learn more about fiber optic download speeds on a smartphone, go to snapdragon.com/gigabit.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.440]   And by Felix Gray, give your eyes the break they deserve.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.280]   Felix Gray glasses filter blue light and reduce eye strain without the ugly yellow tint distortion
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.160]   of other computer glasses.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.720]   Go to phillixgrayglasses.com/twig to try a pair today.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.400]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.400]   And I'm Jason Howlio.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.640]   The port is not here.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.360]   He is traveling the world.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.640]   I don't even know what magical wonderland he is at today.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.680]   He's probably sleeping actually at this point because he's on the other side of the world.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.760]   But more power to him and I wish him the best on his travels and having a whole lot of
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.760]   fun.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.680]   Maybe I'll go to France someday too.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.680]   Who knows?
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.480]   But I have in, so I'm here in place of Leo and we have also Jeff and Stacey are both out
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.480]   today.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.200]   We've got an awesome lineup.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.560]   Starting of course with someone who you're probably already familiar with from earlier
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.640]   this week because it has been the week of Ron Richards, my co-host on all about Android.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.640]   How's it going Ron?
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.640]   It's good to be back three days in a row in the Twit camp.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.440]   This is my swan song on the week of Ron.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.960]   So thanks for having me back.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.840]   What are we going to do on this network when Ron goes down to one day a week again?
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.840]   I don't know man.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.840]   I don't know.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.280]   But you know, I do love me talking some this week in Google.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.800]   For some reason I seem to always end up getting scheduled when you're here Jason.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   That's a problem.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   I love that.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.600]   But it's fun to talk about a little more than just Android.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   I completely agree.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.160]   Also joining us and one of my favorite guests on the show and I think I've already told
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.600]   you that in the past, Matthew Ingram is here.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   Matthewingrum.com/work.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.360]   I just love your perspectives and I love the work that you do.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.360]   And it's great to have you here today Matthew.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.360]   I love you too.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.360]   Oh, shucks.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.160]   It's a total Google love fest around here.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.640]   It's a love in.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.960]   Which is kind of fitting because you know, the show is obviously, you know, it's dedicated
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.960]   to Google.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.720]   It's in the title this week in Google, which kind of ties right into the very top.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.480]   Apparently five days ago it was a Google verse or a Google.com domain was registered 20 years
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.000]   ago today if today were September 15th.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.640]   So this actually had me thinking when was you remember the first time you became aware
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   of Google and or used it?
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.840]   Oh boy, that's a good question.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.840]   Right.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.280]   So because like right around this time 1998 I was or 97, right?
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.760]   I was a I was a diehard Alta Vista guy.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.760]   Yep.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.760]   Sounds about right for that time.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.760]   It was the Alta Vista.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.760]   A lot of the yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.760]   What about dog pile?
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.760]   Do you remember that?
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.760]   I'm not a dog pile.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.760]   You can.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.760]   You can.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.760]   I don't remember.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.360]   You can search a bunch of different engines.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.360]   That's right.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.360]   That's right.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.360]   I remember wire.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.440]   At that time we came out, you know, like we're coming off of Yahoo in the mid 90s and and
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.000]   it was it was all curated and it didn't really had it wasn't really searching.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   It was just more curated, right?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Yep.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And then and then you're right.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.840]   Hotpot from Wired and then Alta Vista and then Lycos.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.840]   Lycos, yeah.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.720]   And I actually remember thinking when Google came out, I thought, hey, that's a dumb name
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.200]   and B. I thought, you know, Alta Vista is pretty good.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.040]   Like how much better could the search engine possibly be like Alta Vista finds stuff, right?
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.040]   That I need.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.040]   It's not that like it's not rocket science.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.680]   How much better could this search engine be?
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.800]   And well, that's turns out a lot better.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.360]   I do remember that as well.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.960]   Alta Vista was at the top of my list.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   It was my go to.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.280]   I don't know if it was right about this time 20 years ago today, but that seems about
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.280]   right.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.280]   20 years ago.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.800]   I know, Alta Vista was like the game changer for me.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.920]   I'm like, wow, this is actually giving powerful results.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.640]   And I remember playing with Ink tome.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.640]   Do you remember Ink tome?
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.640]   Yes.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.640]   Yeah, right.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.640]   Imposeeek.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.280]   Yeah, it was a it was a it was a a wasteland of search engines out there in the late 90s.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.640]   Well, we just didn't know we didn't have the body of knowledge around what search could
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.640]   be.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.120]   And now it feels so dominated.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.400]   I mean, you know, we've got some stories potentially in the lineup for today that are
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.600]   talking about how tech as you know, as an industry and especially the big four, the
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.560]   big, the major tech companies are kind of at a point of inflection right now.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.720]   We're suddenly all eyes are turning onto them and saying, Hey, wait a minute, maybe
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.080]   you control too much.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.360]   20 years ago today, sir, sir, here was a lot more innocent.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.600]   That's just the all you can see about that.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   I remember writing at the time I was writing financial stories for a newspaper in Toronto.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.080]   I was writing about the stock market.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.960]   I wrote about Google's IPO in particular because it was an unusual kind of IPO.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.640]   It was a Dutch auction.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.080]   If you want to know details anyway, it at the time it was unusual.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.920]   Their shareholders letter like founder's letter was unusual.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.880]   The fact that they were going to keep so much control is unusual.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.520]   And I remember writing a column.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.640]   The consensus was that this stock was not going to be that great because there were lots
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.440]   of other search engines.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.520]   Google didn't really have that much to bring to the table as far as anyone could tell.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.880]   It certainly didn't have a business model at the time.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:26.760]   And so everybody was like, it sounds great and it's got a weird name and but should you
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.760]   buy it?
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.920]   Probably not.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.920]   So interesting.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.720]   Some dumb move there historically.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.200]   Yeah, you never really know that stuff back at the time, but it also had a very simplistic
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.920]   approach and that's something that they've carried forward for a long time.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.720]   That definitely helped it back then because things are, you know, the web was a pretty
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.720]   noisy place.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.800]   It still really is.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.960]   But when it came to search, that was one of the few places that you could go and feel
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.600]   like you weren't bombarded by a million other things at the same time.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.760]   Well, it was also I was just I also remember when Google first came out and what I first
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.120]   discovered it had to have been.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.480]   I wasn't as early as 97.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.960]   And I would be lying if I was like, I was there early on, but realistically probably
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.040]   like late 98, 99 is what I call wind of it.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:18.640]   But the two things that attracted me to it was just the plain white, minimal design.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.560]   And you just got results.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.600]   And this is before they rolled out the add model and things like that.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.240]   And then also the gimmick of the I'm feeling lucky button.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.640]   I think that was the thing that someone's like, oh, have you seen this?
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.640]   You just hit this button.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.640]   It goes anywhere on the web.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:39.160]   And it's like, and that was having a fun approach to search that the other ones like
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.680]   Altavista while it was great was very it was from digital.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.160]   It was IT driven.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.960]   It was very bare bones and very boring.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.520]   So Google brought a little fun to the table, I thought, at least at that time.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.440]   Well, and at the time the Google, the big criticism was sort of no business model, but
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:03.520]   then they quickly basically borrowed a business model from Overture and Bill Groves.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:12.400]   But it was that was probably the single best kind of accidentally like backing into a business
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.240]   model that we've ever seen certainly in my lifetime.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.440]   The amount of value that that has generated is mind boggling.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.440]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.280]   Well, because he's really right around the IPO.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.880]   I mean, I remember the flurry, I mean, we didn't see maps or Gmail or all the things that we
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.200]   associate with Google till the mid 2000s, like 2003, right?
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.640]   Like around there, like I remember the flurry to get a Gmail account, like you need to get
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.680]   a beta invite and all this sort of stuff.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.040]   But at the time in the 90s, it was just search and it was just that, you know, ads against
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.560]   search and for some reason it stuck out.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:53.480]   And I remember, I remember the day I switched, you know, to Google as my primary search engine.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.920]   And when I switched from IE to Firefox as my primary browser, those were like two big
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.720]   days and like 99, 2000, I remember happening.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.440]   Now what about switching from Firefox to Chrome though, Ron?
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.880]   That was probably '06, '07 maybe, like a little later.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.280]   Yeah, same time for me too.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.240]   I mentioned to Leo the other day when I was on that one of the big moments for me, Google
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:22.880]   wise was when they launched Google Earth, I'd seen Google before, which they acquired.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.880]   But Google Earth was a mind-boggling.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:31.800]   It was one of those moments when, like even as a jaded sort of tech reporter, I felt like
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.600]   man, we are living in the future.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.640]   Like this is, you can zoom in.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.240]   It's like science fiction.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.360]   I completely agree.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.080]   It made the world feel accessible, which is exactly what it was doing, right?
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.200]   It allowed you to really just pick a location on the globe and say, "I want to see what's
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.600]   happening there," or what happened there at a certain point in time.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.400]   Before that, it was just never that easy and never...
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400]   Exactly.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.400]   It was a really cool tool.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.400]   What element is it?
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.400]   It's really cool, yeah.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.400]   And Street View too.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.400]   I mean, Street View.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.400]   I mean, Street View.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.400]   I'm Street View.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.680]   The newspaper newsroom shut down.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.120]   Like productivity dropped probably to zero because everybody had to go check out their
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.360]   street and their house.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:17.240]   And I had a woman I worked with who let out this scream and I asked her what was wrong.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.920]   And she said, "Look at my house."
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.760]   And if she went by her house, she had been getting her groceries out of the car when
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.840]   the Google car went by.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.520]   So it was basically just her butt.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.280]   She had bent over into the car.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.200]   And she was like, "Oh my God."
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.360]   And I said, "Don't worry.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.360]   Like a year from now, they'll get some new shots."
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.720]   No, the internet is forever, but not Street View.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.720]   Yeah, Street View.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.720]   They refresh those things.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.720]   So you're okay.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.840]   So before we move on, I just ran into a very funny Google-esque thing.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.240]   Because I wanted to, we're having this little nostalgia trip and I wanted to pull up like,
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.120]   when did certain Google products come out and things like that?
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.480]   So I just went to Google and wrote Google history.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.360]   And the search results I got were welcome to my activity to find your search history.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.760]   And then it's all about viewing and controlling your account.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.000]   And I can't actually find the history of Google because I'm getting all the results about
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.160]   my history with Google and shows you how it provides you.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160]   How pervasive is becoming our lives?
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.760]   That's actually in terms of the thing that makes the biggest difference to me sort of
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.720]   on the day-to-day basis with Google, it's not, you know, Google Maps is great and everything.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.960]   But Google Photos changed my life in a lot of ways.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:31.320]   I mean, just having everything there, having it searchable all the time, being able to
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:36.240]   just type in my daughter's name and photos come up.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.000]   It's really, it's simple.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.240]   But it did change things for me significantly.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:47.360]   And also looking at it in the context of 20 years ago, 1997 was also the year that Ask
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.760]   Jeeves came out, which is now Ask.com, which at the time I had trained myself in using
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.000]   Altavista to do keyword-based search.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.960]   Realistically in this Google search for Google history, I should have searched Google Company
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.080]   history and that would get me better results.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.520]   But I remember at the time, Ask was like, you just ask it a question and it's natural
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.400]   language and that'll never work.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.760]   But I realized a couple of years ago, and Jason, I think we talked about this on another show
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.480]   a while back, more often than not, I'm not doing keyword searches on Google these days.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.960]   I'm doing what is the temperature in Chicago right now?
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.320]   And I'm asking Google natural language questions and it's answering me.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.240]   Google has formatted its business around that, right, with a system with Google Voice Search
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.560]   and everything like that there.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.400]   Keep continues to strive towards a more conversational approach.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.520]   But yeah, I remember that back then and I remember using Ask.com and going, wow, this
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.520]   is really cool.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.600]   I don't have to think of a syntax or whatever.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.000]   I just asked it a question and it didn't always work the way you expected it to.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.440]   But you can see where that led to.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.080]   I mean, that's really where we're at right now with Google's muscle behind it.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.720]   That's what we have and it's super effective.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.720]   It's awesome.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.560]   And I've noticed that the natural language questions work way better.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:06.480]   So if I just search keywords like record, phone calls, Skype, Chromebook or whatever,
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.880]   which I was doing recently, I don't get as good results as if I type in, how do I record
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.080]   a Skype call on my Chromebook?
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.080]   Right.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.080]   That's interesting.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.240]   Well, Google, we love you.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.360]   That's why we're here and that's why we just spent 10 minutes talking about your 20-year
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.360]   anniversary.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.360]   Hey, Nastalza Tripp signed me up for any time.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.840]   But I'm surprised they haven't done some sort of like tri-Google in and a year, you know,
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.840]   and it will change.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.840]   Yeah, that would be cool.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.840]   It would look like how it did in 2000 or something.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.480]   Yeah, that would be really cool.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.880]   They should totally do that.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.080]   Oh, there you go, Google.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.080]   It's a free marketing idea.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.080]   There you go.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.080]   It's Cunar's listening.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.720]   For their 25th anniversary, just for the day even.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   Cunar's listening.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.720]   Well, yes.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.720]   Of course.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.720]   We know he is.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.440]   Cunar is a big fan of Jason and I.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.200]   So we're a positive that he tunes in anytime we're talking about Google.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:01.560]   Cunar's not quite a friend of the show, but in a technical sense yet.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.720]   We have yet to interview Cunar on the show.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.280]   But once we do, he will, and I'm sure it'll happen, he will become friend of the show.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.280]   Maybe it'll happen on this weekend.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.920]   I'm willing to give him future friend of the show designation.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.720]   He's going to be a friend of the show.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.600]   He's a little creeped out right now.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.560]   All right, so hey, why don't we talk about, I think this was the big news yesterday and
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:27.640]   it's kind of a, you know, like here we are to spoil the party, but droid life went on
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.680]   a tear if you didn't know yesterday.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.840]   If you were waiting for Google's upcoming announcement of their new pixel lineup of
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:40.760]   devices we knew because Google had posted a video teasing something happening on October
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.760]   4th.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.920]   It was a short video kind of a little cryptic, you know, do you want better battery life?
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.960]   You know, do you want your phone to be smarter?
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.960]   It asked all these questions.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.360]   It didn't really announce an actual event.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.560]   Well since then Google has sent out a press invites for an official event that happens
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:03.760]   on October 4th in San Francisco, 9 AM Pacific, 12 PM Eastern, and that's exactly a year from
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.720]   this time last year when Google showed off its first generation pixel devices.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:14.360]   So we know what's in store, particularly because droid life spoiled the party and revealed
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.760]   literally, well, I mean, maybe they didn't reveal everything, but they revealed everything
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.200]   that anybody was waiting for.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.680]   And so we can go through these piece by piece, but I think, you know, obviously the new pixel
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.320]   devices is something that everybody's looking forward to.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:37.400]   They're called the Google Pixel 2 and the Google Pixel 2 XL, a whole variety of colors.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.800]   You know, in fact, this one, the XL has like a two tone color with the glass on top and
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.000]   then, you know, the white bottom part of the phone.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.400]   And so in many ways looks very similar to last year's models, but with some changes.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.520]   But the cost, I think the cost is pretty in line as well too, right?
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:02.880]   Like the smaller Pixel 2 which has HTC's involvement comes in around $649 for 64 gig,
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.080]   749 for the 128 gig.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.360]   And this is what you're seeing right now, the Pixel 2 with HTC.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:16.840]   And then the larger one, the XL comes in around $849 for 64 gigs or $949 for 128 gigs.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.800]   So we are in premium smartphone territory.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.880]   Matthew, what is your phone?
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.880]   What's your daily driver?
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.640]   Is it an iPhone or do you have the Pixel phones or what do you have?
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.960]   I actually just upgraded.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.120]   I've got a Samsung Galaxy S7.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.400]   So that I had an LG, I had an XS6.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.080]   I like the Nexus 6 actually.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:48.280]   And I do, even though I have a Galaxy now, they were having a deal, my carrier.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.120]   So I did like having a Google phone.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:58.120]   I did like having like a lack of crap where from Samsung or whoever I liked having just
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.400]   sort of Google experience.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.440]   And I liked getting updates, you know, as soon as they were pushed out instead of waiting
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.200]   for Samsung or whoever to push them out.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.800]   So I've definitely thought about the Pixel.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.480]   It's a little out of my price range.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.600]   Like I'm trying to keep cost down.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.040]   I can't like, I'm not Leo.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.120]   I can't buy every phone, you know, that comes out for $1,200.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.280]   It just seems like.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:27.240]   And I was not, I was like the X iPhone, a 10 or X or whatever.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.600]   And the cost of these phones is just astronomical.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.360]   I've got kids in university.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.200]   I can't spend, you know, $2,000 on a phone.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:41.000]   Yeah, $1,000 every year because we are addicted to upgrading our phones every year, for some
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   reason.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.240]   Yeah, what, I mean, what do you think, Ron?
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.320]   I know that you are kind of at a point right now.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:52.640]   You just got the Pixel because you're an expert Robin crapped out not too long ago.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.320]   So you got that second hand, but are you thinking, you might, I mean, sometimes Google
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.880]   has like a trade in value sort of thing, maybe trade up.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.040]   Yeah, I'm going to, I mean, I'm going to keep it open mind.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.880]   I will think, you know, we talked a little bit about this last night on all about Android
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.280]   and I was, I was thinking about it this morning.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.120]   And I'm really, if these leaks are too, are true, I'm a little disappointed.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.960]   Similar to how I was disappointed last year that these are all high end flagship price
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.040]   level phones and there's not a three 99 version.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:26.760]   You know, I would love, I would love Google to take the pure Android experience and make
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.360]   it more affordable for people.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.600]   And last time at the Pixel, they had a great financing option and it was exclusive with
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.400]   Verizon, which always has a subsidized phones and that sort of thing.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.640]   But you know, I get that they want to show this is the best that Android can do.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.680]   But apart from me, it'd think it'd be great if they put out a OnePlus competitor or a,
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.880]   you know, like that mid range phone as an option.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.600]   You know, because honestly, that's been, you know, like the Pixel, I did get a second
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.000]   hand pixel and that's been the closest to a flagship phone I've ever had, Jason.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   You know this.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.480]   And I had kind of the middle of the road, you know, the kind of, you know, what Google put
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.480]   out.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.600]   The Nexus 5 was three 99.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.920]   So you know, so while I think these phones are nice and new hot and sexy kind of new
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.520]   models, I wish there was a little more affordable option.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.440]   Yeah, I do too.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.960]   And I think they could do it.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.560]   I mean, they certainly, there's nothing stopping them.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:24.360]   I guess they just want to be, you know, they want, they want to sexify Android phones a
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.840]   little bit, which is fun.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.000]   Yeah, they want to boost the brand image.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.640]   It really seems like because they have to, I mean, I think we even said this last year,
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.040]   they have to justify the cost.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.440]   Why does your phone almost cost $1,000?
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:43.160]   That's an insane price, you know, price category for that to fall into.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.800]   And is that going to limit people buying the phone?
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:51.200]   I mean, do we feel like the Pixel experiment, one year in paid off for Google?
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.520]   I think Google, I don't know if their intention out right out of the gate was to be a Samsung.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:01.200]   But I mean, I've seen some out in the wild, not in an overwhelming amount, not nothing
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.240]   close to what you see with Samsung, but Google's done all right with that, right?
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.000]   From a marketing standpoint.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   I think they have.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.840]   I don't know sort of revenue wise, whether it's making a big difference for them.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.840]   I've certainly seen lots of people talking about it.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.800]   I can't say that I've seen that many.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.360]   I mean, I'm in Canada, so maybe that has something to do with it.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:30.200]   But I do kind of wish the, you know, to Ron's point, the Android phones have had kind of
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   a reputation that their, their down market, you know, their cheap phones for sort of nerds.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.560]   And I can see that they want to try to move up the kind of scale a little bit.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.320]   But I don't see why they couldn't do both at the same time.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.880]   Yeah, agreed.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:51.080]   I think that a part of it is that I think it's, the pixels have been a success for Google,
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.280]   because clearly they're doing it again.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.760]   I think they're not scrapping the program or anything like that.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:59.600]   And if the rumors, Jason, we were talking about this over email earlier, if the rumors
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:05.720]   are true that Google might be, you know, hovering around HTC and purchasing their phone business,
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:10.440]   it's the, it appears as if it's so good that they are getting in bed with a manufacturer.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.520]   And then clearly it's working on some level.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:17.520]   But I don't know what the, what the goal is internally inside Google is the goal to just
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.800]   have a presence and be on the shelf at the carrier stores.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.520]   Or is it to set the expectation for the OEMs to follow?
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.120]   Or is it to compete with Samsung?
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.800]   You know, like there's so many different ways to approach it.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.960]   And I, you know, going back to, you know, future front of the show Sundar, I don't know
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.960]   what their goal with the strategy is with these phones.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.200]   Yeah, that's why we need to have Sundar on and say, what is the goal with these phones
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   Sundar?
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.080]   And I'm going to say thank you for a new video.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:46.280]   But we would get, we would get the stock marketing answer to be like, do we want to make a phone
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:50.720]   that shows what Andrew can do and the pure Google experience and all that sort of stuff?
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.280]   I mean, I could hear him saying it.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.680]   He said it at last year's event.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.280]   We've seen that.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.440]   But from a sales standpoint, like, I don't know if Google wants to compete with Samsung,
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:05.040]   you know, the sheer volume of fun, like is Samsung being in the Android phone business
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.040]   good for Google?
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   Yeah, it is.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.040]   Absolutely.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.960]   Yeah, because increasing Android's market share, right?
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.760]   So yeah, it definitely does not seem like the goal for Google is to push all of its partners
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.000]   out the door and be like, nope, we've got the only phone that anybody ever wants.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.920]   It seems just like, like a part of me almost feels like Google's doing it because they
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.200]   feel like they have to do it.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.680]   Like we have to have hardware that has our name on it.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:31.280]   We're Google and we make the phone system and, you know, we make the system that it
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.680]   runs on.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.240]   And of course, everyone expects for us to have it.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.440]   We're like Apple, we have our hardware, right?
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.360]   But they also have others, others doing it.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.200]   But you mentioned the HTC deal.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.560]   So why don't we just talk about that right now?
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.840]   Google apparently might be in a position to announce an acquisition of HTC.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.240]   And we've been hearing rumors about HTC.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:58.240]   I mean, well, we know HTC as a company has been hurting in a world of hurt, just to say
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   the least.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:06.600]   Their shares have fallen 94% since their heyday in 2011, which I've loved HTC's hardware
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.680]   early on, especially in the early days of Android, they were doing some really awesome
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.680]   things.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.840]   They were doing design and build quality and all this stuff before a lot of competitors
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.840]   were.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.400]   They were really focused on that and that really set them apart.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.200]   But they've really kind of fallen to the wayside over the last however many years.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.960]   So lots of rumors about HTC and its business and what's going to happen.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.440]   I feel like we've been hearing about this for two, three, four years now.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:36.000]   And then very recently about the possibility of Google snapping it up when we can compare
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.440]   this to another time in the history of Google when it snapped up a hardware manufacturer
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.240]   of Motorola and did that.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.760]   And then a couple of years ago later sold it off.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.800]   So we don't know this for sure though.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:55.080]   This is news that supposedly could come out soon because HTC halted its stock trading
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:24:01.880]   in Taiwan today, I believe, ahead of what they say as an announcement later this week.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.880]   Could this be the announcement?
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:07.720]   Does this make sense to you, Matthew, that this would happen that Google should buy a
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.120]   company like HTC?
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.600]   Yeah, I think it makes sense.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:17.520]   I mean, to be honest, I thought Motorola made sense, but obviously it turned out not to.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.600]   And there were issues with Motorola that maybe aren't the case with HTC.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.000]   I think in a lot of ways it does make sense for Google to kind of be vertically integrated
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.920]   that way as much as possible.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.680]   It gives them a lot more control over costs, gives them a lot more control over sort of
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.440]   margins and stuff like that.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.080]   So I could see it at the right price.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.640]   It sounds like HTC is probably going to be pretty cheap.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.080]   I mean, 300 million or something like that.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.080]   What is that?
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:48.640]   Like to Google, that's like, you know, they can find that behind the cushions of the couch
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.160]   and send ours office probably.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.240]   Sundar sneezes that into a tissue when he has allergies.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.240]   That's what that is.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.240]   She said that that mental image just.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.160]   Sorry, I don't know where that came from.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.160]   He sneezes money.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.960]   Yeah, that is kind of weird.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.360]   I mean, it was points that would hurt.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.560]   Yeah, it would.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.560]   It would.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:13.680]   Although if I sneezed money came out of my nose, I'd be sneezing all the damn time.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.680]   Just say it.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.200]   If it was it was Nichols, he'd be like, Oh my God, my nose hurts so much.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.000]   It's going to save me a long time for retirement.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.600]   I'm so close to $150.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:30.680]   But if they are going down this route with HCC, it's hardware go round round two, like
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.680]   we said.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:35.680]   And I'd be wondering what they've learned from the Motorola experience that led them
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.120]   to sell that business to Lenovo.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.560]   And do they think they're in a better position now?
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.000]   Rick Osterlo is now with Google.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.120]   He was a high up guy at Motorola in terms of the product side of things.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.960]   It seems as if the pieces on the chessboard are in a better position for Google to take
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.520]   on hardware development than when they had Motorola a few years ago.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:06.840]   And it also sounds like HTC might not be selling off the HTC Vive division to Google.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.960]   Although I could totally see that working too.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.240]   Like why not have that?
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:16.120]   You know, Facebook has Oculus, Google has its own kind of VR division and it's the smartphone
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.120]   level of VR.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.320]   They're not have a premium level VR with the Vive.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.320]   But that wouldn't happen.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:29.360]   Also, Eve Leakes, Evan Blass has a source that makes him think that the brand, the HTC
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.440]   brand, might not even be on the table.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:38.120]   So it would be kind of the hardware mechanism of HTC that comes over to Google and not necessarily
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.720]   the HTC brand that stays behind.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.840]   And that's actually, I don't think that's bad either because what, you know, when we
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.840]   talk to me.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.800]   Yeah, when we talked about Google and hardware, we've said, okay, listen, they partnered
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.960]   with folks to design and then to produce these things.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:57.280]   The reason why they went to ACES for the tablets, tablets or HTC for phones or LG for phones
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.760]   is because they lacked the supply chain and the manufacturing.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.280]   And that's what this gives them.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.000]   So, you know, so, you know, they don't need the HTC brand.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   They just need the phone.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.840]   And honestly, I like their, I like HTC phones.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.440]   I mean, squeezeable buttons aside.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.960]   I think HTC has done some pretty good stuff for Android over the years.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.960]   Well, squeezeable.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:22.960]   Especially, especially if HTC's, you know, what contributes all the hardware for the pixel,
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:28.040]   if they really want the pixel to be, you know, a symbol of what Google can do with hardware
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.400]   and software, then it makes sense for them to own that whole thing beginning to end.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.400]   Yeah, agreed.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.240]   Well, apparently we're not going to have to wait very long to hear what this announcement
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:43.280]   is. I don't know what else it could be. Maybe it's something entirely unrelated.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.760]   But we will certainly find out.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.120]   And yeah, I mean, like I said, they've halted their shares.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.600]   They have a major announcement.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.200]   So it sounds pretty critical. Sounds like a pretty big deal.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.400]   This would fall into line with that.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.800]   There are other things that have been leaked.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.960]   And we will talk about those.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.560]   But before we do that, let's take a quick break and thank the sponsor.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.440]   And then we'll get back to, well, I'm really looking forward to this pixel book.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.560]   And I know if Jeff Jarvis was on, he'd have a lot to say about it.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.200]   You'll hear from him another time.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.960]   We're going to talk about that after the break though.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:17.880]   So let's thank the sponsor, which is Qualcomm Snapdragon gigabit LTE.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:22.520]   We've all experienced the effects of cellular network congestion.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:27.600]   It's no fun. It just, it slows you down in your tracks and crowded environments, airports,
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:33.440]   shopping malls, all types of busy areas, your favorite apps can become barely usable.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.440]   They're just not working the way you know they should be.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:42.240]   That's why Snapdragon gigabit LTE was designed to deliver the fastest mobile connectivity
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.040]   and help speed things up in crowded places.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:50.920]   With additional lanes for your data to flow on and the ability to squeeze more speed from
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:58.560]   each LTE connection, Snapdragon gigabit LTE is like driving in a much wider, much faster
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.560]   data highway.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.400]   Everything moves smoother.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:07.600]   And average LTE download speeds are up to seven times faster than typical home Wi-Fi.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.720]   You're going to notice the speed difference.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.320]   It can turbocharge all of your connected apps.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.240]   Makes things run seamlessly.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:21.240]   Stream 360 degree videos in YouTube VR and 4K resolution with minimal buffering or stuttering.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.600]   That's kind of the dream right there.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:28.080]   You can access all of your files in the cloud nearly as fast as you would if they were stored
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:33.880]   on your phone, which is the supreme kind of goal I think of cloud file storage.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.680]   You want it to feel like it's a locally connected drive.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.360]   And you get that with Qualcomm Snapdragon gigabit LTE.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.920]   You can download hours of movies or music in a matter of seconds, load Android instant
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.880]   apps almost instantly, obviously.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.080]   It's in the name there, but it makes it feel like it's an app that you already had installed
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.240]   because it happened so fast.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.880]   Like the most of your unlimited data plan to learn more about faster network connections
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:08.400]   in crowded places, all you have to do is visit snapdragon.com/gigabit/snapdragon.com/gigabit.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:15.160]   We thank Qualcomm Snapdragon gigabit LTE for their support of this week in Google.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:19.160]   Some of the other things that were leaked out by DroidLife and we can kind of pick these
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.160]   apart here.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.760]   We don't have to go too deep on the daydream VR headsets because I think they're just kind
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.760]   of like a little spruce up.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:33.440]   Yeah, it's a little refinement of the design as well as a more expensive price tag.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.080]   Yeah, apparently 20 bucks more.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.400]   So it was 80 prior and supposedly when this is announced in a couple of weeks is going
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.560]   to be right around 100 bucks.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:47.000]   So they will have to yet again kind of justify the cost or maybe they don't have to.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Maybe they just put it out.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   It comes in coral.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.160]   So coral is the new Google hotness, by the way.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.840]   That coral color is everybody wants it.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.080]   Yeah, they just like saying coral.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:03.640]   No, I really think that this price changes as a cost adjustment.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:09.200]   I think the original daydream VR, they priced it too low or based on the sales.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.800]   And I think this is a math thing.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.160]   I think that's why they're raising the price.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:18.400]   No internal tracking embedded inside of the headset hardware for 20 bucks more.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:23.560]   In a sweatpants material visor, I don't think so.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:30.400]   Yeah, maybe it has an embedded headband for so for sopping up the forehead sweat.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.720]   Sorry, this episode is getting gross.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.720]   I apologize.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.320]   Google Home Mini is another another thing that we're going to find out about.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.360]   We had been hearing rumors about this and well, we still are, but we have pictures to
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.360]   go with those rumors here.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.000]   It's like a squished Google home.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.640]   And it has four LEDs on top, little, almost looks like a hockey puck sort of thing comes
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:32:00.840]   in a few colors, including like you just said, coral, because corals, the new hotness, $49
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.320]   for these once they are announced and they're released.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.840]   I feel like we're reporting on an announcement.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.680]   Nothing's been announced, but we have everything.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:15.800]   It's all rumors, but I was just thinking, if you're, let's say you haven't kind of bought
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:23.160]   into Google Home or you haven't bought into Google, having services like that, 49 bucks
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.200]   is like, you know, why not?
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.200]   Why not try one?
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.200]   Nothing to sneeze at.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.200]   Right.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.200]   And then if you like it, buy a couple more, like 50 bucks.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.760]   I mean, honestly, yeah, at that at that at that forty nine price point, forty nine dollar
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.000]   price point, I'm, you know, take my money, sign me up.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   I'm going to get one for the bedroom done deal.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Yeah, why not?
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.920]   You know, I think that's exactly the, the purpose, right?
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.280]   Like I have a Google home in my kitchen, the full size Google home, because that's all
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:56.240]   we have right now, yet in the fan, the Google home family of devices, have one in the kitchen,
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.240]   one of the living room.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.680]   I can't, I can't really think of another room that I have to have the full size thing
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.080]   in that I would justify, you know, spending a hundred thirty bucks for.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.400]   But yeah, 50 bucks to just drop it in there, low footprint.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.360]   So it's, it's not, you know, taking up a huge corner of the room.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.360]   I'd be out for that.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.720]   It's going to, it could replace the alarm clock.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.600]   It, it, you know, whether you get your morning briefing, you know, like it, it, it having
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:25.600]   a spot in the, I've already seen my sister is a Amazon Echo Cup family.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:30.880]   And they, they put the echo in the kitchen and then echo dots in all the bedrooms.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.840]   So the kids are have their alarm clock.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.840]   They listen to music.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.480]   They, they, they use it as the intercom system.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:41.680]   Like having these devices in the individual rooms in a house is a great application of
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.680]   this technology.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.760]   So I'm glad that Google, I'm glad that this is the next step.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.720]   And we wanted this when we went at IO.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.520]   Remember, we were hoping for a, a smaller lower price home device.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.640]   And I'm glad that we're getting it or, or might be getting it if these leaks are, or
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.920]   to believe, to believe.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.960]   And that way Google can record you in every room and then use your voice to enhance its
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.960]   algorithms.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.960]   It's comprehensive.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:08.560]   Keep a, keep a running catalog of everything you've ever asked to ask it or said on your
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:14.000]   Google account summary, which you can get to very easily and listen to those recordings,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.520]   which by the way, I think we've mentioned on the show before is hilarious to do.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.640]   How many times they've fired off accidentally.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:23.240]   You hear very random moments of your life played back for you.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:26.600]   Just go back and search Google history and Google and you'll find it in the first.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.600]   Exactly.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.600]   That should be your end of show tip, Ron.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   Yeah, there it is.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.680]   That's how you get to it easily.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.240]   And because it's smaller, you have to imagine that means that the speaker system on it
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:39.040]   is way less, is far less robust than what you get on the larger version.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:43.360]   So if you're thinking about, every room can have a nice speaker for all of my music, I'm
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:49.200]   sure it'll be able to be another point in your kind of matrix of Google homes to interconnect
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.400]   for playing music and stuff.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.800]   It just probably won't sound nearly as good in those places.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.840]   So if that's a priority to you, I'm guessing you'll want to keep that in mind.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.840]   Yeah, I think it would, I imagine it would be as good as like a Bluetooth speaker, a
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.840]   small one.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.600]   I don't think it's going to compete with Sonos or something like that.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.760]   But I do love that feature about having multiple Google homes, playing in the same thing in
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.480]   multiple rooms, simultaneously, you know, all synced up.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:17.720]   It's, you know, it's great for dance parties, which we have all the time.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.720]   I have two girls.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.320]   So of course we do.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:26.120]   And then finally, I'm really excited about this, even though it's incredibly expensive,
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.400]   but I've been waiting for it and I've been waiting for years.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.680]   I know Jeff Jarvis has as well.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:34.600]   I'm curious to know what you guys think, the Google Pixel book, which is a Chromebook,
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:40.240]   you know, they, I think their last Chromebook pixel came out in 2015.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.120]   I'm still using the one from 2014 and I've had a hard time moving away from it.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.080]   Got it right here.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:52.280]   Hard time moving away from it for any of the other Chromebook options, just because I
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.760]   love the build quality.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.520]   I feel like it's, it's been powerful enough to do everything I need for the past four
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.280]   or five years, four years or so.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.120]   And so I've been waiting for an update.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:11.280]   Here you go, 128 gigs for 1199, supposedly, all the way up to 512 gigs for 1749.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:18.240]   So this is a Chromebook competing with regular, like full powered laptop on price.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.960]   Well, I don't know if that's competing on price price similarly.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.200]   I don't know if they're competing because I don't know how capable it is compared to
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:29.800]   those, but it does include the ability to use a pen.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.560]   You get it for another 99 bucks.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:37.160]   The Pixel book pen that'll have precious sensitivity, tilt support, no lag.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:41.820]   So I'm sure we'll hear something about how Chrome OS is, is better, you know, has some
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:44.640]   sort of stylus support to go along with that.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.320]   And the whole thing folds into a tablet.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.720]   So you can run your Android apps in tablet mode and all that kind of stuff.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.720]   I know I'm getting one.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:54.760]   I'm getting, I probably won't get the premium, you know, 512 gigs one.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.520]   But I'll get the 128 gig one.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.520]   Sure.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.520]   That's all I need.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.520]   What do you guys think?
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.360]   It's very expensive.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.360]   It's very expensive.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.360]   Yeah, I was going to say that.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:10.480]   I mean, I could buy a backbook here roughly the same price.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:15.800]   I don't, to be honest, I don't like, I like the Chromebooks and I like, I've been using
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.680]   one for the past like three, four months and it's an old one.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.680]   So it's a little underpowered, but I have no problems with it.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.440]   And I like the idea that these have better build quality.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:31.080]   They're not kind of, they don't feel as sort of low end or cheap.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.400]   But do, do I need some of the returns into a tablet?
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.400]   No.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   Do I need a stylus?
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.400]   Probably not.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.680]   So then those things are going to be lost on me.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.280]   Are that many people really going to use this thing and turn it into a sort of clamshell
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.280]   tablet?
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.280]   I, maybe.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:52.200]   I mean, I, I think that, and I said this last night on all, but Android, but not for
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.560]   those who didn't watch that.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:59.680]   I think that this is a lot of Google competing with Microsoft in the Surface books.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:05.080]   What Surface has been doing with styluses and creativity and in the classroom and making,
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:11.320]   like Microsoft is making a run at Apple to, to woo back artists with the Surface Studio,
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.960]   those big desktops and things like that.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.320]   And they've been, you know, they've really been pushing those Surface convertible laptops,
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.520]   laptop, tablet combinations.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:22.160]   And I think Google sees Microsoft making headway in that space and saying, okay, well,
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:26.200]   this is us competing with that because ultimately Google wants to get in the classroom as well,
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.200]   too.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.720]   But at this price point, it's not realistic for, you know, create, creative types who are
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:37.080]   notoriously, you know, starving artists as well as education where there's never enough
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.160]   money for education.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.160]   So it's.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.480]   And it's not just that.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:46.560]   I mean, if, if you're a creative type and you want to do things with a stylus, you're probably
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.080]   going to want to install software.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:52.400]   You're probably going to want all sorts of graphics, you know, software and there are
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.040]   cloud versions of those, most of them, but they're, you know, they're not as full featured
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.960]   as the ones you can install.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:04.760]   The original Chromebook Pixel launched back in the one I have right here launched back
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:05.760]   in 2013.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.840]   You love that thing.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.520]   And it's, yeah, I love it.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.600]   But with an asterisk, which I'll talk about in a second.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.200]   I was at the launch actually.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.440]   So there you go.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   And I mean, we.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.440]   I'm at the time.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:22.880]   So I was in San Francisco and I mean, I'm guessing because the price point is the same.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.560]   Well, it's not the same, but it's very close.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:30.880]   Then the price point entry level was 1299 or you get a 1449 with an LTE connections,
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:35.000]   nothing about an LTE connection on the new version, at least in the leaks anyways.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.800]   So I guess we'll find out.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:41.200]   My asterisk Ron is that I didn't buy this.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.160]   We got it as a Google I/O and out for one of the years of Google I/O.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.640]   So then I have to ask myself back then, would I have ever put down, dropped down the money
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.640]   for it?
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.360]   And the answer would have been no.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.480]   At this point, I would put down the money for it because I've grown to really love this
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.720]   machine and I've used it so much over the years.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.200]   And I realized that it's under power.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.760]   Like, I realized that it's under capable.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.760]   What is the right word?
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:11.720]   Not as capable as a full, you know, blown like MacBook Pro or whatever.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.000]   But that's not why I use it.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.640]   I use it because it's super light.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:19.880]   It does exactly what I need to do on the shows here and it's great for travel.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:28.040]   And having one that I feel, you know, the same kind of like I like good design and everything
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:32.040]   about the build quality of this laptop makes me happy, I guess.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:36.120]   So I guess from to that degree, I don't mind spending a little bit more than $1,000 on
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:39.480]   a new one that's going to last me four or five years, which is what this has done.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:45.200]   Have you ever found anything that you wanted to do that you couldn't do on the Chromebook?
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:50.160]   I mean, there are things that it obviously does not do, but I'm fine with that because
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.200]   I have other solutions for that, right?
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.280]   Like I have a desktop computer at home.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:59.320]   And if I really need to do some of those like video editing or audio editing, I wouldn't
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.600]   want to do it on laptop anyways.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.000]   I hate doing that stuff on a laptop.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.560]   I like doing it on a desktop.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.920]   So maybe that's the trade off, right?
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.880]   I have another computer at home that can do those things or at work here.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.640]   You know, it's a desktop setup in my office.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:19.040]   But this just gets relegated specifically to my browsing, which is like 99% of what I
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.920]   ever do anyways.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.360]   And it's a nice one.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.120]   Instead of having like a built out of plastic thing where the trackpad feels all hollow
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:33.280]   when I tap it and everything like that, I feel like it's a MacBook Pro with Chrome OS.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.080]   And for some reason that works for me.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.560]   And that's only, I mean, that didn't happen initially.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.960]   When I first got it, I was scratching my head going, why would I ever buy this?
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.680]   But over the years, it's really won me over.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:50.800]   And when I've been using, since I've been using this Chromebook, I have found it useful
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.680]   for almost everything.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:58.480]   Since it is a little underpowered, it has problems streaming, you know, high quality
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.080]   video, for example, to the TV.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.920]   But that I can understand it's an old Chromebook.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:08.240]   It was my daughters before we got her an error.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:13.480]   But I have, so I've been thinking next computer I get, why don't I just get the Pixel, for
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.480]   example.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:19.280]   But there's like one or two things that I do that it can't do.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:24.280]   And so then I wonder if it's not going to be, if I can't use it as my main computer,
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:29.960]   like I can't figure out how to record Skype calls, for example, there's no plugin that
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:30.960]   works.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.280]   So Skype works fine.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:35.000]   But for my job, I need to record those calls.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.320]   I couldn't figure out how to do it.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:42.240]   There appears to be no easy way to do it except using a free conference call service, which
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.120]   is all kinds of other hassle.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:50.680]   So then if that's one kind of thing that I do a lot, if I get a Chromebook, I'm not
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.920]   going to be able to do that.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.320]   So then it can't be my kind of main computer.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:43:00.000]   But this is a discussion that we always end up having, which is that Matthew, like I
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.080]   think we're power users, right?
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:09.240]   And personally for me, I need to be able to do graphic editing and audio recording and
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.600]   editing much like yourself.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.960]   And every now and then a little video and all this sort of stuff.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.120]   And these are very processor intensive tools.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:19.320]   And we've been raised on application tools and things like that.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:24.080]   But the average user might not need to record a Skype call.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.600]   They just need to use Skype to talk to somebody.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:33.400]   And so oftentimes I wonder the pool of potential customers for a device like this at this price
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:39.520]   point are like business travelers who are dialed into the Google network, Google ecosystem,
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:45.240]   much like people dialed into the Apple iCloud ecosystem or Microsoft Office or whatnot.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.280]   And this device might not be for us.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:50.120]   We might still need a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air or whatnot.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.120]   >> Oh, you're right.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.120]   You're right.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.120]   >> Yeah, but that's it.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.280]   >> And it does make sense.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.600]   It does make sense for schools.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.440]   It does make sense.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:02.040]   I think for students it probably makes sense for road warriors or whatever if all you need
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:05.680]   is kind of if everything you can do, you can access on the web.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:11.880]   I was thinking of one kind of interesting target market.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:20.120]   Foreign travelers coming into the US, you could have a bare Chromebook, nothing on it,
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.080]   just basically a browser.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.040]   You bring it into the US.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.960]   They can't find anything on it.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.640]   They can't look at anything on it.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:32.080]   So you can do your work kind of assuming you can do everything on the internet, have
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.360]   your regular leave your regular computer at home.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.360]   >> Yeah, absolutely.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.480]   Because it's so easy to set up a Chromebook.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:42.000]   You just log into your account and everything just goes, and then like 30 seconds and everything
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.720]   is back there as if it was your laptop forever.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.480]   That's a really good point.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.480]   I don't know.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.840]   Yeah, I mean, the question that you posed Ron and that kind of that that you're talking
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:55.920]   about there in Matthew two is a, I don't know if that's, but I don't know if that's
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.120]   like Google's end game necessarily.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:02.600]   Like, well, we'll target, you know, people who are traveling nationally and certain business
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.600]   travelers.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:08.440]   Like it is still a question that I have, even though like I'm excited to get the, the,
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.080]   the pixel book if and when it comes out.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:15.440]   And even though I also say that knowing that it's very expensive and that maybe it isn't
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.480]   worth it, I don't know, but I'm still going to get it.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:24.480]   I still have a hard time understanding who their target actually is on this.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:31.680]   Yeah, I mean, regularly, at least in the industries that we run in, there are reasons
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.560]   that this does not make sense.
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:45.560]   So it's so it's easy to kind of fall into the, you know, so in a way, they're kind of trapped
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.440]   in a, in a catch 22.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.560]   The only people I hear talking about pixels are nerds.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:55.680]   And yet nerds are off power users who want more computer, who want to install things
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.920]   or screw around with the OS or whatever.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.880]   And so they're not going to probably get them.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.200]   So they get them as a second or third computer.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.800]   So that's not a big market.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:05.800]   Right.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:09.440]   And the interesting thing when it, when it first launched, I will say, you know, that
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:13.040]   was a long time ago in internet terms.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.040]   Yep.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.040]   2014.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:20.320]   And but at the time, what it said to me was, and maybe this was what they meant by launching
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:26.760]   it was it was a symbol of how much the future was going to be all about the web and all
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.760]   about.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.760]   So as long as you had a connection, you would be able to do just about everything.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.640]   And they at the time, there were lots of things you couldn't do now.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.720]   There's a few.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:43.440]   So we have sort of seen what they were talking about at the time, which is that more and more
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:47.120]   stuff has gone to the cloud more and more stuff has gone to the web.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:54.000]   So you don't have to have as much kind of on your machine and you can use a thing that
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.760]   gives you a connection and nothing else.
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.760]   That's a really good point.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:03.800]   What we will see, I was also, as you were talking, kind of taking a look over the Verge's
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.800]   2013 review.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.600]   And I mean, it just ties right into what you're saying.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:12.400]   My how much things have changed since even 2013.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:17.600]   But then again, how much things have stayed the same because it's when I look at like
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:24.400]   the cons on this original device, it was that Chrome OS is severely limited, that price
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.880]   is a deal breaker.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.280]   Price will probably be a deal breaker here as well.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.400]   And actually what we were talking about, just talking about as far as trying to find
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:36.920]   who this would be marketed to, I just kind of assume that's why Google apparently had
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.680]   stopped doing the Chromebook Pixel, right?
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:43.840]   They did 2013, they did 2015 and then there was nothing.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.280]   And I was like, okay, well maybe that was an experiment that just didn't pan out.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:51.120]   The only people that I ever really saw using it were Leo, myself.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:55.320]   And then if I went to Google I/O, I saw it to people that worked for Google using them
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.320]   there.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.320]   But you don't really see him anywhere else.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.760]   So maybe that just didn't work, but apparently it did because it's coming back.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.400]   And it seems like the Pixel book changing the name, you know, they want to centralize
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.680]   everything around the term Pixel.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.800]   And it's probably confusing.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.120]   Plus it's not just a Chromebook, you've got Android apps as well.
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.200]   So Pixel book makes sense.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.040]   Yes, yes.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:22.400]   And then I think we can get out of the rumor territory.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:29.160]   Ron, you were talking about kind of a lower cost to entry device in the Pixel line.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.520]   This isn't quite that.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:36.120]   But we do have the first Android One device to launch in the US.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.480]   That hasn't happened yet.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:43.920]   Android One, of course, is Google's kind of, I don't know, budget phone category.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.880]   I don't know if that's the right kind of way to describe it.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:52.000]   It's really been used in a lot of emerging markets to give a lower end device with a
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.560]   lower price point that still has very minimal UI alterations, has an update schedule that
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:02.280]   comes direct from Google and other benefits like that.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:09.520]   Now Motorola with the Moto X4 is launching its Android One device in the US available
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.040]   for Project 5 users.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:16.720]   And so that means if you are on Project 5 before you had only kind of like premium
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.920]   device options to pick from, now it's opening up.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:24.680]   So you pay $399, which isn't bottom of the barrel pricing, let's say.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:29.720]   And certainly it seems kind of expensive for anything we've seen in the Android One category.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:32.560]   That's less expensive than some of the other options.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:36.040]   So maybe this is the middle of the road option that you were talking about, Ron.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:40.680]   I feel like I need to ask Google for $1 million next and I'll get an email saying, we've
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.680]   given you $1 million.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:45.360]   They're giving me what I'm asking for.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:51.720]   But I think that the fact that $399 is a great price point, $165 back with select
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:52.720]   trade-ins.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.040]   That makes it even more interesting.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:59.280]   And offering $50 in Project 5 credit.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.880]   That's pretty cool too, to help you save money.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:06.880]   And the colors are Starling Blue and Super Black, which is pretty cool.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.880]   No coral.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:08.880]   No coral.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:09.880]   No coral.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:10.880]   No coral.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:11.880]   No blue.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:12.880]   No kind of blue.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:20.920]   But hey, I've been operating with a Moto Z2 Force, my first Motorola phone in a while.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.240]   I've been test running this for this month.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.240]   And I've been really impressed.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:25.800]   Motorola is making some nice hardware.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.920]   And we talked about the Moto X4.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:31.480]   And I think last week we were all about Android with this weird camera design in the back,
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:36.000]   the dual camera lens that looks almost like a manual camera focused knob.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.400]   But this might be the middle of the road option.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.440]   And I like that they're rolling Android 1 out in the US.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.920]   It's really interesting.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:47.720]   You'll see how it does for Project 5 users.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.000]   But of course, if a T-Mobile and Sprint merge as has been rumored for a long time, then
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.240]   Project 5 becomes a little bit less compelling.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.880]   That's a ways down the way.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.880]   And that merger will never happen, right?
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:04.160]   That'll get squashed in regulatory analysis.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:09.440]   That'll totally never happen in today's day and age.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.640]   Crazy things will happen.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.760]   Let's see here.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:13.760]   What can we talk about?
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.000]   There's other Google news, right?
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.440]   Google apparently.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:24.840]   So we had the EU decision that basically said that Google had to pay 2.4 billion euros
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:31.640]   in a fine to the EU and its antitrust case related to Google's shopping search results
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:40.920]   and having favorable placement for its own products in comparison to competing companies
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.360]   that were in the listings.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:50.440]   So along with that fine came some requirements for Google to really change things so that
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.440]   they could address some of these issues.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:59.800]   Google is appealing this, but in the meantime, it still has to kind of make the effort to
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.320]   stand up and make some changes according to the EU.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:10.320]   So apparently Google is proposing to auction off some of that space to its rivals.
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.600]   Here's to know what you guys think about this.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.200]   To list products for sale.
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.480]   So if I'm understanding this correctly, instead of Google showing its own products, it's saying
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:25.360]   how about we auction this off to you guys, you pay us lots of money so that we don't
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.360]   put our own products there.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.360]   Is that what this is?
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:35.120]   Yeah, this falls in the category of what I would like to call a nice try.
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.760]   So why not?
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.600]   Like they're appealing it anyway.
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.200]   Why not kind of lob this out there?
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:46.920]   There's no, and in fact, if you look at that article that's in the lineup, there is no
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:51.000]   hope that anyone is going to think that this is a solution.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.080]   And in fact, everyone who's heard about it, including all the people who brought the action
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:01.600]   in the first place, this is not going to work because their fear is Google will just...
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.960]   So Google said, "Oh, we'll put a cap on it."
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.240]   So then it can't go up.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.240]   We won't be able to bid any more than the cap.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:14.280]   Well, they have to do is set the cap ridiculously high and then no one will be able to beat it.
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:16.920]   And even if they do bid it, Google makes way more money.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:24.600]   So it doesn't actually have the smell of what you would call a solution to the criticisms
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.600]   that...
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:28.080]   Like I have my...
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:32.440]   I'm skeptical of the criticisms that the EU is acting on.
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:39.560]   I don't think that most of what Google does in terms of showing its own results meets any
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:44.080]   real standard of sort of antitrust or anti-competitiveness.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:50.800]   There are things that it does that I think do, but just when I search for umbrellas and
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:59.280]   Google shows me its umbrella results or travel, those are things that help the user.
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:03.080]   The EU is arguing they're fundamentally anti-competitive.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:05.320]   I think the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:09.360]   But I don't think they're going to get anywhere with this offer for sure.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.320]   I want to give them points for your creativity.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.320]   That's for sure.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:13.320]   An innovation.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:18.520]   I would expect nothing less from Google to try to figure it away for them to profit from
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:23.240]   the slap of the wrist that they got from the EU.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:28.760]   It's like you get charged with an offense and it has a six month jail term.
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:33.680]   And you're like, "Well, why don't we raffle off specific jail terms for me?"
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:38.840]   And then we'll see who bids most and then that's what I'll go to jail for.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.520]   Hey, it never hurts to try, right?
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.320]   You don't get anything if you don't ask.
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   Yeah, you don't find out if you don't ask.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.320]   Can or to ask.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.280]   Yeah, what the heck.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.200]   And it shows that they're doing something.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:53.960]   They're just not doing something that anyone really thinks is an actual solution.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:57.000]   But hey, there you go.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.160]   Let's see here.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:00.480]   What else can we talk about?
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.720]   We talked about this a little bit last night on the day before.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.720]   Sorry, Ron.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:10.560]   But I think it's kind of cool this idea of, so Google has a payment app rolling out in
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.560]   India.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:16.160]   I think if we're going to see it in other places or at least this kind of technology coming
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:20.720]   to other places as well, maybe India is kind of like a test point for this.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:22.200]   But the app is called Taze.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:26.880]   I want to call it Taze, but someone, I'm trusting someone last night that said it's actually
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:27.880]   Taze.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:29.840]   So there you go.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:38.120]   And it's basically, it's a way to use the app to link up to financial accounts and trade
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:44.080]   cash essentially, India has certain, it's a very fragmented money market.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.040]   And so they're very focused on cash.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:51.760]   And so the government is doing a lot of things to try and help people kind of break that and
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.320]   kind of dealing with the fragmentation.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.880]   So Google created this app to kind of work with that.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:05.680]   And what I find interesting is that for person to person cash transfers, it doesn't use NFC
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:08.400]   necessarily to connect between them.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:11.320]   It uses something, did I put that in here?
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.960]   It's basically, it's like an audio QR code.
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:18.720]   And so it puts out an inaudible beep that we can't hear to our ears anyways.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:23.520]   It's outside of the human hearing range, but that the devices can hear and that makes
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:27.480]   the connection and then you transfer money.
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:28.480]   It's like the future.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.480]   It's cool.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:32.760]   Yeah, it does sound cool.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:38.120]   I don't know enough about audio technology to know whether this is going to be secure.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:45.080]   Like, couldn't, if it's just sound, can't something make the same sound and effectively
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.520]   achieve the same transaction?
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:49.720]   I don't know if that's the case or if that's possible.
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:56.320]   Or on the other side, can you, can I intercept your sound and then use it at other places,
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:57.320]   right?
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:58.320]   Oh, wow.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.320]   Right.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:02.760]   So the payment, all the information encoded in the signal, right?
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.440]   Or at some point after the signal, that information is exchanged.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:07.440]   Right.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:12.240]   Unless what it's doing is it's not trans, I can't imagine it's transferring any sensitive
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.360]   data in the audio QR.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:19.440]   It's got to be transferring a marker that is saying, you know, beep, boop, boop.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.280]   And then the other side is beep, boop.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.080]   And that, and that, that gets a handshake.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:26.960]   And then at the up on the server side, it figures out, okay, you're who you are and I'm
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:30.240]   going to take your money from your account and none of it is happening on the application
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.240]   level.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:33.240]   That's really that that's how it's got to be working.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:36.080]   Oh, you have to duplicate the handshake, right?
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:39.760]   Then all you have to do is make the beep boop, whatever.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:43.320]   It would be fun if it made the same sounds as like early dial up modems.
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:49.120]   Yeah, we really need to go back to that.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:53.800]   And it does, it makes sense because as this article points out, a lot of people, particularly
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:58.120]   in developing countries don't have NFC on their phones because they're probably got
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:01.280]   a flip phone, you know, that was handed down to them.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:05.040]   And so it makes sense to use some other type of technology.
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:08.240]   It's not sure whether the sound is the way to go.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:11.480]   And again, I don't know enough about it to criticize it.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.480]   Way man, I'm getting an AQR code right now.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.480]   ATD.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.480]   ATD.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.480]   ATD.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.120]   I just gave you $50, Matthew.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.120]   Sorry.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:28.000]   And if they do do this, I can't hear you over the internet.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.360]   Are all the dogs in the neighborhood going to get upset if people start transferring?
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:36.280]   Yeah, because we're taking their money.
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:41.480]   We've tried to shoot holes in this, but I'm going to play devil's advocate.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:44.480]   There are very smart people at Google who have figured this out.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:49.760]   I'm going to assume that any scenario we've invented, they have an answer for where they
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.760]   wouldn't roll this out.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:54.880]   I can't imagine Google would be so brazen with a financial app like this.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:01.120]   It just feels like us in five minutes could not come up with something that Google engineers
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:02.680]   have not thought of.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:03.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.000]   We couldn't figure this out in five minutes.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   We are slipping.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   Let's see here.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   What else do we have here?
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   Oh, what?
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   It's a Chrome one.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.200]   And a Chrome story about blocking autoplay videos, I thought was pretty interesting.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.720]   Yeah, I was circling on that too, actually.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:24.600]   So apparently Chrome browser, so Google's doing a lot of things right now when it comes to
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:30.000]   making adjustments to Chrome to make the browsing experience better.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.320]   A lot of this stuff seems to relate to ads.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:37.600]   They have their own ad blocking mechanism or setup that's apparently going to appear
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.600]   inside Chrome.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:43.120]   They also have their, what is it, Google contributor that I think you've been doing, right?
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:44.120]   Ron?
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:45.120]   Yep.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.120]   For a while.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.600]   So this kind of ties into that, I think.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:52.480]   Chrome browser is going to soon be able to mute the audio of any autoplay video content
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:58.760]   that appears on a page unless the user has specifically said it's okay to play that.
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.600]   So with Chrome 63, that's kind of where the changes will begin.
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:06.480]   Users are going to be able to have the control over muting specific sites.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:11.560]   But then at Chrome 64, it's going to broaden out so that you will only ever hear audio on
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:16.200]   any of the sites if you have explicitly told Chrome in some way that it's okay.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:20.200]   And I think part of how you do that or part of it, part of how it knows whether it's
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.800]   okay to do it is like your interaction with the site.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:27.160]   If you like open up a tab to a site and you don't do anything on the page, that's one
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.720]   indicator and it says, okay, well, you haven't done anything on the page.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:36.200]   So why would, why would I, you know, I Chrome expect that you would want to hear this audio.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.560]   But if you click on the page in some way or scroll around, I'm not really quite sure
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.600]   to what degree of level that that will take place.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.440]   Or if you visit it frequently, maybe.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.880]   Yeah, maybe see the long lines.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.800]   You know, this is one of those things and contributor and a bunch of the other, the Google sort
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:57.480]   of Chrome built in ad blocking thing I have problems with as well because from a kind
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:03.200]   of media industry point of view, this is a classic example of something that users will
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:10.480]   love and media companies will hate because a lot of them have rely on autoplay video.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.480]   Is it bad?
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.480]   Yes.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.280]   It's a horrible, horrible user experience.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.160]   And I know that because I go to a lot of sites that use it.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.160]   I worked for one.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.720]   They used it and I hated it every single time.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:26.160]   So it's, so Google wins a lot of points by doing this because it makes for a better
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.880]   experience for users.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:35.480]   The problem is a lot of publishers for better or worse use a lot of these videos and other
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:40.720]   garbage forms of advertising to generate revenue because they literally can't think of anything
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.920]   else to do or because they have no other option or whatever.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:51.680]   So the problem with these types of measures and surely the ad blocking one is an obvious
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:59.840]   one is they increase the control that Google has over the revenue generating abilities
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:00.840]   of media companies.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:05.600]   And don't get me wrong, lots of media companies do terrible things to make money and that's
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.600]   bad.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:13.320]   But Google and Facebook together already control, you know, the vast majority of online advertising,
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:18.040]   I think last year, all of the growth in digital advertising went to Google and Facebook.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:22.000]   If you took those two out, the digital advertising market actually shrank.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.560]   So it's centralizing that control in even more ways.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:31.160]   And then I'm sure Google has lots of other ways for you to monetize including contributor
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:34.920]   and subscriptions that Google then handles.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.920]   So it's, do you know what I'm saying?
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:42.720]   It's a little bit of a, yeah, as a user, it's a fantastic thing and I think it's great.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:47.280]   In terms of their relationship to the kind of media ecosystem, it's troubling.
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.760]   Well, and I mean, as far as Google is concerned, it's great.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:58.520]   You know, it's a great solution because it puts them in even more control over the experience.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:02.120]   You know, there are a lot of people that use their party ad blockers.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:06.200]   Google is not necessarily saying don't use ad blockers, they're just saying use our ad
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.760]   blocker and you know, then we've got control over the experience, you know, not to mention
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:18.840]   this whole, this whole approach to ad blocking in Chrome, you know, kind of hinges on Google
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:25.480]   making a determination based on standards of quality that have been set prior, but makes
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:30.280]   the determination of what is a good ad and what is not a good ad.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:34.320]   And I don't know, I'm just guessing here, but I'm guessing that Google's ads are going
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.880]   to be good ads because they're following those rules.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.440]   And anyone that doesn't have good ads are Google's competitors that they're not letting
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:44.400]   you see their ads because, and you know, might do as a user again, that's great.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.920]   I don't want bad ads in my experience, but that really benefits Google and is that,
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.920]   I don't know, is that too much?
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.600]   I mean, does that cross a line?
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:58.640]   Well, and this goes back to all those questions about Google's power and what that power,
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:06.440]   like if Google was, you know, a smaller company, did fewer things, wasn't as sort of dominant
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.520]   in advertising, all of these things would be fantastic.
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:16.240]   And it falls into the kind of category of things where if Google did it five years ago,
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.760]   six years ago, when it was smaller, we would all be cheering, right?
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:25.600]   Offering free email or, you know, maps and satellite views of the earth.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.280]   We were like, wow, these are fantastic and Google is amazing.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:34.440]   But the more power you get and the sort of more you become, not just a dominant player,
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:40.800]   the dominant player, all those things that you do that would once have seemed innocent
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:47.720]   and helpful, you know, start to look like you're kind of feathering your own nest in a way.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.720]   Mm-hmm.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:49.720]   Mm-hmm.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:56.360]   Somewhat related to this only because it's kind of the ad network side of Google and
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.320]   this also, you know, bubbled up with Facebook.
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:04.160]   I think initially, actually, it hit late last week in relation to Facebook, but then eventually
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.440]   Buzzfeed dug into it with Google and saw the same thing.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:15.800]   Is this idea of ad targeting based on, well, racist phrases is more of the examples that
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:16.800]   were shown.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:23.000]   Buzzfeed found that Google was allowing ad targeting for, you know, pretty horrible phrases
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.880]   and everything that you can actually as an ad buyer target your product or your message
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:34.160]   or whatever your advertisement against these phrases if they, what if people are searching
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.240]   for them or whatever.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:40.520]   Facebook also kind of came under the microscope for this as well.
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:47.080]   Their system was also allowing a lot of these terms to be marketed against and in their,
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:55.000]   you know, to their benefit, they did address these once they were notified about this by
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.360]   Buzzfeed.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:03.280]   And I think it was a pro publica that found initially what Facebook was doing.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.800]   But, you know, part of me just wasn't Twitter does this as well, right?
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.800]   That's right.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.320]   They're actually, they're actually, you can do the same thing on Twitter.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:13.240]   Yep, there was, there was news that Twitter was doing this as well, which I think, you
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:18.640]   know, further kind of proves my hesitation around this, which is like how, I mean, is
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:22.680]   this just part of the ad network world?
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:30.440]   So this is, it's a great example of how, of the flaws, I guess, in, in, or the risks with
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.800]   a totally distributed model.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:37.920]   So all of these companies, and I think Google was among the first Facebook later, Twitter
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:48.400]   later, tried to kind of make their ad buying as user friendly as possible and as sort of
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:54.760]   accessible as possible so that the amount of input you had to have from human beings
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:59.000]   at that company was approaching zero, if not zero.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.160]   So self-serve, click here, type in your terms, weak algorithm gives you the prices, boom,
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.040]   boom, boom, you're done.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:11.040]   And in fact, Sheryl Sandberg wrote something, I don't know if it's in the lineup, but she
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:17.600]   responded to these stories and said, you know, we screwed up and this is terrible and we
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.920]   feel horrible and we will take action to stop it.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:26.880]   But her point was, what made this possible was all the things they tried to do to make
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:33.000]   it easier for small business owners to get ads and run ads about their businesses no
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.560]   matter how unusual those businesses are.
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:43.240]   So, you know, reused frisbee rentals or whatever, there's probably not going to be a category
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:47.320]   in a system run by a normal advertising company.
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.080]   So you can literally enter anything you want.
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:55.000]   So what happened in these cases as far as I understand it is people just typed in racist
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.520]   terms where it said, you know, what business are you in?
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:03.960]   So that's the kind of, yes, it's a flaw, obviously.
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:09.760]   And for the system to not say, whoa, dude, that's totally racist, we can't sell ads against
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.680]   that.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.680]   They didn't do that.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:18.800]   But controls weren't there in any of these companies to stop people from typing in those
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:19.800]   terms.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:25.640]   Whether any ads were actually sold or run against those terms, who knows?
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:32.680]   But I think to me it's just an example of how kind of automated these systems are and
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:39.240]   how much they rely on you, the business person or whoever to type in things that make sense
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.720]   related to your business.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:49.560]   It reminded me of Microsoft's TAY where TAY came out and almost immediately everybody
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:54.600]   started targeting TAY with certain phrases and words and basically made TAY a racist
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.440]   AI chat pod.
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:57.680]   And like two hours.
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.560]   You know, yeah, very short about a time.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.880]   It was mind-boggling how fast it happened.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:07.640]   But in retrospect, looking at that and going, man, I mean, it's not impossible to protect
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.640]   against that.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.880]   So why didn't you think about that?
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.880]   That's kind of how I feel about this.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.520]   Like I get the idea of a self-service model.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:19.840]   It's also very easy to be like these two words we put together, there's like no way
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.960]   why anyone should be able to buy ads against that term.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.280]   And not the play devil's advocate to defend them.
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:32.640]   But I mean, I think it's more sad of the state of affairs of the world today that this
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.560]   has relevance because of everything around and outside the tool.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:42.920]   But if you look at the searches that the obvious expletives and horrible racial slurs and things
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:45.040]   like that, I'm sure already blocked.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:49.680]   And I'm not surprised that someone at Google or Facebook did not sit back and say, well,
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:56.360]   what if somebody searches for insert, no group.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.720]   >> Yeah, horrible phrase here.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.840]   >> Yeah, not even horrible phrase.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.280]   White people ruin everything.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.080]   That was one of them, right?
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.080]   Like things like that.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.520]   Those are strings of words that I can't say.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.520]   I would have thought of if I was building that tool.
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:08.520]   >> That's true.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:15.640]   >> And we've gotten to a point of unfortunately people who potentially want to purvey hate
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:19.120]   in a way that they're getting creative to work around the tools.
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.640]   And that's game theory.
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.640]   That's just natural.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.160]   That's that people are going to figure out ways to get across what they want to do.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:31.120]   So I'm glad that ProPublica and BuzzFeed and all the other folks are being watchdogs because
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:34.720]   that's what we need the media to do and point this out and the companies are responding
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.720]   and kind.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:39.160]   But I mean, as when I saw this, it was like, ooh, that's rough.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:43.560]   But then as I dug deep into it, I'm like, oh, I see how that can happen.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.560]   >> Mm-hmm, yeah.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.560]   >> Yeah.
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:53.400]   >> It does feel more to me like a bug in a self-serve ad system than Holy cow Facebook
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.200]   is internally racist.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.040]   >> Right, sure.
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.040]   >> Yeah.
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:00.720]   >> And so there are other things Facebook does that are way worse.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.800]   Let's put it that way.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:08.200]   So deleting videos about the Rohingya being massacred, that's an actual bad thing that
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.400]   raises questions about what Facebook is doing.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:15.480]   The fact that you can auto-generate an ad related to some childish term that you just
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.320]   came up with doesn't trouble me that much.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:24.080]   >> Yeah, and saying Twitter also has this problem, we all know about the rampant problem
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.560]   with Twitter with abuse and with trolls and things like that.
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:33.040]   And the recent taking two hour turnaround to delete a terrorist related theme tweet or
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.280]   something like that, they've got to get better about this stuff.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:42.840]   And the desire to make it automated makes sense from a scaling issue, but we're dealing
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.920]   with subjects and we're dealing with things that require a human touch.
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.160]   And so they've just got to get better.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.080]   >> That's a great point.
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:12:00.120]   Facebook and Google and lots of other companies have, Facebook built this entire network based
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:05.760]   on the idea that human beings were only had to be tangentially involved.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.040]   Human beings were the input of content, but in terms of running it.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:13.760]   Because at one point, I can't remember if Mark Zuckerberg actually said this or if people
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.440]   figured he said this, but human beings don't scale.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:20.840]   So if you want to get to global size, you can't have human beings doing everything.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.320]   It costs too much money.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:29.920]   So in this came up when Facebook started having problems with racist content, fake news, whatever,
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:34.880]   they've had to hire thousands, like 5,000 or something moderators.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:41.920]   Because some things, and this is probably one of them, human beings are way better at recognizing
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.080]   those things than computers are.
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.680]   And maybe that won't always be the case, but it certainly seems to be the case right
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.680]   now.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:49.680]   >> Yeah.
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:50.680]   It's really good.
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.440]   I think that the way that the day was racist, literally five minutes after the thing started.
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:02.640]   And sure, that was a great symbol of day realizing that, hey, human beings are racist,
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.200]   which is true.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.600]   But it was also a sign that Microsoft could probably have thought it through a little
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.600]   bit more.
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:13.640]   I mean, we've had chatbots since the '70s.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.080]   >> Yeah, absolutely.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:22.880]   And by the way, Matthew, reused Frisbee business, I think it's going to be a hot trend in 2019.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:25.520]   A couple of years from now, it's trending now.
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.520]   >> I've already done that.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.760]   I've got the domain, all right.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:34.040]   >> Any last thing before we thank a sponsor and then get to our tips and tricks and all
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:41.000]   that, anything, burning stories that you had to talk about before the end of this show?
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:48.520]   >> I think we've covered all mine.
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:55.640]   I don't think we talked about the open markets group that's going after Google specifically
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.000]   based around antitrust.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:04.360]   There's a whole internal politics around them branching off from this other foundation and
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:10.160]   Google asking for them to be tossed out or not, depending on how you kind of read between
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.160]   the lines.
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:21.040]   But there is clearly a very significant number of legal scholars and people with experiencing
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:30.400]   government who are going after Google specifically to redefine the way antitrust is thought of
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.360]   in the US, whether they're going to be successful or not.
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.360]   Who knows?
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:38.200]   But I think for Google, that's a significant problem.
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:42.400]   It dovetails perfectly with what the EU's been trying to do.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:47.760]   And until now, it's always been, well, that's just a bunch of Germans and French people
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:54.240]   and maybe some Spaniards and the Italians and who cares because it's just the EU and yes,
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:59.320]   they're all hot about this stuff, but it's not that big a deal because it doesn't affect
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.560]   kind of our main market.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:06.480]   Well, this is going to the heart of that if open markets and that group can get a significant
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:11.440]   amount of kind of interest going in Congress, that's going to be a significant problem for
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:17.080]   Google for sure because it defines not to get into too much detail, but it defines antitrust
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:21.360]   in a way in the past for probably the last 30 years.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.280]   US antitrust has looked at is the consumer harmed?
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.680]   That's the number one thing.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:33.360]   So if all your stuff is free and everything works great and the users are happy, no antitrust
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.360]   problem.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:39.760]   So what open markets wants to do is redefine that to look at actual competition and that
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.440]   could be a significant problem.
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:46.720]   Yeah, like I was saying earlier, inflection point for technology because it's not just
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.720]   Google either.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:53.560]   I have a feeling like the tide is turning so to speak with big technology companies right
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:16:00.800]   now and we've been amazed at just how much you can do with the power and the scale of
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:04.120]   these of these technology companies working for you.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:10.320]   And now, I think in light of a lot of things that happened last year, people have realized
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:19.160]   just what that amount of power can scale up to, like what the impact of that can be and
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:24.200]   continues to be more and more and more and that some of these rules, yeah, maybe they
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:28.880]   do need to change because we're in a different world now when it goes to technology and the
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:31.480]   information age than we were 20 years ago.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:37.520]   All of those antitrust principles were based around physical things, physical objects,
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:44.440]   you know, trains, oil, whatever, like they weren't designed to understand the power of
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.480]   network effects.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.560]   And so sure, anybody can use another social network.
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:51.320]   They don't have to go use Facebook, but are they going to?
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.320]   No.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.280]   Like, lots of people didn't even stop using Twitter when it was a trash fire.
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:01.840]   So because those network effects are what keep you in those networks.
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:09.240]   And so then that gives those companies way more power, but it doesn't always kind of,
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:13.760]   the analogy is not perfect between that and owning a bunch of railway, you know, cars
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:16.000]   that then distribute oil, you know what I mean?
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.800]   So that's the part people are struggling with.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:19.800]   Yeah.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:20.880]   Agreed.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:25.000]   Very fascinating time for technology right now, definitely for Google.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.920]   As we kind of see the effects of what the EU is doing and how that translates into the
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.960]   US and other markets, big change ahead.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:36.240]   Real quick before we do get to the break, I failed to mention this and it's kind of,
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.240]   you know, it's today's news.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.880]   So we should mention it here real quick.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:45.040]   Nest after so long of people saying, "Man, you know, Google bought Nest."
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.040]   And then they did nothing.
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:48.760]   They really lack any sort of new production.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:52.240]   Today they announced a whole bunch of new stuff.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:58.600]   The Nest Secure Alarm System is basically like a full security system for your home.
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:05.960]   It includes like a siren, the Nest Guard, like that sounds a super loud 85 decibel alarm.
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.280]   Nest detect for, you know, attaching to your windows and your doors, you know, when they
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.840]   open and close.
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:14.280]   Nest tag for putting on the things like your keys or whatever.
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.640]   So you don't lose them.
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.280]   Sounds familiar.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:22.920]   And then, you know, a bunch of other things including a baking assistant, Google's assistant,
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:30.560]   into things like the Nest Cam IQ camera and then also they announced the Nest Cam IQ outdoor
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.720]   camera.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:33.080]   All this stuff is really expensive.
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:38.320]   I think the full security system is, what is that, around 500 bucks or something?
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:42.560]   Well, the thing about this, what struck me from this is that it's always been like Nest
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.160]   has been the sleeping dog that's been lying in the world of IoT, right?
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:51.020]   And that they, you know, the thermostat, you know, blew everyone's mind and then the
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:52.920]   smoke alarm had some problems.
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.640]   And then they got real, and then they had a lot of internal reorg and structuring and,
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:01.520]   you know, Tony Fadal left and all the, you know, like all these various stuff that was
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.680]   going on.
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:06.040]   And then it seems like this is, you know, what they've done is they took a step back and
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:10.800]   looked at the IoT market and was like, Oh, small tags to track your items.
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:11.800]   That's doing well.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:12.800]   Doing one of those.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:17.680]   So outdoor cameras or interfaces for outside your home, we're going to do one of those.
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:23.120]   And now they're marching back to kind of target every successful product that is in
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:29.200]   the IoT play space and add both Nest and the power of Google Assistant behind it to justify
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:33.200]   those high costs, you know, the more expensive products.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:36.600]   And my guess is they're probably going to do well because everyone loves the Nest thermostat.
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.920]   And I think they have a real chance.
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:43.720]   I mean, like you said, this is a kind of wide open market in a way.
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.600]   It's like the Wild West and there's a lot of stuff.
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:47.920]   There's a lot of integration problems.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:50.600]   There's a lot of stuff that doesn't work that well.
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:57.040]   If they can kind of nail the integration, getting all of these things to work properly,
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:01.160]   having them all connect through the Google Assistant and connect to your Google home
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:06.000]   or whatever, that's going to be a significant, you know, that's going to have be a big selling
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.560]   point for people, I think.
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:11.920]   They also have a doorbell camera, by the way, the hello doorbell camera.
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.800]   I mean, yeah, they're touching all these things.
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.560]   This is very familiar, right?
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:18.160]   I mean, a lot of the products that we talk about here into it, right?
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.160]   And these are all.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:23.280]   And if somebody has a Nest thermostat, you know, they're like, well, I can control this
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.000]   all from the Google Home app or from the Nest app.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.480]   You know, why would I, why would I want multiple people want to people want to buy into a
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.320]   system, right?
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:35.000]   How long until next to these are on multicolor light bulbs.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.720]   They're going to get into the game.
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:37.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:38.720]   I'm really surprised there.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:40.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:44.760]   Although I do know, speaking of Google and power, I know a friend, as soon as I mentioned
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:49.200]   this or send a link, they're going to be like, sure, I want Google to have a camera inside
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:50.840]   my house and outside my house.
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:53.280]   Sure, I want Google to control my front doorbell.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.280]   Yeah, that makes total sense.
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.280]   Uh huh.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.280]   Nope.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:00.840]   I's in ears in every corner of the home.
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:03.200]   That's, you know, that's kind of the deeper meaning, apparently.
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.200]   I help you.
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:05.200]   Yes.
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:10.720]   And to make your life more convenient and to make our life better because we profit from
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:11.720]   it.
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:16.320]   Uh, real quick, before we get into tips and tricks, I want to thank the sponsor of today's
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.320]   episode.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.720]   That is Felix Gray.
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:22.040]   Think of, I mean, we stare at our screens all the time.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:25.080]   Think of how often you look at your screen.
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.320]   You might be looking to screen now.
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:30.400]   You probably are if you're watching this show anyways, uh, and or you might be listening
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.960]   to this podcast to get away from one.
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:36.280]   And if so, I totally understand, uh, been there.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:38.560]   Um, we've all, you know, had the eye rub moment.
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.080]   I feel like I have it all the time.
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.080]   Your eyes feel dry.
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.080]   They feel fatigued.
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.080]   You have a headache.
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.080]   Your vision goes blurry.
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:50.360]   Uh, you can give your eyes a break with a pair of computer glasses from Felix Gray.
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:57.200]   And it's just an awesome way to kind of help your eyes not feel so tired at the end of
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:58.200]   the day.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.200]   And it's screens all the time.
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:06.240]   Felix Gray's lenses are specially designed to filter blue light and eliminate glare,
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:11.080]   which many of us know are the two culprits, uh, behind digital eye strain.
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:14.840]   Too much blue light from your computer and phone screen can lead to eye strain and make
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.280]   it difficult to focus.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:21.760]   Uh, Felix Gray glasses have blue light filtering material embedded into the lens.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:25.800]   So they remain effective without that ugly yellow tint that you're used to seeing or
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:29.520]   color distortion that you get with other computer glasses.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:34.880]   You want to make sure to visit Felix Gray glasses.com/twig and you can find more information on the
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.680]   dangers of blue light.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.200]   But we hear about this all the time.
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:41.960]   Reducing the amount of blue light is it's good for you in so many ways.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:44.800]   I, I, I didn't know what glasses I was going to end up with.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.440]   So I just, I chose it random.
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:47.920]   This is one pair.
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.360]   They have tons of different styles.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:53.640]   If you go to the site, uh, you can, you can pick your way through them and find a style
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:54.640]   that works for you.
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:58.680]   Uh, here's a little tortoise, uh, tortoise style.
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:03.200]   I want to, when I was a kid, I wore tortoise glasses, never, never have since.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.160]   You look great in a pair of glasses, Jason.
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:06.160]   I'll give you credit man.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.160]   Very debonair.
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.160]   Thank you very much.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:09.720]   You look much smarter now.
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:13.960]   Oh, I mean, you got, you got to, you kind of got a Clark Kent thing going on there.
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.800]   What if I were to you?
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:16.800]   You did smarter?
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.560]   See it, it doesn't work like that.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:21.200]   Uh, Felix Gray, thank you, by the way.
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:26.800]   Uh, Felix Gray, I wear is beautifully crafted from premium handmade Italian acetate.
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:30.800]   Uh, their glasses look great so you can feel confident in any work environment.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.720]   Non-prescription and reading lenses are also available.
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.520]   Um, and prescription glasses are coming soon.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:41.640]   So if that's something you're holding out for, uh, you don't have to wait very much longer.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:50.040]   Reading prescription ranges from plus 1.0 to plus 2.5, or you can add a .25 magnification
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:54.760]   if you're fixated, uh, to your screen, like if you're a programmer, a financial analyst,
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.400]   you know if that applies to you.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:59.280]   All orders include free shipping and free returns.
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:01.240]   So there's no risk in trying them out.
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:02.240]   And you don't buying glasses.
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:03.640]   It's a very personal thing, right?
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:07.800]   Like only certain glasses styles that you might feel comfortable with and you want to
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.360]   own these when you wear them.
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:10.960]   So you know, you can try them out.
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.760]   And if it doesn't work, ship it back.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:16.280]   Uh, you get free returns and, uh, try on some more.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.280]   So check them out for yourself.
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.360]   Give your eyes the break that they deserve.
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:26.280]   Go to Felix Gray Glasses dot com slash twig TWIG and go there today and you can try a
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:30.640]   pair of Felix Gray computer glasses and discover a smarter way to work.
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:34.040]   If you're staring at the screen all day, you might as well protect your eyes in the process.
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.840]   That's Felix Gray Glasses dot com slash twig.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:42.800]   And we thank Felix Gray for their support of this week in Google.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.000]   Okay.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.400]   This is the tools, tips, tricks, whatever you got part of the show.
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.960]   Ron will start with you because I do see one in here for you.
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:54.000]   I'm trying to remember if I've seen this before.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   I don't know if you have it's so I don't know.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.840]   Maybe, um, this one's square in the edge of what's okay to talk about, but, uh, I figured
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:02.840]   go with it.
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.640]   Uh, fall TV season is upon us.
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.080]   It's my most favorite time of the year.
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:08.240]   I got my entertainment weekly fall TV preview.
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:10.120]   The Emmys were just on this past weekend.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:12.040]   New TV shows are coming at us.
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:15.920]   And if you're like me, you like to watch TV and I live and die by Plex.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:18.280]   Plex is my kind of media center app.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:22.720]   It's fantastic, but Plex doesn't do it.
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:28.040]   Plex is great for putting stuff into it, but it's not so good for telling you what's coming.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:32.840]   And so there's an app called Sonar, which is a little desktop app that is able, you're
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:37.800]   able to subscribe to series that you watch it enjoy and it will use it.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:41.800]   It accesses all the databases that are out there on the internet and makes a really cool
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:47.000]   uh, integrated kind of interface that allows you to see when the air dates for shows are.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.840]   Um, and there's also a bunch of really cool little notifications hooks and little recipes
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:54.720]   you can put together to give me, you know, give me a notification when this new show is
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:55.720]   on.
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:01.720]   Um, it also will go get the show if you subscribe to those types of methods to do that.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:03.720]   And that's what I'm not going to talk about.
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:05.520]   I'm not allowed to talk about that.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:10.000]   Not going to talk about that, but it's there if you're into that sort of thing.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.080]   But um, it's really, really handy for just like, you know, you ever watch a show and then
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.120]   it disappears like, when is that coming back?
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.040]   And then you realize, oh, the baseball playoffs are going on.
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.440]   It's going to be back in November.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:24.320]   Sonar is a great way to keep track of the shows you watch on on typical table and broadcast
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:27.360]   TV, not so much for streaming side of things.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:30.520]   But it's a tool that I started using last year and I've come to, I can't live without
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:31.520]   it.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:34.680]   I got it all dusted off and ready to go for the upcoming fall season.
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.640]   So sonar, it's that sonar.tv.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.040]   It's a downloadable desktop package you can install for Mac windows or Linux and it's
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:43.040]   pretty nifty.
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:47.400]   And I will leave the rest of it to you to discover on your own.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:48.400]   You can do good.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:49.560]   You can do not so good.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:52.600]   So, sonar with two R's by the way.
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:53.600]   So S-L-N-A-R-R.
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:54.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:57.440]   Just talked like a pirate day the other day.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.440]   So it's too bad.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:26:59.440]   This wasn't then.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:00.440]   Okay.
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:05.520]   So in our dot TV, Matthew, do you have a thing, tip, trick, anything?
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.520]   What you got?
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:12.200]   Well, I didn't really have anything but it's interesting that Ron mentioned sonar.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.880]   I experimented with sonar not that long ago.
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:21.880]   I also have a big Plex fan and I have a Linux box that I use as sort of a media server,
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:26.000]   Plex server, photo, hosting, all that stuff.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:35.600]   And I, so sonar, if you like TV and movies and music, they're not related like they come
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.360]   from different people but a lot of people use them together.
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:45.840]   There's Sonar for TV, couch potato, it's called or movies and headphones for music.
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:52.680]   And I got all of these working and then something happened with the box and they stopped doing
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:55.160]   the things they're supposed to do because it's Linux.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:59.680]   Obviously, I probably have to recompile something from the kernel or whatever.
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:04.000]   But anyway, at one point it was working and they do exactly what Ron was talking about
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.280]   with sonar.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:10.480]   They keep track of the things that you like and they tell you when there's new things
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:16.200]   and then you use a variety of methods to get those things.
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:20.120]   But it's great if you have a media server and that's the kind of thing you want to do
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.720]   and we'll go into the details.
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:23.720]   That's awesome.
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:25.240]   See, you did have a tip.
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:26.720]   Yeah, it is.
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:29.680]   It just, it took Ron's tip to bring it to the surface.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:30.680]   That's awesome.
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:32.840]   That's, that's expanded information that totally adds on.
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:35.120]   It's like a full media solution that you have now.
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.760]   Mine has nothing to do with that though.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:41.560]   So when you're done setting up your media solution and then when you get Android 8.0
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:46.480]   Oreo, which could take a really long time to come to your device, but if and when that
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:51.440]   happens, did you know that there is system wide theming?
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:55.400]   So if you've got Android 8.0 and you want to theme everything in your system, almost
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:59.080]   everything in your system, prior to Oreo, you had to root.
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:03.040]   And that's one of the reasons why a lot of people would root access to their device
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:06.920]   so that they could get in there, they could mess with the files, alter the files in a
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:12.480]   way that would totally theme the look and feel of their device.
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:15.960]   And apparently in Android 8, there is a theming engine.
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:21.840]   The folks at Substratum that had systems prior to Android 8.0 that did this launched
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:25.240]   their app and their desktop app set up to do this.
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:31.000]   Taps in to Android's Overlay Manager service, OMS, talked about this on all about Android
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.640]   a couple of months ago, but the reason I'm talking about it now is because it's all out
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:36.640]   now and you can do this.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:42.680]   The app that you're looking for is called Andromeda, not to be confused with the once
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:48.400]   fabled Andromeda Chrome OS Android combination that never happened.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:52.800]   And you can buy it, you see there it's $1.99 to buy the app to install it.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:56.920]   Once you have that installed and once you have their desktop client installed, that
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:30:02.280]   desktop client, you plug your phone into your computer and that desktop client gets the permissions
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:05.680]   to make the changes on your unrooted Oreo device.
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:10.760]   So you do not need root yet, you can use this to completely theme your device.
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:15.240]   I haven't tried it myself yet, I just realized that it's all good to go and it's now public
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:16.840]   so I definitely want to play around with it.
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:22.200]   But you can theme the Android system, the system UI, settings menu, navigation buttons,
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.720]   you can get in there and play around with it.
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:28.240]   It'll survive a reboot, sometimes on these things you do it and then you reboot and
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.800]   wipes it back to normal.
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:34.000]   So when you reboot, your theme is going to stick around, the permissions will not.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.880]   So you'll still have to plug it into the desktop app to make the changes, even revert
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:39.880]   it back to the way it was initially.
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:43.120]   But you can get in there and you can theme to your heart's content and you don't even
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:47.400]   need root to do it anymore, less and less reason to root your device.
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:51.960]   And that's thanks to the folks at Substratum that put this all together for you.
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:55.440]   So pretty cool, but who has Oreo?
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:56.440]   Not many people.
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.360]   So you might be waiting a while.
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.360]   Hope you don't though.
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:02.160]   Once it happens, you have something fun to do.
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:04.480]   All right, I think we did it.
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:05.480]   We did it.
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:07.320]   We made it to the end and that was a lot of fun.
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:12.240]   We had a lot of Google stuff to talk about and I'm really happy that I got to do it with
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:13.240]   both of you guys.
[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:14.240]   Thank you, Matthew Ingram.
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:18.440]   It is always a pleasure and an honor to do a podcast with you, sir.
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:19.840]   Tell people what you're working on.
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:23.360]   Where do you want people to follow all the things you're doing these days?
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:26.000]   Actually, probably Twitter is the best.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.160]   And also, Matthew Ingram.com/work.
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:30.400]   Matthew only has one tea.
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:37.040]   I'm hoping in between things at the moment, I love fortune back in June.
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.960]   So I'm hoping to have something to announce soon.
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:42.280]   But yeah, so keep in touch.
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:43.280]   Absolutely.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:46.240]   Well, I can't wait to see where you end up, where you land.
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:47.240]   Someone's going to like come.
[01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:48.240]   Thanks for having me.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:52.480]   I'll find you on the job market and snap you up, I'm sure.
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:53.480]   Absolutely, man.
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:55.640]   It's always so much fun to get the chance to talk to you.
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:58.960]   So thank you for joining us.
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:01.040]   And what about you, Ron?
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.520]   Has anything changed since yesterday?
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:05.480]   Nothing changed in yesterday, but maybe somebody didn't watch yesterday.
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:06.480]   It's a business.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:10.040]   You definitely want to make sure to watch the aforementioned all about Android here on
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:16.040]   the Twitter network every Tuesday around 5.30pm Pacific time, 8.30pm Eastern time, or Jason,
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:20.360]   myself and Florence Aion and special guests are always talking about the greatest hits
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:22.440]   of Android, what's going on in the world of Android.
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.880]   A deep dive, if you would.
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:29.160]   And then if you want to follow what's going on with me, much like Matthew, you can follow
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:34.040]   me on Twitter @RonExo, also on Instagram where I post nonsense and fun things I see
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.360]   in the world.
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:36.680]   But then also I've got some other podcasts.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:41.120]   You can go to ifandboy.com where you can find out not anything about Apple, but about
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:45.960]   comic books, where we're talking about comic books, movies, TV shows, fun things.
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:46.960]   Things like that.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:51.280]   And then if you're into the TV show Twin Peaks, you might want to check out damnfindpodcast.com,
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:55.720]   where myself and Tom Merritt and special guests over the past year rewatched all Twin Peaks,
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.120]   including the new TV show.
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:00.240]   And if you're into the TV show, please check it out because it's a fun kind of companion
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.240]   to watching Twin Peaks.
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.240]   So there you go.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.480]   And Jason, thanks for having me.
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:04.960]   It's always a blast to do, Twig.
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:06.200]   Yeah, it is.
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.400]   And it was a great week of Ron.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.800]   I really appreciate it, man.
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:11.800]   Lots of fun.
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:13.680]   But I get to podcast with you next Tuesday.
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:17.480]   And now I'm realizing, Matthew, I need to invite you on all about Android.
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:19.200]   And I will follow up with an email.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.280]   Don't feel like you have to come on.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:23.600]   But if you would love to have you, we would love to have you.
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:24.600]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:25.600]   I'll be in touch.
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.400]   We have a lot of fun on all about Android.
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:28.400]   Cool.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:29.400]   So I will be in touch on that.
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:33.560]   But as far as I'm concerned, well, all about Android, obviously Tech News today, filling
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:34.560]   in for Leo.
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:38.320]   Actually, this weekend, I'm doing the new screen savers.
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.800]   So I'm going to be here having fun with that.
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:44.720]   We're going to-- I hope we're going to show a VR thing.
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:48.080]   I have to check that there's some really cool stuff in the pipeline that I've been
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:49.560]   involved with with new screen savers.
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:52.760]   I hope we get to see the light of day this weekend.
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.240]   So definitely check that out.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:59.440]   As far as this week in Google is concerned, we record live every Wednesday, 4pm Eastern,
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:04.320]   1pm Pacific, 20-100, 28 o'clock UTC.
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:10.320]   And you can find that live if you happen to have the time, twitter.tv/live is the link.
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:11.400]   Or you can come into the studio.
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.720]   We have some folks here watching today.
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:20.240]   And it's always great to have people here in the studio kind of applying a little bit
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.560]   of that live audience pressure.
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:25.800]   But they've been all smiles the whole time, so it hasn't been pressure at all.
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:30.960]   And you, of course, go to the twit.tv/twig web page.
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:34.240]   That's where you're going to find all the episodes that we ever do, everything that you
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:36.400]   need to know to subscribe to the show.
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:41.400]   Please subscribe.
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:46.400]   That way you won't miss any episodes of This Week in Google in your queue.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:50.400]   And big thanks to Carson as well for putting the show together today and helping out on
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:51.400]   the production.
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:52.400]   My name is Jason Howell.
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:53.400]   You guys are awesome.
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:54.400]   Appreciate being here with you.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:59.400]   I will see you next week on another episode of This Week in Google.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:00.400]   Bye everybody.
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:07.400]   [MUSIC]
