[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.960]   This week in Google, the show that covers Google, the cloud,
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.480]   and pretty much everything you could
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.000]   think about that goes on on the internet.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.080]   Jeff Jarvis and Leo Laporte both out this week.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.680]   Leo's on jury duty.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.680]   And Jeff is on an undercover secret spy mission
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.720]   that we can't talk about.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.600]   But Gina Trapani is here from smarterware.org.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.240]   I only said that, Gina, because I don't--
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.080]   do you know where Jeff is?
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.760]   I have no idea.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.840]   He's on vacation in Florida, I believe.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.800]   That's the cover story.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.320]   He's on vacation in Florida.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.440]   Even Jarvis takes a vacation every once in a while,
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.760]   which is heartening for the rest of us.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.680]   That's right, actually.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.840]   It really is.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.040]   It's very weird to be here without Jeff and Leo,
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.480]   but I am so psyched about the panel that we have today.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.240]   Well, thanks for not making up an excuse.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.720]   And I thought to be here.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.600]   I really have to go to Alabama.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.960]   Sorry about it.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.120]   No, we got some great folks joining us on the show today.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.160]   Kevin Purdy, author of the Complete Android Guide
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.800]   and a forthcoming book, right?
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.640]   Yes, indeed.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.040]   I am working on a book about Google+,
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.240]   Excellent.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.680]   For O'Reilly and do out probably long after it should be.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.200]   But working on it now and enjoying it very much.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.320]   Also joining us, former C-netter.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.320]   We worked at C-net together now working at paid content,
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.240]   covering mobile, mobile editor Tom Krasit.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.800]   Hey, Tom.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.880]   Hey, thanks for having me.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.600]   So we thought we'd just confuse Gina and Kevin
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.200]   by having two toms on the show as well.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.640]   Confusing me.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.440]   I don't know which-- I don't know who I am anymore.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.040]   Let's start off with your column that you wrote for paid content.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.680]   Why Google is right, yet short-sighted
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.240]   to complain about mobile patents.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.720]   Give us a summary of this.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.640]   Well, I think one of the biggest stories
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.240]   in mobile technology over the last six months or so
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.280]   has been these patents.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.960]   The way that both big companies are asserting them
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.320]   against other companies, mostly Android partners.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.600]   But then also, you see the companies like LODCIS
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.480]   and the patent trolls of the world,
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.800]   making their voices heard as well.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.240]   So I was trying to-- this was also
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.840]   in the light of Microsoft and Google's little public spat
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.760]   that they had a couple weeks ago, where they had the Google
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.400]   accused, Microsoft of acting against Android partners
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.360]   and trying to compete in the courtroom
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.720]   and not the marketplace.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.520]   And Microsoft fired back, and then Google fired back at that.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.440]   And then it just sort of gets to be kind of silly to a while.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.400]   But I think I was really wondering sort of how to express
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.680]   the fact that Google's right.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.840]   The patent system is messed up.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.920]   There's a lot of patents out there that
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.520]   shouldn't have been awarded in the first place.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.280]   And it's hard for companies to sometimes know exactly how
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.200]   they're treading on these patents that shouldn't be out there.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.800]   And then they're also silly to complain about this kind of thing
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.400]   because they have to go out and go get the same patents anyway.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.160]   I mean, they're really complaining about the fact
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.680]   that they lost out on an opportunity
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.400]   to get patents that they then called bogus.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.400]   So it's kind of-- it's a weird dilemma for them.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.680]   They know the system is messed up,
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.800]   but they have no choice but to play the game
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.520]   during the weeks and months ahead.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.760]   Should they be spending more time lobbying the government,
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.360]   trying to change patent law?
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.480]   It seems like that's what Eric Schmidt is supposed to be doing.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.840]   Well, that's, I guess, his job now.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.320]   I mean, I think they can do that, but I don't think--
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.160]   it's pretty clear the government has a lot of things
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.920]   on its mind right now.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.560]   And I don't know if patent reform is necessarily
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.120]   that high on that list these days.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.840]   So I think that Google should be doing as much as they can
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.960]   to try to highlight this issue.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.400]   And I think that a lot of people are trying
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.440]   to highlight this issue as well.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.680]   But it's going to take a long time.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.040]   I mean, there's a patent bill that's about to go through--
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.360]   Obama has said he was signed it, but it doesn't quite
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.680]   go far enough towards addressing a lot of these issues.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.160]   It's already been passed in the Senate House
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.120]   just needs to be reconciled.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.000]   Right.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.480]   And so that will help in some ways
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.520]   and may make things worse in other ways.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.840]   Seems pretty toothless, yeah.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.320]   Well, I mean, it really is.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.800]   It doesn't get at the heart of the problem,
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.760]   which is the fact that a lot of these patents should have
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.280]   never been issued in the first place.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.600]   The patent office is hopelessly underwater
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.520]   with applications that grow over year.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.240]   They don't have a ton of people working there.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.160]   I think their budget for 2011 was what
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.640]   Google made in profits last quarter.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.080]   So you sort of get a sense of where the priorities are
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.400]   in the government towards these things.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.960]   And I mean, Google can lobby and they can complain
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.800]   and they can raise a fuss and all of that.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.080]   And people can go, yeah, you're right.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.920]   But it's going to take a lot more than complaining
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.560]   to actually get something done.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.560]   Tommy, you pointed out that Google's in a really tough
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.480]   position with their IPO filing.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.800]   I think you mentioned that they even said one of the lines
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.040]   they used was, we are not a conventional company.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.320]   And now they're being forced to fight
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.840]   this kind of conventional fight that Apple, Microsoft,
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.360]   and other firms are so used to fighting
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.320]   with big stockpiles of patents.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.880]   Do you think that Google's just kind of pinched
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.320]   by its own image a little bit?
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.000]   Yeah, I mean, I think that a lot of those things
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.560]   in that founders that have come back to haunt them
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.240]   over the years.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.240]   And they had the best of intentions, of course,
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.080]   when they set out to do it.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.280]   But once you get to be a big company, like the size of Google,
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.920]   you don't have really a choice but to engage in a lot of things
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.760]   that at 24-year-old Larry and Sergey probably
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.880]   would have thought were pretty reprehensible.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.560]   But there's just no choice.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.440]   There's no choice for Google if it wants Android
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.480]   to continue to succeed but to get involved
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.640]   with this mobile patent scheme.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.760]   I mean, let's call it what it is.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.720]   So I mean, I think that they--
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.960]   it's going to be very interesting
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.880]   to see what Larry decides to do now that--
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.240]   I mean, it's pretty clear that they didn't address it
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.800]   as much over the last couple of years.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.560]   And now that he's run on the show,
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.760]   it's going to be interesting to see what they do.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.000]   They may want to happen to spend billions and billions
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.720]   of dollars to get patents that may not be valid, which
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.800]   is insane, but here we are.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.240]   Gina, what do you think-- yeah, go ahead.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.800]   It seems like the issue of patents
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.400]   has come up for independent developers
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.120]   and smaller developers in the last few years,
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.840]   because we have these so many platforms which
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.000]   you can release apps and the lot's issue.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.400]   And I feel like Google's making very strong public statements
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.640]   about how broken the system is and what they're doing
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.160]   to try to protect consumers from the costs
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.840]   that could trickle down to them if they
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.120]   lose these battles.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.040]   But I think they're trying to really rally the troops.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.600]   I mean, I think there are a lot of developers who are much more
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.520]   aware than ever how broken the system is.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.440]   And I think that that's part of their--
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.360]   I think that they have to both complain about the system
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.840]   but work within it to protect consumers.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.440]   And if they position themselves as saying,
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.040]   we're trying to protect consumers and make it
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.040]   so that you don't have to pay an extra $20 or whatever
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.600]   it would be on the handset to buy all the licenses you need
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.240]   to in order to get Android, which is just now free,
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.240]   but also say these are bogus and this is broken,
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.760]   and we need to redo this.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.240]   I mean, I'd love to see more initiatives like Peer
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.560]   to Patent where patent applications are public for companies
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.800]   of interest for everyone to review and discuss
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.440]   and make recommendations about whether or not
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.640]   the application should be granted.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.400]   I mean, the system just has to be overhauled.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.160]   And the patent office can get companies and experts
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.160]   and people who work in these areas to offer support
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.960]   and their thoughts about whether or not a patent ship
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.960]   should be granted.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.800]   I don't know what we do about the already granted
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.920]   bogus patents.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.280]   Well, earlier this week, Mark Cuban wrote a post saying,
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.600]   let's get rid of software patents and process patents,
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.360]   particularly, and he thinks that will take the burden
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.280]   off the patent office, make things cheaper,
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.600]   encourage innovation.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.720]   Is that the silver bullet?
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.640]   Is Cuban got the answer?
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.840]   I mean, it would be nice if it were that easy to do,
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.600]   but there are legitimate patents.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.800]   I mean, this is part of the problem,
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.280]   is that in patenting a lot of these things,
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.880]   you don't necessarily know which ones are valid
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.200]   and which ones aren't until you litigate it,
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.160]   until you actually get into a courtroom
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.280]   and figure out what the claims cover,
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.400]   or the patent office reexamends it, which doesn't happen.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.000]   The patents involved in the BlackBerry case,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.080]   remember that way back when?
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.600]   Yeah, right.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.640]   NTP, just this month, won an appeal
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.400]   of the reexamination process for that.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.560]   So that was five years ago or so.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.760]   And they were first litigated 10 years ago,
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.120]   and the patent office may just get around
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.240]   to doing a final reexamination of them
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.480]   some time later this year, the 10 years.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.720]   So it's kind of, you know, it'd be nice
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.240]   to just throw everything out and start over,
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.440]   but that's not necessarily gonna be in the best interest
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.960]   of a lot of smaller companies who have legitimate innovations,
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.400]   and patent them to try to protect their business.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.080]   And we need to figure out something
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.280]   to protect those people as well.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.440]   I don't know if it's copyright.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.240]   And do you think that there needs to be software patents then
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.360]   to protect software?
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.120]   I mean, that's sort of the broader question.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:40.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.920]   Because like software is an art,
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.760]   and it needs to be protected in some way.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.680]   You can't have, you know, you don't want it
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.400]   to just be, you know, open to anybody.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.240]   I don't think anybody's really saying that.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.320]   But how do you go about doing it?
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.640]   Do you have some sort of copyright system?
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.480]   Do you have some sort of--
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.360]   Well, and there is a copyright system.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.040]   That's what Cuban argues is copyright already protects you
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.680]   from people just imitating your stuff.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.320]   So why do we need patents for things that are obvious?
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.880]   Well, because not everything is obvious, right?
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.480]   I mean, the iPhone's obvious now.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.080]   Was it obvious in 2006?
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.800]   Maybe it was, you know, but Apple went out and changed,
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.520]   you know, the way that we look at mobile technology.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.720]   So, you know, sometimes patents--
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.720]   this is the hard part, is that sometimes patents are justified.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.920]   And sometimes they're not.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.920]   And so how do you--
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.280]   I mean, I think the answer is better examination
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.240]   of patents in the first place.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.280]   Stronger review.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.920]   Stronger tests.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.920]   You know, they actually look for prior art instead of, you know,
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.920]   stamping the thing and throwing it in the next pile on your desk.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.400]   Kevin, Gina and Jeff and I talked about this last week,
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.760]   the idea of software patents.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.720]   What do you think about this?
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.040]   Well, it's funny that if you read through Tom's article
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.960]   and also listened to the most recent "This American Life"
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.240]   episode, which was called "When Patents Attack,"
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.720]   it's a really heated war that nobody wants to be in.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.520]   Engineers, you know, the companies themselves,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.400]   obviously as Tom's article points out,
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.960]   the folks who work at the patent office
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.000]   don't want to be in that game anymore.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.200]   It's a really heated issue around something
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.840]   that almost universally, you know, most folks,
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.760]   except for maybe the rare small, you know, innovator who
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.160]   does need a patent protection.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.240]   It's a fight that nobody really wants to be in,
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.800]   but it's getting increasingly, you know, violent and heated.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.560]   It's a really strange story when you think about it.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.720]   More and more, I am of the opinion.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.280]   And maybe I got swayed a little bit by Cuban's editorial
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:29.080]   that software is a mathematical equation, right?
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.440]   I mean, that's all software really is at base.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.560]   It's a set of equations.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.440]   And equations cannot be patented.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.480]   I think there are maybe some exceptions to that
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.800]   where software could need a patent.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.880]   But if we just kind of enshrine that and say,
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.080]   the burden, the assumption is that software isn't patentable
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.160]   until you can show otherwise, that could solve a lot of problems.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.800]   And I think we're seeing a couple of examples
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.760]   of why copyright and trademark might be all the protection
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.760]   you need.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.520]   Apple won a ruling in Germany that blocks the Samsung Galaxy
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.800]   tab from being sold anywhere in Europe,
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.360]   except for the Netherlands, based on community design.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.560]   So that's based on trademark, the look of it.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.320]   It has nothing to do with patents.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.760]   And they filed to target the Motorola Zoom
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.040]   in that same German court.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.280]   Now, this is the East Texas of Europe, this court.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:27.440]   They're very friendly to plaintiffs in this sort of thing.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.480]   But this is not patents.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.480]   This is Apple saying, look, if it looks too much like our trademark,
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.320]   then they can't sell it.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.840]   And again, it's preliminary injunction
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.160]   and has yet to be determined fully in the courts.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.040]   But it's an example of not needing patent law
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.640]   to help defend yourself.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.600]   One thing that really bugged me about that Samsung thing
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.760]   that I just have to point out is Samsung did not
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.240]   get a chance to defend itself against that order.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.840]   They basically found out about it when it happened.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.280]   So they didn't get a chance to argue their case,
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.440]   which is kind of insane to me.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.280]   But that sort of speaks to how competing in different parts
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.440]   of the world with different standards for patent
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.200]   or design or trademark or whatever
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.080]   can really complicate your business.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.040]   I think most people who looked at the Motorola Zoom
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.640]   and the iPad side by side would feel
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.280]   like it was a compliment to the Zoom to say
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.160]   it's too much like the iPad to--
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:20.800]   Exactly.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.680]   I was going to say it.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.320]   --exist in Germany.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.760]   I mean, I like the Zoom is good for what it is.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.560]   But it almost feels like Apple shouldn't even say that in court.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.920]   They shouldn't legally say that, oh, yeah,
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.240]   this is a very similar product to our iPad, too.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.880]   It seems strange.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.440]   Yeah, I can see the argument for the tab, right, Gina?
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.800]   But maybe not the Zoom.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.000]   Right, not the Zoom.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.920]   So we're talking about the hardware design, right?
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.240]   That's what we're talking about, not the software.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.400]   Yeah, they're pretty different.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.800]   I mean, can you--
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.000]   I don't know, I have trouble with that.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.920]   Can you say that I'm going to--
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.840]   we own the design for what's basically just a slab of touch
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.920]   screen?
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.440]   I don't know.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.800]   I mean, I guess that the tab is a lot like the iPad.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.720]   The shape is different.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.200]   The weight is different where the camera--
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.360]   maybe I'm splitting hairs.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.240]   But I suppose I can kind of see the similarity with the tab.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.480]   But the Zoom, absolutely not.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.960]   That seems crazy.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:18.520]   Well, if I make a knockoff iPad, then we would think it's obvious.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.800]   Like, oh, you can't make something that looks just like the iPad.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.120]   So where do you draw the line?
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.280]   I mean, if something would have to look just like the iPad,
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.920]   for me, it would have to be the same size, the same orientation
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.600]   with the one button in terms of hardware.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.720]   And then the software would have to also look the same.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.320]   I saw a skin.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.120]   At one point, we covered a story with it involved
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.520]   in Android skin that looked--
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.280]   I mean, it really looked like iOS, the software itself.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.080]   I mean, so if you had those two things together,
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.080]   I would say, OK, this is clearly just mimicking every single
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.400]   little bit about it.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.560]   But the tab just seems like a good tablet
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.960]   with minimal buttons and hardware on it.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.480]   And the hardware that does have the camera and the front-facing
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.760]   button, they're different than the iPad.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.320]   Again, maybe I'm splitting hairs.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.680]   And maybe I'm arguing for the thing that I just argued against,
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.480]   which is that patents are bogus in these very subtle differences
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.760]   don't count as innovations.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.440]   I don't know.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.840]   Yeah, this is definitely a topic that's
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.520]   going to continue to be debated and acted upon.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.760]   And it's one of those weird things where it feels like nobody
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.120]   who's involved in this except maybe the companies like LODESIS
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.560]   that are strictly benefiting off of owning patents,
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.320]   nobody really wants to be involved with this.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.240]   It's sort of a necessary evil for business.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.040]   Well, I don't think Microsoft is too concerned
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.160]   about being involved with this.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.680]   I mean, I think they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.480]   But they don't want to have to have a bunch of lawyers
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.760]   hired to constantly acquire patents and defend themselves,
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.400]   do they?
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.400]   Why not?
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:40.840]   Maybe.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.800]   They make enough money.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.200]   Yeah, all right.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.960]   As long as it's a profitable business center,
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.800]   I guess they don't care.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.600]   Well, that's true.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.560]   And it also sort of reinforces the fact
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.200]   that Microsoft can say that we continue
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.240]   to be an innovative company.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.440]   And it's very important to Microsoft
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.960]   to continue to be seen as a company that's
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.760]   on the forefront of computing, which
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.800]   is a charge that they have to defend themselves
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.560]   against quite a bit.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.480]   All right, well, let's move on into some Android news.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.240]   Google is retiring Android App inventor.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.840]   But in Google fashion, open sourcing the code.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.040]   Gina, have you been following this?
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:17.720]   Yeah, I have.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.640]   You know, it's sad.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.120]   And I actually am of two minds about this.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.760]   I mean, there are a lot of teachers.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.600]   This app was very popular in education.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.800]   There are a lot of high school teachers
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.840]   who are introducing students to app development using this app.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.560]   I use this app.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:36.120]   I made a Valentine app for my wife last February 14, ladies.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.360]   You used App inventor?
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.040]   Because it--
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.040]   Wow.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:39.640]   Did you--
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.200]   Was it just because it was faster?
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:41.720]   That's there.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.280]   You know, I did it because I wanted
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.920]   to see what it was like, what the experience was like.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.520]   And I thought it would just be cool to get a kitten to me
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.920]   out when you tap it, which is basically
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.560]   the Hello World example in App Better.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.000]   And it was really-- and now I develop Android apps
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.040]   like using Java with actual source code.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.440]   So it was cool to see the WYSIWYG interface.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.000]   And you know, as a developer, I tend
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.160]   to look at these tools and think, these are cool.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.600]   But the reality is you hit a wall.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.400]   There's a point at which you just can't do the things
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.600]   you can do if you're using raw code.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.920]   All these frameworks and kind of pre-made WYSIWYG tools
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.320]   are great.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.200]   But ultimately, they're limited.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.760]   And they're not based pretty much not
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.520]   going to create an app that you're really going to release
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.000]   in the market and get great sales on.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.320]   The community builder in me says that people, new developers
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.800]   who are interested in platforms need a quick win.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.920]   They want to just work their way through a tutorial
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.600]   and have a Hello World working.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.200]   And App Better is a great way to do that.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.400]   So I'm sad that they're discontinuing it.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.240]   I think it's great that it's going open source.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.000]   There's no reason why someone can take over this project
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.720]   and keep it going and have it still available.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.800]   Google doesn't have to be the one taking care of it.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.200]   The way I feel about it is if Google has a choice between
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.600]   allocating resources towards shipping, ice cream sandwich,
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.320]   or maintaining app inventor, give me sandwich.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:55.120]   And that's kind of what has been going on, right?
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.920]   Larry Page has said, let's focus.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.880]   Let's get rid of some of these distractions that we've had.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.520]   It's been great to experiment and branch out and see what sticks.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.320]   But it's time to focus in on stuff.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.160]   And that is the other story here.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.760]   Lance Whitney over at CNET reporting
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.800]   that Google trying to rush to get ice cream sandwich out
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.640]   and beat iPhone 5.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.240]   We still don't know when iPhone 5 is coming out.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.440]   We know it's coming out in the fall.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.000]   We know they're in beta 5 for it.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.080]   iOS 5 is in beta.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.120]   But we don't know anything about the hardware.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.680]   So is it a good thing for Google to rush?
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.320]   Or should they take their time and get it right?
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.760]   They should take their time and get it right.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.120]   Get it right.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.280]   It is the most important release of Android.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.080]   I'm fine saying that and quote me on it.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.920]   It's the most important release of Android they're going to do.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.120]   Because if you look at the widespread--
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.600]   the number of different versions people could be running now.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.080]   And if you look at the differences between Android 3
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.080]   or 3.1 on the tablet and 2.2 or 2.3 on the phone,
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.240]   the ice cream sandwich is meant to merge them together
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.680]   and give phones a little bit of the sci-fi techy look
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.520]   of the tablets and tablets a little bit more usability.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.960]   So it's the most important release they're going to do.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.440]   And I really don't think anyone's going to--
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.240]   I don't feel like new versions of Android
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.760]   get enough press play or enough public attention
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.160]   that someone's going to base their decision on this.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.960]   If you know-- everyone knows the iPhone,
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.320]   obviously they will argue in court
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.080]   that they spent all this marketing time and effort making
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.120]   it a public brand.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.960]   So if you know the iPhone, it doesn't
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.160]   seem like you're going to walk into a store
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.800]   and be like, I don't know, iPhone 5 or ice cream sandwich.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.480]   It doesn't seem like that type of thing.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.920]   It doesn't seem public knows enough about versions
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.920]   that they need to get it out there in front of the iPhone.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.920]   But if ice cream sandwich gets out there first
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.360]   and has all of these great features,
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.520]   they may go into a store and say, oh, I
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.520]   want that Android phone that has X, Y, and Z.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.960]   What you mean to say is that when they get ice cream sandwich
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.440]   out there first on one phone, on one carrier,
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.360]   through Best Buy.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.800]   Exactly.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.400]   I mean, how long would it take for the phones out there
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.200]   to get ice cream sandwich?
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:01.760]   It could take--
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.760]   It's going to take a while.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.960]   But that's the same as the iPhone's
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.160]   going to be on one phone.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.320]   It's one phone iPhone 5 available at Best Buy and Apple
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:09.720]   Stores.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.080]   But it's the iPhone.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:16.440]   And two of the US's biggest carriers.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.640]   Hence the rush.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.360]   This is a large store full of straw men
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.280]   we're talking about now.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.920]   But no, I think they really should take their time.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.800]   Because if the rumors are right,
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.560]   it'll be coming out on the Nexus Prime, which
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.280]   is the next Samsung phone.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.680]   And they should take their time to make sure
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.040]   that it's a well-crafted product that doesn't let
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.800]   itself to arguments about this phone's
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   available on this carrier with this version versus otherwise.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.040]   They should really try to bring everything under the big 10
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.240]   and spend their time making it smooth.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.440]   The Android team should learn from past mistakes.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.880]   Honeycomb was a rushed job to compete with the iPad.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.520]   Ice cream sandwich should not be a rushed job
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.440]   to compete with the iPhone.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.560]   It should just be a good job.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.880]   That's what I'm hoping.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.000]   That's what I'm hoping for.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.360]   Yeah, and ice cream sandwich to me,
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.680]   the big advantage is that it's one operating system, tablet,
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.120]   and phone.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.400]   And again, like you were saying, Kevin,
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.360]   just about ice cream sandwich in general,
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.880]   that's not something your average consumer is going to care
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.760]   one-wit about when they walk into a store.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.840]   Well, if that average customer could travel a few states
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.320]   over to visit their relatives and show their Android phones
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.760]   and their phones look roughly the same right now,
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.520]   if I have an Evo on Sprint and I show it to someone who's
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.520]   running the Samsung TouchWiz interface,
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.680]   it doesn't look to the average consumer.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.600]   They look like two completely different phones.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.720]   So if they can get that kind of platform consistency,
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.880]   that would be really nice.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.200]   And that would actually give them a pretty good competitive
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.480]   standpoint.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.200]   Gigahome reporting on an interesting bug in Google Plus.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.680]   It's kind of convoluted.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.720]   But essentially, there is a way, if you're sharing a computer
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:02.080]   with someone, that your IMs can end up in their Google Plus
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.000]   account.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.440]   And let me see if I can get this right.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:05.640]   They--
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.800]   Good luck.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.080]   The way Janko retkers over at Gigahome explains it,
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.960]   let's say Peter logs into Gmail and G Plus,
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.520]   leaves both windows open on his computer,
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.600]   hands his computer to Mary.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.240]   And then Mary, she logs into her Gmail,
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.000]   but leaves his Google Plus open,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.360]   then closes the browser window she used,
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.840]   and hands the computer back to Peter.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.360]   Apparently, Google Plus, while it's
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.480]   sitting there in a window that Mary is not using,
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.520]   will notice that Mary logged into Google Talk
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:43.480]   when she was on Gmail and connect to Mary's IM.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.040]   And then when those browser windows are closed,
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.600]   she'll hand that computer back to Peter.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.040]   He'll find out that he's still logged into Mary's Google
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.560]   Talk account, but it's still his Google Plus page
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.840]   because she never used the Google Plus page.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.240]   So in other words, the G Talk account
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.160]   logs in on the Google Plus page without logging him out
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.280]   of the Google Plus page because you
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.960]   got two different elements there.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.480]   And then Richard walks in with a lateral magnetic pulse
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.480]   device and goes--
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.120]   Steve is recording the whole thing over the shoulder.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.040]   And then Bob pops up and says, I'm the man in the middle.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.520]   I still all your data anyway.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.960]   So basically, they're saying Google Talk floats
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.880]   between accounts.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.640]   If you change browsers tabs too quickly,
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.320]   Google Talk could be tied to the wrong account
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.920]   and float from one browser tab to the other, basically.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.440]   It's the short version.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.160]   But your Wi-Fi has to go out and the ping
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.200]   has to not update it in the time that it could Wi-Fi came back
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.160]   in and logged out.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.200]   It's a really obscure--
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.200]   So much beyond, isn't that what you do?
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   Yeah, what are the odds on that?
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.040]   It's not a widespread scenario vulnerability.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.920]   And it's actually pretty easy to avoid,
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.960]   which is before you hand your computer over to somebody,
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.960]   close all of your windows and log out of it.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.520]   I mean, not even just close all your windows.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.520]   Log out of your account.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.440]   I mean, you should be doing that anyway, right?
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.920]   That's pretty basic security.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.400]   If you don't want someone to see what you're doing,
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.200]   don't hand your computer to them.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:02.720]   Now, Google--
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.960]   But one thing with Google Talk is that you can call people
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.480]   from it and you can do video chats with it.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.960]   So the only danger is that you could,
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.400]   like one of the dangers is you could
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.680]   prank call somebody from someone's Google Talk account.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.520]   Also, another thing is if Mary goes
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.720]   to a different computer and logs in,
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.120]   any I am, Mary sends from a different device
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.440]   would get relayed to Peter's computer
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.600]   if he leaves her logged into his Google Talk.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.680]   So Peter and Mary don't like each other very much.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   They're not after this.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.880]   Because he's going to find out all kinds of things he didn't know
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.320]   and that's going to end their relationship.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:33.840]   I know.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.200]   There are--
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.600]   These suspicious spouses are rigging up this hole.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.240]   You're here.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.840]   Just use my computer.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.560]   Don't touch Google Plus, though.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.000]   I'm driving off my condition.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.080]   Yeah, Google spokesperson said that it looks like a rare bug
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.560]   that is-- but it is being addressed.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.920]   So even if you're one of the people out there that are like,
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:58.680]   no, this is exactly the problem I face every day.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.400]   Hopefully they'll fix it soon.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.920]   Good news for Google and for Gmail.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.880]   Search and email still the top activities,
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.920]   according to a Pew survey conducted in May.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.200]   92% of online adults use search engines
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.040]   to hunt for information on the web.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.840]   And 59% do so on any given day.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.000]   Not a big surprise here, right?
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:20.480]   Not really.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.200]   I mean, was Netflix and porn in the survey?
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.240]   I mean, this doesn't surprise me.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.520]   It's funny how those are never included.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.040]   Why are prodded out?
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.920]   Go to a social network, get news.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.680]   Those are some of the other things showing up in the top.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.360]   Yeah, they didn't say anything about Netflix
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.040]   and porn particularly.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.840]   The growth in the social network usage, though,
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.200]   I mean, is obviously what has everybody excited about all
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:42.640]   of that.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.360]   I mean, it's mainstream now.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.520]   It really can't be ignored.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.760]   And that's something Google is obviously addressing.
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.480]   And Google now in the game.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.240]   Social network rising has been a threat to Google
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.320]   in this story six months ago.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.440]   Well, they have a good product.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.200]   But are they in the game?
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.680]   I mean, how many people--
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.400]   Facebook has what?
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.520]   750 million people and counting.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.760]   I didn't say they were winning the game.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.240]   I guess they're in it now.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.880]   I mean, without a doubt, Google Plus
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.600]   is the best thing they've produced from a social standpoint,
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.320]   ever.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.320]   I mean, I think that's pretty non-controversial.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.760]   That's canonical, yeah.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.480]   It was.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.280]   And it ain't wave.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.800]   So yeah.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.840]   So you're safe to write a book on it.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.200]   Oh, that's not nice.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.120]   Knock on wood.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:29.680]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.560]   I didn't mean to curse you there.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.440]   Inside joke people.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.120]   Inside joke.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.480]   I'm sorry, Gina.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.360]   It's OK.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.200]   It's a good punchline.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.400]   It makes everybody laugh.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.600]   It's good.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.720]   I'm secure in myself.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.480]   Web developer and self-proclaimed happiness evangelist--
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.720]   I would like that job.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   Francois Beaufort shared a new video--
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.320]   this was on ReadWriteWeb--
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.840]   of a touch interface for Google's Chrome browser
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.120]   currently in development.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:03.240]   So does this in some way imply that we get a Chrome OS tablet?
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.320]   Is this another piece of evidence for that?
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.920]   I have always heard every Google or I have ever talked to
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.520]   has said Chrome OS is for devices with a keyboard.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.040]   They've been pretty interested about that.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.880]   They've been pretty clear about this.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.880]   I mean, this seems like an experimental thing.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.640]   It's interesting that the demo video is using a mouse,
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.240]   and not an actual finger.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.000]   I don't know.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.200]   This seems like kind of an experiment.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.240]   I couldn't tell if Francois is a Googler or what.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.840]   Like, how did he get this?
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.320]   It sounds chromium related.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.400]   It seems like he lives in the Chromium open source version
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.400]   of Chrome.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.240]   That makes sense, yeah.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.240]   The mock-ups for Chrome OS when they first showed up
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.960]   on the web were very different than what
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.240]   Chrome is now, which is almost nothing.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.080]   It's just the browser with tabs.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.520]   The early mock-ups on the Chromium world
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:55.360]   showed front row style fades and a big background
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.040]   and stuff like that.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.280]   It turned out totally different.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.840]   So things that show up in the Chrome world
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.280]   don't necessarily always make it to market, so to speak.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:02.280]   Right.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.160]   And just because it's showing up for Chrome browser
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.920]   doesn't mean it shows up for Chrome OS necessarily, right?
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.920]   Right.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.400]   But it's not a bad idea.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.840]   I mean, if there's going to be that much momentum
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.800]   behind tablets, then why not?
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.960]   I mean, if Google's vision of the world
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.760]   is that we all sort of go more towards this web OS concept
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.320]   anyway, so you might as well see if it can make it work
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.320]   on a tablet.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.160]   It's actually my ranking stream that he had with the Crunchpad,
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.760]   the Ilgon Crunchpad, the--
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:28.760]   Oh, right.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.480]   It keeps a glass that has a browser.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.480]   Like, that's all he wanted.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.680]   And this would be it, basically, if it really existed.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.200]   That is true.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.200]   You should have gotten a patent on that.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.480]   A bump bump.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.720]   It feels like web apps are, in general,
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.760]   adapting a more touch-friendly interface.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.880]   Even Google search results page were just recently
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.600]   sort of a little more spread out, no matter
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.320]   whether you're accessing it in a browser or on a tablet.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.440]   So it just feels like the touch interface,
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.600]   larger, easier to find, but tap targets are just generally
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.720]   a design theme right now, which I think is definitely
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.240]   a good thing.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.200]   So this seems like a Chromium experiment.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:04.640]   I don't know.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.080]   I don't know if we're ever going to see this.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.640]   Maybe they'll make a tablet that you can dual boot, Chrome,
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.080]   or Android for the Uber nerds.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.600]   Well, somebody could make that.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.120]   They could make that right now, if they wanted to,
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.160]   especially if they got a hold of this interface.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.120]   That's true.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.400]   It's not outside the realm of possibility.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.680]   I just don't know if Google wants
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.480]   to have that kind of brand confusion.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.000]   Which Google tablet should I buy?
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Is it the Android one?
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:30.920]   Is it the Chrome OS?
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.120]   Up to now, I think the reason that they have been so
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:37.680]   insistent of the separation is because they want to avoid that
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.680]   and say Chrome OS is a thing.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.480]   It's a laptop of its own.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:45.560]   We don't have Android laptops, at least none that we advertise
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.720]   and support officially.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.520]   And we don't have Chrome OS tablets.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.080]   And we're trying to keep that straight.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.880]   Because otherwise, it is pretty confusing.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.240]   It is.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.360]   And I honestly don't think this will ever get to consumers.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.040]   I wouldn't be surprised if this came out as a kind of fun,
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:57.760]   nerdy project.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.120]   You can hear, hack this open source version of Chromium
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.080]   onto your tab and see what it's like.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.440]   But I very much doubt.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.600]   Chrome OS has been-- it's a productivity machine.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.160]   And honestly, to be productive, you need a full,
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.760]   you need a full keyboard.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.840]   The iPads and tablets, and generally, are consumption
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.200]   devices.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.520]   They play games, you watch movies, that kind of thing.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.880]   So I think this is cool.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.400]   But I'd be very surprised if it went anywhere
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.240]   beyond just a geeky open source project.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.280]   And actually, the Android browser on their tablets
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.040]   is pretty Chrome-like as it is.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.680]   I mean, it's not exactly Chrome, but it's close to it.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.400]   So it would be kind of--
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.360]   it seems like a weird thing to have to do.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.840]   Another Chromebook news, though.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.280]   Three months after being promised at Google I/O,
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.640]   Netflix streaming comes to the Chromebook.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.720]   And if you're wondering why didn't they have it,
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.920]   are you watching Netflix on my Chrome browser?
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:53.200]   It's because the DRM implementation of Netflix
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.200]   required some tweaking in Chrome OS.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.360]   But Samsung Series 5, Acer AC700, and the CR-Heart 48s,
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.600]   all can access Netflix.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.800]   So what I'm wondering is, when you
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.800]   go onto Virgin America and you rent the Chromebook,
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:11.320]   can you use the Google wireless to watch your Netflix?
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.200]   Ah.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.840]   I think it would be a little slow.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.400]   Also, everybody on the plane would hate you.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.320]   Well, yeah, because everybody else's bandwidth
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.760]   would grind to a halt.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.240]   Right.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.680]   You think just that you've got two Veronica Mars.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.960]   How did you know?
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.400]   You think the media's coming from phone all over themselves
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.040]   to do streaming on something like a Chromebook.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.640]   I mean, you can't install anything on it.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.640]   So you're always going--
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.640]   the problem of actually sharing files goes away.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.360]   You think they really want to push that?
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.000]   There are no files, essentially.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.720]   Ooh, I like an idea.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.160]   Not for me, but I think that's true.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.040]   You think that it would be Hulu, too.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.480]   I hope Hulu comes over to the Chromebook very soon.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.520]   It's kind of there, but wonky.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.520]   It needs to be smoothed out quite a bit.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.240]   And then we've got this infographic from GigaOM in here
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.320]   that compares Netflix with Comcast,
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.800]   US subscribers in the millions, and just
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:14.760]   chose visually how Netflix is catching up from Q109 through Q211
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:19.640]   to the point where Netflix actually surpassed Comcast
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.440]   in US subscribers.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:21.960]   It's amazing.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.840]   And Q2 2011, is that right?
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.760]   It must have been a Twitch sponsorship.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.520]   It must have been Netflix.com/Twit,
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.840]   where you get a 30-day free trial.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.880]   It definitely must have been.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.400]   That was seamless.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.360]   That's the only thing I could think of that would explain it.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.200]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.880]   I honestly don't think that that's what pushed it ahead.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.400]   But yeah, it's sort of unbelievable.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.760]   But yet, this is why you have so much enmity
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.080]   against Netflix right now, especially from the cable
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.080]   companies.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.000]   Yeah, but did you see those revenue numbers?
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.240]   That made me really sad.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.640]   Netflix had revenue of $2.16 billion in 2010
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.640]   and $770 million in Q2 2011.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.640]   So the revenue's going the wrong way.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.040]   Yes.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:06.440]   Yes.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.440]   No, wait.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.680]   It's $2010 in total, all four quarters.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.440]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.440]   No, it's going the right way.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:11.760]   You're right.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.040]   It's just one quarter under here.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.240]   One quarter versus all of 2010.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:14.440]   So--
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.520]   That is a poorly drawn infographic.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.960]   It is.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.920]   Because that big film canister makes it look like--
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.280]   yeah.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.560]   But it is just one quarter, $770 million.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.200]   So all right.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.920]   They also have 61% of the digital movie market share.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.480]   That's amazing.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.520]   Netflix is an amazing company.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.360]   They're doing incredible.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.320]   I mean, the service they provide is--
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.120]   well, all right.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.560]   I'll stop making this sound like a commercial.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.040]   I just--
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.560]   I really do love Netflix.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.760]   You started it.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.840]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.160]   I'm going to shut up now.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:42.880]   No, but yeah.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.240]   I mean, and if you're curious, there
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.400]   is some curious numbers in these things, as usual.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.720]   30% of all Netflix traffic is on a PlayStation 3
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.680]   versus 25% on an Xbox 360 and just about 20%
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.480]   on a PC.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   So people watching it on their televisions
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.920]   and watching it through PS3 more than Xbox 360, which
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.120]   is odd to me.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.280]   Because PS3 and Wii went through that period
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.800]   where you had to order the disk before you could install it.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.080]   And it was kind of a barrier, whereas Xbox just kind of got
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.040]   it natively in the OS update.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:11.720]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.800]   Does that correspond with Xbox versus PS3 sales?
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:15.560]   I don't think so.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.560]   And John-Lan market share?
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.960]   I'm eyeballing it.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.480]   But Xbox has been leading the PS3 in sales for so much
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.560]   that I would not think that that was the case.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.160]   I don't know what the install-based numbers are, though.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.320]   That's an interesting question.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.680]   All right, let's say--
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.600]   well, we sort of just took a break for commercials,
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.960]   so let's just keep moving on.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.000]   Netflix.com/twit, 30 days free.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.800]   You heard it here for a Stella Friend.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.680]   And I just have a note about Google
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:47.560]   Plus that we must play this video from Ileane.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.360]   And I haven't had a chance to actually view it,
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.680]   so I hope it's safe for work.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.200]   Not sure.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.360]   It's safe for work.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.840]   I think Gina has asked me.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.800]   Oh, did Gina teach me to put this in?
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.560]   I did.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.880]   So is there a setup to this, or should we just go in cold?
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.920]   It's about Google Plus.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.800]   It's Google Plus related.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.560]   It's kind of a goofy video.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.440]   All right, it'll be fun.
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:04.920]   It'll be fun.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.000]   Yeah, excellent.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.640]   Here we go.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:14.040]   Check my email, got an invite to a website I don't know.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.800]   Looks like Google, but at first I thought my friend said
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.120]   that I know.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.320]   Why did we need an additional network?
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.640]   Because in Facebook, they're all right.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.920]   A new thing won't mean to learn.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.480]   This could take all night.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.240]   Damn it.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:32.280]   What is this, Google Plus?
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.240]   Did she get sick?
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.320]   I don't need Google Plus.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.920]   There's another plus one and another plus one.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.080]   What is this, Google Plus?
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.280]   Hey, what's this red thing here?
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.360]   Going Google Plus.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.400]   They want me to put my friends in circles,
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.840]   but circle not those ways.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.760]   Every day is like stuff is choice.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.920]   Trying to choose where the drink goes well.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.120]   Put a pair around, search for friends,
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.360]   can't get in without invites.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.440]   And when I'm drunk and leave, 'cause it is cute,
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.360]   I can edit it later than night.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.960]   Whoa.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.200]   I kind of like Google Plus.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:10.240]   Can't believe I'm on Google Plus.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.640]   Oh, another hangout and another hangout.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.880]   I dig my Google Plus.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:19.200]   Hey, on high school friends, we can't turn my Google Plus.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.160]   Friends at me without me adding them.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.600]   That feature is really nice.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.120]   Brando's ugly's my part to learn all these friends
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.640]   I've never liked.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.720]   No one knows.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.280]   My circle names, we've been good friends in hand picked.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.280]   Did you make it into my main beat?
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.720]   Or are you in my circle of--
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.040]   Whoa, yeah.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:38.560]   Whoops.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.920]   I'm in love with Google Plus.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.920]   She means circle of people who cut the cell
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.480]   accidentally with a pin.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.320]   Here's another juice bag and another loser
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.600]   that didn't name a Google Plus.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.760]   Hey, now I'm a fascist pig.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.920]   Thank you, Google Plus.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.360]   All right.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.040]   Who made that?
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.280]   Where'd that come from?
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.360]   Is that just like a college humor type of thing?
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.520]   Google wishes they made it.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.520]   And I'm sorry.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.400]   He's shaking his head.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.320]   Yeah, he is.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.160]   He's rolling over.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.480]   I had to direct all of that, but--
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.600]   The names of her circles were just priceless.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.840]   The mouth breathers, the drums.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.880]   Never really liked you anyway.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.720]   I kind of like that.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:17.720]   So thanks--
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.040]   And there was Jeff in the chat room
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.000]   was like, oh my god, this thing has been posted so many times
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.200]   on Google Plus.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.200]   Right.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:24.720]   Right.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.920]   I know on Google Plus, I saw somebody say,
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.960]   this is the 11th time of watching this.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.040]   Well, and that was my favorite part of the whole thing
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.840]   is when she's like, you can't join my Google Plus.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.440]   No parents and bosses yet.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.200]   I like that too.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.320]   That's good.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.000]   It captures a lot of things that are great about it.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.600]   This really stage, especially in the comment editing,
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.760]   which is a really big thing.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.480]   Yes.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.840]   And the fact that this is the experience of a lot of people,
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.760]   I think, for all joking.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.320]   This is sort of-- a lot of people are like,
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.640]   great, another social network.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.760]   Why do I need this?
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.960]   They get caught up in it, and then they start liking it.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.320]   That seems to be the experience.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.880]   And the red thing too was kind of--
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.600]   Yeah, yeah, the little line's in there.
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.880]   That was my favorite thing about Google Plus at first
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.480]   was the notifications, because then I could access it
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.640]   without having to go to it.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.440]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:13.940]   I like it.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.760]   I think it's a thing that kind of really makes it sticky.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.400]   I mean, you could have email notifications
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.040]   until the cows come home, or whatever.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.480]   But when you go to the Google Search page,
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.840]   or in any other Google service, and you see that notification
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.600]   that you've got new stuff, you click on it.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:28.200]   So it is that kind of thing that doesn't let you forget.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.560]   Google Labs has turned into the hunger games.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.920]   Only one will survive at the end.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:38.320]   Matt McGee has a post up on Search Engine Land.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.120]   Google-- as we mentioned earlier in the show,
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.920]   really focusing on things, getting rid
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.480]   of a lot of extraneous projects, and choosing winners and losers
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.240]   among lab projects.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:50.600]   Google Books and Graham survives.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.960]   I wouldn't have guessed that one.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.320]   That's the one that shows you the history of the use
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.480]   of a word throughout time.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.840]   It's now an official part of Google Books.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.800]   You know, I feel like I know Google products pretty well.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.480]   And reading through this list, I realized how many labs things
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.000]   I just didn't know, or we talked about once,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.120]   and hadn't looked at again.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.520]   I think this pairing now that they're doing
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.680]   is probably a good thing.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.160]   What does this do at 20% time?
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.600]   You know, I have a good question.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:22.200]   Like, if they don't have as many ways to come up with stuff,
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.720]   or like to actually-- like, if you make something
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.520]   your 20% time, you want to feel rewarded that you did it,
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:26.720]   right?
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.360]   And so you need to have it shown somewhere.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.800]   So if they're pairing down these projects,
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.800]   like, what kind of incentive do you have to do something
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.160]   in your 20% time?
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.880]   I wonder if they're asking engineers this totally,
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.080]   just speculation I have no idea.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.920]   But asking engineers to build upon existing platforms.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:47.480]   So like, build a Gmail Labs feature, which, by the way,
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.400]   Gmail Labs is totally separate from Google Labs.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.520]   That's alive and well and staying around.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.360]   Or building an app that plugs into Google Apps.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:58.080]   Or it seems like they're building in the ability
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.680]   for developers to develop on top of existing products
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.200]   versus making something totally new.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.080]   So I don't know.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.000]   That might be a possibility.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.120]   I wonder though if the 20% time has changed,
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.160]   we should get a Google on here sometime
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.360]   and see if that has changed at all.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.200]   That's a good theory, because they really
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.960]   have a strong culture of dog fooding at Google.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.080]   So they could just roll that in.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.760]   Although it changes the principle of 20% time, which
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.160]   was work on whatever you want so that we can discover new stuff.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.680]   Yeah, and Gmail was a 20% time project.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:33.360]   And I know for every Gmail, there are probably hundreds
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.440]   of 20% projects that either never made it out the door
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.120]   or an experiment or were like gnaw or search wiki
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.080]   or one of those products that never went anywhere.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.280]   But Gmail was a pretty big win.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.280]   So they certainly do want to keep that possibility
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.480]   of another Gmail kind of hatching
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.440]   from an interested engineer open.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.240]   At the same time, it may be just a matter of not
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.960]   keeping things around longer or--
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.160]   I don't know what the maintenance is for projects like this.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.280]   But once the maintenance becomes more of a more tedious
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:04.120]   than the interest in it, just kill it off sooner.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.160]   Do you think that they should allow--
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:07.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.960]   Do you think that Larry Page has in mind
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:14.880]   to focus down, remove things, and then open it back up
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.560]   after a while?
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.720]   Is it going to be a cyclical thing?
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:18.840]   It's kind of hard to do, right?
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.320]   I mean, there's a generation of Googlers
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.400]   that were raised in that culture.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.200]   And so to put the brakes on that to a certain extent,
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.520]   I think is at a time when they're already
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.680]   struggling to keep a lot of good people with companies
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.720]   like Facebook and Twitter hiring very aggressively,
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.560]   I don't know.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.840]   I mean, I think it's a bit of a risk.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:37.560]   But I think it's probably necessary at the same time, too.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.160]   I mean, I think that a little bit of focus for a company,
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.000]   like Google, is probably not a bad thing.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.240]   It's just where you draw the line, right?
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:43.920]   How you balance it.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:44.440]   Sure.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.280]   Let's see what he does.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.920]   Or they could leave the 20% time and say,
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.920]   keep the taps flowing.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.640]   And we won't have Google Labs anymore.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.760]   But if we see something that you're working on that's
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:57.040]   really interesting, we'll grab it and actually make it--
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.120]   we'll put more behind the stuff we pick.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.560]   Right.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.840]   I guess that's possible, too.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.360]   I think-- well, Kevin, what do you think?
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:10.920]   It's difficult to think about what the grading scale must be.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.480]   Because if you think about the average Google user who
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.560]   isn't as tied into it as perhaps we are all,
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.880]   or let's just show our--
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.760]   how many people ever tweak with their settings or labs
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:26.160]   in Google products or try out, go to the settings,
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.520]   and look really deep in and say, oh, look, I can do Gmail
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.000]   undo.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.960]   It seems like if you don't have those kind of--
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:37.040]   that whole lab section and blog posts announcing new goofy
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.720]   things that you're trying, it seems like it's harder
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.760]   to get awareness for them.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:44.120]   So the whole kind of iterative on top of products
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:47.120]   labs development, I think, feels like you'd
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.160]   have less awesome stuff coming out of it.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.200]   I do think we should pour a little out for script converter,
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.320]   bread crumb, Google talk guru.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.640]   I've definitely never heard of several image swirls.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.040]   Sputnik, the JavaScript testing tool.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.720]   You'll be sorely missed.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.160]   And App and Vener for Android.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.480]   We talked about that before, too.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.720]   By naming it Sputnik, they kind of set it up.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.160]   App and Vener was the one I think that was the most probably
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:11.720]   remarkable.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.640]   That's probably the most loved, huh?
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.160]   Huh.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:15.480]   That's--
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.040]   Now, one of those 20% time projects
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.600]   that gets a lot of attention is the driverless car, which
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.000]   we talked about last week was in an accident.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.320]   Human caused accident.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.400]   But apparently, China recently debuted
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.920]   an autonomous vehicle that is made in partnership with China's
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.400]   first auto works and university researchers
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:41.520]   equipped with a honky HQ3 sedan.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.920]   That can't be how that's pronounced.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.920]   H-O-N-G-Q-I.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.720]   That can't be right.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:46.400]   That's not right.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.480]   Honchi, maybe?
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.000]   Not much better.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.160]   Not much better.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.240]   Autonomous vehicle made a 154 mile.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.600]   I've totally lost my place.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.200]   I've had a 154 mile journey on a busy freeway
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:04.080]   from the Hunan Province's capital of Changsha to Wuhan,
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.120]   the capital of the Hubei province,
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.720]   made it in three hours and 20 minutes.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:08.600]   Driverless.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.920]   Because if you've looked at China's history
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.600]   with data and privacy policies over the last five years,
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.600]   the one thing you want is China driving your car for you.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.120]   Really?
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.360]   I mean, obviously, they've been so good with--
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.080]   That's worse than my gene ed, James.
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.600]   --not on screen people live.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.400]   Well, oh, yes, it was.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:28.120]   To China, which is my country.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:30.320]   Yeah, so who runs the car?
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:35.320]   What back-end service is it uploading information back to?
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.880]   Yeah, I don't know what--
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.120]   I guess we have the same question with the Google driverless
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.440]   car, but we have an idea of Google's platform.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.240]   I don't know anything about the companies providing
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.720]   the platform for this.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.200]   There's got to be a backdoor for the government
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.080]   to get in there, though.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.160]   There's just no way that China does things like that
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.040]   without at least thinking through what it could allow them
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:55.400]   to do.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.200]   If you say the word Tiananmen Square,
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.000]   the car comes to a screeching halt.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.120]   You just can't go there.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:00.840]   You can go everywhere else.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.760]   You can't go there.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.760]   You try to put it in navigation, and it just
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.000]   tries to reroute you to a Starbucks or something.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.200]   It has no idea.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.920]   Wouldn't you like to go to a fake Apple store instead?
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.320]   You can have a store.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.640]   I just got back from China, and I noticed on every freeway,
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.440]   every highway, there are cameras everywhere,
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.760]   like constantly snapping.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.240]   So this just seems like a more efficient way
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.760]   to gather data about where every car is going in China.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.160]   All jokes aside, I think driverless cars
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.520]   are something we desperately need as a society,
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:33.440]   because I really do believe that humans are probably
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.880]   the worst entity of any kind to be in charge of a car
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.000]   on the freeway.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.840]   And I think this would actually improve traffic.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.160]   It would improve safety.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.280]   And so the fact that we have multiple entities researching
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.760]   this is a good thing, as long as the research is shared.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.040]   And it's going to happen.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.760]   Yeah, it's just a question of who.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.800]   But I mean, I'm telling you, the lawsuit when somebody--
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.520]   when some code error crashes a car for the first time,
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:57.600]   I think--
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.080]   Oh boy.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:45:59.880]   It's inevitable.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.560]   Yeah, Nevada State Legislature actually
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:05.360]   has a law about driverless cars on the books already.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:05.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:06.560]   Just in case.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.120]   Making a head.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.400]   All right, let's take a quick break and thank
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.120]   our sponsor Carbonite.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.200]   Unexpected computer disasters are going to happen.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.520]   It's not something you want to hear,
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.040]   but it's something that's absolutely true.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.480]   So if you want to make sure that your data is safe,
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.080]   if you care about the data on your computer--
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.600]   if you don't care about the data on your computer,
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.760]   just fast forward right now.
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.880]   Skip, go to the bathroom.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.880]   But if you care about your data, you
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.480]   need to have a good data backup plan.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.880]   And the way I recommend-- and several people
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:38.560]   recommend-- is to have your copy that's on your computer,
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.320]   a copy on a local storage drive that's
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.000]   separated from your computer, but is local to you,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.080]   and a copy in a remote location that is away from you.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.640]   That way, if there's a fire or flood or other disaster
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.480]   in your locale, you still have your data backed up elsewhere.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.720]   If there's a problem elsewhere, you've got a copy here.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.320]   You've got triple redundancy.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:00.440]   Carbonite.com is my recommendation for that remote storage.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:04.440]   It's absolutely safe, encrypted end to end.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.720]   It backs up all of your files.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.800]   Once you get the paid version, everything on your drive
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.360]   goes up into the cloud with no limits.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:13.280]   It's easy to use.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.520]   It just happens in the background.
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.640]   You can even check to prioritize it
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.000]   so that if you're doing some bandwidth intensive stuff,
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.720]   it doesn't get in your way.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.880]   And you get your files back with just a few clicks.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.720]   And the side benefit is you can access all of your files
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.840]   wherever you go on the web using your login.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.160]   So unlimited backup of your PC and Mac
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.760]   is only $59 a year.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.240]   You've got a terabyte of stuff, $59 a year.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.320]   That's $0.16 a day.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.320]   Try it for free, though.
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.680]   You don't have to pay anything right now.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.000]   You don't have to use a credit card.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.960]   Go to carbonite.com and use the offer code.
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.040]   It's up on the screen, actually.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.720]   Twig, T-W-I-G.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.760]   And you'll get two months free with that offer code
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.520]   if you decide to buy the service.
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.200]   So try it for free.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.760]   Use the offer code twig to get in.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.040]   Then when you buy it, use that offer code
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.880]   to get two months for free.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.200]   And be sure to sign up for the free trial from the homepage
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.800]   if you want to get those two months free.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.480]   That's carbonite.com offer code twig.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:09.280]   We thank them for their support of This Week in Google.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:14.920]   Tony Wang is telling me that Hong-Kee means red flag in Chinese.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.920]   We still share your pronounce on that?
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.920]   No, I definitely don't know if I'm pronounce.
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.920]   I was hoping that he was telling me
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:23.920]   how to pronounce it properly.
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.920]   But the name of the driverless car system
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.920]   in China is called red flag, which, again,
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.920]   no cause for concern, anybody.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:32.920]   That's an international standard.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.920]   The red flag means.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.920]   All right.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.920]   Facebook Facial Recognition Software
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.920]   violates privacy laws in Germany.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.920]   The Facebook is now threatened with legal action
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:48.920]   over the recognition software that goes in and suggests,
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.920]   when you tag a photo,
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.920]   hey, you might want to put a tag for Tom Krasit
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.920]   because this looks to be a picture of Tom Krasit.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.920]   Germany says not allowing people to opt into that
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:00.920]   may violate the law and it's up for review.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.920]   Not having Jeff here for a story about Germany
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.920]   and facial recognition is unfair.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.920]   I just feel like I have to channel Jeff here.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.920]   Should I just turn red up my head
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.920]   explode and I talk about how this is total hogwash?
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:14.920]   I think that's all.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:15.920]   I put personal news stream Gutenberg.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:16.920]   Gutenberg.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:17.920]   What's another one that?
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.920]   Habermas.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.920]   They're going to Habermas.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.920]   This is the first time.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:30.920]   Germany is no fan of Google or Facebook's privacy policies
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.920]   that let it be said.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.920]   But, you know, it is...
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.920]   I think that certain people, if I talk to my friends
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.920]   and relatives, they would...
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:39.920]   And they had never seen it before.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.920]   They would think it violates privacy laws.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.920]   Just that folks who have been using Facebook for a while
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.920]   I feel are kind of a nerd to it by now.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.920]   The whole, you know, like, well, they know everything
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.920]   about what I'm doing with my camera.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.920]   Is it really violating privacy laws though?
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:52.920]   I mean, that's the question.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:56.920]   What it's doing is what so much software out there
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:57.920]   can do already.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.920]   There was a demonstration, I think, at DEF CON
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:05.920]   about how easy it is to determine all of this private
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.920]   information based on facial recognition software
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:09.920]   that's off the shelf.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.920]   I think Google just bought PitPat.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:15.920]   And you can use that to find out, you know,
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.920]   to recognize the face from a Facebook photo
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:23.920]   and then find out, in one case, they were able to guess
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.920]   like the first five digits of the Social Security number.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.920]   That's based on location and stuff like that.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:32.920]   But telling Facebook that you're violating privacy
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.920]   because you suggest to someone this person might be
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:38.920]   in this picture and allowing that person to decide
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.920]   whether to tag it or not, that doesn't seem to be
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:41.920]   the worst violation to me.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.920]   You can operate images of people into Google now
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.920]   and it will return Google results for images that look
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:48.920]   like that person.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   Is that a privacy violation?
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   I don't know.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:52.920]   But I mean, it seems a little more, you know,
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.920]   if I can just take a picture of somebody on the street
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.920]   and upload that to Google and then find out who they are,
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.920]   like, that's kind of weird.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.920]   I mean, I don't know if it's--
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:02.920]   - Is that a lot?
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:07.920]   - The image search project they, like, two or three months ago,
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:10.920]   you can go to image search right now, you can upload a picture.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:11.920]   - No kidding.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.920]   - And it will return results of pictures that it believes
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:15.920]   are similar to that picture.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.920]   - That's not image swirl, that's something else.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.920]   - I don't think so, no.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.920]   So you can-- I tried it with a picture of myself
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:23.920]   just to see what would happen.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.920]   And, I mean, not that I'm like famous or anything,
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:28.920]   but it did return, you know, a fair amount of results.
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:32.920]   - So there's a little camera on the side,
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:36.920]   and then it allows you to either paste in an image URL
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.920]   or upload an image.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:41.920]   So let's see, I'll-- I'm gonna try it out.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.920]   Be careful there, I'm gonna-- yeah.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.920]   - So now my understanding was that this returns web pages
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.920]   which contain that same image, but doesn't necessarily
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.920]   do facial recognition, which is a little different.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.920]   - Well, pixels are pixels though, right?
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:54.920]   I mean--
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.920]   - I mean, I think that it's-- so, like, I just tried it with--
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.920]   with my own headshot, and it showed me a series of other people
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.920]   who are Caucasian with dark hair, including Ashton Kutcher.
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:05.920]   - Yay.
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.920]   - Because clearly Ashton and I look similar, but--
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:08.920]   let's try it.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:09.920]   - All right.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.920]   - So I'm thinking-- because I thought that they made a big deal
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.920]   about the fact that they had the capability of doing facial
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.920]   recognition, but they weren't because they felt like it was too--
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:18.920]   - Oh, well, I picked a cartoon.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.920]   I need to-- I picked a cartoon version of myself.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:24.920]   That's not a-- that's not a--
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.920]   - That doesn't matter that your privacy.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.920]   - That's not a fair test.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.920]   - First world problems.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.920]   - Yeah, right.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.920]   All right, so I'm going to go into pictures.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:37.920]   I'm going to find-- I really need to organize my pictures.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.920]   - It's worth noting that in Germany with a street view
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.920]   debacle they had a while ago, what would end up happening
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.920]   is that folks in Blurmani, as it's now called,
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.920]   can-- you know, I had an option-- at the end of all the legal
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.920]   wrangling, they have an option to blur their house on street
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.920]   view, they had a way to get out of what some folks considered
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:59.920]   their invasive picture taking, but you know, I guess maybe if I'm
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:03.920]   guessing correctly, Germany's laws would want Facebook
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.920]   to give everybody that option.
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.920]   And so if your friends with someone on Facebook and Facebook
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:10.920]   automatically tags them in your photos, you're not giving them
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.920]   that same kind of ability to blur themselves, hide themselves.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:17.920]   - All right, so I uploaded my old CNET photo.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.920]   It's a beardless photo of me from way back in the day.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:22.920]   Here's what I got.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:23.920]   - I don't think any of those people are you.
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.920]   - Oh, you don't have my screen anymore?
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.920]   - I never know.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.920]   - Oh, you never had my screen. All right.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:29.920]   Too bad.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:30.920]   - I saw it.
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.920]   - Well, I don't think any of these people look like Tom.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.920]   - Tom, Tom, I can verify.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:35.920]   - Tom, Tom, I can verify none of these people.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.920]   - That one lady, I don't know, but I mean, yeah.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.920]   (laughing)
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.920]   - So does it-- I mean, did they say this is Tom Merritt,
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.920]   or did it just say this hedgehog?
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.920]   - No, it just says visually similar images, and it shows
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:47.920]   mostly white people.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.920]   - Well, does it link to the page where those images are?
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.920]   - Yeah, they're clear.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   That's the visually similar thing.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.920]   (laughing)
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.920]   So this guy, this big smile.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.920]   Yeah, this guy.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.920]   - So I guess it doesn't violate your privacy if it doesn't work.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:03.920]   - Right.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.920]   - So that's true.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:05.920]   (laughing)
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.920]   - And then, yeah, if you click on any of these, then it does go.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.920]   It does take you to the normal image search.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.920]   - So you could match-- - Yeah.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.920]   - You know, you could-- if it worked, and it found
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.920]   another picture of you somewhere, it could match it to that site,
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.920]   and then you find out the name, and off you go.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.920]   - Let's pour it, lady.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:22.920]   Let's take your answer.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.920]   (laughing)
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.920]   Speaking of-- Germany's gonna be after us pretty soon.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.920]   (laughing)
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.920]   - All right.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:35.920]   If you're mad about this, along with Germany, you can join the
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.920]   anonymous protest, November 5th, Guy Fox Day.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:43.920]   Anonymous says they want to take it to the streets against
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.920]   Facebook, not a DDoS attack.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.920]   They're asking people to go out into the streets anonymously.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.920]   I guess you wear your Guy Fox mask.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.920]   (dramatic music)
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:55:05.920]   This is the typical anonymous video.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.920]   - The citizens of the world, we are anonymous.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.920]   We wish to get your attention, hoping you heed the warnings
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.920]   as follows, your medium of communication.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:17.920]   You also dearly adore Will be destroyed.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:21.920]   If you are a willing activist or a guy who just wants to
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.920]   protect the freedom of information, then join the cause
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:28.920]   and kill Facebook for the sake of your own privacy.
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:32.920]   Facebook has been selling information to government agencies
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:37.920]   and giving clandestine access to information security firms
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.920]   so that-- - So this is the typical plea.
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.920]   - The only one on the world.
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.920]   - But they're asking everyone to go out on the streets
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.920]   on November 5th.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.920]   Where are you gonna be, Guy Fox Day, Gina?
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:52.920]   - I mean, go out on the streets and like not be on Facebook.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.920]   I don't-- (laughing)
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:56.920]   - You can't post anything to Facebook that day
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.920]   while you're on the street. - What does this mean?
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.920]   - Point to your local Facebook constable area
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:01.920]   and shake your fist angrily.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.920]   (laughing)
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:05.920]   - Hmm.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.920]   You know, I think I'd rather just not,
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.920]   out to not use Facebook in general every day.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:14.920]   - Now, Neil Prodolinsky at ZEDI Net says that anonymous members
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:16.920]   may be looking to kill Facebook,
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.920]   but the larger activist group does not appear to support their cause.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.920]   So this may be, there's a page that says anonymous does not
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.920]   support killing Facebook on November 5th.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:27.920]   So this may be a spin-off.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:28.920]   - Division's in the ranks of anonymous--
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:30.920]   - Well, that's kind of the way anonymous works.
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:31.920]   They don't have ranks.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:32.920]   - Yeah.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:33.920]   - They have everything.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.920]   It's all about chaos.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.920]   They wouldn't be true to themselves if they didn't have divisions.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.920]   That's just the way I think that's the idea.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.920]   - Yeah.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:43.920]   - You can go in whatever direction you want.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:47.920]   Amazon, and get a lot of publicity for something
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.920]   that's actually been around for a while.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:53.920]   An Amazon Kindle social network similar to Goodreads
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.920]   that lifts info from Facebook and Twitter
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.920]   and shares information about what you're reading.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.920]   If you wish, I went over and looked at it.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.920]   And all it has are the books that I have on my wish list
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:09.920]   at Amazon included in my to read list, but nothing else.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.920]   Even though I buy Kindle books, it hasn't pulled anything in.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:14.920]   I'd have to change the setting.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:19.920]   I'm just curious why this suddenly got a ton of attention.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.920]   - Yeah, I just got an email this week from someone who was following me
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:23.920]   on Amazon Kindle.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.920]   I was confused and deleted it, but apparently this was it.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.920]   And I haven't had a chance to look at it yet.
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.920]   Goodreads, just because the life hacker book just kind of came out,
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.920]   so I've been watching alerts for it.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.920]   And Goodreads is quite popular.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.920]   It's not something that I use myself, but it gets tons of reviews
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:39.920]   and comments.
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:42.920]   And Amazon, this makes sense for Amazon.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:46.920]   I really like the fact that you're the stuff that you highlight
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.920]   in Kindle books you can share on the web, and you can keep on the web.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:50.920]   That's really cool.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.920]   - I know some people don't like it, but I like the fact that when you highlight something
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:57.920]   that goes into a database, and then I can choose to have that on
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:59.920]   what I'm reading and see what other people have highlighted.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:00.920]   - Absolutely.
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.920]   Yeah, that was actually kind of a cool experience.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.920]   The first time I was reading a book and it highlights a certain part of the book
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.920]   and says, "This was a really popular highlight."
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:11.920]   It surprised me, because I'm not used to people being in the room with me
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:12.920]   while I'm reading a book.
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:13.920]   It's a very private thing.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.920]   But then once I get used to it, I was like, "Oh, this is cool."
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:18.920]   Kind of crowdsourcing the most interesting quotes from the book.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:20.920]   And I use highlights extensively.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:21.920]   I have a terrible memory.
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:24.920]   I really like being able to look back and say, "Oh, yeah, that book."
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:25.920]   And remember what happened.
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:31.920]   So what is the cause for the recent left in this?
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:33.920]   I mean, did they do some sort of big launch announcements?
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:40.920]   - No, I think some blogger picked it up and pitched it as, "This is a secret social network."
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:42.920]   But Amazon is hiding.
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:47.920]   - They also just recently launched the HTML5 based, what they call the cloud reader.
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:48.920]   - That's right.
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:52.920]   They know about cloud, which basically you can run on any browser.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:58.920]   I've seen people with really obscure phones saying that it works on their devices and tablets and phones.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:05.920]   - Yeah, we're trying Android phones and iPad, but not Android tablets or iPhones.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:09.920]   - So now you can literally get to your Kindle account from almost anywhere.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:13.920]   And so maybe it's just getting a push because of that, because now it's out more in the open.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:19.920]   - All right, let's finish up with a little bit about what's going on in London.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.920]   This story is much bigger than a tech story, of course.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:25.920]   riots have been going on there for days.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:31.920]   We've had folks from London, from Birmingham on the network talking about, you know,
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:37.920]   that they're either blocks away or they got out of downtown from their job just ahead of riots going on.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:43.920]   The big stories around this have been Blackberry, Rym saying, "We will cooperate with the police."
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:44.920]   Pretty much that's all they said.
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:48.920]   And then of course immediately their page got hacked because everyone assumed they were going to turn over
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:52.920]   all the Blackberry messenger text, which they can't if they're telling the truth.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.920]   Everything is encrypted.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:57.920]   And police using Flickr to identify London riots suspects.
[00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:05.920]   So they're taking camera pictures, posting them up on Flickr and asking people to help identify folks for prosecution.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:12.920]   - I mean, if it really was a scary, you know, big brother world, I mean, everyone who has a smartphone,
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:15.920]   you know, and has GPS on it, they could have been tracking everyone that way.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.920]   They could say you were in this area on this night where we know writing was happening.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:24.920]   I mean, we're not there yet, thankfully, but you could learn a whole lot from someone in this situation with their smartphone.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.920]   - Well, should they just upload these pictures to Google image search?
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.920]   - Well, it doesn't work. - Yes, seriously.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.920]   - Except it doesn't work.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920]   - Except it doesn't work.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.920]   - And then great- - In the great- - In the great- - Here ladies go get arrested because they look like, you know,
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.920]   in all seriousness, this is the other, this is the flip side of the coin, right?
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:42.920]   In Germany, they're like, "Oh, a possible facial recognition thing that might tell you if someone's tagged in a photo.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.920]   That's not allowed."
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.920]   But the Metropolitan Police, they can't recognize people from- so they're going in crowdsourcing it.
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.920]   Is that a privacy violation?
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:55.920]   - Are they asking people to post their cam phone pictures to Flickr or they're just going in a Flickr and-
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.920]   - No, it looks like they're taking pictures from the police surveillance cameras- - Okay.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.920]   - And putting them up on Flickr.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.920]   - So they're crowdsourcing. I see, interesting, and asking people to identify.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.920]   I don't understand why don't they just upload to Facebook?
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.920]   Facebook will do the suggestion.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.920]   - And then just tag it for them, I know.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.920]   Come on, Matt.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.920]   - They did that in Vancouver, right, too, after the Stanley Cup finals?
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.920]   - That's right.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:16.920]   I forgot about that.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.920]   - I forget the service. I think it was Flickr.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.920]   - Yeah, those were cam pictures a lot of times, though.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:26.920]   I think they were just asking for identification of people who in a picture were obviously, you know,
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.920]   like holding up television.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:29.920]   - Committing a crime.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:30.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.920]   - In this picture.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.920]   - We're looking for a white male 5'6.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.920]   Can't believe how hard it is to find parking and Tottenham.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.920]   - Wearing a Canucks jersey.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.920]   - Oh, wait, no, you're talking about London.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:41.920]   (laughing)
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.920]   - All right, well, before we get out of here, let's get our tool tip.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   - And, well, I don't know if we have a number.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.920]   Kevin, do you have a number?
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:49.920]   You have a number?
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.920]   Okay, you've got us covered.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.920]   Gina, we'll start with your tip.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:52.920]   What do you got for us?
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:53.920]   - Sure.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.920]   Gmail Labs, which, like I said, separate from Google Labs,
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.920]   Gmail Labs is still alive and well in your Gmail settings.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.920]   It's got a new feature called Preview Pain.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.920]   If you go into Gmail settings and Gmail Labs and enable Preview Pain,
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.920]   when you come back to your inbox, you get the opportunity to get
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.920]   a three-pained view on your Gmail.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.920]   So you get, you see, you can view your inbox and list of labels,
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.920]   the list of messages, and then Preview a message.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:18.920]   So, I'm mixing it.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.920]   My first reaction was, oh, this looks a lot like Outlook,
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.920]   repain view, and you can do vertical or horizontal.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.920]   And, you know, I looked at that a couple days.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.920]   It wasn't, it's not exactly my cup of tea, but it's great for really
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.920]   wide, wide, wide screens and tablets.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:38.920]   And the only thing is, apparently it messes up multiple inboxes.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:42.920]   So, if you like multiple inboxes, those two don't play well together.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:43.920]   - Good to know.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.920]   - But with it enabled, there's a button on the top right hand side
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.920]   that says, "No split, vertical split, or horizontal split."
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.920]   So you can turn it off really easily.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.920]   You don't have to go digging through your settings every time.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.920]   So, Preview Pain for Gmail.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.920]   - Excellent.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:57.920]   I like that.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.920]   In fact, I might enable that to be awesome.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.920]   - It's very Outlook-y too for people who miss the Outlook feel in Gmail.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.920]   It feels like that kind of.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.920]   - I might get sentimental and put that on for the Outlook,
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:13.920]   and then enable the Google Labs thing that allows you to have the beta symbol back in Gmail.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.920]   (laughter)
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.920]   I'll just, I'll be like super nostalgic.
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.920]   - You live in the labs world.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:20.920]   - All right.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:22.920]   Kevin Purdy with the Jarvis number.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:23.920]   What do you have for?
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:24.920]   - The Jarvis number.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:31.920]   It is 20, and that is the percentage of respondents in a survey of about 500 people
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.920]   by Oglevy and Mother, M-A-T-H-E-R.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:35.920]   How sure how to say that?
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:36.920]   - The Oglevy matter.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.920]   - I actually know this one.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.920]   It's Mather.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.920]   - Oglevy and Mother.
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.920]   - I can't pronounce hon-ki, but I can pronounce that.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:46.920]   - They ask 500 people online, "Who do you trust with mobile payments?"
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:51.920]   And of those respondents, they gave them 11 providers they could choose from.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:55.920]   About 20% said they would trust Google with their online payments.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.920]   So basically relating to their Google Wallet initiative.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:03:59.920]   And that's not a really high number.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:05.920]   But then when you look at the other numbers, you realize, "Well, maybe the problem is that nobody trusts anybody with their purchasing things."
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:10.920]   Visa actually topped the list at 40%, pretty low for a company that is the biggest credit card.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:18.920]   Facebook to the bottom with 12%, and Apple was about 23%, so just a little bit over Google,
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:22.920]   and just above Apple was the US Postal Service.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:28.920]   So all that from CDNets, Google and Google Blog, and it shows that maybe Google Wallet
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:34.920]   would not be all that well received, but then again, Facebook Wallet would be much worse.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:41.920]   - And Apple, which already does process payments, running about the same as the Google right now.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.920]   - Right, and just under the US Postal Service.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.920]   - Well, is that US Postal Service with my cash or with my checks?
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:49.920]   - Yes.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.920]   Do you trust the full service if you, you know, rubber band cash and send it to the man?
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:54.920]   - Most people probably.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.920]   - And put it in a see-through envelope.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.920]   - Do they have PayPal on this one?
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.920]   - I'm not sure.
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:00.920]   - Yeah, I didn't see PayPal.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.920]   - Yes, you can head over to the Google and Google Blog and check out the whole thing
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.920]   with a link to the full survey.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:13.920]   - All right, I've got a tool, which I'm always worried that I'm doing something that has been done before,
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.920]   but in this case, I actually don't really care because I think it's an important one.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:26.920]   Recently, there was a story about how some ISPs are actually redirecting your search terms
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:30.920]   to individual pages based on affiliates, right?
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.920]   So they take, like, for instance, Amazon has an affiliate program.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:37.920]   Anybody can sign up for it, unless you're in one of those states that has a tax dispute.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.920]   And then Amazon doesn't know where you're using those links.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:44.920]   So these ISPs are doing things where if someone types in a search term on a search engine,
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:48.920]   they'll redirect it to an Amazon affiliate link and try to collect money from that.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:53.920]   There is a way to stop that, and it's to make sure that you're connecting to your search engines securely.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:57.920]   Now, Google, by the way, has already complained to these ISPs and said, "Stop that.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.920]   You don't get to do that," and the ISPs have stopped with Google, but it still works for Bing and Yahoo.
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:06.920]   So install HTTPS Everywhere, which you can get at the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:10.920]   eff.org/HTTPS- Everywhere.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:18.920]   It is a Firefox plugin, but it is made in collaboration with the Pator Project and the EFF,
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:23.920]   and it works for Google, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook, Bitly, GMX, WordPress,
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:31.920]   New York Times, PayPal, several others, and forces a secure connection every time you are connected to these sites.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:36.920]   So it's just good practice to be securely connected, and I'd like to throw that out.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.920]   Is that one that's been done before, do you know, Gina?
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.920]   I don't think we've done that one in particular.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:46.920]   We've definitely talked about using HTTPS in general when you can, and when it's an option, turn it on.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:52.920]   If the one millisecond of latency you might get with it, it's an HTTP/S Everywhere.
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:58.920]   And the HTTPS Everywhere is a nice, in case you forget, or you just don't want to have to type in,
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:00.920]   it'll force it to happen.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.920]   So it's just a good fail-safe there.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.920]   Hope that helps, honey.
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.920]   You're welcome to throw in a tip number or tool, Tom, but you don't have to.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:09.920]   You're not obligated.
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:12.920]   I did not come prepared with the tip or number.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:13.920]   That's fine.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:18.920]   You can use that time to pay content, though.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:19.920]   Well, sure.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.920]   You know, thanks for having me on, Tom.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.920]   It's great to have you.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.920]   You can find more of our stuff.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.920]   We've been covering this mobile patents issue that we started off talking about this morning,
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.920]   very in-depth, and we will continue to do so.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:35.920]   And, you know, both myself as the mobile editor and Joe Mullen, who is our legal reporter,
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.920]   who's been very in-depth on this.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.920]   So you can check us out at paidcontent.org.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.920]   And I also, you can also find my stuff on mokonews.net.
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:43.920]   All right.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.920]   Y'all, you're still doing mokonews, then.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.920]   I'm still doing it.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.920]   Excellent.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:47.920]   Good to have you, man.
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:48.920]   Good to see you again.
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.920]   It's good to see you again.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.920]   Definitely.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:51.920]   Yeah, it has been.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.920]   Kevin, pretty great to have you on the show as well.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.920]   And let folks not only know about Complete Android, but the other book you were talking
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:57.920]   about as well.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.920]   Sure.
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.920]   Well, so that's coming, you know, in the near future.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:05.920]   From O'Reilly, a book on Google+, this part of their Missing Manual series.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.920]   Fiverrantly working feverishly fervently.
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:08.920]   Working on it right now.
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.920]   Well, not right now, but, you know, as soon as I close this Skype window.
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:17.920]   And in the meantime, though, Complete Android Guide, at completeandroidguide.com, we've just
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:23.920]   released a Android app, which is basically our book and reformatted for the Android interface,
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.920]   so that when you have a question about your Android phone, you can actually just pull up
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.920]   the app and look up the answer to it right there.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.920]   So that's in the Android market.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:35.920]   It's a little hard to find, mostly because the word "Android" is a very crowded market search.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.920]   Yeah, it makes sense.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.920]   If you search the word "complete Android," all one word, it pulls up first.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:47.920]   And I also created a link at bit.ly/completeandroid should take you right to our app in the market.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:48.920]   Bit.ly/android.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.920]   That's probably the best way.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.920]   Just bit.ly/completeandroid.
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:53.920]   Complete Android, okay.
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.920]   Yes, and it's 99 cents.
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:02.920]   It's my whole book that I spend months writing, so feel free to, you know, grab it, recommend it to folks,
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.920]   you know, who just got their phone and don't know what to do with it quite yet.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.920]   We've got some great chapters in there about setting up your phone, setting up your email,
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:10.920]   stuff like that.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:17.920]   So that's in the market and completeandroidguide.com and Google Plus Book coming very soon.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.920]   And Gina Trapani, always good to be on with you, smarterware.org.
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.920]   I've got my think up account up on my screen if you want to take that.
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.920]   Oh, I lean.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.920]   This gives you a little look at what's going on.
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.920]   This is the kind of stats you get.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:33.920]   Awesome.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.920]   We just released beta 14 yesterday, like fresh off the packaging script.
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:39.920]   Excellent.
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.920]   Fresh out the build script.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.920]   So check it out.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:43.920]   Thinkupapp.com.
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.920]   Beta 14 is our last beta.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.920]   We're going to go into version 1.0 land soon in the next month or so.
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:50.920]   But thanks for having me, Tom.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.920]   This is a really fun show of both Tom's.
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:58.920]   Actually, Tom Kay, thank you for explaining patents to people who are confused by them, like me.
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.920]   And I can't always wait to see you.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.920]   All right.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.920]   Tom starts off with a reference to the Wire, everybody.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.920]   So it's a really great intro to the world of patent lawsuits and fights.
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:07.920]   Google's coming.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.920]   And you got no honey nut.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.920]   I got the whole Wire line.
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.920]   I don't know.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:14.920]   All right.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:15.920]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:21.920]   Leo Laport will be back on Twig in two weeks after his jury duties are finished.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.920]   And next week, I, as actor, will be hosting Twig and Jeff Jarvis will be back.
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:28.920]   So thanks, everybody, for watching.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:29.920]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:39.920]   [MUSIC]
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:46.920]   Great.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.920]   [LAUGH]
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:50.920]   Sorry.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.920]   I just have to do that every once in a while.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:53.920]   Yeah, it's good.
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:54.920]   It's a release.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.000]   (laughs)
