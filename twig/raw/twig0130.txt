[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   And it's going to be a good show, I can tell you.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Let's start by saying hello to our panelist, Gina Trappani.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   I'm smarterware.org, back from the White House.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Yes, I am. Hi, how are you?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Great, you got to tell us all about it, okay?
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Yes, I will.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Also here, Jeff Jarvis, journalism professor from the
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   City University of New York and the author of
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   "Public Parts," his newest book.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Good to see you, Jeff.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And in my hair, I'm always appearing in black and white.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   You know, you look good in black and white, actually.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Also, Matt Cutz is here from Google, one of Google's
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   newest employees.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   He works in the spam fighting division at Google and a good
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   person to have on today.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Hello, Matt.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Hey, good to be here.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   You guys, turn off the logo to turn off your lightsmith.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   It's a dark day today.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   That's fine.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Those of you who are just tuning in or downloading the video
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   might be slapping your computer or your television set.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   No, there's nothing wrong with your set.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   We are in black and white today because we're recording
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   this on January 18th, which is the day the internet fought back.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And with some success, I might add, we just learned we just
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   talked to an activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   that today alone, 29 members of Congress, have reversed their
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   position on the internet.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I'm Kevin Purdy, and I thank you for joining us.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I wasn't quite the engineer.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I just rolled with it.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I like the black and white, actually.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I think that looks kind of good.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I'm glad you got it.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Classy.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   So if you go to google.com, there's a nice big--
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   it looks like a piece of duct tape over the logo and a link.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Tell Congress, please don't censor the web.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   And look at this.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Nearly 4 million people today signing that petition.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Let me just do that right now so that I can make it 4 million
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   and 1, and I encourage everybody while you're watching the
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   show to do that.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   What cuts?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Why doesn't Google want to stop piracy?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Are you pro-piracy, Matt Cuts?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Of course not.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   No, we hate piracy, and we actually spend, you know, like 60
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   million dollars a year trying to get bad ads and other things
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   out of our system.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So nobody wants piracy, but it's pretty crazy when you're trying
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   to solve a business model problem with a technological
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   solution that just won't even work.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And I think that's one of the big things, is people don't
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   realize that pirates will just quickly get around this.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And in the meantime, it will absolutely, of course, her
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   jobs, but basically put a chilling effect on the Internet,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   where a lot of people, a lot of sites that rely on user-generated
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   content will be incredibly affected by it.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   My wife, I sent her an email and I was like, "Hey, would
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   you mind calling a senator?" and she's like, "Oh, yeah, yeah,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I should."
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And then she went to craft zine, which is an O'Reilly site,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   and it was shut down for the day.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And she's like, "Oh, no, that's right.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Regular sites are going to be affected."
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And that was what the tipping point for her to call her
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   senator.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Yeah, I care a lot about this.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Our news program, Tech News Today, we get pulled down from
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   YouTube all the time.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Our news program, Tech News Today, ran that mega download,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   or mega download.com video.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Even though that video itself was not an infringing video,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   but the Universal Music Group decided it was, Universal
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Music Group also asked Tech News Today to be pulled down.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   We appealed it, they pulled it down again, we appealed it again.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And finally, it was put back up on YouTube.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   It's funny, Matt, because you do work for the company that
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   owns YouTube, and YouTube is, in many cases, been hand in glove
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   with the music and the recording and the motion
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   picture industry.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Well, what's interesting to me is I went to DC last year and
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   did a Q&A, and it was just for staffers.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And most places, if you, you know, say, ask me anything about
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Google, they'll say, "How does Google work?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   How do I rank higher?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   How do I get my word out to constituents?"
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And I was pretty shocked at how many questions were about
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   YouTube and DMCA and copyright--
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Oh, isn't that interesting?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Wow.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And what I realized is a lot of people have this conception that
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   YouTube is still this, you know, like it was in the very early
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   days where you could find all these shows.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   And Google has done a very good job of trying to make sure that,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   you know, if you're the copyright owner, you can make sure
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   the copies are down or you can, you know, monetize it, you've
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   got a lot of different options.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   So we've heard hard, but at the same time, you're absolutely
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   right.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Like with TNT, it's totally the case that you sometimes see overly
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   broad takedowns.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   You can see mistaken takedowns.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   You can see takedowns that end up almost looking capricious because
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   it turns out the person didn't have the copyright.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   We've seen all kinds of fake DMCA requests where people are just
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   trying to hurt either competitors or trying to basically do some
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   prank or something like that.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   So the notion that this process won't be abused when we already
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   see it abused under DMCA is just crazy.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I guess that's the point of that.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   One of the points of that video that we just aired in, we didn't
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   air it on the, but I'll tell you what, I'll play it at the end of
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Twig so you can see it, but it explains why soap is bad.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And one of the things, the video points out is, well, there's a
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   lot of things that video points out, but one of the things that
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   video points out is that there are bill, there are laws like DMCA
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   and pro IP that already in place, there are anti-counterfeiting laws
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   that can, that are more than adequate and have problems already.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   We don't need to go a step farther.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Tim O'Reilly, we're trying to get Tim on, he's in a plane.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And when he makes his connection, we're trying to get him on
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   by phone, but he's been really great on Google+, a lot of posts on
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Google+, but one of the posts he put up a couple of days ago that I
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   thought was great.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Before solving a problem, make sure you've got the right problem.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   He talks about, unfortunately, the people who framed this debate
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   often frame it around, is it about piracy?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   But in fact, he says, really, that's a misframed argument.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   The losses due to piracy far are far outweighed by the benefits
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   of the internet, by the free flow of information.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   History shows us again and again, frontiers are lawless places,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   but as they get richer and more settled, they join in the rule of
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   law, American publishing, listen carefully, American publishing,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   now the largest publishing industry in the world began with piracy,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   began by stealing others' works.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   We've got to reframe this conversation.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Piracy isn't the problem.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And even if you thought it was, these bills won't make a difference,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   because pirates just go ahead and go around anything like this.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Just earlier this month where digital sales are now higher
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   than physical sales of music.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And early on, you definitely saw a sort of antagonism towards
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   digital sales by a lot of people in the content industry.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   And just as they hated VCRs, cassettes, MP3 players,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   freaking piano player roles.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   At the turn of the last century, they tried to stop.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Player pianos are going to put the music industry out of business.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Leo, I think one of the things that Tim makes so,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   that he of all people can make this argument because he is a publisher,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   he sees the benefits, is that there's no, we haven't proven the harm here.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   How many of those, it's proving a negative.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   How many of those people who did pirate the work would have bought it,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   having not pirated it?
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Probably very few.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   How many people instead, however, did discover the work because it was pirated?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Could be very high.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   And Palacuelo, the author, I wrote about this in the last book,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   he has sold more than 100 million books, yet he pirates his own works.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Right.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Because he discovered that when he put up, when people did pirate his works
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   in other languages like Russian before the book was out,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   his sales in those countries went up and he pirated his own works
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   and his publisher caught him, Jane Friedman caught him,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   because he said, "Oh no, somebody pirate you."
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   And it turned out it was the, you know, the introduction.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   They put it up on pirate bay, Palacuelo did it himself.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Yeah, and it was the wrong version, but he said, "Okay, you caught me,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   but let's look at the business opportunities here."
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And you know, he, Palo yelled at me, I was giving away books at an event,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   and he said, "Don't give away books, sell books."
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   You know, so he's very much a salesman, very much believes in it,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   but he sees the benefit of things being spread in this way.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And I think it's the lack of harm too, and I'm going to start the drinking game
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   early, but you go back to Tito's point about early publishing and Gutenberg.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   You know, this notion of owning intellectual property is fairly recent in history.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   And I think that what's happening too is we're going through a phase in society
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   where we're going back to the idea that, I just wrote about David Weinberger's
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   magnificent new book, "Too Big to Know," and knowledge becomes the network.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   It doesn't become the property of individuals in it.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And that's our old model, and that's the way we used to do this.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And I think that this is really about trying to rethink the shape of our world,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   and that's why the institutions are having such trouble with this.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   That's why the Rupert Murdochs are belching everywhere.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Look at this tweet from MC Hammer.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   He says, "Stop SOPA," and there is Hammer with two guys from Firefox
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   standing in front of the Capitol building.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I love it.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   He says, "Need we say more."
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   So even artists, I think not all artists, but many artists understand that the Internet
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   has given them far more opportunities than it has taken away from them.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   And you say an interesting thing, Jeff, and Tim O'Reilly says this as well.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   We often conflate, the way the argument's misshapen is we conflate
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   intellectual property with real property.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And we think that, you know, steal my phone, that's real property,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   but steal my idea is not real property and is not protected
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   in the Constitution or by...
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   The founders never intended to protect intellectual property.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   In fact, they said very clearly that the copyright laws and the patent laws
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   were designed to protect the inventor for a limited time, a very limited time,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   just 14 years, and that ultimately that intellectual property was the property of society
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   and belonged to society to promote the arts and sciences.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And so this whole idea that somehow something is like,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   that it's real property that's being stolen, even that is fallacious and is...
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Especially in a digital era.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Especially in digital era.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   That look because it's not a consumable anymore,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   but also because the models change.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   And I go through this all the time, but in media,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   we've been brought up to think that all the value is encased in the product.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   That's why we sell it.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   And I've said this, I think on the show before,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   but Mark Zuckerberg realizes differently.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Content has value, but its value is to get people to generate signals about themselves.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Why do you think Google invented Google+,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   because why is it in Android?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Because we're using these things to generate signals about ourselves
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   that allow those services to give us more targeted and relevant content services
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   and advertising and extract more value from their relationships with us.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   So content does have value, but it's only one value in a chain
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   and the way media was structured for the 550 years of Gutenberg's era
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   was that content media were encased as a product and could be sold that way.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   That's just over.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   So what we're seeing is more than just old companies trying to protect their copy rights.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   We're seeing right here two important things happening.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   One is the other shift of a business model around media,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   but second, and I'm very, very happy about this,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   I'm very proud of our internet,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   we're seeing the beginnings of, I think for the first time,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   the creation of a public called the net.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   And I think that's very, very exciting,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   that this is the first political movement that I believe has started out of the net
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   for the net's concerns, and it's up to this point working.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   It hasn't won, but it's impressive in what the people of the net can do.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   So let's remember this, folks, and let's keep fighting for other principles.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Yeah, that's, I was going to say that.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   I mean, what's going on today is just absolutely historical.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   What I was going to say earlier though,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   I mean, I think that we need to be realistic though,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   and accept that we're never going to convince the MPAA and the RA,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   that privacy is not a problem.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   So while I agree with you guys, I just think that, you know,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   they're spending a lot of money convincing the powers,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   that be that piracy is a problem,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   and this is why we need legislation this way.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   So what we need to do with the tech community is educate the government
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   about how the internet works with as much effort and time and human hours
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   as they're spending, educating them about how much piracy is a problem.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   You know, I was at the White House last Monday,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   which is the reason why I missed the show.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   I was invited there for a meeting about an event that's happening in the spring,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   which I'll talk about then, but after the meeting,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   I had a few moments to speak with Anise Chopra,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   who's the CTO of the United States.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   And we were talking about, you know, how does government reach out
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   to its constituents and engage with citizens online,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   and Anise said, "What's the issue of the moment?"
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   And I said, "Absolutely so."
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And I used, you know, I very strongly advised him
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   to, that the administration has to put a statement out there.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   And they did three days later. Thank you, Jim.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   And he gave, what I was very proud of, Gina,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   he gave the hat tip to you and Twitter, which was really so cool.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   He did. Well, I told him that I would boost his follower count
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   by mentioning him on Twitter, which I did, and then said,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   "Oh, hey, it's all the hours. You're welcome."
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   And he said, "Okay."
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And then he went on the White House and responded.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Gina, say that again, because we broke up a little bit.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   We lost her. Oh, sorry about that.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   I had mentioned on him on Twitter saying that, you know,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   tech community should follow him.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Good.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   And I think kind of in return, he gave me that hat tip
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   for the White House's response.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   But the White House was working on that response
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   when I was out the White House.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   So I certainly don't take credit for that.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   What's his Twitter handle? I want to follow him.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Anise Chopra. Anise Chopra is his name
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   and his Twitter handle is just his name.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   An-I-S-H.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   An-E-G-S-H.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   C-H-O-P-R-A.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   All right, I'll follow him right there.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   There we go.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Chief Technology Officer.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   So follow...
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   There you go. See? See?
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   But I do think this makes an important point.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And ReadWrite, Scott Fulton, writing a ReadWrite web
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   also makes this point.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   All right.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   So we've shown we can be negative Nellies and say, "Don't pass it."
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   But then the challenge is, "Okay, come up with a solution."
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   But what's the problem, though, Lee?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Well, I agree with you.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   And that's his...
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   And you go back to Twitter about a month ago,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Nille Pratel and I had a big debate over this.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   And Nille, who was a lawyer by training, said,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   "You can't just say no.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   You have to offer a compromise position."
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   My position was, digital technologies,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   there is no technology that effectively prevents piracy.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   The solution is to reinvent your business model,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   not to break the internet and computers.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   And I do believe that the people who control content today,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   wish computers and the internet would just go away.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   The reason we chose to go black and white today instead of black and tirelies,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   I wanted to harken back to the '50s, where there was no internet.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   There was no computer.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And of course, at that time, people, those guys hated other things.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   There were other technologies they hated.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   But they would love computers and the internet to go away
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   and failing that, they know that's not going to happen.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Let's modify them in such a way that we don't have to fear them.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Instead of reinventing their business model,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   there's plenty of money to be made.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   But the problem that they perceive it is that there's piracy going on on foreign websites
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   and the United States needs a way to address that.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Well, is there a way, though?
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   I don't know. I don't have a better way.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   I mean, this bill, this is an attempt to,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   to give the United States a way to address,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   there's a foreign website, non-US website,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   offering copyrighted material, which is illegal,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   and how do we address that?
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   This is not the solution.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   But what is the solution?
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   I mean, when I brought this up with Denise, she said to me,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   do you know why this bill even started?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   It's because we need a way to address criminal activity on foreign websites.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   And it is, listen, offering copyrighted material is a crime right now.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Right?
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   So what is this?
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   How could--
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Al-Jina, hold on there.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   What happens in China is not a crime in the US.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   It's a crime in China if China has the right laws.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   And in China, it's not a crime in China.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   That's part of the problem.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Yeah, so that's what this is trying to do is to fill in laws and enforcement in lands
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   where it doesn't exist.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   But we don't have, unless we want to do some extradition and,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   well, we've done things like that.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   We've got no way of stopping Chinese.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   So we'll do what the Chinese did, which is create a great firewall of the United States.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Right, and I agree with Leo here.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Go ahead, sorry.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   No, I was going to say, obviously, that's a terrible idea, right?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   But that's what this Read&Write web article is saying, that the administration is saying,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   like, OK, if this is a terrible idea, then what can we do?
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   OK, here's the idea.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Leo is absolutely right, I think, and you start to encourage and teach industries new models.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Now, will various of those companies succeed?
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Not necessarily.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   You know, the thing that I've been talking about, and I think I've just decided today
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   that we're going to try to build a demo of this at CUNY, is to build embeddable units of content.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   So I'm going to come back to Google+, and Richard Jingeris and folks, and try to get a guardian article,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   let's say, off their API, embedded not only in my blog, but also on Google+, with their brand,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   with their revenue, with their analytics, with links.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   You change the model, a movie that passes around, maybe it should pass around with advertising in it.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   And if you want the clean version, you buy it, otherwise you get some monetization with it.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   I don't know, but trying to preserve the old model in a new reality is not the solution,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   and it is a misstatement.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   This is where Tim Riley is really so right.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   It's a complete misstatement of the problem.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   There's not a proof of harm here.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   So before we get demanded by the White House or Read&Write web, then, well, OK, then you call it with something better.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   No, absolutely not.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   You come up and show us the harm.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   You show us the real facts that make it worthwhile to ruin the friggin' Internet.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   It's not.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Well, and it's interesting because I try to think about how to step into the minds of the people who are facing these problems,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   because I understand if you're a movie producer or someone who writes music,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   you don't want pirated content to take away from your living, right?
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   So there's two different cases.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   There's collateral damage, really legit businesses that could be taken down by mistaken sort of problems.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   There's a lot of them, sort of practices, and then there's the egregious sort of stuff.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   And on the egregious sort of stuff, my spam fighting instinct kicks in a little bit.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   So to be a good spammer, you need reputation, like links, you need content, something that the search engine can key off of,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   but most importantly, you need a way to monetize.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And there's been a study where people looked at email spam, and they basically figured out that most of the credit card processing
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   went through something like three banks based in Eastern Europe.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   And so a lot of the times, if you actually follow the money to either the credit card processors or the other payment processors,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   you'll find that there's some very small points where you could actually have a big impact there.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And so there is an act called Open where people are talking about following the money.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Yeah, but Matt, how well is that worked in stopping email spam?
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   The interesting thing on email spam is I think Gmail has been a huge technological improvement over what was previously working with email.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Because you're filtering it, not because you're stopping it.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Because we're...
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   What is it? 95% of all traffic on the internet is still spam.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Yeah, but for an average user, they don't have to see spam in their inbox.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   That's my point. There are technological solutions, but you cannot stop piracy. You cannot stop spam.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   If black holes, if black lists worked like they're proposing in SOPA and PIPA, we wouldn't have any spam. They don't work.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Oh, you can totally familiar with that.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Yeah, we haven't stopped spam. We just don't see it.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Right. Well, and what's interesting is the very first thing I worked on at Google was safe search, which is our family filter.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   And there was a Dilbert that came out that basically said, "So you're going to try to keep every 14-year-old boy from getting to porn?
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Did you know that a snowball lasts longer in hell if you put a little hat on it?"
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   And so you can't keep people who really are going to go to...
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   They'll go all over to find stuff, but you can try to make it easier so that people don't run across it on a daily basis.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   But what doesn't work, because I've seen how the brittle aspect of black lists dealing with trying to mark explicit porn sites and not...
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   The idea of outsourcing that through a private right of action to other companies who don't necessarily aren't necessarily as tech savvy, that just seems like a recipe for disaster.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Somebody in the chat will say, "Well, what about physical goods? What about Chanel handbags and Rolex watches?"
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   I would submit that anybody who would buy a fake Chanel handbag or Rolex wristwatch would not buy the original under any circumstances anyway.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   So what you cannot say is that Rolex loses money to fake Rolex wristwatches.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   No, and in fact, Leo, I went to a meeting by Rishmaul in South Africa last year, and they talked about what they're going to offer.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   The danger there really is that someone thinks they're buying a real one and get ripped off.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   A phony gets passed off. So what they see the need to do is to create new verification mechanisms.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   So before you buy it, you can verify that this is real.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   But that's not the overseas website problem, because if you're buying Chanel handbags from an overseas website...
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   No, you're right. Well, you should just know better. You're right, Leo. You're not going to buy it. You're not going to buy a real one anyway.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Here's another way to look at it. There were more cases today. Zappos were looking at so many things the wrong way.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   I wish I'd been on with Steve before this to ask him this question.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   It's slightly off topic, but all the security breaches and, oh my God, people have my credit card number and my address and my social security number.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Shouldn't we set up transactional methods so that it doesn't matter if anybody has my credit card, my social security number or whatever?
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   We're doing it the wrong way. We're trying to play the whack-a-mole that Matt's talking about of getting rid of the bad guys rather than creating new and better systems and models.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   If we had some means that was biometric and informational that let me and only me do transactions under my name,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   then I wouldn't care if anybody has my social security number. It's not the secret to my universe.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   We're doing it the wrong way. So same here. I think that Matt's quite right is to try to stop that thing from happening.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   I think that's going to work so you create better systems that bring the good stuff up, make it easier to buy things.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Steve Jobs proved that that worked in music. Is the revenue the same? Is the monopoly pricing the same?
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   We'll know, but welcome to a new world.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Everybody have a chance to speak along to these lines, Matt. You have anything else you want to say before we move along?
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   I think we're preaching to the converted here. I think anybody who's watching this show knows exactly why they hate SOPA.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   But it is very cool when you were talking to the EFF guy to hear the 29 Congress people have reversed your position today.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   That's pretty wild.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And as you say, this is much larger than Pippa and SOPA.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   I think you'll be able to look back on this day and say this is the day the internet showed its power.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   And we, the people of the internet, maybe do have a little bit of clout.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   And we're not just a bunch of neck-bearded guys in their underwear sitting in their basements.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Plus one thing that may be very happy about the discussion of the White House statement was that it rose to the level of principle.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   That's what I talked about in my book is the need for discussion of principles.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   Because we get down in the nitty gritty of trying to recreate a little model or protect one little thing.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   We've got to deal with the full principles, the precedents that occur here and the why and the wherefore.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And at some point the White House has to decide and Congress has to decide is it more important to protect an entertainment company or free speech?
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   And where are they going to put their capital and effort in doing this?
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   And we have to have this discussion at the level of principles and protecting these principles for a future.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   And that's what I'm so delighted about is that we're having here.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   We're saying that SOPA is one of many bad things going on in trying to screw the internet.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   But this is the one we're going to to far and this is the one we're going to stop.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   And we're going to have this discussion at the basis of principles.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   And I hope this strengthens our muscle and our protest muscle.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   And now that we understand that we have some say in the matter that we all stay involved and active, we vote, we pay attention to these issues.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   But now I think it's really important that we have a balance, a descending viewpoint.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   So ladies and gentlemen, we take you to Rupert Murdoch who says...
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   So Obama has thrown in his lot with Silicon Valley paymasters who threaten all software creators with piracy.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Please...
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Leo, can you do that with an Australian accent too please?
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Yeah, plain thavory.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   What I'm going to say later is Google who streams movies free, sells advertisements around them.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   No wonder pouring millions into lobbying.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   So as you point out in your... this is from Jeff's blog post saying Rupert Murdoch doesn't understand links.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   It really doesn't.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   It's all your fallback cuts. I blame you.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   I don't know what to say about this.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   He thinks to link to things is to steal them rather than sending them audience.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   He does not understand that basic structure.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   So he's always thought that aggregators were content, kleptomaniacs in the words of one of his recently ousted lieutenants.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   And now he thinks that for Google to just link to bad stuff is Google doing it.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   And he thinks the whole internet is on by Google. I saw...
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Here's the smoking gun post.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   I've just been to Google search for mission impossible.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Wow, several sites offering free links. I rest my case.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:28:03.520]   Jeff
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.520]   Don't care about people not buying movies, programs or newspapers. Just stealing them.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:12.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:18.520]   So, okay, so if we don't buy anything from him ever again, he won't... he doesn't care about that.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.520]   No problem.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.520]   No problem. Just don't steal.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:31.520]   Well, actually, you know, that there is some internal consistency to that because the presumption being that if once stolen that was a purchase that we've lost.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.520]   He accuses Google of being the thief.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.520]   Right.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:39.520]   You stole it instead of buying it.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:44.520]   Oh, he says AFL-CIO supports SOPA.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.520]   Well, we better talk to those union leaders. How about that?
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.520]   I have to say, though, I'm not... I don't want to make too much fun of Rupert because at least he's tweeting.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.520]   I mean, this is him, obviously.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:04.520]   And how many CEOs, only a guy like Rupert Murdoch with huge amounts of power within his company would get the permission to tweet.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.520]   He doesn't ask permission.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.520]   He just does.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.520]   Yeah, he gives it.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.520]   I'm going to say what I want.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.520]   All right, but now it's Matt's turn to get on the hot seat.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.520]   And we're going to do that in just a little bit because Google made some big changes.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:34.520]   I don't know, Matt, if you saw a tweet this week, but we went into great detail with Danny Sullivan about this search plus my world and some of the real interesting conflict of interest issues that it raises.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.520]   And I'm going to give you every chance to respond to that.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.520]   So we'll do that in just a little bit.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.520]   This is, of course, the day the internet fought back.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.520]   That's why we're in black and white.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:30:04.520]   And it's a great opportunity for you to go to blackout.ef.org or Americancensorship.org or Reddit.com or one of WordPress.com or Wired.com and learn more or Wikipedia.org and learn more about this and what you can do.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.520]   Primarily, chief of which is a call you're a member of Congress.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.520]   Now, of course, we're a global show.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:14.520]   More than a third of our audiences outside the US don't think this doesn't affect you.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.520]   These laws are being passed all over the world.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:30.520]   Most recently Spain, France, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the running dog of the US content industry is working on passing bills exactly like this all over the world.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.520]   So the fight goes on everywhere.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.520]   You're just as much at risk as we are.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:43.520]   So please do find out what it is that you need to do to make a difference in your neck of the woods.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.520]   We're going to take a break and come back with more of Gina Trippani, Jeff Jarvis, Matt Cutz.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.520]   But first a word from Squarespace.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.520]   I wonder, you know, I didn't look at Squarespace.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.520]   I wonder if they're participating in this.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.520]   Squarespace would be one of many sites that would be absolutely threatened by it.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.520]   No, they're not.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:06.520]   Because all it takes is one infringing site on Squarespace on a Squarespace.com server.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.520]   Oh, yeah, there it is.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.520]   There's the black bar across the name.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.520]   Stop censorship right there.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.520]   All it would take is one infringing site at Squarespace.com.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.520]   The whole domain could be gone.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.520]   So that's why we've got to fight this fight for everybody.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:32.520]   Squarespace is web hosting the best out there in addition to the best content management software to give you a place for your website.

[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.520]   So great.

[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.520]   Just with very simple drop a little widget in there.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.520]   Sliders point and click.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:14.520]   You can completely customize it to fit your site's look.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.520]   Templates that are not templated.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.520]   They are professionally designer created templates.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.520]   More than 60 of them.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.520]   But that's just a starting point.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.520]   And then you make it yours.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.520]   You could even use CSS and JavaScript.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.520]   You could do e-commerce.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.520]   I just love Squarespace.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.520]   I want you to try it free for 14 days.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.520]   Click that green button.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.520]   If you decide to buy, this is the only thing I ask of you.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.520]   Use our offer code when you decide to buy.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.520]   It's worth your while.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.520]   30% off for the first three months of your site when you do so.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.520]   Twig one is the number.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.520]   TWIG the number one.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.520]   But that's only when you're ready to buy.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.520]   You don't even need that just to try it and see how you like it.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.520]   Squarespace.com.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.520]   The secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:03.520]   30% off for your first three months when you use the offer code TWIG and the number one.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:09.520]   Any site aggregator would be vulnerable to this bill.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.520]   And of course we'd be very vulnerable.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.520]   I mean I'm not implying that I don't have a stake in this.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:21.520]   I have a huge stake in this because every show we do, including this show, frequently,
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:25.520]   we run clips because we're a new show and it's fair use allows us to do so.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.520]   Clips that illustrate the news stories we're talking about.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.520]   And often content creators pull those shows off of YouTube.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:39.520]   But and I think that you know that's a reasonable DMCA takedown.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:46.520]   I'm content with that because there's an appeal process.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.520]   To me that works.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.520]   Doesn't work perfectly as Matt was saying.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.520]   But it's more than adequate to protect.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.520]   In fact sometimes way more than adequate to protect rights holders.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.520]   We don't need to go any further.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:03.520]   If we did it would take merely a complaint from the Universal Music Group to pull all of TWIT off the air.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.520]   And that's the kind of thing we're worried about.
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.520]   Take me down off YouTube.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.520]   I can live with that.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:14.520]   We'll fight it and we'll appeal it and there is an appeal process.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:21.520]   But you know there's no appeal if ICE decides that TWIT is an infringing site and pulls us off the air.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.520]   By the way you know Chris Dodd former Senator Chris Dodd who is now.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.520]   Spokesperson actually is the CEO and chairman of the Emotion Picture Association of America.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.520]   Was just on CNN.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:40.520]   Time Warner's CNN saying well SOPAs to protect jobs in Hollywood.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.520]   I think far more jobs have been created by internet broadcasters.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.520]   We've created a dozen two dozen jobs here.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.520]   Amen.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.520]   Amen.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.520]   So that's the way that jobs have been lost.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.520]   So SOPA costs me jobs Chris Dodd.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.520]   What about that?
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:59.520]   Well Leo I just see that Trevor Tim who was you had on you know just a few minutes ago.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:03.520]   From the EFF on Twitter from the EFF Twitter says that he quotes Patrick Rufini of saying
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:09.520]   that 26 of the 29 legislators who just announced opposition to people in SOPA are Republicans.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:15.520]   He says the national review refames the legislation as a quote bailout for Hollywood.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.520]   Thank you.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.520]   Which he says explains the sudden Republican opposition.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.520]   All he had to say is the word bailout.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:26.520]   That's why it really it's Tim is right Tim and really it's right when he says if you reframe
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:32.520]   this it's really a misunderstanding of the problem that's causing this.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.520]   Yes.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.520]   It's true.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.520]   I love that bailout for Hollywood is brilliant.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.520]   And so you have Oren Hatch who was one of the according Trevor here who was one of the
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.520]   co-sponsors is now removed his co-sponsors.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.520]   Thank you.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.520]   We were working on dying in Feinstein.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.520]   Hello Democrats.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.520]   Hello Democrats.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.520]   Well what's interesting.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.520]   I'm Schumer, Jill O'Brantte.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.520]   Come on.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:57.520]   Feinstein also one of the sponsors is a senator from California so she represents both industries.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.520]   Right.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.520]   Silicon Valley and Hollywood.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.520]   So we're just going to exert a little more.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.520]   Google's in Washington DC right man.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.520]   I mean you have an active lobbying.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.520]   Oh yes.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.520]   We are in Washington DC.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.520]   Yeah absolutely.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.320]   But it's you know it's a case where the longer you've been in DC the longer you have
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.320]   relationships and Google as a young company.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.320]   Right.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.320]   It doesn't have as many relationships.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.320]   You need to hire more senators.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.320]   I'm sorry did I say that.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.320]   All right.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.320]   So let's talk let's talk about Search Plus My World.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:34.320]   I don't did you get a chance to see Twitter last last Sunday with Danny Sullivan.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.320]   You've probably seen Danny's complaints.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.320]   It's yeah.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.320]   We talked to Danny yesterday in fact.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.760]   And it's really interesting to me because there's a lot of great stuff in Search Plus
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.760]   Your World where really useful things can show up.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:53.120]   You know if I follow Gina which I do and she talks about a router and I do a search for
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:57.520]   router it surfaces her opinion about what are the good routers what are the routers to
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:01.360]   avoid and I actually had that happen to me this past weekend.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.480]   And I think Danny and other people had some some very reasonable feedback about what we
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.160]   wanted to see more Twitter or we wanted to see more Facebook.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.440]   And you know Facebook they have a deal with Bing.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.840]   They have a deal with Yandex in Russia.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.200]   They even have a deal with Bletko.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.960]   They've talked about Baidu.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.040]   But we haven't been able to arrive on a deal together.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:24.240]   And even Twitter you know we had started out with a product called Realtime Search which
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.240]   is was hugely useful that relied on Twitter a lot.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.520]   And unfortunately that arrangement ended up rather abruptly.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.120]   I don't know all the details.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:37.000]   I know that a lot of engineers were working on the July 4th weekend this past summer to
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.280]   turn that off.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.480]   And so I think when we were building Search Plus Your World you want to have a good user
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.480]   experience.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.320]   You want to have sharing that just works and identity that just works.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.720]   And as an engineer you're probably a little bit reluctant to build something.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:55.560]   If you don't know whether you know that other company is just going to say oh you know I'm
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.800]   putting in a robots.txt and blocking Google from crying the entire.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.960]   So you could I mean it's true we know that Google can see a lot of what's on Facebook.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.960]   A lot of that's public.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.560]   A lot of it's searchable.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.440]   But you just can't count on it is what you're saying.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:12.560]   Certainly with Twitter you know given the experience of Realtime Search where that did
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.160]   end rather abruptly.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.560]   You know it was interesting.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.600]   I have a ton of respect for AMAC the general counsel for Twitter.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:23.320]   He's worked at Google and you know he's a fantastic guy.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:27.160]   But you know it's hard to predict whether someone's going to say well how dare you not
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.680]   use Twitter more from the open web data versus we don't want to be in it at all.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.120]   And so I think we started out with a relatively safe assumption but you know definitely if
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:40.360]   people want to talk about ways to work together that's something that we can have that conversation.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.840]   Something odd has happened here.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:47.720]   I have to say I was able to demonstrate on my Twitter my Google account.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:51.920]   I had search plus my world it seems to have been turned off now.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:57.320]   I don't know I don't know why I am no longer getting those results on the right hand side.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.840]   I'll give you an example of the search that we did do and you are seeing some of the some
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.200]   of what we're complaining about right here.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:08.920]   I search for Mark Zuckerberg right in the drop down I see Mark Zuckerberg's Google+ account
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:14.040]   coming to a Google property and for a while it was the first search result.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.040]   It's changed now.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.320]   No it's first for me.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.840]   Yeah something happened I think that I hate to say it Matt but somebody at Google has flipped
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.320]   a switch on my account.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:27.480]   Try to know what a search like Linux and see whether that brings up.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.080]   You know what was it was another good search.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.840]   Let's see what happens is music.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.280]   Here we go.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.280]   This is doing it now.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.280]   So let's do that.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.280]   Let's show this one.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:41.640]   Mark the point Danny made was that Mark Zuckerberg's Google+ page is probably not a good search
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.560]   result because he hasn't posted anything on it.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:50.960]   Yes it's a Google property but it is not a good result and this is precisely his complaint
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:55.400]   which is that you are now massaging search results to benefit Google not to give the
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.120]   best search result.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:03.320]   Well I think if you look at that page it says people and places on Google+ so I think
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.960]   it's in its own box that's on the right hand side and it very specifically says it's on
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.960]   Google+.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:08.960]   Didn't do it for Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.720]   You actually gave it to me in a drop down and it's a first search result.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:17.200]   But yeah I think the suggestions are again people that we know about because we actually
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.200]   know their identity.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:23.560]   There's a very common case if you're married with someone and suppose you get a divorce
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:28.120]   you know on Facebook you might have those permissions updated instantly but if you're
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:32.400]   crawling the web you might not get that connection that these people are no longer linked and
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.960]   maybe you know it's really bad to show pictures of your ex or something like that.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.920]   So unless we really have the sort of access where we can tell you know at a given moment
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:45.960]   does someone have access to this picture or something like that then it's really tricky
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.440]   to be able to handle that well.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:51.600]   Let me, music is another example and as you say this is people and pages it says people
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.120]   and pages on Google+.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:41:00.200]   What happened of course is if you search for Lady Gaga she wasn't on Google+ she must
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:05.080]   have listened to our Twitter episode because she is on Google+ now and there's good reason
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:09.320]   to be if you look over here after I search on music I get Britney Spears and Snoop Dogg
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:15.200]   both of whom are in one million plus circles on Google+ those are right there related to
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:20.840]   music there may not be the best search results for me Lady Gaga is not there but as Lady Gaga
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.760]   obviously recognized boy you better have a Google+ account.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:30.200]   Is that not strong arming Lady Gaga into having a Google+ account by modifying your search
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   results?
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.200]   But she just started.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   Right.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.200]   She capitulated.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.200]   You won.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:41.280]   Well again you know this is not my area I'm not a lawyer I'm a regular webspam engineer
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:47.720]   but I don't think that the law requires us to do things that help competitors just competition
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:52.440]   something that helps showing these results is better than not having any information at
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:56.600]   all I like the search of Linux because it actually has leanest tour vaults Linux and
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.640]   Greg Co-Hartman who's a Colonel hacker and it actually surfaces really useful experts
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.080]   that you wouldn't have seen before.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:08.440]   Yes but if Linus wasn't on Google+ it would not have.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:13.080]   No absolutely but the problem is you know we forgot clear marking we've said this is
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:18.520]   people in places are people and you know and pages on Google+ and at the bottom learn
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.240]   how you could appear here too.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.080]   Sure but it is on the right hand side and it's in a different box but I think the key thing
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:29.760]   for us is we already tried to build a product for example that would surface Twitter data
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:35.240]   and had a contract and that had to end really quickly and a lot of people had to work really
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:39.920]   hard to pull data out and so I think if you are an engineer and you're trying to figure
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.320]   out you know if you're just going to build a system and then a year and a half later
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:48.360]   or two years later have to shut it down in some cases uncleanlier very quickly then you'd
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.240]   be a little reluctant to build that the next time around.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.720]   It's sort of like one spit and twice shy.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:58.960]   So really the call at this point and I presume you make somebody at Google's made this call
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:03.640]   us to Twitter and Facebook saying let's make a deal so that you can show up here too because
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:10.720]   truthfully it would be much better for the search results if you did.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:11.720]   And that's above my pay grade.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:12.720]   I understand.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.720]   I'm out some of the elephant.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:21.360]   Matt I believe me I know I'm spanking you here and I'm only spanking you in surrogate.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:26.520]   I love you Matt and you know we love Google but I have to say a number of people said
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.280]   this on the net this was the day Google went evil.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.120]   So that's one thing that I disagree with.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.920]   Like Danny had published a post that talked about when some of the things were pushing
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:40.800]   relevancy you know not as strongly because it was Google plus but what I've noticed is
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:46.080]   your searches can change entirely if you do a search like photos you can get the latest
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.480]   photos you've taken and the latest photos that your friends have taken.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:55.160]   I find myself doing for example I went to Costa Rica about a week or two ago and if I
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:00.320]   do the search Costa Rica now I get colleagues at Google who have been to Costa Rica and I
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:04.560]   have that picture and now I can do find out from them which things I should be doing.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:09.120]   So you know the notion that you should be able to search over the sorts of things you've
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.640]   seen in the past you don't remember where you saw it but you know you can get really
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.920]   interesting useful stuff to still down and more importantly searches you wouldn't have
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   done before like it's a different type of search that lets you find out new information
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.800]   that you wouldn't have found for your friends.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:30.320]   I've had several of those epiphany moments where I'm like oh wow that's you know a recommendation
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:35.480]   from Gina is worth ten times as much in my mind than just a regular web page and I've
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.480]   had several of those kinds of things.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.520]   So and I agree with you in fact this is what we've been talking about quite a bit for the
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:45.640]   last two years is how social search massages search results and makes them more relevant
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:50.240]   and it was clear that one of the reasons Google started Google+ is so that they could you
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:55.440]   know own some signals these very very valuable social signals and you're right you can't rely
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:00.440]   on Facebook you can't rely on Twitter for those social signals so I understand the engineers
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:05.280]   point of view which is well we're going to have to create our own social signals we recognize
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:11.680]   that these social signals are absolutely critical to making search better so what do you as an
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:17.880]   engineer how do you solve that well let's start capturing social signals Google+ but what
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:23.360]   it looks like to the outside world is a favoritism towards Google+ I think you've responded well
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.360]   Gina and Jeff.
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:29.240]   Gina you go first because you've been silent for a while then of course I'll jump in.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:35.080]   So I have a I've mixed feelings about search plus your world I think that it makes my search
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:39.800]   results both better and worse so I just read the Hunger Games series so I do a search for
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.280]   the Hunger Games and I can see all the places where my friends have mentioned the Hunger
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.760]   Games.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.280]   Dereka example.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.280]   Valuable and because I happen to be pretty pretty.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:54.000]   Spayed a lot of the network and my friends participate a lot of the network and Google
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:00.800]   graph is very very useful so that I like what makes me uncomfortable is like this past week
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.920]   or the last couple of days I did a search for I want to look at Leo's blog because I
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.440]   knew he had done a post about whether or not we should blackout today so I searched for
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:14.280]   Leo LaPort and the first result is his Google+ profile because he's in my circles but that's
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:18.280]   not what I'm looking for actually it was that's where I posted that.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:21.840]   You did an audio post on the blog.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.400]   Audio post is on the blog now you're right.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:27.320]   So I didn't remember Leoville.com off the top so that's what I'm looking for and I thought
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.600]   I follow Leo if I wanted his Google+ profile I would have looked for him on Google+ I would
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.680]   have known to do that.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:38.800]   Truthfully this made me uncomfortable I have to say I've been on Twitter since 2007 I've
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.120]   invested way more time on Twitter than I have in Google+ right just because it's been around
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:48.640]   a lot longer so Twitter has a lot more information about me than Google+ does at this point so
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:54.200]   I feel like my Twitter profile and even to some extent my Facebook profile should rank
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:59.840]   higher than Google+ at this point and I understand the issues with making deals with those companies
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.080]   and all those things I just I felt kind of disappointed because I think that the best
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:09.440]   way for a community to grow for a social product to grow is from the inside and not from the
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:15.080]   outside like it made me sad that people are going to join Google+ as part of their SEO
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:19.400]   strategy you know because they've been you know because they feel like it will it will
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:23.040]   raise their ranking because of Searchlight and World.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.080]   Exactly rather than join Google+ because it's it's a great product I actually think the
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:31.640]   Google+ is a good product but I don't think it's proven itself yet so this felt this feels
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:36.440]   like the right path but to me it felt a little too much too soon I didn't love that it's
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:41.800]   the default setting I didn't love that it even if you toggle to to disable personalized
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:47.280]   search it goes back to the default setting unless you settings and say don't.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:52.360]   So it may be uncomfortable it felt a little bit like a misstep even though as Matt said
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:56.320]   I have had the experience it did enhance my search results in some in some cases where
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:02.200]   you know I value the things that my friends say more than random dude on the internet web
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.960]   page so that's my my mixed review.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:10.840]   No and I think that that's absolutely fair feedback and one thing that some some people
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:15.000]   didn't realize in the very first wave is even though we need to know who you are and
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.480]   able to surface your content or your friends if you link from your Google+ profile to your
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:25.680]   Twitter account or Quora or friend feed or WordPress or type add that that data can also
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:31.680]   be surfaced so it's not only Google+ content but the other thing that I'd mention and I
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:35.480]   totally agree it can be useful if you search for sunset I expect to see Danny Sullivan's
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:41.600]   pictures of sunset but there's a good story from when we first rolled out a PDF or acrobat
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:46.160]   search because PDFs are really long they had a lot more words and they had a lot more
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:50.280]   matches and at first when we started to blend them there were people complained you have
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:55.440]   way too many acrobat files showing up in the search results and so I think will absolutely
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:00.360]   iterate because we totally know that if we annoy people like Matt Hohnen did a post where
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:04.600]   he said he's going to set his default homepage to Bing we know there's no lock in and search
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:09.600]   you can leave in 15 seconds and so if we annoy people we know that they'll start to leave
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:13.680]   and so it's in our enlightened self-interest to try to get the balance right and not to
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:19.480]   try to you know show you so much of any given thing that it annoys you so the goal is to
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.960]   show you those results only if they're really useful not if there's something that's going
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.840]   to be annoying to you and it might take time to find exactly what that balance is going
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:30.840]   to be but I do think that we'll find that balance and in two or three years people will
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:35.320]   look back and say I'm really glad that I've got this kind of functionality where something
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:40.320]   that's private or accessible only to me I don't have to remember where it was I can
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:44.480]   go and I can search for it in one place and by the way as Danny pointed out on a Twitter
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.600]   on Sunday Bing's been doing this for a long time so going to Bing is actually not does
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:59.640]   not do anything you know I agree with you that there's an issue here but but the issue
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:03.840]   is not that Google is pointing to itself you know the New York Times does not point to
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.800]   the New York Post Sports section which happens to be better than the New York Times Sports
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:11.080]   section I'm told right it points to its own stock well I hear that argument but that's
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:17.560]   a publisher and so this is my really fundamental problem is Google a search engine or a content
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:21.680]   creator you can't have it both ways well no I disagree I think that it is a service provider
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.280]   and it can point to its own services it points to it can point to Gmail and it can point to
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:28.960]   other things it can use its space that's what companies do but here's where I'll agree with
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:36.480]   you I think that Google's reputation depends upon it enforcing print having and then enforcing
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:40.960]   and living principles and so if I were Google I would have a few things one I think I'd
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:46.480]   been a little less garish about the point to Google plus to I would have made a very clear
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:51.200]   policy statement that says as soon as we can I take a point Matt reliably get feeds from
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:55.160]   Twitter and Facebook we will include them equally because those are social signals that
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:51:00.280]   are equally important to you and if they're you know more important in terms of your social
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:04.600]   graph then we'll put them there I think Google should make that kind of a statement of where
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:11.520]   it's going but I also think that Google made some right moves you know one as Gina said
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:16.560]   going toward collecting social signals is important and two it was it got praise even
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:21.680]   from privacy people on its transparency about where it gets what it gets I think they deserve
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:25.000]   some of that I think a lot of the problem here is a design and aesthetic problem because
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:31.880]   it's a little bit tacky and that's good feedback I think there's still absolutely room to improve
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:35.800]   the UI you know if you have two results maybe it's better to have one result and that's a
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:40.760]   little more compact we tend to go for lots of information in the given pixels that we
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:47.040]   have but what's interesting to me is like I love Twitter I post on Twitter all the time
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:51.960]   yet some of these services they're almost like private forums and that you expect it's
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:56.640]   your data and you can pull it out and you can take it wherever you want but if I'm if
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:01.640]   the service can restrict how well we can crawl or block us entirely or something like that
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:05.200]   then it's not as much your data as you think it is right which is a little bit of a strange
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:09.240]   I've been very vocal my criticism of both Twitter and Facebook because they are essentially
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:17.000]   silos based on our content and that isn't the way it should be either and so I am sympathetic
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:23.040]   actually the to Google's conundrum I'm sure you'd love well let me not put words in your
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:28.720]   mouth would you love to include Twitter and Facebook results in this social search I can
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:33.360]   only speak for me personally but absolutely I mean I've tweeted something like 15,000 times
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:38.080]   I would I would that's a lot of signal there's a lot of signals stored in Twitter which in
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:44.720]   theory you own but in fact you do not Twitter owns and Twitter restricts I or think about
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:48.560]   it or something like that right I was with some guys from the Google+ team when I went
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:53.120]   out to do my book talk in Mountain View and you know I'm not revealing anything behind
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:57.640]   any curtains but they were clearly disappointed that they no longer had Twitter live search
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.920]   and these were not business people these were product people you know we're creating the
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:06.120]   product that we're using but more data is only good is only going to provide better services
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:09.720]   so you know I think if Google had been more clever this is where Google has a problem
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:13.720]   with both Washington and Silicon Valley and they've got to watch this out especially in
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:17.880]   Europe I think is they should have turned around and said we're about to release this amazing
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:22.400]   new thing we wish it included Twitter why don't you go ask Twitter to let us do that
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.640]   and it would have turned the focus on Twitter and sort of the focus being on Google seeming
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:33.320]   as if or you know badaging its monopoly which it doesn't really have well that's a fantastic
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:37.800]   point I completely agree and what's one thing that's been a little interesting is whenever
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:42.480]   we rolled out real-time search I found a post by Andy Beard who's a guy who's not always
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:47.000]   happy towards Google and he basically said I hate real-time search it shows up all the
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.760]   time it's on by default the UI is garish I don't want to surface you know all this sort
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:57.400]   of Twitter information in my search results and yeah you know a couple years later when
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:01.640]   we turned it off people are like oh wow real-time search is fantastic I know that Michael Jackson
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:07.600]   died or whatever and so I do think that there's a really nice vision if we can deliver on
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:12.880]   it of something that's useful and not just the public web but distilling you know opinions
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:17.640]   of your friends or or stuff that only you have access to if we can deliver on that I
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.880]   think people will really love it but we have to get the UI right we have to get the balance
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:26.000]   right ideally we can you know work with with other people to try to surface that information
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.840]   from wherever it happens on the web clarify this for me did Twitter pull the plug on that
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:36.000]   relationship my understanding is that Google did put out a statement that said that and
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.240]   Google normally tries to be a very polite company right so the fact that we would even
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:44.080]   go that far means there's a little bit of this you know left at the altar once bitten
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:47.640]   twice I kind of feeling going on but that's my understanding and I think you know you
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:51.960]   made such a good point which we had not heard before which is you don't build a service
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:56.280]   based on something that could be pulled so easily people are saying well they can search
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:03.240]   Facebook you can today but but and we've seen Facebook do this they did it to Apple with
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:09.160]   Ping they they said yeah we got a relationship until we don't and it's very embarrassing
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:15.400]   for a company like Apple like Apple to put out Ping with Google with a Facebook integration
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:19.600]   which they announced and then not to have it so I can understand why as an engineer you're
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:23.240]   not going to build something on that you don't want to have the Twitter debacle happen again
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:29.160]   right it's it's not even like it was a hypothetical we had seen it happen six months ago and on
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:34.000]   the July 4th weekend of 2011 and so to have it happen once you're it's definitely once
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.960]   bitten twice I think Gina you were gonna say something I'm sorry
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:40.480]   somebody in the chat room made an interesting point which is that it would be nice if users
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:45.840]   could could opt in to having their Twitter data crawled and an easy way to do that would
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:50.600]   be to open up the Google+ API to make it right so I could say hey anytime I post the Twitter
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:55.720]   or Facebook also post this to Google+ but that's not that has not happened yet and I
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:56:00.440]   understand the reasoning behind that you don't want Google+ to just be this you know echo chamber
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:05.000]   for what goes on in other networks but but that would I mean I would love that I would
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:10.080]   love to be able to have Google search capabilities across across all my networks and it might
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:14.840]   be you know giving the users a little more power to do that versus making complicated
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:18.160]   deals with these companies I mean of course not everyone's gonna opt to do that but a
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:22.640]   publisher like all of us sitting here who spent a lot of time but putting things online
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:26.920]   probably would opt into something like that right and I don't you know and again I'm
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:31.800]   just speaking for myself personally I would love that we have seen with buzz where if
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:35.560]   there wasn't as much activity and then you had the API then buzz would just become things
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:39.280]   that were syndicated from the other services where you posted but even if it were something
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:44.000]   where you could upload your own data you know so that search plus your world whatever it
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.520]   was you know maybe it was an XML feed I think that would be fantastic we have I mean we've
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:53.520]   seen stuff like like Facebook with their version of data liberation was we'll give you the
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:59.120]   lists of the names of your friends no no profile pages or anything so it's don't you dare import
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:04.320]   them into Google plus yeah it's unclear how much data you'd be able to probably lose for
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:10.160]   different services but I personally would think that would be fantastic we're waiting
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:16.000]   Tim O'Reilly I think is going to join us we are going to wrap very soon Tim are you there
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.440]   Tim is in between flights and so we're going to try to get him via phone he was getting
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:25.120]   his headphones getting his headphones from the airport is that what that sound was that
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:30.320]   was feedback Tim O'Reilly okay and then we're going to wrap up if you're just tuning in
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:34.720]   and you're saying why are they in black and white or if you're watching one of the downloads
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:38.400]   and you've been banging on your TV for the last hour we're in black and white because
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:45.960]   today is January 18th the day the internet sat up and started fighting for itself and
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:52.760]   like many other sites we considered pulling ourselves going black and I decided that this
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:57.800]   would be a good compromise black and white the banner on the lower left that says is
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:03.480]   americansensorship.org but I think we have a duty to pass along information I'm really glad
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.440]   you made this decision you know I think it's the right decision and and an email before
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:11.760]   Angina and you and I are in this Lauren Weinstein did some really great posts on Google plus
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:17.960]   arguing all for protesting so but saying that and I'll put it in my words that if you're
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:22.760]   going to tell the world that you're vital then you shouldn't cut yourself off and he
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:28.880]   made a post using the word hospital in place of Wikipedia and said well we're very important
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:32.560]   but we live some problems and we're going to be okay for 24 hours somewhere else.
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.960]   That's not a good idea on the other hand I commend Wikipedia because I do too I think
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:41.400]   it was the single biggest stroke and I think they did the right thing they did but you didn't
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:45.120]   have to do the exact same thing I think you're talking about the issue you're giving any
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:49.480]   addition to the folks who rose up as a public of the internet and I think that's important.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:55.240]   If you go to Boing Boing.net you'll see 503 service intentionally unavailable this is
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:59:00.160]   a really they really went dark but of course nobody nobody died from lack of Boing Boing
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:06.800]   but we are going to have two of the editors of Boing Boing. Corey couldn't join us because
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:12.960]   it's so late at night in Great Britain but we are a Mark Fronfelder will join us for
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:18.440]   triangulation tonight 4 p.m. Pacific 7 p.m. Eastern time and we'll spend an hour talking
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:21.280]   about this issue. We're still waiting to hear from Tim O'Reilly I really wanted to
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:27.160]   get Tim on because he's been so eloquent. We're just having a little technical issues
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:32.160]   because he is in fact at the airport and it was very gracious of him to make some time
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:38.320]   in between flights. And in the meantime can I just say that I'm going to use this as a
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:42.640]   litmus test to see what is the most savvy magazine because there really ought to be a
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:48.120]   magazine that puts Alexis O'Hanean co-founder of Reddit on the front cover and says this
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:54.760]   is the new face of politics. I agree. Yeah. Good point. You know he was really one of
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:58.920]   the lightning rods. I mean Wikipedia at a huge amount of momentum deciding to go completely
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:03.040]   dark but you know it seems like Alexis kind of narrowed down the day and really was one
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:07.840]   of the first to say we're going to go 100% dark and Reddit is building a platform for
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:13.120]   changing politics as well. And even before that's built you know he's personally won
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:16.680]   over a lot of Congress people like I really want to see what magazine ends up doing that
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:21.360]   profile because somebody needs to. I agree. I think that it probably will go unnoticed
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:27.680]   but truthfully this is a significant step forward in politics and in the internet and
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:34.360]   the power of use of geeks the political power of geeks people will understand the issues
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.600]   who care about the issues and are willing to stand up and be counted. This is a huge
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:44.520]   day and I think that's we absolutely had to recognize it and I just wanted to find a
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.600]   way to recognize it that would allow us to have these great conversations. Matt I want
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.880]   to thank you. Matt cuts it works at Google keeping the Google search results spam free
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:58.840]   and I'll tell you what without Matt I don't know. We really are grateful to the work you
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:06.560]   do. We really appreciate it. We also thank you for taking some of the heat by proxy and
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:11.480]   I think you did it as always and this is always great to have you on and why Google
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:16.840]   likes your loves having you speak. You did a great job defending the search plus your
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:20.440]   world. Thank you Matt we'll see you soon. Take care. Thanks for having me. The great
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:29.240]   guys in the world. We love Matt. We love Matt cuts and we love having him on and I love
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:35.440]   having these kinds of great conversations about the whole thing. I'm still waiting to
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.160]   hear from Tim O'Reilly. Do you want to I don't know if we had planned a tip in a number
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:43.360]   and a tool of the week but we could do that. Gina if you've got a tip of the week.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:48.240]   Gosh it seems so such a heavy. It seems so trivial doesn't it? I know what your tip
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:54.000]   is. Call your Congress critter. I mean that really is the tip of today. I just have to
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.600]   say again it really is amazing to see the internet become this amazing platform for
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:03.200]   democracy and I want to see more action. I want the web to kind of have this API to
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.520]   these big institutions to change them and to stop legislation like this. I want to see
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:10.000]   the more of this in the future and we will have more of this in the future because I
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.680]   think Clay Shurkey pointed out in his TED talk that the SOPA is just the next iteration
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:21.680]   to the DMCA so there are going to be others in the future. But back to my trivial tip.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:29.880]   I picked up this site notification control dot com. We all kind of get a little too much
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:34.960]   email. A lot of it is what they call bacon or notifications from different social networks.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:39.400]   This site notification control just has a basically just a list of links to various services
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:45.560]   Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, YouTube, 4 square where you can control that exact page to set
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:50.200]   what notification email. I like that. Email and you don't want to set up the filters
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:55.880]   in your mail account. You can just go do a quick audit very similar to my tip a couple
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:01.440]   weeks ago to my permissions. Just do a quick audit of what's sending you what? For what
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.240]   reason? What kind of notifications are you getting? Notification every time someone mentions
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:09.080]   you or someone DM's you that kind of thing. The second part of this is a shameless plug.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:15.880]   My app for Android to do dot text touch has been ported to iOS. It's available to us.
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:21.280]   I have an iPad and I hope you'll check it out. If you go to to do txt.com you'll see
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:30.160]   it for iOS. Excellent. It's it's 100% nerdware, proudly nerdware. I hope you check that out.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.600]   Thank you, Gina. We're going to get Jeff's number and my tool of the week before we do.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.800]   Let's say hello to Tim O'Reilly. Have a Rylie media. Tim, are you there? Hi, yes,
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:42.240]   I am. Thank you so much. I know this is a hardship. You're in between flights, but such
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.800]   an important day. And I don't know if you've heard the news because you're on a plane.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:51.680]   We just talked to Trevor Tim of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. 29 members of Congress
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:58.600]   today have retracted support for SOPA. Yes, I did see that. And I was actually kind of
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:04.560]   interested to see that 26 of them were Republicans. Yes. Now, so that makes me wonder where are
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:10.520]   the Democrats and in particular, you know, being from California, I wonder about Barbara
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:16.120]   Boggs and Diane Feinstein being on the wrong side of Piper. Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:24.840]   Tim, you've written such great posts on Google+, about these bills and about reframing the argument,
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:31.220]   which I think as usual, you're really a deep thinker on this. I encourage people to read
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:38.260]   your posts. One of the issues being, of course, that intellectual property isn't really property
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:43.860]   in the same way that we understand, you know, a car, a cell phone or a house to be. Well,
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:49.980]   I guess I don't even really want to go there. What I suggested in my post, there were two
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:54.180]   or three things. First of all, I totally agree with all the issues that have been raised
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:59.340]   about internet censorship and the dangers of going down that path. But I thought, well,
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:04.500]   there's a lot of people already talking about that. And what could I add to the discussion?
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:12.220]   And what I thought I could add was the perspective of a publisher for whom, you know, piracy
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:17.820]   is really not that big a problem. I mean, we know that our books are pirated. They appear
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:23.780]   on torrents all the time. They're also just, by the way, the books that are most often
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:26.340]   stolen from libraries, according to librarians.
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:32.660]   Those darn programmers are such thieves. Does that mean that we don't want our books to
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:37.140]   be in libraries? No. Does it mean that we want to shut down libraries because they're,
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:44.860]   you know, havens for shoplifting? You know, the whole idea is, first of all, I, so anyway,
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:48.420]   I wanted to bring that personal experience in there. But I also wanted to bring in a
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:52.660]   bit of historical perspective. You know, I found, for example, in one of my posts, this
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:58.700]   wonderful letter from one of the Harper brothers back in the 1860s, where he was responding
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:03.540]   to complaints from author Anthony Trollope that Harper brothers had pirated his novel
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:10.620]   "Orley Farm." And, you know, Harper went on to basically say, look, we're doing the
[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:14.780]   best we can. You know, it wasn't the International Copyright Treaty. And so they would just go
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:23.820]   buy, you know, what they called early sheets of various novels. And in this particular case,
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:28.500]   Trollope had sold them to Lipancot, which was in Philadelphia, rather than the Harper brothers.
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:31.700]   And they were like, well, we have a series of Trollope novels. You're interfering with
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:35.620]   our ability to commerce. So they went and published a pirated edition. And you look
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:42.300]   at this and you go, American publishing began with piracy. And now these companies are
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:48.220]   complaining. But the fact is new markets begin in a very chaotic and disorderly way. And it's
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:53.260]   really evidence of market failure. And so I wanted just to bring that historical perspective
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:07:00.140]   in and to say, yes, there are problems right now. But as a matter of industrial policy,
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:07.020]   do we as a nation want to say, let's try to stop the future until our old lying companies
[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:11.380]   can get their act together to serve the market in a way that satisfies it?
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:16.500]   Or do we want to just say, hey, the market is moving, get with the program. Now I have
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:24.540]   been spending, you know, I started publishing ebooks in 1987, you know, and I, you know,
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:31.300]   have been waiting for this moment. And firstly, it's the last thing that's a problem for publishers.
[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:35.340]   The big problem is they've been so afraid of piracy is they haven't actually taken
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:41.340]   first move or advantage, you know, and they're going to hurt a hell of a lot more from Amazon
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:46.020]   stealing their authors than they are going to hurt from piracy. And so if they had been more
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:51.060]   proactive about embracing the market and finding ways to deliver to customers what they want,
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:56.460]   they'd be way better off. So it's just misdirected, you know, energy to try to get Congress to
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:08:00.980]   impose laws because you haven't acted to serve customers.
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:07.980]   Tim O'Reilly, I'll let you get your flight. Thank you so much. Read Tim on Google Plus.
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:14.100]   He's been using that lately. Of course, O'Reilly media is also on the internet at OReilly.com.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:20.020]   But Google Plus. We're blacked out today. So you can probably read the stuff on Google.
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:29.340]   It's great to talk to you. Thank you so much for making some time with us. Thank you for
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:33.500]   being a great leader and an eloquent leader in this subject.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:38.660]   All right. Thanks a lot. Thanks Tim O'Reilly from O'Reilly media. OReilly.com. Yes, it's
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:44.140]   blacked out, but there's a lot of good information there. And of course on this Google Plus account.
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:49.660]   Thank you, Tim. Take care TNT coming up in a bit, but first Jeff's number of the week.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:56.180]   Real quick, Facebook finally exceeds orchid in Brazil in December. It's 36.1 million numbers
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:02.140]   beat or orchids 34.4 million. So as Google becomes more social in one way, the other way
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:05.660]   kind of goes a little bit in the sunset.
[01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:12.580]   My tool of the week is I just fallen in love with Google Currents. Google Currents is
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:18.900]   an app for iPhone and Android phones. That is a really great way and tablets, I should
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:23.460]   mention. There's an iPad version. Great way to get news, both from your Google reader
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:30.740]   account and other sources. This is in some ways the flip board for Android. Really a
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:38.060]   great way to read and consume content and free. Currents is the name of it. You could find
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:43.100]   it in both the iOS and the Android marketplace and for the iPad as well. If you haven't taken
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:48.340]   a look at it, I highly recommend you do some really nice features. Make it easy to read,
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:53.260]   easy to share and very attractive. I have it. You know, the only request I'd have is
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:59.740]   can you guys make an Android widget? I want a widget, please. No widget means no desktop
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:05.060]   space. I've got a page just waiting for you right there, right there. I put it right there
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:14.300]   on my Google widget page. Currents. Thank you, Matt Cutz. Thank you, Jeff. Have a great
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:19.500]   day. Thank you, Jeff Jarvis. Thank you, Gina Trapani. Thank you all for watching in black
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:25.540]   and whites. The facts are black and white. They're simple. They're straightforward.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:29.460]   Before this day is out, I hope you will all contact your member of Congress. Phone them.
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:34.260]   It's the best way to do it. If you want a phone number, go to blacklist. I'm sorry, black
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:40.740]   out dot E. I'm sorry. It is blacklist, blacklist dot EFF dot org. They will help you find the
[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:45.940]   phone number you need. And you can strike out against censorship of the internet and
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:50.540]   stop those internet blacklist bills. In fact, let's stop it so hard that they don't come
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:56.020]   back with another. What do you say? Let's hold the line. And thank you for joining us.

[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:27.500]   living color on this week.
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:39.860]   Thank you.
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:44.900]   Trevor Tim is an attorney with EFF dot org. Is that a title? Trevor or just an attorney?
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:51.140]   Actually, I'm an activist. Yes, although I am a lawyer, I'm not practicing. So I'm an
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:56.540]   activist and writer for EFF. I love it. Welcome. EFF is the electronic frontier foundation
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:01.060]   we've spoken of course many times with many of its founders including Mitch K. Poor John
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:09.060]   Perry Barlow. We've told you many times support EFF. We do. We donate every month to EFF. And
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:13.500]   if you go to EFF dot org right now, you can see a lot more about the internet blacklist
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:19.580]   bills, sopa and PIPA. And of course, they put that big bar stop censorship bar across
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:29.020]   the top. So let's actually do a little news bit first, Trevor. How are these protests
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:34.300]   working? How widespread are they? Are they effective?
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:37.500]   I mean, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that this is probably the most effective
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:44.220]   online protests we've ever seen. We had major sites, black out their websites and protests,
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:49.260]   Wikipedia. Obviously is the biggest. They're six largest site in the country. But we also
[01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:56.980]   had Craigslist, Huffington Post, Wired, EFF, a bunch of others. Reddit was the one that
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:03.500]   started this. And we've seen 29 congressmen change their position today already. And
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:10.300]   the day isn't even half over. So it's been, it's been basically an avalanche. Every 15
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:15.540]   minutes it seems we're getting news that a new congressman has changed his mind. And
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:21.620]   a lot of them are co-sponsors too. So that's where it really hits home is when the people
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:25.340]   who supported this bill from the beginning decide, you know what, we're going to start
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:31.300]   listening to our constituents and oppose this bill.
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:37.220]   So boy, that is a stunning number. What is it? 29 members of Congress? 29 hours of a
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:40.580]   half hour ago. And at this point, it might be 30 or 31.
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:44.780]   That's fantastic. And I think the key here, and I'm sure you would agree as an activist
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:48.700]   is people I think sometimes feel like they cannot influence Congress. Well, there is
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:56.260]   no greater influence than your vote. So the key here is really being an activist calling
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:59.980]   your member of Congress, giving them your name, the city or from make sure they understand
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:07.900]   you are a voter in their district and being clear that this is your opinion and it carries
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:08.900]   some weight.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:13.660]   Yeah, absolutely. We encourage everyone to call in. If they can hear your voice, it's
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:18.300]   even better than email. Obviously, emails are great. We have a petition for sending out
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:24.580]   emails. It's already gotten since last night at midnight, it's gotten 250,000 emails sent
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:30.100]   to Congress. Apparently, the Senate servers were knocked off for a little while today
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:34.540]   because their websites were overloaded. Their phones have been ringing off-book. Google
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:40.140]   actually participated in the blackout too. They had a, their logo blacked out. You can
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:44.780]   still search, but they asked people to take action so far today. They've gotten 4 million
[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:47.340]   signatures on their petition.
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:53.940]   That's amazing. I think that that was job one was to raise awareness because unfortunately,
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:58.500]   technical issues like this do not capture the public interest. You know, Congress is
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:05.260]   embroiled in a debt crisis, in an economic crisis. All of the news channels when they
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:10.260]   cover Congress and I've been watching carefully over the last few days cover that. They don't
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:17.780]   mention SOPA and PIPA. So it's up to us to spread the word to everybody. Let them know
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:21.260]   and then have them call Congress and put this on the front burner. And I have to say, we
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:26.460]   cannot count on mainstream media. I was just watching CNN and who's on CNN to talk about
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:31.380]   this. Remember CNN is owned by Time Warner, Warner Brothers films, Ring of Bell and the
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:37.060]   Motion Picture Association of America's Head, the former Senator Christad is on saying,
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:41.140]   this is going to, you know, piracy costs jobs in Hollywood. This is, you know, we've
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:49.660]   got to pass this bill. And he's effectively calling this protest terrorism. So I think
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:57.060]   that it's very important that we, that we treat this with the urgency that it requires.
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:00.700]   Can we declare victory, Trevor?
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:07.820]   We lost his. We lost him. We're trying to call him. We think Skype is taking a day off.
[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:12.340]   That's fine. Look at Google.com. I've got it up on my site. It's, that is, that is
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:17.660]   great. And right there, tell Congress, please don't censor the web, the link on the front.
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:26.580]   And that's the petition. And they have 14 million signatures so far. I hope this gives
[01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:36.060]   people a feeling of power. I think, I hope this, I hope this tells people actually four
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:42.380]   million, not 14 million signatures. I hope this tells people that we can make a difference.
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:49.820]   And I hope that people realize that this is not over. All this does is, is, is send the
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:56.620]   RIAA and the MPAA back into the trenches. They're going to figure out a way to do this more
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:03.100]   gradually, more secretively. Now you understand why the ACTA treaty was, was being pushed in
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:10.580]   secret. They know that people don't want this. We got him back. So, so my question to you,
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:15.980]   Trevor, was can we declare victory today? Oh, no, definitely not. I mean, this today
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:21.700]   has been great. The problem is that the Senate is still scheduled to vote on this bill, protect
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:26.860]   IP next week. And the House has indicated that they're going to continue marking up the
[01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:32.780]   bill in February. So the fight is far from over. We have to remember, we started with
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:39.100]   the DACs stacked against us because Hollywood had outspent the internet 13 to 1 in Congress.
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:45.740]   This bill was basically dropped on Congress's front doorstep by the music and movie industries.
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:50.020]   They wrote the whole thing with no input from these internet companies at all. And, you
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:55.740]   know, when you hear this bill will stop online piracy and you don't really read into it,
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:18:01.300]   you know, who's against that, right? The senators who, who originally signed on and there was
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:06.220]   over 40 of them, which is almost unprecedented for co-sponsors, never really read through
[01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:10.740]   the bill. They didn't understand how, how much free speech it would censor and how many
[01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:16.220]   ordinary users who've never really thought about copyright infringement, it would affect.
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:21.980]   So now that they're seeing this pushback and it's honestly massive and unprecedented,
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:26.380]   I mean, four million signatures on petition in less than a day is, I've never heard of
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:31.220]   that. You know, they're starting to wake up and understand what they initially signed
[01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.060]   up for is not what they thought.
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:37.580]   Well, Trevor, I know you've got a lot to do today and there's a lot more to do. I encourage
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:44.100]   everybody to visit EFF.org and read up on the bills. I mean, getting, it's more than just
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:48.380]   casting your vote or calling your member of Congress. You need to know, you need to understand
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:54.340]   why this is a bad idea so that you can argue effectively with friends and family who say,
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:59.500]   but piracy is a bad thing. We've got to stop piracy. They need to understand why this doesn't
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:08.220]   work. And this is, it's up to all of us as, as educated geeks to take action, geeks tend
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:13.500]   to like to sit on our duffs and enjoy life in our gadgets. Well, we want to preserve
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:20.020]   what we enjoy and that's, this is time to act. EFF.org, Trevor, thank you so much for
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:21.780]   coming on. We really appreciate it.
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:23.620]   Yeah, thanks for happening. Appreciate it.
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:29.020]   And EFF.org/action is the action page on EFF. That's fantastic. Just really.
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:32.300]   Yeah, or you can go to blacklist.eff.org as well.
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:35.820]   Oh, I like that. All right. Thank you, Trevor.
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:36.820]   Thank you.
[01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:40.780]   Trevor, Tim, an activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
