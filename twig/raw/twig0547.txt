[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   It's time for this week in Google. I'm Jason Howe. We've got Anne Pruitt, Jeff Jarvis and Kevin Tofel.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   And we've got a lot of news to talk about the effects of coronavirus on the greater tech industry.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   And what's going to happen to the tech industry? We don't actually know.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   But we have some guesses. That's up next.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Also, Android 11 developer preview launched, dropped right before the show.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   I was able to get it installed on my Pixel 3a.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   And we show that off and talk a little bit about some of the upcoming features.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   High-end Chromebooks, whether they deserve to be a thing.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Foldable phones, whether they deserve to be a thing.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Lots of stuff that Google killed and a whole lot more next on this week in Google.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   This week in Google is brought to you from LastPass Studios.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Securing every access point in your company doesn't have to be a challenge.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   LastPass unifies access and authentication to make securing your employees simple and secure.

[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   This is Twig.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   This is Twig. This week in Google, episode 547 recorded on Wednesday, February 19, 2020.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Google Glass Bagel Rat.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   This episode of This Week in Google is brought to you by Mint Mobile.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   They provide the same premium network coverage you're used to,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   but at a fraction of the cost because everything is online.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Mint Mobile makes it easy to cut your wireless build down to just $15 a month
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   with their three-month introductory plan.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And get the plan shipped to your door for free at Mint Mobile.com/Twig.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   It's time for Twig.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   This week in Google, I'm Jason Howell, filling in for Leo.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Leo is not here today, but I always enjoy being able to jump onto the Twig panel.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   So thank you for allowing me to take over for one magical week.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Joining me as always while here in the studio.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   He's also very spiffy.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I don't know about spiffy. I didn't even iron this shirt.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I think the difference is your shirt doesn't have words on it.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Oh, right. That's what it is.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   It doesn't say dominate or where's the barbell?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I always know what your intention is because I read your shirt and today I have nothing.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I have no idea what to do now.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I didn't wear my no shirt today. That's true.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I'm happy you didn't do that.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And basically that means you're going to say yes to everything today.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Also joining us, Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Jeff, how are you, sir?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I should have worn this shirt.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Oh, look at that.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We call that branding.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   The Leonard Tau Professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark graduate school of journalism.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I'm a professor at the University of New York and so much more.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Take a breath.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   That's the abridged version of that.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Yes.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Oh, there we are.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Okay, you can read it on your screen if you're really about it.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I love that the readers in the show.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I love that that's a graphic that's just on hand for this show.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Great to see Jeff also joining us.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Stacey Higginbotham, of course, is out this week in her place.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Kevin Tofill.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   How's it going, Kevin?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It's going well.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I have much to say on my lower third.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I'm not like Jeff, but I do have words in my shirt.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   You do have words in your shirt and they are appropriate to this show.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   They are applicable.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It says, "Go, go, ogle?"
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Is that what it is?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Now I see.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Now I see.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And I have to say, I'm super jealous.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I did not know until this morning that Stacey is in my favorite place in the world right now.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Where is she?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   She's on vacation.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   She's in Scottsdale, Arizona.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   You're in Arizona, guys.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   You're a sun devil.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   That's right.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   That's right.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Do you envision somewhere in your future moving to Arizona going to where the...
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   In about 30 years?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   In 40 years?
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   No, no.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Well, it'll be an oceanfront property by then.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.240]   But we actually went out there in 2014 to go buy a house and we had lots of options and
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.280]   we were ready to put on some offers and we had our house in the market in Pennsylvania.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.400]   We couldn't get any takers for what we needed to make the deal close.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.720]   So we decided to wait until 2018, which came and went because now my daughter is going
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.080]   to a state university here in Pennsylvania, so I'm not going to leave here now.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.360]   But I go out there to Arizona once every one to two years for some Cardinals games, may
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.880]   as you basketball and whatnot.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.880]   So I love it out there.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.880]   So I'm like, work on your son.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.880]   Yeah, work on your son.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.760]   I'm in Arizona very briefly, but I'll have to go back.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.920]   I do like the heat.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.840]   I don't know if I'm going to be the person that retires to a place like Arizona, but I
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.200]   do enjoy being able to go to the heat and kind of roast in the sunshine.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.440]   We kind of like that.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.960]   Some people don't like that.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.200]   I don't understand you people.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.600]   Well, I mean, you can always layer up when it's cold, but you can't get no lower than
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.600]   buck.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.600]   You know what?
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   That does not.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   That just doesn't work for me.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.840]   I'd rather just be hot all the time.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.840]   I don't know.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.840]   Everybody's different.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.840]   What a weirdo.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.720]   Hey, take me as I am.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.200]   I'll find a shirt that has some words to give you the next time.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.800]   Some choice words at that.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   Well played.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.800]   So let's see here.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.960]   Should we start with coronavirus, this Chipper topic that's right at the top of the dock?
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.480]   And I think here, I mean, there's a number of stories here in the dock, but I think the
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.480]   overarching question that at least relates to this show is that the coronavirus, the spread
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.200]   of the coronavirus seems to be having some pretty interesting and dramatic impacts on
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.520]   the world of technology.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.600]   Last week, I believe you spoke on the show.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.200]   You talked about the cancellation of Mobile World Congress.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   Right.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.840]   It happened right before we went on there.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.840]   It happened right before.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.280]   So that was big news last week, still big news because I think the reverberations of
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.040]   that are going to be interesting as we enter Mobile World Congress week.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.040]   Right.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.040]   Because some...
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.360]   So Jason, let me ask you, we asked this in the last week.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.040]   Does Mobile World Congress ever return, Mr. Android?
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.400]   I mean, okay, I should say I've never been to Mobile World Congress, so I've not been
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.400]   there.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.400]   I don't have any direct involvement.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.280]   But does the industry need it?
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.120]   From my outsider's perspective looking in, I think it returns.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.920]   I don't think this is the end of Mobile World Congress.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.160]   I know a lot of people are talking right now about like, well maybe this is the kick
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.600]   in the pants companies needed to realize they don't need these events after all.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.280]   And they're going to kind of go inward or do a different strategy.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.280]   I don't see that happening.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.400]   That makes sense for the big budget folks.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.400]   Sure.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.240]   But not the small guy that's trying to find that network of buyers and get their product
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   out there.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.240]   So yeah.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.240]   The same songs in the Huawei's of the world, they'll be fine.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.240]   They can do their own events.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.040]   But the smaller players, they don't have really their own platform.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.760]   They don't have enough people to come and see these events, whether they're online or
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.760]   not.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.440]   And Mobile World Congress isn't just phones.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.320]   It's also telecom equipment, which is a pretty big deal.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.120]   There's really no other big show for that.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.680]   So I don't see it going away.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.680]   Lots of IoT stuff.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.760]   Tons of it.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:23.160]   It might, you know, maybe it's possible that GSMA decides to do Mobile Congress in a different
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.160]   place.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.680]   Like maybe it's not Barcelona, although even that I kind of find.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.680]   That's not the issue.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.680]   Barcelona wasn't the issue at all.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.240]   It was just that there were a lot of companies in Asia that had to come in.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.240]   Right.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.240]   Right.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.240]   Right.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.040]   But I think a lot of people are looking at this as like an opportunity to change things
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.920]   up like, oh, well, if it's not happening then, then maybe it's resurgence.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.960]   If there is one at all, maybe it, you know, ends up in a different location or whatever.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.680]   GSMA will move that event if it's a benefit to their wallets.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.120]   I mean, it's just like anybody else who's going to give us the break, you know, who's
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.480]   going to help us make this thing more financially feasible for us.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.480]   I don't have to imagine.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.480]   Scottsdale, Arizona.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.480]   Scottsdale.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.480]   [laughter]
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.920]   Drone the dice on that one.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.280]   We'll see how far that gets us.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.480]   I thought you were thinking more like Shreveport, Louisiana for Mobile World Congress.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.480]   [laughter]
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.440]   That'll be a good fit, right?
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.120]   So we'll see what happens there.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:21.480]   I think now we're also, I had heard that Microsoft, is it Microsoft was pulling out
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.480]   of RSA?
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.480]   It's not Microsoft.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.480]   IBM, not Microsoft.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:33.880]   IBM pulling out of RSA, Sony backing out of PAX East.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.280]   So there's like a lot of these independent threads going on right now.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.480]   Facebook has canceled its next conference.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.480]   So okay.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.480]   It hasn't, that's the marketing conference.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.480]   It hasn't canceled IO.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.800]   It's not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.480]   not not not just a smaller marketing.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.040]   Let me give you a fake.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.040]   Okay.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.720]   That would be any bigger than that.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   I know of another conference.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.720]   It hasn't canceled.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.720]   It hasn't been announced.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.720]   It was a little IO either.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.720]   Right, exactly.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.880]   Facebook would like to cancel IO if they could.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.880]   If they could.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.160]   There's another conference that I had coming up that it's not announced yet, so I won't
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.160]   say which one it was.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.040]   But Singapore is being canceled and told.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.040]   Okay.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.600]   The other thing is since so many things, so many electronics are made in China, you have
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.680]   to wonder what's going to happen to the supply chain, obviously.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.920]   I know this is this week in Google, but I believe Apple just announced that it's not
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:31.560]   going to meet its investor expectations because they're dealing with supply issues there.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.560]   Yep.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.560]   Yep.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.200]   Actually, it's in the rundown trend force released a report and they're basically looking at
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.040]   the potential impact of the coronavirus on tech manufacturing.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.840]   And they had a number of different areas that they looked at.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.400]   Smartphone production, they expect will decline 12% year over year to this quarter.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:55.960]   They'll see a major reduction in fiber optic supplies, which could affect 5G rollout.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:02.240]   DRAM and NAND flash markets apparently unaffected because of a lot of stockpiling going on there.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.800]   So those should be unaffected as a result.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:11.120]   Although it's affecting current video game technology, the next generation, which is
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.840]   expected to come out at the end of this year, they're saying as long as things with this
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.360]   outbreak are mitigated by the end of the quarter.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.960]   It shouldn't have a dramatic effect on these next-gen consoles.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.440]   Part of me wonders, that seems really fast for this to be mitigated by.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.920]   That's rapidly approaching.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.080]   So one could expect there to be a big impact there potentially.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:38.680]   And the biggest declines would be with smartwatches, laptops, smart speakers.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.760]   Yeah, so exactly what you're talking about, Kevin.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.440]   Yeah, as far as the video game consoles, well, you always have Stadia.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.440]   There's no console to buy.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.440]   Well, that's true.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.160]   Why do you need anything else?
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.040]   Google already gave you Stadia.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.040]   That's right.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.600]   All of this you're saying all coronavirus is a Google conspiracy?
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.960]   Is it all the way they're going to make Stadia succeed?
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.600]   Wow, they went a long way for that one.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   I didn't say that.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.600]   I didn't say that.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.400]   Well, they are all powerful.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.760]   Apparently so.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.240]   Oh boy.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:14.040]   Yeah, so long term, at least for this year and potentially beyond effects, this is going
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.680]   to make a big mark in a lot of earnings reports that we're going to see over the coming months.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.880]   I'm surprised we haven't seen the stock market because Apple, I just checked Apple.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.880]   It's up for the day.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.160]   You know, it's not really had a big hit.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.520]   I don't think anybody's taken a big equity hit yet.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.520]   Yet.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.400]   Well, isn't it just the fact that a lot of those big companies are pretty dad, gun resilient?
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.000]   They're going to bounce back.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   The larger companies.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   They're definitely whether that's storm better.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:47.680]   We talked about this last week, I think that with the tariff fears made them two years ago.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.680]   Some contingencies.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.600]   Made them diversify their supply chains a little more.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.160]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.680]   CNET has a report that's related.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.160]   I mean, someone had to all of this.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.600]   I had not seen this until right before the show.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:08.060]   Apparently, there's a company creating face masks that are face ID compatible because it
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.360]   prints your face on the bottom portion.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.360]   Now, this is how you capitalize.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.360]   This is creepy.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.600]   This is this is this is pretty creepy.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.760]   It's creepy, but that's how you capitalize.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.760]   Right.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.760]   Apparently.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.760]   I mean, look at that.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.760]   That's just weird.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.760]   That's the American way on their sites.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.480]   They said, is it a joke?
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.480]   Yes and no.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.000]   I mean, you're going to want to wear a face mask.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.640]   So you might as well wear our face masks with your face on.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.640]   Wow.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.200]   That one mask looks really similar to my face.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.200]   Wow.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.200]   Wow.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.620]   I mean, this is this is also a way for us to try on other people's faces.
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.620]   You know, see?
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.620]   Half-horse.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.920]   Isn't there a movie that did that?
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.920]   Look at that.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.820]   That looks really similar to me.
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:51.820]   Face off.
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.820]   That was the movie.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.820]   There it is.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.820]   It's off.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.820]   Apparently, these are $40.
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.820]   So if you want to get one.
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.820]   They're not making them yet.
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.860]   You can get on the mailing list to find out when they'll start.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.860]   Oh, that's right.
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.860]   No official launch.
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.700]   They don't want to they don't want to use up face best.
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.700]   People actually made me.
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.700]   Well, that's OK.
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:08.700]   Thank you.
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.700]   And they just invented them like last week.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.700]   It's a good one.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.700]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.700]   It's basically in the oh, that would be a cool thing.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:15.700]   A cool idea.
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.540]   I'm surprised it's not Kickstarter, but that's fine.
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.540]   Yes, totally.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.540]   It will be, I'm sure.
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.980]   An indiegogo or something along those lines.
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.260]   All right.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:30.260]   Any final thoughts on the coronavirus, comfefe, whatever they call this?
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.700]   Well, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, very important.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.980]   There is have any impact on Chromebook Galaxy deliveries?
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.980]   Well, that is important.
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.900]   Well, you're jumping way down the notes now.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.900]   Just not just everything I see everything.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.900]   You're here by Chromebook.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:45.900]   God is here.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.900]   Everything.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.580]   Now in the light of Chromebooks, there's a lot.
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.580]   You know how we call it?
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.420]   We have the local angle.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.340]   This is the local angle of my head.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.340]   I hear you.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.340]   I hear you.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.340]   So, OK.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:03.660]   So earlier today, I noticed thanks to actually one of the about Chromebooks readers.
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:09.780]   That Best Buy has a release date for the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook.
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.180]   That release date is currently April the 6th.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.140]   I did reach out to Samsung to confirm that about eight hours ago.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.020]   I have not heard back.
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.740]   You know, Jeff, Samsung is based in South Korea.
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.020]   They do the manufacturing there predominantly.
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.500]   Do we know?
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.860]   That's actually a really good question.
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.980]   I mean, from a lot of their memory chips and so on, yes.
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:39.420]   As far as their laptop/chromebook production, I'm going to go with probably because I don't
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.980]   see them outsourcing that.
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.860]   I really don't.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.060]   So I don't think there's going to be any impact there.
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:51.740]   But of course, things can change as we know with the coronavirus on a daily basis.
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.780]   More interesting probably to you and many other people.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:15:00.900]   I noticed on the official Galaxy Chromebook site today, they have network connectivity
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.220]   of LTE.
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:07.220]   And I'm waiting to hear back from Samsung on that as well.
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:14.940]   And my thought is that at CES, they announced the base model for $999 over the top machine
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:15.980]   as it is.
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.300]   But you could always get more memory, more storage, et cetera.
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:24.860]   So I'm thinking that if you go up from the base model, they may be offering an LTE option.
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.700]   They've said nothing officially about any other models only that you can specify after
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:34.700]   the base model up to 16 gig of RAM and one terabyte of storage.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.900]   So first time I've seen them mention LTE.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:38.900]   So we'll see.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.300]   There's no place on the higher levels, right?
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.060]   Just the base price.
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.220]   Just the base price right now.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.220]   That's correct.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.220]   Wow.
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.660]   So you're towards the color.
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.660]   So apparently, Jeff, I'm getting all on the spicy red.
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.660]   Fiesta.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.660]   Fiesta red.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:58.740]   It's I spent a half an hour with that device at CES and it's gorgeous.
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:15:59.740]   It's bold.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:00.740]   That's spicy.
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.460]   Now you got me saying it's spicy red.
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.820]   The Fiesta red is very bold.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.980]   You can get minerals, right?
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:05.980]   It's kind of boring.
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.660]   It's the same old same old.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.900]   It's just such an incredibly thin device.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.140]   I mean, it's really worth it.
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.140]   You had the keyboard travel you're okay with?
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.140]   I'm okay with that.
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.140]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.620]   You know, you know, England guys that that look more like orange to me.
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.060]   Do you have your pixel on you?
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.060]   Yes.
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.780]   Yeah, because the pixel like I'm looking at the Samsung color and then I'm looking at
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.740]   the your pixel, which is a little washed out right there.
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:28.740]   There you go.
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:29.740]   There you go.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.620]   It's it's redder in person.
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.620]   Redder person.
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.780]   It's kind of hard to capture on camera, especially at CES with a terrible lighting.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.780]   Oh, it's lighting.
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.780]   Totally.
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.020]   But yeah, I mean, it's it's toppled a line without a doubt.
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.340]   So shouldn't have to wait too much longer.
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.340]   Okay.
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.220]   So we know Jeff's going to get this, especially if there's an LTE option.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:53.420]   Can I let me ask let me ask about that because I don't understand Jeff as a Chromebook user,
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.260]   not as user of Chromebooks.
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:00.380]   But Jeff, what's the obsession with having like the most expensive Chromebook because
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:04.140]   this has almost a desktop class processor in it.
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.980]   And you don't need that for browsing and, you know, basic use.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.980]   So I'm just curious.
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:08.980]   Oh, jeez.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:09.980]   Are you my wife?
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:14.580]   I mean, he is I was gonna say he's almost just sort of talking smack about you.
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:15.580]   Yeah.
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:16.580]   No, no, no, no.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:17.580]   It's a question I've always wanted to ask.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:18.580]   I mean, don't get me wrong.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.020]   He's basically just like you're not a power user.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.020]   Why do you think it is?
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:27.980]   What does a high end Mac cost now?
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:28.980]   10,000.
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.420]   Yeah, I was depending on how high.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.220]   $50,000 expensive.
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.460]   A top end, a good Mac book.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.460]   What does it cost?
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.460]   I don't know.
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.460]   About $25.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.460]   Yeah.
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.460]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.460]   Anyhow, $25 to $45.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.460]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.460]   This is the device I use constantly all day.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.460]   I live on it.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:56.700]   I have lots of tabs.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.580]   I like the speed.
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.700]   I've worked with the earlier machines so I know how they can slow down.
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.420]   So it is possible to slow down.
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.620]   So I live with that kind of fear.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.980]   I'm old enough to remember a fan on a Chromebook.
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:09.980]   Thank you.
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:10.980]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:11.980]   Yeah.
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:19.500]   So, and you know, this machine, my Chromebook pixels, my Pixel books is still wonderful.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.180]   But as I've said, I bang it up a fair amount.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.780]   I'm just afraid it's going to die.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:25.780]   All right.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.780]   Sure.
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:27.780]   But that's just excuse.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.780]   I fully admit it.
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:29.780]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.780]   No, I don't.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.780]   Anybody on this show?
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.860]   What's the latest, biggest, bestest thing?
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.100]   Because we're men and we, that's what we do.
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.460]   And I don't have a Corvette.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.300]   I have a Chromebook and it's very sad.
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.300]   That's fair.
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.300]   That's fair.
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:47.300]   I only raised the question because, you know, a couple of years ago, I, Pixelbook was it.
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.300]   Right?
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.300]   That's all you had.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:54.180]   There's, there's a broad range of high-end devices that, yeah, some of them cost just
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.180]   as much as this.
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.100]   Some of them you can get for $600, $700.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:04.100]   You know, I mean, I have one right now with a Core i5, more of a desktop class type processor
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:09.100]   in it with 16 giga ram and it was like 820 bucks.
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.100]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.100]   I know.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.900]   Well, the other thing is the, the, the flip display, whatever you call it officially.
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.900]   Two and one.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.900]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.900]   Sure.
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.900]   What?
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.500]   Well, yeah, right.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.300]   Um, whatever it's called officially.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.700]   Uh, the weird thing is, this is yours.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.700]   That's what it's called.
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.700]   Somebody else.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.700]   That was a good one.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:32.300]   I used, here's why I use that in takeoff and landing on planes.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.300]   Oh, no, it's not a laptop.
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.300]   It's a tablet.
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.300]   Oh, that works.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.300]   That works.
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.300]   Loop.
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.300]   Yeah.
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.300]   No reason.
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.300]   I get it.
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.300]   I get it.
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.300]   Hey, I like that one.
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.300]   I've never seen that before.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.300]   That's been hiding in the Tricaster.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.300]   Do that again.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.300]   That was good.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.300]   That was impressive.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.300]   That was impressive.
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.300]   Off the air.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.300]   We just became a laptop.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.500]   The Holy cow.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.820]   I can't believe my eyes.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.700]   I was like, wow, Kevin, did you just make that up on the fly?
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.700]   That's, that's why he's pushing buttons instead of me.
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:04.700]   Got it.
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.700]   Okay.
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:06.700]   Now we know what was the missing.
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.700]   That's why he deserves Kevin Cam.
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.700]   That was impressive.
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.700]   That was impressive.
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.260]   He's at mastery at work.
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.260]   Now, okay.
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:18.220]   So the pixel book, there are over, there have been, or actually, well, okay, let me
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.220]   back up here.
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.220]   Let me actually talk English, speak English.
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.500]   I can't talk suddenly.
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.940]   I never mind that give up.
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:32.500]   What I'm trying to say is, are there many Chromebooks that are more than a thousand dollars?
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.740]   It would be this one by Samsung and it would be the pixel book.
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.180]   Isn't that there, meaning?
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.180]   There's not that many, right?
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.700]   Like I'm doing a series online and there's like high, high three digits, but.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.820]   So, so there are two by Dell that are really enterprise focused.
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.420]   You can spend over two grand on those, quite honestly.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.420]   Oh, really?
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.420]   Yes.
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.420]   Yes.
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.620]   They came out probably two or three months ago.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.140]   But it's not a consumer device.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.820]   You're not going to buy them even though they don't, you know, there's nothing different
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:03.260]   about them physically or anything like that.
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.060]   It's the latitudes.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:10.540]   They took their, I think it was their 71, 30 and I forget which ones they are.
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.500]   But I mean, I don't write about them that much because again, it's a niche kind of thing
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.500]   inside of a niche.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:16.500]   I'm going to try a side.
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.500]   Oh God.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.500]   Yeah.
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.500]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:26.660]   So, and then, well, don't forget at CES also the ASUS Chromebook Flip C436.
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.540]   Now that starts at 7.99.
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.820]   Very similar to the Samsung.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.180]   Also looks very nice.
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.980]   You can spec that up as well.
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.180]   The pre-order page was up and then it came down.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:42.020]   But while it was up, I saw that the next model up is 9.99.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.140]   So that's getting up there.
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.140]   Wow.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.140]   Yeah.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.260]   So that was from Acer or ASUS?
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.100]   That was from ASUS.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.220]   And then I have the Acer and if you go hog while on the Acer and configure it all the
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.620]   way to the top, it's $1,500.
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:57.620]   Okay.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:58.620]   All right.
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.180]   So they're not really alone.
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:05.020]   I'm just curious to know how many people are actually buying Chromebooks in that price
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.460]   range.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:12.100]   I would enjoy having a Chromebook that's capable of that.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:16.100]   But I don't know how many people like that's part of their use case.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.780]   Is part of it just kind of like you're already all in on Chrome OS.
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:25.780]   So and you don't mind spending a lot of money on a laptop in general.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.860]   So you might as well spend a lot of money on a Mac.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:28.860]   Just how much?
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:34.220]   I guess the question is how much is all in on Chrome OS that ecosystem?
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.540]   You don't spend a lot there.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.220]   That's the other thing.
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.220]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.220]   You're right.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.820]   You've got to spend all this virus protectors and all that junk.
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:44.820]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.820]   That's true.
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:46.820]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.820]   Yeah.
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.780]   See, for me, it's a very specific use case.
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:55.180]   And that is the coding classes and the applications that I'm writing on my own.
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.180]   You different IDs?
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.180]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.740]   You know, Android Studio alone is a hefty beast.
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:06.220]   And Google recommends, you know, that you have like a Core i5 use series processor,
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:10.420]   which is one step up from what the Pixelbook had, not had a Y series.
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.420]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.980]   I mean, I just literally just wrote a post last week about can you get through a computer
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:19.700]   science program in college with a Chromebook and I outlined all the apps that I use and
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:24.300]   the device that I bought, why I bought it with 16 gig of RAM and so on and so forth.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.140]   But again, most people are not buying those.
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.140]   No.
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.140]   Do people use the clips?
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.140]   Sorry.
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.140]   Sorry.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.140]   Yeah.
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.140]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.540]   Hella J, Visual Code, Android Studio.
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.540]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.540]   People still use the clips.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:39.540]   Where are you?
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.420]   The other key is going to be I saw a post this week and I can't remember where it was.
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.420]   So I can't remember.
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.020]   But somebody was trying to find good video editing.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:52.340]   And so they finally found some free actually on Linux on the Chromebook.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.340]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:57.340]   There's a couple of video editors on Linux.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.580]   There's a couple of photo editors too.
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:04.900]   I mean, you can do everything that you need to do if you've edited video and photos, but
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:10.020]   you have to be comfortable with the non-name brand type, you know, open source applications.
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:17.900]   But that's also you're telling people to jump into the Linux OS, which is not everybody's
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.660]   cup of tea.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:20.820]   Yeah.
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:21.820]   I agree.
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:26.540]   But the trick is it's kind of hidden and it's like you enable Linux.
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.500]   Linux is installed when you enable it, you flip a switch on your Chromebook and then you
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.500]   have it.
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.500]   It's just there.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.500]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:37.780]   You may need to go into the command line and learn how to download and install an app.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.380]   You start telling people pseudo app get and they look at you as if you just-
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:42.380]   Sure.
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.380]   Talking outside of your neck, you know.
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.380]   Right.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.820]   But you do that one time and to be honest, you can actually download a package manager
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.620]   or AKA type app store.
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.620]   Right.
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.620]   It's visual.
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.220]   It's got a GUI and you can just pick and choose.
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:59.380]   And to be honest, even if you don't want to go the command line route, if the software
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:05.580]   you're looking for is available in a download specifically for Debian Linux, which is pretty
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:11.180]   popular, a distro of Linux, you can download the .deb file and then in the files app of
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:15.660]   your Chromebook, the native files app, right click and one of the options is install on
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:16.860]   Linux and it doesn't really.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:17.860]   I didn't know that.
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:18.860]   That's cool.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:19.860]   I didn't know that.
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:20.860]   Oh, cool.
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.860]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:27.700]   So you use the command line if you can download a .deb package file, which you would just download
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.700]   through Chrome OS.
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.820]   I mean, that's it.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.820]   That's pretty damn cool.
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.820]   It's not as scary as you might think.
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:35.820]   Trust me.
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:40.300]   Well, I've seen some of the video editors and photo editors on the Linux side.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:48.700]   I used to play with one called Shotwell for photos and video was open shot and open
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:53.020]   shot was really nice and could compare to the likes of DaVinci or Premiere Chrome.
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.580]   I would love to have you do a story on you.
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:56.580]   There it is.
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.580]   Prekey now.
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:03.700]   In Chrome book for photo and photo also video, but you know, since you're high end photo,
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.700]   you'd have to really find the thing that could really work well on it.
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.700]   Yeah, NASA thing.
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:13.140]   I'd have to dive back in because I left that stuff behind several years ago.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.140]   Right.
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.500]   But I'm sure it's better now.
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.500]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.500]   And that's the thing.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.500]   I'd like to see it now.
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:23.860]   It's not really being pretty comparable to some regular video editors.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.980]   But again, it was like trying to tell people, "Hey, you need to reverse install a boom
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.580]   two or a Linux Mint or whatever."
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.420]   And they go, "No, that ends up being a Roblox."
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.420]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.420]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.420]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.420]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.420]   It's definitely a big barrier.
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.260]   I totally get that.
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:44.220]   But the flip side isn't because people, when I wrote that article about getting through
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.660]   college or the Chromebook, they're like, "But you're not using Chrome OS."
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:47.660]   I'm like, "So?"
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.700]   I'm using a native built-in feature of Chrome OS, which happens to be Linux.
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:52.700]   Right.
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:53.780]   Just like Android is built in.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.340]   So what does it matter?
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.580]   If it does what I need, who cares?
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:58.580]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.580]   Exactly.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.580]   All right.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:01.580]   So I'm curious now.
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.580]   I need to get a new Chrome.
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.060]   For Sorenmacho, geeked them here.
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:10.380]   I'm eager to hear Dr. Android's experience with Android 11.
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.380]   Okay.
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.380]   That's right.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.380]   How about that's the tease.
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.380]   Let's think.
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.380]   Okay.
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:22.420]   And then when we come back, we're going to dive into the new, like, fresh off the presses
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:28.260]   release of the first developer preview of Android 11 or Android R, if you want to call
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.820]   it that.
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.860]   But Google really isn't even calling it that.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.980]   But I did get it installed on Pixel 3a.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.220]   It took me a while.
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.060]   We'll talk all about it.
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.100]   Before we do that, let's thank the sponsor this episode of This Week in Google is brought
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.980]   to you by Mint Mobile.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:48.140]   Mint Mobile is actually the provider that I use in my Pixel 4 XL.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.980]   I have a Mint Mobile SIM installed on my phone.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:58.860]   I have my, what used to be my Google, my, why am I suddenly blanking?
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.820]   My Google SIM card.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.620]   Why am I blank?
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.420]   Today is not my day.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.420]   Fine.
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.420]   Thank you.
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.260]   It's such a long name to remember.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.500]   It's two letters.
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.460]   Like I can't remember two letters.
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.700]   Because Mint has erased it from remembering.
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.700]   True.
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:15.700]   You have no need for it now.
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.700]   No longer.
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:17.700]   Because you have Mint.
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.700]   That's the beauty.
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.260]   Once you put Mint Mobile on your phone, you'll forget everything else in your life.
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.700]   All that matters is Mint Mobile.
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.700]   Geez.
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.700]   All right.
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.940]   If you're still using one of the big wireless providers this year, you should ask yourself
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.300]   what you're actually paying for.
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.780]   You're probably paying for expensive retail stores.
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.980]   They have some sort of a store that they got to make the money to keep the lights on
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:45.460]   and those doors inflated prices, hidden fees, all these things mean that you might actually
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.780]   be being taken advantage of because they know you're going to pay.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.660]   This is how most people, especially here in the US, is how most people get their cellular
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.660]   coverage.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.940]   Enter Mint Mobile because Mint Mobile does it completely differently.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:03.140]   They provide the same premium network coverage that you're used to, but at a fraction of
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.580]   the cost because everything is online.
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:10.340]   Mint Mobile saves on retail locations and overhead because they don't have those things.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:15.380]   They don't have a retail store that you can walk into that they need to pay for everything
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.180]   that's included within that store.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:24.060]   They pass that savings on to you and really keeps it easy.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.660]   We're used to living our lives on the internet.
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.380]   That's what Mint Mobile is all about.
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.740]   It's providing you this coverage, making it easy for you to sign up online.
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:36.660]   It was super easy for me to port my number from Google Fi over to Mint Mobile.
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:41.860]   It actually happened super quickly and all my calls just started coming in, streaming
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.380]   into the Mint Mobile Sim and I have a look back.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:49.220]   Mint Mobile makes it easy to cut your wireless build down to just $15 a month with their
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.060]   three-month introductory plan.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:58.260]   Every plan comes with unlimited nationwide talk and text and you'll also stop paying
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.300]   for unlimited data that you'll never use when you're using Mint Mobile.
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:08.340]   You can choose between plans with three, eight or twelve gigs of 4G LTE data.
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:12.900]   I happen to have the 12 gig plan and I never come even close to that, but that's what I
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.900]   have.
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.620]   Use your own phone with any Mint Mobile plan and keep your same phone number along with
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.060]   all of your existing contacts.
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.260]   Again, that's exactly what I did.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.540]   You can ditch your old wireless build, your old wireless provider, whether you can remember
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:30.140]   the name of it or not, ditch it and start saving with Mint Mobile.
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:34.340]   To get your new wireless plan for just $15 a month with their three-month introductory
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:41.100]   plan and get the plan shipped to your door for free, all you got to do is go to mintmobile.com/twig.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.860]   That's mintmobile.com/twig.
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:50.180]   Do that and you'll cut your wireless build to $15 per month with their three-month introductory
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.180]   plan.
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:56.620]   Mobile.com/twig and we thank them for their support and for understanding that sometimes
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.380]   I just have a brain fart that makes me forget things.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:03.540]   No, it was all of those command line entries from Android 11.
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.540]   Thank you and that's exactly what it was.
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.500]   That's exactly what it was.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.900]   So I get into work this morning.
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:15.700]   I'm like, "All right, I've got three solid hours to get ready for this twig show."
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:21.060]   Then I open up my news and I see that Android 11 has been released, the developer preview.
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.060]   You were on all that.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:26.100]   It was like, "Okay, well now I know what I'm doing for the next however long it takes
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.020]   me to install this dang thing.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:33.420]   I've done this so many times and yet for me, just like speaking, it never gets easier."
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.420]   No.
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.500]   Just like saying two letter words, it never gets easier.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:38.500]   But I got there.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:44.220]   So I spent some time installing it and I wish I had a whole lot to show you, show off with
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.220]   Android 11.
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.220]   This is Android 11.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.220]   That's going to work right there.
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.220]   It's pretty good.
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:54.540]   So here, let me scroll up so that I make sure I don't get anything important here.
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.020]   So the preview is out.
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:00.820]   The only way that you can get the Android 11 preview installed right now is by downloading
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.660]   the OTA or the factory image.
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:10.140]   There is no opting in at this point for the automatic download via the beta channel, which
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.300]   will be an option eventually.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.700]   But right now, it's so early.
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:20.700]   This is actually a month earlier than last year's Android 10 first developer preview
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:21.700]   release.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:25.740]   So we're even a month earlier, which makes me wonder if that's going to change the release
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.460]   state at all or what's going to happen.
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.980]   Makes me wonder if your phone is going to blow up.
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:30.980]   Could right now.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:31.980]   Very well could.
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:32.980]   But you know what?
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:37.260]   It's a Pixel 3A that I had hanging around and I was like, "You know what?
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:41.140]   I'm not going to put this on my Pixel 4 XL.
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.660]   So I've got it on here instead.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.660]   So the safe route."
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.260]   The SDK is also in Android Studio.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.980]   And that's really what this is all about.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:53.740]   This is about developers playing around with some of the new features, kind of understanding
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:58.700]   what they're all about, getting their apps prepared and ready and all that stuff.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:03.340]   The original Pixel and the original Pixel XL are not going to get Android 11.
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:06.940]   So we know that at this point, I don't think so.
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:12.140]   But I think people should definitely get updates in December 2019, right?
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.140]   I believe so.
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.460]   Yeah, they got updates longer than I think they were supposed to anyways.
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.260]   But Android 11 is not coming to the Pixel.
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:25.460]   I'm sure there will be some developers that do the magic work to bring it over anyways.
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.700]   We love devs.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:32.620]   So anyways, I mean, walking through Android 11, there's not a whole lot new to look at.
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:36.220]   Like you can see this says all apps instead of a line there separating.
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.940]   That's pretty minimal.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:41.300]   One of the new features is in the quick settings.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.740]   There is now an option to put in a screen record feature.
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.260]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:51.060]   This is embedded into the OS at least at this stage and mind you, with developer previews,
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.060]   anything can change.
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.980]   Yeah, that could be for debugging.
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:54.980]   Couldn't it?
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:55.980]   Could be.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.540]   But I know that this has been something that they've been working on and it's kind of bounced
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.220]   back and forth previously.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:04.340]   And so now it's surfacing as an option for the quick tile setting.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:05.340]   So I could just tap it.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.940]   It says, are you sure you want to do that?
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.340]   Start now.
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:09.340]   And I am recording.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.340]   That would be great to have.
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:12.620]   Right out the box.
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:17.580]   Once I stop that, I believe it would appear in my notification screen recording.
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.780]   I could tap that to view the video that I just recorded.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:21.780]   And there we go.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.780]   Good day.
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:23.780]   That's kind of nice.
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:29.500]   I don't know if everybody has a use for screen recording, but yeah, I use that for tutorials.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:36.300]   If I'm trying to show someone how to do post processing in Lightroom or just whatever it
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.460]   is I'm doing creatively.
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:42.140]   I've done some screen recordings and put them up on YouTube or on Instagram or something
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:43.140]   like that.
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:47.980]   And it's just a way to really allow people to be immersed in the process.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:48.980]   Yeah.
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.980]   Yeah.
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.180]   So OK, so that's one thing I can show you.
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:59.940]   Another thing in the settings, if I go to do a search for dark mode or dark theme, let's
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:02.140]   see here, we'll go to dark theme.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:07.140]   Which I know is Jeff's favorite section of the event.
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:11.620]   Now you have the ability and the schedule to turn it on from a custom time.
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.700]   So you can set that up also from sunset to sunrise.
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:19.220]   So if you want it to automatically switch to dark mode as the sun starts to set, you
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.220]   can do that.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.220]   So yes.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.380]   Oh, yes.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.020]   So I wonder if the cabin is awesome.
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:28.820]   It might be synced up not with the light coming through the camera as is the case right
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:34.620]   now, but probably more so with the time of day and your time zone and everything.
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:40.140]   Pretty cool to have that as well as the blue filter feature that you can set up.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:44.180]   Yeah, you can set that too within digital well-being settings.
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.980]   You can put a schedule on that so it would happen at the same time.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:51.820]   So you can automate the dark theme on the system, which is kind of nice.
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.940]   What else can I show you?
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:54.940]   Oh, OK.
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:59.940]   So there's a lot of permissions work that is apparently happening, you know, continuing
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.260]   to happen with Android 11.
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.740]   Some of those permission changes.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:09.740]   One, it's going to prohibit apps from repeatedly asking for a single permission.
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:14.740]   So there have been times in the past where it will keep popping up this request and you
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:18.540]   know, you deny it and it's still like it's almost like it requires you to do it because
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.980]   it keeps asking.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.340]   Now it'll kind of give up.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.220]   It's like forces the apps to give up.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.300]   So that's nice.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.300]   One thing I can show you.
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.180]   So I have Yelp installed here.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.540]   Yelp says, OK, we're going to need your location.
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.580]   If I say, OK, I understand, I get this thing, which we've seen before.
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.700]   This message, allow Yelp to access this device's location.
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.180]   You get a new setting in here, only this time.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.540]   So it's a temporary setting now.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:44.980]   That's like, you know what?
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:50.260]   On just this open, I want Yelp to have access to my location.
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.780]   But the next time that I launched the app, I want that to be re-enigged and ask me again
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.540]   then.
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:01.020]   They made some really great changes last version around that, but they're adding more.
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:05.100]   I believe it was right now, allow it always.
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:10.580]   Or just when this app is open, was the phrase that it used in the past.
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:14.740]   But I like this being literally temporary, this time only, period.
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:15.740]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:16.740]   That's pretty sleep.
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.740]   Yeah, totally.
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:18.740]   It gives you a little bit more control.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:23.980]   I've turned on the brightness so things aren't so blindingly light for you.
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:27.780]   As far as things that I can really show you, I think the rest of the stuff is really kind
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:28.780]   of hidden.
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:33.780]   So the other thing, if I had received a message through a messenger, one of my notifications
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:37.820]   that would appear from there, it is labeled as conversation.
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:45.380]   So I think this, I don't know exactly why that is, but I think they're going to bundle,
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:49.100]   that means that they're going to be bundling messaging apps under a single notification
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.100]   tree.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.460]   We'll have the 87th Google messaging app.
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.460]   Oh boy.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.580]   You know, I mean, all 86 that came before.
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.540]   Embedded in the OS this time.
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.540]   Oh boy.
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:03.780]   I don't think it's a new type of messaging app, but it's just a way of organizing messaging
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:07.300]   app notifications into a conversations tier.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:13.100]   Do they have a setting in the notification settings that currently that will let you
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.060]   bundle or unbundle those things, I wonder?
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.060]   Let's see here.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.340]   If you've got a chance to look there.
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:21.980]   I know that the notification feature is called conversations.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:26.140]   I'm doing a search in settings for conversations they're starting to.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.460]   And these are apps and notifications assistance.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.900]   So these are both tied to assistance.
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.220]   So I don't think that's what we're looking for.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:39.020]   If we do bundles, because I do remember that notification bundling, but I'm not finding
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.820]   anything for that.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.260]   There is a way to get into settings for that though.
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.260]   Absent notifications.
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.820]   Let's see here.
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:52.340]   So notifications, system UI.
[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:58.460]   I feel like I'm probably not looking in the right zone, but there might be some way to
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:00.020]   bundle notifications.
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.740]   I know that was part of the previous version.
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.700]   I didn't really use it that much though.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.580]   So I swipe away so many notifications.
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.580]   Yeah.
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:08.580]   Look at nowadays.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.580]   Yeah.
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:15.100]   Outside of that, I think all the changes, at least at this point, this early point are
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.620]   not changes that are easy to show off.
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:24.500]   Like one of them is that project mainline has added another 12 updateable modules to the
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:25.500]   OS.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.700]   Now, if you remember, you guys remember mainline, this is kind of an extension of a project
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.860]   treble.
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:36.900]   It allows certain parts of the Android OS to be updateable without a full system wide
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.700]   update without like downloading a system in which an updating it.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.660]   So it's componentizing the OS.
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.900]   And that was a really big deal for last version of Android.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:47.900]   There were eight before.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.700]   Now there's a total of 20 modules that can be updated this way.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:58.140]   So more and more Google is kind of pulling out the aspects of Android that couldn't only
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:05.700]   be updated through an OS upgrade, of which manufacturers and carriers could kind of get
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:10.380]   in the way of that happening and users wouldn't end up getting those updates.
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:15.180]   Mainline allows for there to be kind of like a direct pipeline into updating certain aspects
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.340]   of the OS.
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:22.900]   So that it doesn't rely on them, on the carriers or the manufacturers making changes or allowing
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.900]   it to happen.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:28.180]   So that's I feel like any changes they make related to mainline are a big deal.
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.180]   That's pretty slick.
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:34.580]   And it looks like you're going to get one of these every month for the next five or six
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.580]   months.
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.060]   Yeah, the timeline.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.460]   Yes, exactly.
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:41.940]   So does it I don't know that I have that article in here.
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:45.100]   Does it give the timeline as far as like when the final version is supposed to release?
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.900]   I'm guessing like Q3.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:47.900]   It's all it is.
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.900]   Q3 right now.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:49.900]   Okay.
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:50.900]   All right.
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:54.900]   So, you know, obviously we're going to hear so much more about this as we head into Google
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.300]   I/O season and stuff.
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:01.940]   But I mean, there are there are other features support for electronic IDs.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:09.740]   So in the way that we use our smartphones for for mobile payments, there's going to be
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:15.300]   stuff built into Android 11 that allow for like digital drivers license.
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.220]   So you record, right?
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:22.380]   Yeah, I saw one of these if that's just what they're doing is grabbing the public data,
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.540]   some kind of way.
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.140]   But I feel like they have to secure it.
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.940]   There has to be some sort of security around that.
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:31.260]   And I think that's part of what they're what they're baking in here is kind of the official.
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.260]   They don't have to.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:33.260]   It would be nice if they did.
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.260]   That's true.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.260]   Fair.
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.620]   Very fair.
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:38.620]   That's true.
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.620]   I just think that Google wants to protect us.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:43.460]   But what do I know?
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:50.340]   Other permissions changes scoped storage, which was how apps would have isolated storage from
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.340]   other apps.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:54.940]   This is something that they tried to put into Android 10.
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:42:01.140]   And then developers got really upset because it kind of broke certain aspects of how their
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:04.380]   apps were reaching into storage data.
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:10.100]   And it really requires developers to rethink and reprogram their apps to support this new
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.340]   kind of paradigm.
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:16.340]   So Google went back on that, but they said, but warning you, Android 11, this is going
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.340]   to happen and everybody's going to be forced to do it.
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:20.380]   And sure enough, that's the plan for Android 11.
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:25.460]   I still worry, not worry, but I still have questions about the permission side of it.
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:30.540]   And I guess it's more in the consumers control instead of Google's control.
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:35.420]   And you mentioned the apps giving you the concept notification for a specific permission
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:41.020]   after you denied it several times when you opened it up previously.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:46.580]   And a lot of those apps will allege that, OK, our app just won't work until you activate
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.180]   this permission.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.940]   Google really can't do much about that other than what you were mentioning is they'll make
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:56.420]   that notification go away.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.820]   Is that the only control they have?
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:01.420]   Or is it more on the consumers' honest to just say, you know what, I'm just honest
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:03.220]   to all in this app?
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.340]   I mean, yeah, I don't know how that's going to play out.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:12.260]   If a consumer decides, I really don't want this app to have this permission and that
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.100]   permission is critical to the app functioning.
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.100]   I see it now.
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:17.100]   That's the difference.
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.660]   It's critical to the app functioning makes sense.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:26.220]   If I'm looking for a restaurant app or whatever, so it's probably going to need my location
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:29.100]   possibly.
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:34.980]   If I'm using a paintbrush app, that doesn't need my microphone.
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.620]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:42.740]   So if I keep denying that paintbrush app, the microphone, eventually I'm going to just
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.140]   get sick of it and uninstall it.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:49.380]   Or is that something Google can say, hey, look, stop people?
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:55.140]   I think that in the new permissions, and I only got a chance to really gloss over the
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.980]   Google page for the developer preview.
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:05.300]   If a consumer or a user says, after two times, you know, deny, deny, all future requests
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.460]   for the app would be considered deny.
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:11.860]   So they're trying to stop having you get pastored by this.
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.740]   Like you've made your choice and that's that.
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:14.740]   I'm almost positive.
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.540]   I saw that in the new permission settings.
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:17.540]   Okay.
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:18.540]   Yep.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.540]   I think I saw a couple of times as well.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:23.900]   And then at that point, as a user, this is where it gets a little complicated as a user
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.940]   because then once you've denied a couple of times, at a certain point, you might decide,
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:32.700]   I want this to work or you might not remember that you've denied it and then you go to use
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:33.700]   the thing and it's not working.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.540]   You're like, wait a minute, why isn't it working?
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:39.020]   Well, that's because you denied it a couple of times like two months ago, and you just
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.220]   forgot that you did that.
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:45.660]   Now you as a user have to remember to go into the settings, the actual user settings for
[00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:49.420]   that particular app, go into the permissions for that app and allow it.
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:54.220]   This is why everyone has the links on a Chromebook.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:57.340]   Every time it asks me, do you want to open this with this or this?
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.340]   Can I make a choice?
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:44:59.340]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:00.340]   And this is once or forever?
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.340]   I always say once.
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:02.340]   Yes, I know.
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:03.340]   I have to do it every single time.
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:04.340]   I don't want to.
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:05.340]   Because you never know.
[00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:06.340]   It's too much pressure.
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:07.340]   Yeah.
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.340]   Because you never know, I agree.
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.060]   Because sometimes I don't want to default to something that I just installed, even though
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:15.260]   I may like it, but every now and then it's just the creature of habit.
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.260]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:20.900]   When I went with Twitter, I said, I'm not right.
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:24.700]   It's just too much.
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.820]   I can't ever hit always.
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:35.060]   Someone please make a Jeff with Mr. Jarvis trying to make that decision.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.500]   And Jeff created, I'm sure.
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:42.100]   There's also a feature or will be a feature to mute notifications while you're recording
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:43.100]   a video.
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.940]   So if you have not that experience, we're recording a video with your phone and then
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:46.940]   notification comes through.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.180]   And then when you watch the video later, it's like you hear it.
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.060]   Like the loudest buzz in the world.
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:53.580]   Thank you.
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.500]   So that's a small, but I think a good change.
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.420]   Better biometric security support for developers.
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:05.620]   So I think I don't know much details about this, but I'm assuming more kind of.
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.700]   I added a couple more more.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.660]   Working in more stuff around different types of biometrics.
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:16.260]   So not just fingerprint, they've had a long time to perfect how Android relates with
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.020]   fingerprint security.
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:22.780]   But now, of course, with the Pixel 4, we've got this face unlock that's much more developed
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.060]   than the face unlock that have come before it on Android.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:31.060]   So I'm guessing this is kind of more support in that vein.
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.980]   And I think that's about it.
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:38.700]   That's all I was able to kind of pull together shortly before the showtime to kind of see.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.500]   But that's quite a bit.
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.620]   Yeah, I mean, quite a bit at the same time, pretty light.
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:46.860]   And I know that probably over the course of the next couple of days, we'll get the people
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:51.500]   who are really diving deep into this who will find a lot more hidden.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:53.420]   And the way you come in and out and code.
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:54.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:55.820]   And placeholders.
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:47:00.660]   And Google's really good at keeping a lot of this stuff close to the vest for the right
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:01.660]   time.
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:07.860]   So this is light, might feel light, but it's going to open up as we continue on down this
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:12.020]   developer preview cycle next month, there'll be another one the month after.
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:15.180]   And each time you're going to get a little bit more insight into what's there.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:19.020]   And they're definitely going to save something to be announced at Google I/O.
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:20.020]   They always do.
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:21.020]   You know, they have to.
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.620]   Yeah, they've got to make a big splash.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:28.500]   And yeah, so a lot of these, a lot of the big marquee features of Android 11, we probably
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.580]   don't even know about yet and won't for at least a couple of months.
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:32.980]   That's my guess anyways.
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:38.220]   I appreciate you going through and installing that on this, you know, burner phone, if you
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:39.220]   will.
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:40.220]   I'm trying to understand.
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:45.220]   I was kind of hoping you'd lock yourself out of your main phone.
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:49.900]   Someday I might do that again just for just for giggles, but not today.
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.340]   Alas, I enjoy having my Google.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:55.340]   For those of you who don't know, it's just a, I've got to be a cruel.
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:56.340]   Oh, no.
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:59.100]   The man locked himself out of his stuff once.
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.100]   On the show.
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:03.980]   We'll put a link to the episode in this show notes.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:05.420]   It's worth watching.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:07.220]   I'll never live that one down.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.220]   No, it's great.
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.100]   What not to do when you're turning on two back.
[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:13.980]   Keep your own dog food and choke on it.
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.140]   Yes.
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:16.140]   And you know what?
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:17.940]   And now like I'm two-factored everywhere.
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.180]   So I figured it out.
[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:22.420]   It was the pain point that I had to go through in order to protect myself.
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:25.100]   I wasn't a man who helped you out of that.
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.100]   Yeah, Mr. Cuts.
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.100]   Yep.
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:28.100]   Yep.
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.100]   Mr. Cuts helped me out.
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.780]   Never once a while I hear from people like, "Oh, it happened to me.
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:32.780]   What do I do?"
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:34.620]   I try my best to walk through it.
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.020]   That's constant Google.
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:37.020]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.020]   That's not going to work.
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.820]   But I think everybody's able to figure it out eventually.
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:41.820]   So that's good.
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:43.660]   Speaking of which, I miss Matt Cuts.
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:45.300]   Yeah, I do too.
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:48.380]   We have him on Twit whenever he's in town.
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:54.340]   He is unable to be on Twig anymore because it's a conflict with his current gig at the
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:55.340]   government.
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:56.340]   With the government?
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.340]   Yeah.
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:58.340]   But was it a G stands for government?
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.340]   Yeah, I guess so.
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.780]   This weekend government.
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.420]   But yeah, whenever he's in town, we have him on Twit.
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:05.420]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.420]   He was on not too long ago.
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:11.980]   I'll put a link to his most recent appearance as well.
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.780]   Man, you're link crazy to that.
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:14.780]   He's on it.
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.220]   That's a producer right there, baby.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.220]   That's right.
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:22.100]   Have you guys ever looked into the stuff that his team is doing, by the way?
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.540]   Like actually gone to the websites that they've redesigned and the processes that they've
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.540]   updated?
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:27.540]   Yep.
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.740]   That's .org is just really cool.
[00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:33.780]   Yeah, I'm happy that's working out so well for him.
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:37.540]   He deserves it.
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:38.540]   Let's see here.
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.580]   So what else can we talk about?
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.180]   We're the Pixel 5.
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.500]   There was a link in here for the Pixel 5.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:51.620]   But man, looking at the photo of the supposed concept Pixel 5 phone, and I just don't buy
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:52.860]   it.
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:50:00.060]   There's supposedly a leak of the Pixel 5 that hits a YouTube channel that I had never heard
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:01.700]   of, although there are a lot of YouTube channels.
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:07.620]   So don't-- maybe this is a big channel, front page tech.
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:12.740]   So this, first of all, this is Pixel 5 actually making an appearance in AOSP code, which basically
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:18.500]   just says, yes, there is a Pixel 5 that exists in this world, or it will exist.
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.900]   It's since been removed, but basically it was someone saying we tested this on the Pixel
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:22.900]   5.
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:25.060]   And of course, we all know there's going to be a Pixel 5.
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:26.060]   That could have been there a year ago.
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:27.060]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.700]   Just the comment and outline.
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:29.700]   Yeah.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:30.700]   Yeah.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:31.940]   It's not like a Pixel 5 isn't going to happen.
[00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:35.060]   I suppose there's the small possibility of that happening.
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:40.900]   This is the leaked photo supposedly of the upcoming Pixel 5 that we won't see until
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:42.860]   probably closer to the end of the year.
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:44.260]   And I just don't buy it.
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.260]   I don't see Google go in.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.260]   It's got face on it.
[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:47.260]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:48.820]   Number one, it totally--
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:53.820]   Anthropomorphic.
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:57.500]   I like that it's matte black.
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:58.500]   No fingerprints.
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.820]   Like it just doesn't look real.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:01.820]   I think this is just something--
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:02.820]   It's an emoji.
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:03.820]   Somebody's laughing at it.
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:04.820]   It doesn't look like an emoji.
[00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:05.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.180]   With an emoji with a war paint.
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:09.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:10.820]   That's pretty much it.
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:11.820]   Pixel 5, invitation.
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:14.820]   Oh man, it's almost perfectly lined up.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.220]   That is so weird.
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.020]   How did you do that?
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.020]   The other way.
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.020]   Oh, nice.
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:21.020]   Kevin, how are you?
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:22.020]   My goodness.
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:23.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:26.380]   You are a Pixel 5 right now.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:28.020]   That has never seen anything so crazy.
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:29.020]   That is this week's thumbnail.
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:30.020]   Yeah, right.
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:34.020]   Might look like a mistake out of context, but--
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:36.020]   I can't decide.
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.420]   What do you guys think of the Galaxy Z Flip?
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:42.020]   Have you been wooed in the direction of Samsung's slippable stuff?
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:45.380]   Well, I'm not going to hear you first because we made fun of Leo Waspie.
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:47.180]   What do you think?
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.180]   They were not an object.
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:49.180]   Dr. Android.
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:50.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:57.860]   I think the foldables and the flipables and all that are interesting.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:01.260]   I think the smartphones have been pretty boring for quite a while.
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:08.420]   I applaud any of the companies that are willing to put their money into new form factors.
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.860]   I don't think it's a bad idea.
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.940]   I want to see it in person, though.
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:18.540]   I'm really sensitive to the touch, like the feel of a display.
[00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:19.540]   And I've had displays.
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:21.540]   A lot of people, right?
[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:24.380]   The creases is potentially a problem.
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:30.380]   I've definitely used phones that-- there was a Motorola phone years ago that had a crack
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.220]   proof display.
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:33.820]   And that's because it was a plastic--
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:34.820]   A turbo.
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:35.820]   Was it the turbo?
[00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:37.660]   Yeah, the turbo on my son.
[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:38.660]   The shatter glass.
[00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:39.660]   There were the big ones.
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:40.660]   Yes, yes.
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:42.740]   Matterproof glass or whatever.
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:48.020]   And I appreciated it for what it could do, but there's no way I could live with the feeling
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.020]   of that display.
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:51.420]   It was just like I could never get used to it.
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:55.260]   And so I worry that with these foldables the way they are right now, I'm just going
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:58.740]   to be too sensitive to how it feels.
[00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:00.100]   That might be a deal breaker for me.
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:01.100]   When did they go on?
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:02.100]   When did they go on?
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.100]   When did they go on?
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:04.100]   They were out.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:05.100]   They were out.
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.100]   They were out.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.100]   They were waiting for his.
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.100]   Valentine's Day.
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.900]   I thought he could get worth the store.
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:11.340]   Yeah, you could get one at the store.
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:14.500]   You could get one of two of them at the store on Valentine's.
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:15.940]   So did he get one?
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:22.220]   No, he did not because he didn't take my advice and send me into San Francisco to buy him one.
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:24.500]   He was third in one.
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.180]   So he went and got there--
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:27.180]   Silly Leo.
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:34.060]   Yeah, he just ordered it online and was basically 30 seconds late.
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:37.500]   Well, hopefully he gets it soon.
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.220]   I'm really curious to see it in person.
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:43.300]   I also think they're just expensive, right?
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:44.900]   $1,500.
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:45.900]   I don't know.
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:46.900]   But why--
[00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:47.900]   I have a problem paying $1,500 for--
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:55.500]   Why isn't people questioning the fact that Samsung put two to five in a location like
[00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:56.500]   that?
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:57.900]   You know, what'd you say?
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:58.900]   $1,500?
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:01.100]   The iPhone is how much?
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:03.620]   Well, $1,100 depending on which one's--
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:04.620]   Yeah, you're getting it.
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.900]   So why is it--
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.500]   How much does Samsung believe in it?
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.460]   If it's just such a scarce product to get?
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:12.460]   How many did they make?
[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:13.820]   How many did they produce?
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:14.820]   Good question.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:19.460]   I mean, do we know for sure that they didn't throw a bunch of these into a carrier store
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:21.020]   and they just all sold out?
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:23.660]   Well, have you seen any out there other than--
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:24.660]   Now.
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:26.460]   In the hands of the big time reviewers?
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:27.460]   No, I haven't.
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:31.300]   Daniel Robino was able to walk into Best Buy at all.
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:36.180]   But he's still Daniel Robino, though.
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:38.980]   But he did just walk into a Best Buy and buy it.
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:39.980]   Right.
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:41.500]   I'm going to put some boots on the ground.
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.500]   You're going to go get yourself a Z-flip?
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.260]   No, I'm not getting one.
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:48.820]   But you know, just see how many are out there.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:54.580]   I had some friends back home ask about it and say, hey, what do you think of this phone?
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:55:00.740]   I said, have at it if you can find one and no one could find one.
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:02.900]   See, a couple of things aside from the price.
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:09.340]   I think that they're pushing the edge of the technology and the products themselves, the
[00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:10.340]   materials.
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:16.340]   I don't think a plastic OLED display that can ripple or be dented by fingernails the
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:17.700]   way to go for long term.
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:21.900]   And now, granted, this has the-- what do they call ultra thin glass?
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:27.340]   But we've already seen a couple reports of, hey, it's peeling already off the--
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:29.100]   you know, off the-- oh, I'm sorry.
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:30.700]   That's the Motorola Razors, isn't it?
[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:31.700]   I forget which.
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:32.700]   Yeah, that's the right one.
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:33.700]   It's already peeling.
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:34.700]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:37.620]   So there's that whole issue.
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:41.900]   But for me, if I'm going to spend that much money, it has to be--
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:43.900]   You've been in the Chromebook.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:47.580]   No, no.
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.500]   I want it to be a two purpose device.
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:56.420]   And these small foldables are just smaller phones that go into a regular size phone.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:04.340]   That's why the Galaxy Fold is more interesting to me because it's a phone that could replace
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:05.340]   a tablet.
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:12.300]   I still don't think it's the ideal form factor in size and product material yet, but that's
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:15.020]   got to be something to take my $1,500.
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:18.420]   It's got to basically be two devices for me.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.780]   Well, Scooter Etsus found is Z Flip at a local Best Buy online.
[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:23.780]   All right.
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.780]   So there's one in the world.
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:29.820]   There's a lot of people out there out there who just didn't work for Leo.
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:35.220]   Yeah, I don't know how many of these are actually going to sell.
[00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:39.660]   So OK, the fold goes from a phone to a tablet.
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:44.420]   The flip goes from a tiny little square into a phone.
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:50.220]   And then TCL, we talked about this last night on all about Android, has a prototype that
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:56.500]   basically rolls from a phone out to a tablet.
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:57:01.620]   So the display kind of falls off the edge of one of the sides.
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:05.180]   It's like an infinity display, but wraps around.
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:06.180]   And I don't know.
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:08.180]   It's like a moving mechanism.
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:13.020]   Mr. Victor says it's more like the old blinds that you had in the windows.
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:18.580]   Yeah, they pull and then they let go and it goes to shave.
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:20.580]   I think that was the best description of it.
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:25.220]   And that's a neat little innovation and taking advantage of the tech that's out there with
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:28.820]   the malleable foldable screens.
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:31.740]   But I don't know.
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:34.980]   I don't know long term.
[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.480]   So they're working.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:44.940]   I mean, I think my general opinion is I like seeing that there's some innovation happening.
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:47.580]   Whether you want to call this innovation or not, it's different from what we've been
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:48.580]   seeing.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:54.740]   They also kind of need to because there has been a pretty big stall in innovation and
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:55.740]   smartphones.
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:57.980]   They're all glass sandwiches.
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:57:59.980]   They all look very much the same.
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:00.980]   Same.
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:01.980]   Maybe a different number of cameras.
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:02.980]   Quadrific, man.
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:09.060]   I will say the phone that we would never be able to get the Huawei.
[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:11.420]   Is it the Mate that foldable device?
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:12.420]   Yeah.
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:13.420]   Mate X.
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:14.420]   Mate X.
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:15.420]   The Mate X folded in.
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:16.420]   That was the one.
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:17.420]   No, that was the fold out.
[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:19.500]   That one felt really nice at CES.
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:20.500]   Okay.
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.260]   And the camera on it was pretty slick.
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:24.940]   And the camera features was pretty diagram.
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:27.340]   That's the one that when it folds, the display is on the outside, right?
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:28.700]   It wraps around it.
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:29.700]   It was pretty nice.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:30.700]   I'm thinking.
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:31.700]   It looks really thick.
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:33.180]   Like we'll never get this phone here.
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:34.180]   It felt good.
[00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:35.180]   It didn't.
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:36.180]   Okay.
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:37.180]   No, I'm thinking.
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.180]   Actually, no, you're right.
[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:39.180]   You're right.
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:40.180]   I'm thinking of the Royal, the Flexpye or whatever.
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:41.180]   Yeah.
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:42.180]   The older Royal was thick.
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:43.180]   No, no, no.
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:44.180]   This one actually looks really good.
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:47.180]   But this thing, that one, it felt good in the hands.
[00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:50.660]   And all I could think about is we'll never see it here.
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:51.660]   Yeah.
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:52.860]   No, probably not.
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:53.860]   So do you--
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:58.020]   Because the FBI file on you because you touched it.
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:58:59.020]   It captured your fingerprint.
[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:00.980]   No, that's just one more file.
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:02.540]   They've already got a couple on me.
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:05.500]   Trust me.
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:09.980]   Could you see yourself wanting a phone that turns into a tablet?
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:13.460]   Like is that a transformation that you really want?
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:14.780]   Not really.
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:19.700]   I do enjoy using the Apple Pencil for some apps.
[00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:26.540]   But I don't necessarily see myself using this even smaller form factor to do that type
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:27.540]   of stuff.
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:28.540]   Okay.
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:30.140]   So my phone just needs to be a phone for the most.
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:31.140]   You know what I want?
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:32.140]   What?
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.140]   You know what I guess?
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:34.140]   What do you want, Jeff?
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:35.940]   I missed my Nexus 7.
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:36.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:39.620]   Why did you get into that Nexus 7?
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:41.940]   Because it's the same size as an Opixel 4 XL.
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:42.940]   Word.
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:45.940]   I love that thing.
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:46.940]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:47.940]   That was a great tablet.
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:48.940]   Yeah.
[00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:49.940]   I enjoyed it.
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:50.940]   Great tablet.
[00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:51.940]   Yeah.
[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:53.780]   That's a good size.
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:54.780]   It's own way.
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:55.780]   It was pocketable.
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:56.780]   It was.
[00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:57.780]   It was.
[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:58.780]   Fending out the fancy word.
[00:59:58.780 --> 00:59:59.780]   Nobody's ever beat by trio.
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.780]   Wow, it's trio, dude.
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:07.020]   That'll go way back.
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.020]   Yeah.
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:14.380]   Apparently, the Fold 2, the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2, could be launching as early as this
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:16.020]   summer.
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:20.100]   And I think they're going to-- sounds like they're going to stick with the Galaxy Z as
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.380]   their foldable lineup.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:26.720]   So whereas it was the Galaxy Fold, now it would be something like perhaps a Galaxy Z
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.020]   Fold, that sort of thing.
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.020]   Rembrand, baby.
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.020]   Rembrand.
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:33.740]   Unify them with the same umbrella.
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:38.700]   But that would be the summer ahead, maybe, or maybe timed with the note announcement.
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:41.260]   Because it was timed with the note announcement last year.
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:42.260]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:44.420]   I just assumed they'd be coupled together again.
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:46.500]   But that might not happen.
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:47.660]   Couldn't hurt.
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.820]   But it really does seem like we're going to see more and more of these.
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:56.900]   Google has baked in and continues to bake in support into the Android OS for these dual-screen
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.900]   environments.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:02.620]   The Z Flip does that thing where you can prop it up on the table and have your video
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:05.420]   call on the top and then the controls down the bottom.
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.420]   Yep.
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:09.900]   Google said that's a feature that can and will come to other phones.
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:13.340]   So it's not just a Samsung exclusive sort of thing that they've figured out with the
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:14.340]   OS.
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:18.900]   This is something that the Android OS can do and will do for other phones as well.
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.140]   So it's a nice feature.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:21.140]   I give them that.
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.140]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.140]   And that's nice to see.
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:27.740]   Because if you think back to when Samsung started pushing the boundaries of the phone
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:32.140]   sizes, the Fablet era with the first Galaxy Note.
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:37.180]   So you had a 5 inch screen and it was Samsung that was adding all this split screen feature
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:38.900]   and this feature and that feature.
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.740]   It wasn't in Android.
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:41.740]   And it took a while.
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.620]   Eventually all that came to Android.
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:49.020]   But now it seems like Google is saying let's do this together and make it happen so that
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.980]   way it's not just a Samsung thing.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:55.540]   It's an Android thing and other manufacturers can decide to go foldable or slide out or whatever
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:57.380]   they want and have all these features.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.380]   I think it's great.
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:01:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:00.380]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.580]   I think they make the experience a lot less seamless.
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:04.020]   Samsung, happy about that though.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:09.220]   Don't they lose a bit of a beat?
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:15.380]   I mean they still have their own services that they offer and they have so many.
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:20.540]   To be honest, most of their phone sales, among the tops in the world in terms of handsets
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:24.980]   sold, most of them are mid-range or even low end because they're just the quantity of
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:26.180]   them.
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:28.660]   So I don't think they'll be too upset by this.
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:33.860]   And they're actually selling their glass technology to other, they're folding glass technology
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.860]   to other manufacturers as well.
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:36.860]   It's right.
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:37.860]   So Samsung's making them bank.
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:41.860]   Yeah, they make more money selling stuff to other people than they make in their own
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:42.860]   phones.
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:47.460]   Mr. Jarvis, I don't remember your preference regarding the foldable.
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:51.380]   Oh, I made fun of Leo and I said that I'm going to make fun of him within six months.
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:52.380]   That's right.
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:53.380]   That's right.
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:54.380]   She did.
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.380]   Wonderful.
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.380]   I remember now.
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:57.380]   Quadra-phonic.
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:59.900]   Whatever happened to quadra-phonic.
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:05.620]   You're talking about the quad speaker system, right?
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:06.620]   Is that what you're referring to?
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:07.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.620]   Evolved into 7.1.
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:10.660]   Yeah, I suppose so.
[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:12.420]   Quadra-phonic was around a weight.
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.420]   Did we all want that?
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.420]   No, we have one speaker.
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:17.340]   There's a little speaker on the table.
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:21.660]   I remember this guy in the next dorm room and dorm room is, of course, have paper thin
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:22.660]   walls.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:26.140]   They're practically Japanese rooms.
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:31.900]   And he had to show off to all the ladies, which there were not many coming into his
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:32.900]   dorm room.
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:40.660]   So he had the four biggest, honking, huge speakers in this little tiny dorm room.
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:43.740]   I had a sweet mate like that too.
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:46.780]   Well, God, I hated it.
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:48.940]   I had a sweet mate like that too.
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:53.260]   Our sweet was always the party sweet, apparently, even though I'm not a party animal.
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:58.860]   But because he had those giant speakers, it was always people that are sweet, just
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:03:59.860]   so annoying.
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:07.060]   All I wanted to do was fire up my toast oven and a nice pizza and watch TV.
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:09.220]   Have you watched your TV through those speakers?
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.340]   Whoa, it's like you were really there.
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.940]   I'm old, nuts young man.
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:15.220]   I went to college without television.
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:16.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:17.220]   How old are you?
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:23.180]   She's old enough to miss my trio.
[01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:30.340]   All right, foldables, flipables, rollables, whatever.
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:33.060]   We'll see what happens.
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:34.460]   So how about this?
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:36.100]   Because I know Jeff, you wrote about this.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:43.540]   Google is working on a new news project where it's willing to pay publishers a licensing
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:46.180]   fee to take part in their project.
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:49.380]   This is according to sources of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:55.020]   It's early at this point, it would be licensing content to appear in the article says some
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:57.420]   free Google product.
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:01.540]   Maybe it already exists, maybe it doesn't, but that's where this stuff would appear.
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:07.500]   Publishers have of course wanted Google to compensate them for Google's use of their
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.580]   news in the past.
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:12.020]   So this would be kind of, I don't know if it's a watershed moment, but it's definitely
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:13.860]   a big shift in direction.
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:18.220]   Facebook also made a similar move in this direction last year.
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.540]   Well, like I said, Jeff, you wrote about this on Medium.
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:22.540]   What's your pick?
[01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:26.300]   And counterintuitive, a hole that I am.
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.420]   I regret this.
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:33.620]   I think there's a problem with this that I think that Google will will rule the day when
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.420]   it paid for any content.
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:39.620]   I'm not used to pay for the AP, it's true, but I think this is this sense of precedent
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:40.780]   that's going to be difficult.
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:45.340]   I think they did it because they were blackmailed by publishers with politicians, especially
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:50.140]   in Europe and now in the US, around all the regulation and here in the US around 230
[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:52.540]   and antitrust and stuff.
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:55.500]   And Facebook went and decided they were going to pay.
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:59.980]   And so at Facebook's announcement of this, Robert Thompson, the head of News Corp under
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:05.500]   Rupert Murdoch, who's been a Bettenor to all the tech companies and criticizes him, well,
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.900]   he showed up because he had to collect his envelope and he had to say nice things about
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.300]   Zuckerberg to get his money now.
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.900]   And that's where it is.
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:18.980]   And I just worry, I worry that the publishers are going to think that this is the latest
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:20.860]   messiah that's going to save them and it's not.
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:24.020]   There's not enough money here to do that.
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:29.620]   I worry that they use their political capital cashing in conflict of interest to get politicians
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:37.180]   to give them protectionist regulation and legislation.
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:41.260]   I worry about who's going to get the money and who's not going to get the money.
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:47.180]   So the big old guys will continue to get the money and new insurgent efforts coming in
[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:49.020]   probably won't.
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:53.260]   And it'll be hard to get a toehold here in a very competitive marketplace.
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:59.380]   And so I think it just delays the inevitable of their bringing up into ashes.
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.740]   And so I was very growly about it.
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:02.740]   Nobody paid attention to it.
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:03.740]   Nobody noticed the post.
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:04.740]   That's fine.
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:05.740]   Probably wouldn't get me in trouble.
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:08.260]   But I was actually not in favor of this.
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:11.540]   So you say that she shared us now?
[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:15.540]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:18.580]   Facebook has done something similar as I mentioned.
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:21.100]   Like how has that taken shape?
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.700]   They haven't released it publicly yet.
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:29.260]   So they have the news tab and they announced it at an event in New York and big players
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.620]   are in on it.
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:32.660]   But Breitbart has also been on it.
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:33.660]   And that's right.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:40.460]   A lot of heat, not only outside the company, but inside the company, friends tell me that
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.740]   there was-- people were not happy about that.
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:47.180]   And that's the issue is that the platforms now have to make judgments and make decisions.
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:51.460]   Now full disclosure is I raised money for the school from Facebook for a project that
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:55.220]   in fact is involved in trying to help the platform to decide what is quality news.
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:56.420]   So I'm trying to help with that.
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:01.700]   I think it's important because they're going to send attention to it no matter what.
[01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:06.380]   I received a money personally from any of the platforms and the disclosure.
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:15.780]   I don't know why, but I thought about us previously discussing news.com KNEWZ.com.
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:22.340]   It's probably the most hideous site to try to lead.
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.100]   It's endearing in its own right.
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:28.780]   I feel like it's ugly, but it's also kind of-- I don't know.
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:31.300]   There's something that pulls me to it and it's ugliness.
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:32.300]   It was pretty--
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.300]   Turn it down, please.
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:41.820]   No, and all of it wasn't Breitbart involved with this as well.
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:44.460]   I don't know if they're involved, but it's very Breitbartian.
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:45.460]   Oh, OK.
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:46.460]   Breitbart was in there.
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:47.460]   Breitbart's linked to from there.
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:48.460]   Link to her.
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:49.460]   OK.
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:53.700]   Yeah, so in that case, what basically happened is they are linking to the New York Times
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:58.580]   and the New Republic and the Washington Post and the Guardian and all these comedy rags.
[01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:05.060]   And then they kind of hide behind that so they can also link to Breitbart at all and
[01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:07.260]   then it makes them all seem kind of equal.
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.820]   Let me see.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:11.780]   Do they just curate that stuff, Jeff?
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:16.260]   Or are they publishers getting paid through news or cut out, or whatever?
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:17.260]   OK.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:22.280]   Actual Springer did a version of that in Germany where they did pay, as far as I know, trying
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:26.580]   to replace Google News, but those efforts never really worked.
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:33.860]   Speaking of Europe, they came up with a big digital plan and I was struck by it is that
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:39.420]   one of the-- because you remind me, Kevin, one of the angles on it was that-- now Europe
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:41.300]   will start its own Google and its own Facebook.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.660]   How many years have we heard that?
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:48.700]   Because they're trying to restrict how data flows outside of the EU, but make it flow
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:56.300]   easier inside the EU, which made me say that, well, OK, so they actually do want to collect
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:57.300]   data.
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:00.300]   They just don't want Americans to collect it.
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:05.860]   On a lighter note, can I suggest something?
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:06.860]   Please.
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.060]   I just brought the show down.
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:09.060]   Please, Steve.
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.060]   I'm going to bring it back up again.
[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:11.060]   Thank you.
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:13.660]   Down under other, the second under other, my favorite thing of the week?
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:14.660]   Oh, yes.
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.660]   Wendy is mean.
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:17.660]   Oh, Wendy.
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:20.940]   Why you got to be so mean?
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:25.580]   Wendy's Burgers, of course, or-- I mean, the Wendy's Restaurant.
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:26.580]   Next week we had New Jersey's.
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:27.580]   Wendy's not mean.
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:28.860]   She is on fleek.
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:29.860]   Yes.
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:33.500]   Happy you said that, Kirsten.
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:39.500]   Yeah, apparently, Wendy's Twitter feed is going nuts.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:43.820]   You go to the Twitter feed, and she's calling everybody out left right and center.
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:47.060]   There's a report that Burger King is going to have-- is testing the sandwich with nothing
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:49.140]   but French fries inside.
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:54.180]   To which Wendy said, when literally anything would be better on a bun than their beef?
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:55.180]   Ooh.
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:56.180]   Ooh.
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:58.740]   But you know, there's probably some shoots of that.
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:03.260]   Burger King told posted a picture of the Burger King, which is the creepiest thing
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.260]   this is.
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.820]   Yeah, I'm going to do that, Scott.
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:09.620]   St. Rose's the red ballads are blue patties around, trying to get it Wendy's.
[01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:13.820]   Wendy's did not miss a beat and came back and said, look to drop by to see what Spicy
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:16.300]   Nuggets were supposed to taste like.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:17.300]   Ooh.
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.300]   Ouch.
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:19.300]   Spicy.
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:21.820]   A-- this is the worst one.
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:28.220]   I'm sure from a woman on Twitter, two guys with a dumpster outside of McDonald's with
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.220]   face masks on.
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:32.460]   Wendy's, what do you think they're doing here?
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:34.980]   Wendy's reply is picking up their order.
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.380]   Oh, this is gross.
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:37.380]   I like this.
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:38.380]   Yeah.
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:39.380]   Yeah.
[01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:40.380]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:41.380]   But--
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.660]   And I don't want to get into like political stuff because that's like something I don't
[01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:45.180]   really discuss in general.
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:46.180]   You need to do it.
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:50.780]   But it's like this whole normalization of just being a Twitter troll now.
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:51.780]   I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:52.780]   Yeah.
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:53.780]   Brand--
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:54.780]   Brand--
[01:11:54.780 --> 01:12:00.620]   Brand Twitter has very much followed Wendy's examples and has become a very interesting
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:06.340]   place for a very interesting sub-segment of Twitter.
[01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:09.060]   They realize they don't need to be polite anymore.
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:11.060]   They get more attention when they--
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.060]   Exactly.
[01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:13.060]   Mr. Jarvis.
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:14.700]   Mr. Jarvis.
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.700]   In your day when--
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.940]   What, what, what, young man?
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:19.940]   These newspapers were--
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:22.540]   They were being printed regularly.
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:27.460]   Do you remember seeing ads like this where a company would call out?
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:32.380]   You know, Wendy's would call out at McDonald's buying an ad space like that?
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:33.380]   In our modern--
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.380]   Where's the beef?
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:35.380]   We would say they subtweeted.
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:36.380]   That was subtweeted.
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:37.380]   Well, where's the beef?
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:40.460]   Yeah, but what about just examples like this chart?
[01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:42.100]   They were calling out a specific.
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:43.100]   Right.
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.100]   Brand, which is what Anne's asking.
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.100]   They wouldn't say, hey, McDonald's.
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.100]   Where's the beef?
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.100]   All right.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.100]   Right.
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:52.620]   I don't think they would ever say it like that anyway.
[01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:53.620]   Yo, who?
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:54.620]   McDonald's.
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:55.620]   I'm from Jersey.
[01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:56.620]   What's the beef?
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:57.620]   What's the beef?
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:04.460]   Was that Jeff or Joey talking to us?
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:06.580]   I don't know.
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:10.540]   I like picturing the Wendy's Wendy saying that.
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:11.540]   Hey, McDonald's.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.540]   What's the beef, huh?
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.540]   Chomping on a cigar or something.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:17.540]   Don't look at it in my hair.
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:18.540]   Now, where's the beef?
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:19.540]   Yeah, you.
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:20.540]   You guys don't look mean.
[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:21.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.540]   Boy, you have these trolls.
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:24.540]   But you're right, Kevin.
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:28.780]   That is exactly what I was thinking, too, is that it has normalized it for everybody.
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:29.780]   Yeah, it's a real company's way.
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:30.780]   Tell me what it's like.
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:31.780]   E.R. departments.
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:38.420]   And last week, we did the story of the New Jersey Twitter feed, the official NJ Gov Twitter
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:41.860]   feed, which since then, the New York Times did a big feature on them.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:44.020]   I'm sure because they heard about it on Twitter.
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:45.020]   Of course.
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:52.140]   And it's not as bad as Wendy's, but it still has SaaS.
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:53.580]   That one being the primary one.
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:56.980]   Someone says, "Who let New Jersey have a Twitter?"
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:01.380]   And New Jersey official account responded, "Your mom."
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:07.820]   No, it's funny, though, but I guess it was.
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:09.460]   It is funny, but it's--
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:10.460]   Yeah, why not?
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:13.260]   I don't like where all this is headed.
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:17.580]   Yeah, I had not considered the whole normalization of Twitter trolling.
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:20.300]   I mean, that's-- yeah, it's a really good point.
[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:22.540]   It's a very, very fair point.
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:30.380]   The NJ account is handled by two women, one in her 30s, one in her 20s.
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:31.380]   And they just--
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:34.060]   I don't-- fun with it.
[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:35.060]   Yeah.
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:39.100]   At least somebody's having fun on social media.
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:40.100]   On Twitter.
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.400]   On Twitter.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:44.960]   So last week, they had a stunning video from the Jersey Shore.
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:48.620]   And they tweet read, "Armpit, what?"
[01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:51.380]   People accused Jersey of being an armpit people in Pennsylvania.
[01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:51.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.720]   It's the other show.
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:58.560]   That's purely because of the shape of the state, though, not any other
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.360]   commentations.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.360]   That's the only reason.
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:05.920]   I think we're getting Karsten's psychological Rorschach test here.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.260]   We just learned something about Karsten.
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:08.440]   I don't see it, Karsten.
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:14.040]   How is the-- I see a mouth eating Staten Island, what I see?
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.280]   It's more of an elbow, actually.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.800]   Well, you know Jersey, the--
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.800]   your perth amboy there in Staten Island,
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.600]   that's kind of armpit-ish the bay.
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.360]   So it looks more like a pyramise.
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.800]   Watch it fell off.
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.640]   Oh, yeah, grove in Jersey.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:27.000]   Yo.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.680]   My wife's from Jersey.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:29.720]   Yay.
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:32.360]   You're not going to be lipped back in.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.080]   I'm from Jersey.
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:33.840]   You from Jersey.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.880]   No wall wall for you.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.080]   No more wall wall for you.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.080]   I missed the most--
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.600]   I'm kicking myself because I wasn't fast enough
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:43.880]   on my camera today.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:47.080]   I missed a moment that could have gone viral.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.000]   Oh, really?
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.640]   York subway, and there was Bagel Rat.
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.000]   Oh, really?
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.200]   I had a whole half of Bagel, and I missed it.
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.200]   I cried.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.680]   I got a blurry picture.
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:02.320]   I missed it.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.320]   I'm just kicking myself.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.880]   I could have been famous.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.760]   This is where Google Glass had the advantage, man.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.200]   Yeah, so it's true.
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:09.760]   So true.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:11.240]   Always be recording.
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.360]   Don't say that loudly.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.040]   Hey, that's actually a good transition
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.400]   into one of the stories in here.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.400]   Yeah, sort of.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:26.040]   Tangentially, sure.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:29.840]   Google is apparently according to the information
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.720]   they wrote an article about how Google is lagging behind Apple
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:37.120]   and Facebook in the augmented reality race,
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:41.080]   apparently employees in Google's AR/VR division
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:45.200]   are demoralized according to a couple of reports anyways
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:48.120]   from inside the company in light of Google's cutting
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.200]   of the Daydream VR efforts.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.160]   Of course, Google got rid of its Daydream program.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:56.240]   No more VR coming from Google.
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.440]   Total about face there.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:00.440]   And haven't really been seeing a whole lot around AR either.
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:01.760]   Things have kind of settled quite--
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:05.400]   Is it lagging behind when you don't care to compete?
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:09.160]   Well, and I think that's kind of one of the questions, right?
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:13.400]   Is Microsoft lagging behind on the smartphone race?
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.600]   They just didn't care.
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.280]   They had other things that they worried about.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.120]   Maybe so.
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.720]   Yeah, I mean, Apple and Facebook both have big projects
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:23.160]   in this area, in the works.
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.640]   I think how this ties into Google Glass
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.560]   is when I was thinking about this,
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.240]   like, well, Google was there pretty darn early
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:31.760]   comparing anyone.
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.600]   Google Glass was a product ahead of its time.
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.840]   I don't know if it's true augmented reality,
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.360]   but I mean, it kind of is.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:42.280]   It's the same kind of concept.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.760]   So I don't know.
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:47.800]   I'm just curious if they should be further along,
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.800]   considering they had such a big jump over the competition.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.320]   Or should-- yeah, maybe they don't care.
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.720]   Maybe they're just like, yeah, whatever.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.640]   Like, man, we're just trying to seal my head.
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:56.120]   That's it.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.880]   Before we write them off.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.960]   Before we write them off.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:17:59.960]   All right.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.400]   On the Chromium blog, I don't have this link in here,
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:06.080]   but I remembered that Chrome 81 was announced on the Chromium
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:09.680]   blog last week, the 13th.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:12.320]   And Chrome 81 includes Near Field Communications
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:16.080]   and augmented reality, web-based augmented reality.
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:19.280]   They have a picture there, a screenshot of it.
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.520]   So it's at blog.chromium.org if we can go over it.
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.640]   Yeah, I'll put it in the doc chat.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.680]   So it seems like, OK, maybe they're
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:31.280]   not doing wearable-type products for ARVR right now.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.840]   Maybe they're getting out of that market.
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:36.360]   But they're expanding it to a much wider scope of devices
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.600]   if it's web-based.
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:38.480]   That's true.
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.160]   Yeah, maybe they're not focused on the hardware specifically.
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:44.120]   They're focused more on the software-based approach.
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.000]   B2B, which is--
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:45.960]   Which kind of thing?
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:46.400]   Kevin.
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:51.080]   Kevin tried to subtly cue you that Google Glass never
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.360]   actually went away.
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:53.120]   That's true.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:57.640]   Enterprise Edition 2 just came out about six months ago.
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:01.080]   And it is still being worked on.
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:01.640]   It's a good point.
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:02.720]   Developers can buy it now.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.120]   It's about $1,100 a set.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.520]   If you're a developer, you can get Google S2.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.020]   Right.
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.320]   Nope, not doing it again.
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.680]   Nope, not doing it again.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:12.120]   You learned your lesson.
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:13.440]   It is not for you.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:13.960]   It is for you.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:14.680]   They say--
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:17.200]   --they say in the name--
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.120]   --and to the buy--
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.120]   --enterprise edition.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:19.620]   Yeah, right.
[01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:20.120]   --enterprise--
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.120]   --enterprise--
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:22.920]   --the first product consumer.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:23.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:26.240]   Hey, Jeff, that Galaxy Chromebook is an enterprise edition
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:27.920]   device too, just so you know.
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.040]   Just kidding.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:35.160]   I tried to save me for myself for you.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.200]   Hey, you do you.
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.120]   It's all good.
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:37.960]   It's all good.
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:39.720]   Dang, you can't get it now, Jeff.
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:40.720]   It's enterprise.
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:41.880]   You can't get it anymore.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:44.000]   Enterprise, I'm just me.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.320]   Just get a little me.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:48.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.160]   So on Twitter, on Twitter, I just put up subway wrap.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:54.320]   Oh, what do you mean you're blurry photo somewhere?
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:54.840]   It's not great.
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:55.360]   It's not great.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.880]   It is subway wrap.
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:58.680]   OK.
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.880]   Again, a angle wrap.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.280]   I thought you drew it because you didn't get the picture you
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.720]   said.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:05.400]   Holy cow.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.400]   --aggle wrap.
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:06.920]   OK.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:07.720]   --aggle wrap.
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:08.840]   --aggle wrap.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:09.440]   There was a bagel wrap.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:10.280]   That's a bagel wrap.
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.440]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:15.320]   Well, I mean, you kind of got there.
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:16.360]   A little bit of--
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:17.960]   a little bit of--
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:20.440]   it's cute how it prances away like that.
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:21.480]   I appreciate your--
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:26.800]   --we need AI to enhance that image
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:29.840]   and show us that it really is a bagel in its mouth.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:30.920]   And that it really is a rat.
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.520]   It's kind of hard to see either.
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:36.840]   Yeah, it might have a rat mask on from the virus thing.
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:37.840]   Yes.
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:38.360]   So--
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:38.840]   Hey.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.520]   --oh, it's a thing.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:41.680]   That's dad.
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:47.000]   And that's got me a picture of mom bagel rat somewhere out
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.520]   there.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:51.600]   Let's see here.
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:54.160]   Google is killing, shutting down.
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.760]   It's-- was it station?
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.000]   I believe it was what it's called.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:58.520]   It's station--
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.520]   Yeah, I think it's called the--
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.360]   station program.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:04.960]   This is something that they've had in place since 2016.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:09.640]   It offered free Wi-Fi in 5,000 locations worldwide.
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:12.560]   Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria, Thailand, Philippines,
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:16.160]   Mexico, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam.
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.360]   And basically, the scale had become
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.000]   too difficult, less sustainable.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.560]   So Google has decided to kill the project.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:27.920]   They also said that 4G proliferation is kind of making it
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:29.400]   a little bit less necessary.
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:29.880]   Right.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.000]   Business is business.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:35.040]   And I think the carriers that are in those areas
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.840]   are actually going to take over some of those Wi-Fi stations.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:38.640]   Let's go out there.
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:39.040]   That's good.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.240]   Yeah.
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:40.920]   Oh, OK.
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.640]   This win-win sounds like.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:43.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.720]   That's good.
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.520]   Although, I'm sure this will be added to killed by Google.com
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.600]   sometime soon.
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:49.100]   Yep.
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:50.360]   If it's not there, I mean--
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.000]   If it's not there, I mean--
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.540]   But we see something getting resurrected from the graveyard.
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:54.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:56.960]   Nice transition.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.160]   Something that Google--
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.000]   Yes.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.840]   Thank you for the assist.
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:03.280]   Bookbot was a Google project.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:07.040]   It was a 20% project that apparently picked up--
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.520]   I hadn't heard of this before today--
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.680]   had picked up library books from homes
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.960]   and returned them to the Mountain View library.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.400]   I've seen images or renderings of this a couple of years ago
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:17.900]   or whatever.
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:20.300]   But I didn't know this was a Google thing.
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:20.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:23.200]   I think there have been different delivery robots.
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.000]   This was created--
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.760]   it began the pilot early 2019 and then ended in June
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:33.280]   with no real explanation as to why.
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:36.720]   They were just testing it apparently.
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.840]   And it seems like a couple of Google engineers have now
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:44.760]   broken out and created a company called Cartkin, which
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:49.760]   is seemingly going to be bringing back a robot that
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.220]   does something very similar to this.
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:53.540]   So I don't know if it's the same engineers.
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:55.500]   They're like, hey, well, if Google's not going to do it,
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:57.140]   we're going to do it.
[01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:59.340]   And so you never know.
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:02.100]   You might use your robot to return to library books
[01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:02.940]   or other things.
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:05.540]   I imagine the delivery is not just isolated.
[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:08.380]   So I guess this is just their side hustle while working
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:09.740]   at Google essentially.
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:10.860]   Yeah, I actually don't know.
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:14.620]   Maybe they've left Google to form this company
[01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.760]   or I don't know if they're still working at Google.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:17.840]   But--
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:20.920]   Our kids have got to have a lot of library finds.
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:22.160]   Yeah, right.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:25.160]   This is a really important problem to solve.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:28.160]   I don't think this is isolated to library books.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:31.880]   They say low cost delivery through automation
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:34.440]   aiming at the last mile of delivery.
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.160]   So that sounds pretty broad.
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:36.760]   Sure.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:39.840]   Bagel deliveries to rats.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.560]   Rats got to get their bagel somehow.
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:42.960]   Might as well be robots.
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:45.720]   Does anybody use the bookmobile anymore?
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:46.560]   Not a rat.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:47.840]   Oh, OK.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.760]   We stand corrected, Mr. Kevin.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:52.200]   Thank you.
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.000]   Breaking news.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:53.480]   Bagel pie.
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:54.280]   Breaking news.
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.240]   I just saw it across my feed.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.080]   I just put it in the rundown.
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.720]   I put it under other.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:00.640]   OK.
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:01.200]   Let's see here.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.840]   Breaking news.
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:04.280]   Oh, wow.
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.080]   This looks really important.
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:08.520]   Mark Zuckerberg reportedly gets his armpits blow
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.800]   dried before speeches.
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.640]   No.
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.160]   Stop the presses.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.600]   Doesn't everybody?
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:18.960]   I blow dry my armpits before I do this week in Google.
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:21.000]   I mean, wouldn't that make them sweat more
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.960]   because it gets hot?
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.440]   Well, I get you just threw you on the wall.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:26.160]   I use the Dyson hand dryers in the bathrooms.
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:31.200]   How do you do that?
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:33.400]   The one way you put your hands to that?
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.560]   Have you seen what Tom's atofel is?
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.240]   I just don't-- I'm about three foot six.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.880]   You're talking about the ones on the walls that's
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:46.320]   the big U when you put your hands in there, right?
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.880]   No, no, the Dyson air blades.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.440]   I mean, both pits at the same time.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:53.080]   I was picturing the hand dryers from bathrooms
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:56.840]   that's like a giant U. And I just don't know how that works.
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:00.320]   No, no, that value is to dry my feet after a shower.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:01.400]   That makes sense.
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:02.240]   OK.
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:04.960]   I said something coming up for Kickstarter.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:07.080]   I can see the airport air pit dryer.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:09.160]   The chat room's already on it.
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:10.960]   I'm sure.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.800]   There it is.
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:12.840]   Right where Staten Island is.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:15.120]   I'm telling you, that's the armpit.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.840]   So funny.
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:19.040]   So-- oh, it was OK.
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.040]   So this is part of a book.
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:25.440]   OK, so this is an actual fact from a book.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.720]   This is Levi's book.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.480]   There's stuff getting leaked.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:31.760]   The title is Facebook, the inside story.
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:33.880]   And so apparently it's really inside.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.960]   But Stephen Levy.
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:35.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:38.640]   He's been embedded with him for like a year and a half.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:43.080]   So he's been watching as Zuckerberg blowdries his armpits.
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:47.160]   Hey, you do what you got to do when you're a man of Zuckerberg's
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.360]   stature and public--
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.880]   Actually, look, the pay piece was something.
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:50.880]   I guess.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:53.720]   Ooh.
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:55.320]   OK.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:57.520]   Should we do the change log?
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.960]   Yeah, I think I need to get out of that.
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:01.680]   All right, let's do the change log.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:03.240]   Whoa.
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.000]   Google change log.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:05.840]   There we go.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:09.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.760]   We got a lot in the change log this week.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:12.480]   Let's see here.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:14.480]   This could also be added to--
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:15.440]   killed by Google.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.040]   Alphabet is killing Makani, which was founded in 2006.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.200]   It was spun out of X into its own unit.
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:27.920]   This is the project that was designing kites that were made
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:31.640]   to capture wind energy for renewable electricity.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:35.400]   Kind of cool looking like mechanical type kites
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.720]   that were capturing wind energy anyways.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:40.040]   Google says it's not commercially viable.
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:42.440]   And so they will be killing the project.
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:43.880]   I think if you scroll down, there
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:47.080]   might be a picture of one of those things in the air.
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.440]   This was one of their number projects.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:49.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:50.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:54.240]   Interesting project, but not commercially viable.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.480]   That was a Larian Sergey.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.080]   I think we're going to see more of these things dying
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.920]   from the Larian Sergey years.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.120]   Yeah, probably so.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:02.480]   Chai is seeing kittis crap out of here.
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.480]   Is that one that's going to happen right now?
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.920]   You're doing what?
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.520]   Get this crap out of here.
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:09.480]   Wind kites?
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.520]   No, no, no.
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.360]   No.
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.200]   We've got bigger fish to fry.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:17.360]   Search widget doodles are now coming to more phones
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.040]   than just pixels.
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.360]   If you have a pixel phone, you may have noticed your search
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.840]   widget has these little like doodle animations that
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.800]   appear on certain days and stuff.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.880]   Now that's not just a pixel only feature.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.680]   In fact, it launched on Valentine's Day
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:32.680]   on a number of other phones outside of the Pixel family.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:35.560]   So you'll see little animations in that Google search bar
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:38.080]   down at the bottom, like that one, although it'll be moving
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:40.480]   because it's an animation and not a picture.
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:45.600]   So pretty interesting sort of kind of.
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.960]   Stadia, a couple of pieces of news around Stadia.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:52.800]   First of all, if you bought the--
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.680]   if you were an early adopter and you bought the founders
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:56.840]   edition, you know that it came within it.
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:01.520]   It included a three month membership with the Pro service,
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.480]   which is the only service that Stadia offered at that launch,
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:06.320]   at that early launch.
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:10.320]   Those free-- those Pro tiers are about to end.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:13.040]   So those three months, we're almost at the end of that.
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.800]   When that happens, Google has announced that their free
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:19.760]   service tier will go into effect for all those folks,
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.600]   unless they choose to pay for the Pro service.
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:24.360]   And basically what that means is the Pro tier offers higher
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:28.880]   quality streaming, you know, certain games that are added
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:29.480]   to the library.
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:32.720]   So if you end up going down to the free tier, those games that
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.160]   were included with Pro will be removed from your library.
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:38.640]   You'll be limited to 1080p streaming, which is the upper
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:42.560]   end of the free tier for Stadia.
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:46.200]   Mine ended today and I unsubscribed last night.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:46.880]   Oh, OK.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:47.400]   Good.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:48.440]   You got right in there.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.720]   So you got the founders edition.
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.400]   Do you play it regularly?
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.720]   Or what do you think about it?
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:58.720]   So I did a lot over the break in between semesters.
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:01.280]   But now that school's back in, it's been five weeks of school,
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.280]   I barely had time to touch it.
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:07.720]   I did purchase about five games all the met at this count.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:09.760]   So those I still have access to.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:13.200]   And the free games, it was nice to have, but that's OK.
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:16.120]   I just don't have time to play, so I'd rather not pay for it.
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:18.040]   And it's OK they don't have 4K.
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:18.880]   I'm not a big gamer.
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.360]   I play on a switch sometimes.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:23.200]   You know, I'll play on a phone, I'll play on a Chromebook.
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:25.040]   I don't need 4K.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:25.680]   So--
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:26.680]   1080p is great.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:27.840]   I mean, especially for free.
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:32.880]   And if you've already got the games in your library, that's awesome.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:36.880]   Maybe at a certain time you have more time in your hands, or you want--
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.400]   And then I just re-up the $10 a month.
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:45.160]   And I don't know if the pro games then come back.
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.480]   That's what I'm curious about.
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:48.240]   Because I claimed them.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:51.520]   They're not in my library now, but would they reappear?
[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:52.240]   I don't know.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.000]   That's a good question.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:53.680]   Good question.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:54.240]   Yeah.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.120]   I'd imagine if you claim them, then they would reappear.
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:59.600]   I would hope so anyways.
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:00.040]   All right.
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:04.960]   Well, also if you don't have a Pixel phone,
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:08.240]   you won't be left out of the party, apparently.
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.480]   Stadia is coming to more than just Pixel phones now.
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:15.320]   They've added support for Galaxy S8 through current Galaxy S phones,
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:21.280]   Razer phones, both versions of the Razer phone, both versions of the ASUS ROG,
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:22.120]   ROG, ROG.
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.320]   The Republic of gamers.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.880]   I can never get that right.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:28.040]   And there's four different ways I could say that.
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:30.360]   And I get it wrong every single time.
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:31.600]   So all of those phones as well.
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.760]   So Stadia is opening up.
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:39.600]   And I'm sure soon we'll start seeing more news around other people
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:40.360]   being allowed in.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:42.840]   Because I think it's still kind of isolated to the founders, right?
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:43.280]   Yep.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:47.880]   So I'm assuming very soon we'll see like Google opens it up for everyone.
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:49.840]   And then we'll see if people care.
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.320]   I still just want--
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:55.040]   I want to see that succeed just from because of the cost
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:31:00.320]   and given more people the opportunity to play high-level,
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:02.520]   high-quality games.
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:07.000]   I just don't see it working just yet, because of all the infrastructure issues.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:08.560]   I don't know.
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:12.360]   Has your kind of quality experience been OK, Kevin?
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.840]   It's been quite good.
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:16.120]   It was a little sketchy at first.
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:17.800]   And it also depended on the game.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:19.920]   So it may depend on which game you're playing.
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:24.600]   And I know some games recently, like Red Dead Redemption 2,
[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:29.920]   just got some type of graphical upgrade from the publisher.
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.440]   So that graphics actually look better.
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:37.040]   As far as glitches or anything, because of the bandwidth,
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:40.760]   I haven't had really any issues very rarely.
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.120]   So I've been happy with it.
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:46.240]   There are times you cannot tell you're not playing on a console.
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:46.880]   Nice.
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:47.400]   Nice.
[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:50.120]   And the latency is the other potential downfall.
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:53.840]   I think that probably relates more to certain different types of games
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:58.280]   than others, because I tried playing Mortal Kombat, whatever
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:01.200]   the most recent version of Mortal Kombat is.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:01.960]   Thank you, Kevin.
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:03.360]   Eleven.
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:04.720]   I'm old.
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:05.480]   I play video games.
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:07.120]   The gamer knows.
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:08.120]   Thank you, Kevin.
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.480]   Mortal Kombat 11, and I tried playing that on the stadium.
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:13.920]   And it just kind of felt almost attached.
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:16.600]   There was just enough fast-moving action
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:19.800]   that the buttons didn't seem to line up very well.
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:21.760]   All right.
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:26.080]   So it's probably different types of games that work better for that sort of thing.
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:30.800]   Google announced Game Snacks from its Area 120 Incubator.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:36.200]   These are HTML5-based browser games that Google's offering
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.880]   for older devices, for budget devices, devices that--
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:43.120]   Well, we'll work on my trio.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.120]   It's a good question.
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.480]   You should bust out that trio and see.
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:47.880]   I mean, it's HTML5.
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:49.760]   I don't think the trio--
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:51.240]   I don't think HTML5 was a thing.
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:52.240]   Is there a WAP5?
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:55.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.920]   Whoa.
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.880]   Probably not, I'm thinking, Jeff.
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:04.400]   But if you have an Android device that has minimal processing power,
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.040]   minimal memory, and top-of-the-life game--
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:06.560]   Not me.
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:08.960]   I guess Kevin knows I only buy the best.
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:10.520]   Thank you, probably won't be playing these.
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:13.560]   These are really designed to work in really poor network conditions
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:16.640]   on lower-end devices.
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:19.360]   Is it-- is it work offline, or is it just--
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.280]   That's what I wondered.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:24.120]   What says on any network?
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:28.040]   So I think you have to be online in order to download it,
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:29.680]   in order to load the page.
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:32.600]   And then I imagine, I would guess that it would work at that point.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:33.640]   I'd be all loaded up.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:34.480]   Self-contain.
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:35.880]   Yeah, I would imagine so.
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:38.160]   But you got to be connected to load it for the first time.
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:41.040]   So let's see here.
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:43.240]   Google launched a cloud region in Seoul.
[01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:45.840]   It's its first in the South Korean market.
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:49.320]   Customer base includes Samsung, LG Electronics.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:52.080]   SK Telecom, and a few others.
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.920]   It's competing with a cloud vendor space in the area,
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:57.560]   along with Alibaba, Huawei, AWS.
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:00.480]   So this is potentially a big move for Google,
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:02.520]   and it's cloud efforts.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:03.520]   And then finally--
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.240]   The big one.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:04.760]   The big one.
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:05.840]   I'm happy with this one.
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.760]   And was indifferent last night on all about Android.
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.920]   I imagine either both of you or one of you
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.520]   will be pretty excited about this.
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:16.560]   9 to 5 Google torn down the latest version of Gmail for Android.
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:20.280]   And they are finding that inboxes bundles might actually
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:23.360]   be coming soon or around the corner.
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:28.000]   Essentially, they're integrating this with labels in Gmail
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.360]   to the point to where Gmail will be able to automatically
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:35.120]   decide that this email coming in belongs in the travel label.
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:36.320]   Why don't they just dance or stuff?
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.360]   Keep inbox.
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:39.720]   That ship has sailed.
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:42.360]   I agree, but that ship has sailed.
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:43.360]   It sucked.
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.760]   I don't see that coming back anytime soon.
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:46.760]   But--
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:47.760]   But--
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:48.760]   But--
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:53.880]   But if they can integrate bundle-like features into Gmail
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:56.440]   well enough, then I'll be pretty happy.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.560]   Because that's my one big annoyance with Gmail.
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.440]   It's just all the manual maintenance
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.400]   I have to do on setting up filters.
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:05.080]   And it was just so nice to grab that email,
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:06.840]   drag it over into the bundle that I wanted to go.
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:07.840]   That's the main--
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:09.320]   Well, it is.
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:11.960]   But when I did that in inbox, then it would give me a pop-up.
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:14.080]   And it would say, do you want all messages from this person
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:15.640]   or like this to go there?
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:17.040]   And be like, yeah, that's what I want.
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:19.080]   OK, so you don't think about it anymore.
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:21.960]   You dragged and dropped one time.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.680]   That was a manual effort.
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:25.520]   You can create one filter.
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:27.120]   So go up to the manual.
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:29.000]   Make you pull down filter, open up the thing,
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.760]   do the little search term, hit search,
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:31.800]   find all the things.
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:33.360]   Make sure it's showing me the right things.
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:36.080]   Then click yes, apply to all and also apply this label
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.240]   and remove it from my inbox and go.
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.120]   That's like 10 different things I have to do versus--
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:40.960]   Stick your--
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:42.560]   Dragging it over once and saying yes.
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:45.160]   At least it's not out, look.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.800]   I don't know why it's not a used outlook.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:47.720]   It's been a long--
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:48.720]   That looks on mobile.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.960]   It's pretty good.
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:52.040]   I've heard that it's good.
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:53.280]   I hate it outlook.
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:56.840]   Well, that was way back in the days, it changed days.
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:57.840]   I hated outlook.
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:58.320]   It was so bad.
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:35:59.160]   Well, use it for school.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:03.680]   And I'm surprised at how really clean and good it is.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:08.720]   Yeah, Microsoft's doing some pretty good apps for Android.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.160]   So I'm not surprised about that at all.
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:12.880]   I just exchanged server and active directory.
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:16.520]   Oh gosh, I couldn't stand it.
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.400]   It never worked right.
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:21.000]   And that is the Google change log.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:21.520]   Oh god.
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:25.280]   All right.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.600]   Bomb-bastic.
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:32.040]   Any last bits before we get into tips, tricks, and numbers
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:34.160]   and all that?
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:37.680]   I mean, we already talked about Zuckerberg's armpits.
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:38.600]   You're welcome.
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:42.040]   I bring such a high tone to show.
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:43.040]   I appreciate that.
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:45.800]   I appreciate that.
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:48.040]   Oh yeah, I'm scanning through.
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:54.400]   Oh, Jeff Bezos with his $130 billion net worth
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:57.400]   is creating the Bezos Earth Fund, $10 billion
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:03.640]   to a global initiative, his largest philanthropic effort so far.
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:06.360]   And that's good news, right?
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:08.560]   Some people are taking him to ask him, oh, he needs to give
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:09.160]   more money.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.120]   But I mean, it's not their money.
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.840]   It's his money.
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:14.680]   There's a lot of it.
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:18.440]   You can't attach on to you, Susan Wojci's story about YouTube
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:22.160]   paying $3 billion to the music industry.
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.840]   You know, I didn't get a chance to read it.
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.560]   Yeah, they argue that they've done that with the news
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.720]   industry and the music industry.
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.560]   And the people say, oh, all the money goes to Google.
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.640]   Google keeps saying, no, no, no, we pay a lot back out.
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:31.640]   Oh, OK.
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:35.400]   She had a blog that's on the street.
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:36.400]   I got a blog that's on the street.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:37.880]   It was.
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:39.320]   What was that, Mr. Jarvis?
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.160]   I said, I have a story.
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:43.320]   Mr. Jarvis with this story.
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.920]   Well, it's an obvious.
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:45.440]   I put it up.
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:48.440]   It's UK High Court.
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.040]   Well, let me explain the story.
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:54.880]   So a former cop tweeted some unwoke things
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:38:00.200]   about the discussion now about gender fluidity.
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:02.920]   It wasn't generally woke, but it wasn't.
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:03.680]   It was a discussion.
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:05.720]   Oh, this is an official document.
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:11.640]   So yes, so then a police officer came to the tweeter
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:16.160]   and said, according to the tweeters sworn statement,
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:19.720]   that the police officer said, I need to check your thinking.
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:24.880]   And the tweeter replied, so let me get the straight.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.440]   I've committed no crime.
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:29.520]   You're a police officer and you need to check my thinking.
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:31.320]   Police officer said, yes.
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:31.880]   Oh, boy.
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:35.000]   The tweeter said, have you any idea what that makes you?
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.160]   1984 is a dystopian novel, not a police training manual.
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.000]   So this case went up through the courts,
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:45.800]   and then the High Court ruled in favor of the tweeter
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.920]   and started off by quoting animal farms in Georgia
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.760]   or well.
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:52.280]   If liberty means anything at all,
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:56.160]   it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:00.440]   And at a time when the UK is debating
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:04.480]   how to deal with and I quote, harmful content.
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:09.880]   This is some sorry, but this becomes a preview of what we're
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:10.320]   going to see.
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.560]   And I always emphasize these moments.
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:15.440]   I'm a Kamala Harris Democrat in mourning.
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:17.680]   I'm going to sound like a libertarian right now,
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:19.880]   but I stand for freedom of expression.
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:23.440]   And this kind of stuff scares me when authorities take
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:28.840]   it's their job and to check people on their legal thoughts
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:32.320]   and to bring the force of law down upon them.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.920]   So I just wanted to raise this.
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:36.120]   Next time I scream moral panic on the show.
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:42.120]   Wow.
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:42.960]   Sorry.
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.640]   I did not get a chance to read through this.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:45.720]   No, you can't read the whole thing.
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.520]   No, it's like I knew I would have to summarize it for you.
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:48.240]   But it's pretty crazy.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.440]   No, I mean, that's very worrisome.
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:54.240]   These tweets were not woke, let's be honest.
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:56.520]   But it was a discussion.
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:58.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:01.280]   Well, that reminds me of another article, actually, that's
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:02.920]   in here.
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:05.920]   Let me see here scrolling up to Google.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:06.400]   Where is it?
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:07.640]   The Australian Court.
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:11.040]   So in Australia, an anonymous Google user left a bad review
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:13.440]   for a dental surgeon's business.
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:17.720]   Urge people to stay away, call the procedure extremely awkward
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:22.240]   and uncomfortable, which I mean, I feel like that's a valid--
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:25.960]   This was the news addition to the doc.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.480]   That's a valid view of someone's experience,
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.680]   is that it was extremely awkward and uncomfortable, maybe.
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:32.000]   It actually was.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.120]   The doctor got a judge in Australia
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:38.040]   to rule that he could pursue defamation
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:41.280]   and insist Google hand over identifiable details
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:43.000]   as a result of that.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.720]   That's defamation, really?
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:48.800]   Well, apparently, according to this judge in Australia--
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:51.440]   They'll argue that there's real harm.
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:52.680]   I mean, yeah.
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:56.600]   So is that suppression of important information as a result?
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:00.200]   I mean, maybe his experience was bad.
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:00.680]   Right.
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:02.360]   And of course, the doctor would not
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:05.320]   want someone to know if the experience was bad
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:09.160]   or someone would not want others to know that.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:12.160]   She doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to tell people.
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:13.360]   You leave a bad review.
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:16.120]   They normally-- the establishment normally gets back.
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:17.520]   So hey, we're sorry.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:21.160]   What can we do to make this bad review better or right?
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:22.720]   It was good establishment, would, yes.
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:26.840]   There are a lot of people that have come after Yelp and Google
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:32.920]   and various other reviewers for similar things to this.
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:33.760]   Dang.
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.280]   So I don't know.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:37.600]   That's an Australian court.
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:42.880]   So who knows how that reaches into other jurisdictions.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:45.640]   But kind of interesting.
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:48.760]   And especially just reading the review of me and like, all right,
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:50.760]   this feels kind of valid to me.
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:53.120]   If I had a really bad experience with the dentist,
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:56.040]   I would probably be pretty emphatic about like, yes,
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:56.760]   this happened.
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:57.560]   I didn't like it.
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:00.960]   I would recommend you don't see this person, you know, whatever.
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:02.720]   You have every right to share that.
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:05.320]   I would imagine so.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.200]   But you don't.
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:09.120]   I guess the difference is because this is trackable
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.880]   and being on the internet versus just telling your three
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:15.800]   or four neighbors in your neighborhood, your experience,
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.680]   and in person, if you will.
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:18.680]   Right.
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:19.480]   Wow.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:19.840]   Yeah.
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:21.320]   Well, our libel laws are different.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:22.400]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:24.640]   OK, in Australia.
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.200]   Yeah.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:26.880]   All right.
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:29.760]   Well, I think we've done it.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:30.520]   All--
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.200]   Puzzle tough.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:34.080]   All the news, every single piece of news from last week,
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:35.400]   we've already talked about it.
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:37.360]   So if we didn't talk about it, it didn't happen.
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:38.440]   It's just not worth talking about.
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:39.440]   Yes.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:41.440]   This isn't.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:42.440]   Let's do some picks.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:45.200]   Starting with you, Jeff, what's your number?
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:46.320]   What should I do here?
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:46.720]   OK.
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:49.040]   So numbers regarding Twitch.
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:50.240]   So I didn't know that--
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:54.480]   I saw something about Twitch having a chief revenue officer
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:56.080]   coming to speak at an event in New York.
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:57.240]   I thought, Twitch, revenue.
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:42:58.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:42:59.480]   It makes a lot of money.
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:02.280]   So as we talk about Facebook taking over the world,
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:03.360]   Google taking over the world, of course,
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:06.280]   don't forget that Amazon is poised to take over the world.
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:10.600]   They bought it in 2014 for $1.1 billion.
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:15.400]   It's market share of streaming however
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:16.160]   that's defined.
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:18.160]   These kinds of streaming things is 61%.
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:24.520]   A space including YouTube gaming, Facebook gaming, Microsoft
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:28.600]   Mixer with shares of 28, 9, and 3%, respectively.
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:30.920]   3.4 million monthly broadcasters,
[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:32.480]   15 million daily users.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:38.400]   And so the argument here is that it's poised to--
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:39.960]   and this is for Motley Fool.
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:43.200]   So they're trying to look at what stocks to buy--
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.760]   poised, rakin' billions.
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:47.080]   I tell you, billions.
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:50.280]   Millions of dollars.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:52.400]   Amazon does not disclose, of course.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:54.720]   One report from the information estimates, Twitch ad sales
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:44:02.600]   estimated at 230 million in 2018, 300 million last year.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:05.720]   But those fall short of the company's target of 500, 600
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:08.160]   million in ad revenue for 2019.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:09.200]   We'll see.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:12.160]   So I think it's-- Twitch is one of those things--
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:15.000]   because I'm too damned old because I still like my trio.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.200]   And I'm not cool like Kevin and play games
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:20.440]   in all these new, fangled, cloud game thing ways
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.120]   that I don't get.
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:24.360]   So I don't understand--
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:26.480]   I'm too old to understand Twitch.
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:28.800]   But I keep on ignoring it too much.
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:31.480]   I think it's too much of a force out there.
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:33.040]   So this is just a reminder.
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:36.400]   How many people watch the podcasts of this dear
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:37.880]   Enterprise on Twitch?
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:38.880]   I think a question.
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:40.440]   Yeah, I don't know the answer to that question.
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:40.720]   Look up.
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:42.640]   Do you have any ideas on that, Carson?
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:43.200]   I don't.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:45.400]   I don't know the numbers for that.
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:49.120]   But it is definitely one of our biggest channels
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:49.720]   for live stream.
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:51.240]   Yeah.
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:52.440]   Are there people who--
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:55.280]   it'd be interesting to have them like a science--
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:57.200]   bistro science here at 3,000.
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:00.560]   Somebody narrating watching Twitch.
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:03.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:03.480]   Oh boy.
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:05.000]   Only, oh.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.280]   You always see that.
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:10.800]   You're giving away a really good money-making opportunity
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:13.480]   is some enterprising fan out there.
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:16.600]   Let me just set this up right now.
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:17.280]   Yeah.
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:19.000]   It'll be our second channel.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.320]   It'll be like our MTV2 where we just have a staffer sit
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:23.920]   in front of--
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:24.680]   Don't do that.
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:26.120]   That's when MTV went downhill.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:27.320]   Yes, it's true.
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:27.840]   OK.
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:28.360]   All right.
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:33.160]   I'll wait till we'll have live streams of Apple fans
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:36.240]   and then live stream that to--
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:36.800]   Yes.
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:37.280]   OK.
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:37.720]   Right.
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:38.280]   Yeah.
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:38.560]   So--
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:39.720]   So he adds on talking--
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:44.000]   On Twitch 1, on Twitch TV 1, we will actually
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.600]   do the live coverage of the Apple event.
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:48.000]   On Twitch TV 2, we will do live coverage
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.280]   of the live coverage of the Apple event
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:54.320]   in a mystery science theater, 3,000 sort of way.
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:57.560]   I don't quite get his point that he was making there.
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:00.960]   Doesn't look like Leo got it either.
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:01.600]   No, no.
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.440]   It's not about what they're talking about.
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:04.560]   Apple's talking about it all.
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.320]   That's on Twitch 1.
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:10.680]   That's what 2 is entirely about how we're doing.
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:13.520]   See, Ant didn't iron his clothes today.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:15.720]   What does the shirt say?
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:16.640]   Yes, exactly.
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.080]   See?
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:21.160]   I think there's something to explore here.
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:23.120]   Kevin, what's your thing?
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:29.120]   So since I am taking a HTML CSS and JavaScript class,
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:32.720]   I've been coming across some very interesting projects
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.520]   that use those technologies and sharing them
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:35.520]   with my classmates.
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:39.000]   And my pick is one that I'm going to share with you guys
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.800]   that I shared with them last week.
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:45.040]   It's literally a game that was built by somebody who has only
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:50.080]   been studying web design for three months.
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:55.160]   And it's the most insanely addictive and difficult game.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:56.920]   I'm shocked that they put it together
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:46:59.480]   after just three months of learning how to program.
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:03.120]   But you have to see this game because apparently,
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:08.600]   it is kind of replicating the vision test in Spain
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.160]   when you go for driver's license.
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:12.240]   And I cannot confirm that because I'm not from Spain.
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:13.520]   I've never been.
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:15.320]   But I'm like, oh, this doesn't sound too hard.
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:19.880]   You've got to guide a little dot around a zigzagging road.
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:21.880]   But there's two dots and two rows.
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:23.480]   And you control them independently.
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:23.920]   That's awesome.
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:26.040]   And it makes this annoying honking sound
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:28.520]   when you get out of your lane.
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:29.840]   Oh, God, this is really hard.
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:31.440]   That's pretty awesome.
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:34.440]   It's hard to do with two different dots, two fingers,
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:36.440]   and all that.
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:37.920]   I don't like this.
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:39.720]   Yeah, yeah, I hear you.
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:42.640]   But I thought that it's amazing that somebody with just
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:44.200]   three months of experience learning
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:46.600]   out of code for the web wasn't able to do that.
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:49.000]   That's really impressive to me.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000]   Oh, man, this is really--
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:50.960]   You hate to make Donkey Kong.
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:53.920]   I thought the same thing when I saw that.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:54.680]   Rejected.
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.440]   I learned how to make Donkey Kong.
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:57.920]   Dang, I need better reflexes.
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:59.280]   My coordination test failed.
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:01.280]   Great.
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:06.320]   Now I'm going to have to play that more and get 100%.
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:07.320]   Good luck.
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:08.280]   Yeah, good luck, Ryan.
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:11.280]   You can step away from your developer preview to play it again.
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:12.280]   Yes.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:13.280]   Yeah.
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:14.280]   And it works on Trios as well.
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:16.280]   OK, good.
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:19.280]   You're welcome, Jeff.
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:20.280]   Argh.
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:24.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:28.280]   Oh, my God, I'm scared.
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:30.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:32.280]   And quick, what you got?
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:36.000]   I have a great resource from one of my friends at Adobe.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.800]   Mr. Jason Levine is the principal worldwide evangelist
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:43.280]   of Premiere Pro and audio at Adobe.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:47.520]   And I learned a lot from him far as editing the audio
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:50.160]   and just going through Adobe Audition and Premiere Pro.
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:54.480]   And he has a free playlist on his own personal YouTube
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:56.400]   channel, even though he's an Adobe guy.
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:58.360]   But this is his own stuff.
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:02.760]   So he speaks quite freely, I should say, from time to time
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:05.440]   is some of his videos about the process and so forth.
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:08.960]   But he does a really good job of breaking down
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:13.720]   the ins and outs of properly editing audio for your videos
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:16.320]   or just mixing for your music if you're
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:17.840]   trying to put an album together.
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:21.120]   And it's a really, really good course.
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:22.240]   Love it.
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:22.880]   That's great.
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:24.080]   So let's see here.
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:30.360]   So it's a whole series of videos, a whole playlist, all around.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:31.760]   And this is Adobe Audition.
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:33.160]   It's all Adobe Audition.
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:35.960]   But he explains it in the fundamental that.
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:36.320]   Yes.
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.240]   Because you can still put this in.
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:39.840]   And another, was it Pro Tools?
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:41.840]   Yeah, you could still look like Pro Tools.
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:43.200]   Yeah.
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:44.120]   Right on.
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:45.560]   Love it.
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:48.280]   Yeah, some of those fundamentals are really hard to understand
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.360]   like compression is one thing.
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:52.520]   Compression is one thing that people have a really hard time with.
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:55.960]   So if you get someone who knows how to explain it and kind of show
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:59.120]   off the phone minutes of that, it goes a long way.
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:00.960]   Yeah, totally.
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:04.280]   My tool is-- well, it's an upcoming tool.
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:06.440]   I figured I would just use this opportunity
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:07.760]   to promote my new show.
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:09.200]   Boy, I need to hit the other one.
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:12.440]   Because it kind of falls in line with tools and tips
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:13.480]   and all that stuff.
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:16.320]   It launches tomorrow with episode one.
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:18.480]   It's called Hands-On Android.
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:22.880]   And really, it's just meant to be tips, tricks, explainers,
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:27.200]   kind of deep dives into just the different facets of Android.
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:31.000]   And hopefully, it can kind of take you from Android novice
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.920]   to Android doer, Android Pro, whatever you want to call it.
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:37.560]   And so tomorrow's episode is episode one.
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:41.760]   It's a focus on digital well-being, kind of the tools
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:43.120]   and functions of digital well-being
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.360]   and how you can use it to kind of craft your time
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:46.640]   with your smartphone.
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:48.460]   If I was nimble enough, I would
[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:52.000]   have episode one be about an Android 11 preview
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.480]   that just announced this morning.
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:56.080]   But there's no way to get it recorded and edited in time
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:57.080]   for tomorrow.
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:57.580]   Oh, come on.
[01:50:57.580 --> 01:50:58.480]   So that's not going to--
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:50:59.480]   You know you accept that too.
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:01.200]   A deeper analysis will occur.
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:02.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:04.000]   But that's my hope also with this show.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.400]   My plan with it is to have it be the platform
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:10.640]   to do deep dives into things like a new OS update.
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:12.560]   That sort of stuff to be able to show those features.
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:15.320]   With.tv/hua.
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:15.840]   Hua!
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:18.240]   HOA for Hands-On Android.
[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:19.740]   It's going to be great, dude.
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:20.900]   Yeah, starts tomorrow.
[01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:22.100]   So I'm very excited about that.
[01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:22.820]   Hey, awesome.
[01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:23.340]   Awesome.
[01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:24.620]   Thank you.
[01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:27.340]   But that is it for this week's show.
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:30.780]   This week in Google is all is finito.
[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:34.680]   It's finished and could not have done it without you three
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:35.140]   gentlemen.
[01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:36.580]   So thank you so much for hopping on.
[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:37.540]   Hey, good job.
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:40.020]   Kevin Tofill, thank you for taking some time
[01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:42.780]   to hang out with us about Chromebooks.
[01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:46.020]   Aboutchromebooks.com is the website
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:48.600]   that people can go to follow all of your musings
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:50.260]   about Chromebooks, right?
[01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:51.180]   That is correct.
[01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:51.980]   And thanks for having me.
[01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:52.540]   I appreciate it.
[01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:55.880]   About Chromebooks and about Chromebooks that he finds.
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:57.740]   You can't leave that out because he always
[01:51:57.740 --> 01:52:00.740]   posts about little snippets of code that he finds, too.
[01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:02.340]   Nice.
[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:04.460]   Aboutchromebooks.com.
[01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:07.420]   And then Jeff Jarvis, BuzzMachine.com,
[01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:09.940]   anything else you want to throw out there before?
[01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:12.060]   I can't decide.
[01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:14.700]   Another Jeff opportunity for anyone who's--
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:16.180]   I know Mr. Kevin has it.
[01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:19.580]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:21.500]   Always so much fun doing the show with you.
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:23.020]   Pixel 5, invitation.
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:27.900]   That's right.
[01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:28.580]   Well done, Kevin.
[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:29.700]   Well done.
[01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:30.540]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:33.500]   And thank you, and always fun doing the show next to you here.
[01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:34.780]   Twit.tv/hop.
[01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:36.100]   Slash hop, baby.
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:36.620]   Focus.
[01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:37.180]   Not focus.
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:38.820]   Hands-home photography.
[01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:39.700]   Hands-home photography.
[01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:41.940]   We twit.tv/hop.
[01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:43.340]   Good old tips and tricks.
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:44.500]   Yeah.
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:48.140]   A little bit of tutorials that go on through Lightroom Photoshop
[01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:50.020]   and showing you how to use those tools.
[01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:54.300]   And tomorrow's episode is going to be another fun one.
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:56.700]   Building upon some of the stuff that we've talked about
[01:52:56.700 --> 01:52:57.380]   previously.
[01:52:57.380 --> 01:52:58.940]   Because that's how you learn.
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:01.140]   You build, you build, you build.
[01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:02.900]   Practice and build.
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:04.220]   Practice and build.
[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:06.500]   And you can kind of see there's a little bit of a theme
[01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:08.300]   with our shows recently, right?
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:08.780]   Oh, no.
[01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:10.940]   Seems like something about hands.
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:12.300]   Having hands on things.
[01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:13.300]   Seems like it.
[01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:14.260]   So technology.
[01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:14.820]   Yeah.
[01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:15.540]   It's kind of a theme.
[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:16.260]   Seems like it.
[01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:18.220]   I'm going to do the show Hands-off the internet.
[01:53:18.220 --> 01:53:22.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:22.140 --> 01:53:23.540]   Techno--
[01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:24.340]   In parentheses.
[01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:24.940]   Technopanic.
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:25.500]   Technopanic.
[01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:26.540]   Yeah, in my printing.
[01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:27.540]   My printing press.
[01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:28.540]   Technopanic.
[01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:30.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:32.020]   Right, thank you, Carsten.
[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:33.660]   Thank you, Kevin.
[01:53:33.660 --> 01:53:35.100]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:36.300]   Thank you, and--
[01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:37.340]   Yeah, thank you, chat room.
[01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:38.740]   And thank you, everyone, for watching.
[01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:39.820]   This has been a lot of fun.
[01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:41.940]   It's always fun to be able to hop in and do this.
[01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:47.580]   Twit.tv/twig is where you can go to subscribe to the show.
[01:53:47.580 --> 01:53:49.940]   If you haven't already subscribed, hopefully you have.
[01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:51.660]   But if you haven't, you've got all the links there
[01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:53.420]   with which to do so.
[01:53:53.420 --> 01:53:54.700]   You can find all the episodes.
[01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:59.300]   Audio and video are on the page, as well as links to the feeds.
[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:02.620]   And I mean, you can do all that stuff on the page,
[01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:04.140]   or you can do it in your favorite podcast,
[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:05.980]   or whatever it happens to be.
[01:54:05.980 --> 01:54:08.540]   I would just say just subscribe, so you don't miss any episodes.
[01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:12.940]   Twit.tv/twig.
[01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:16.300]   And we record live every Wednesday, 4 p.m. Eastern, 1 p.m.
[01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:18.220]   Pacific, 2,100 UTC.
[01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:19.300]   If you want to watch live, you can.
[01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:22.580]   Twit.tv/live is the place to go.
[01:54:22.580 --> 01:54:24.180]   That is it for this week.
[01:54:24.180 --> 01:54:27.300]   Thanks to everyone for another wonderful show of this week.
[01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:28.660]   Google will see you all next week.
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:29.580]   Bye, everybody.

[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:35.780]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:38.360]   (upbeat music)
