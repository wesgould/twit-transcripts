[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.500]   I don't know why, but I always say Google,
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.500]   the show where we cover Google, Facebook, Twitter,
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.500]   the Googleverse, the cloud, anything we want to talk about.
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.500]   And a lot of times, it's things like news and media
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.500]   because Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.500]   Professor of Journalism at CUNY, the city university of New York
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.500]   blogger at buzzmachine.com, author of a great many books,
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.500]   including Geeks bearing gifts, his latest,
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.500]   and what would Google do in public parts,
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.500]   and Elphin de los medios de communicaciÃ³n de masas.
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.500]   That's, is that Geeks bearing gifts?
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.500]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.500]   The end of...
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.500]   The joke doesn't work. The end of...
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.500]   Mass media, basically.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.500]   Media communication.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.500]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.500]   The joke doesn't work in Spanish.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   No, it doesn't work in Spanish.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500]   I guess that's a good point.
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.500]   If you use an idiomatic saying...
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.500]   It's been all three books of mine have been the same problem.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.500]   Yeah.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.500]   What would Google do?
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.500]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.500]   Joke doesn't work. Public parts.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.500]   Joke doesn't work.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500]   Jeff, you're very chauvinistic.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.500]   Very US.
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.500]   I am. I am.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.500]   I just got accused of that.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.500]   By a Finnish journalist, just accused me of that on Twitter.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.500]   Just not the case.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   You're the most global man I know.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   We're so glad to get you back from New Delhi 24 hours.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.500]   But I hear a shortle that makes me,
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.500]   my heart pitted Pat a little bit.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   I believe Gina Trapani is in her house.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.500]   I got a gig of YouTube.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.500]   I love your shortle.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.500]   Twitter celebrates.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   Yeah, we love Gina.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.500]   Gina, of course, founding editor at lifehacker.com.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.500]   She's got her own startup, which is called ThinkUp.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.500]   ThinkUp.com.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   She's got a new project she wants to tell us about in a little bit.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.500]   It's so great to have you back.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.500]   Gina only comes here once a month now because she's so busy with her startup.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.500]   But it's sure nice to have you when you do come in.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.500]   It is great to be here.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.500]   I miss you guys.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.500]   It's nice to take a break from head down coding.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.500]   Yeah, head down coding.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.500]   Sometimes you got to look up and talk to talk to humans.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.500]   What's the new thing?
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.500]   So we got a new thing.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.500]   It's called Makerbase.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.500]   You're also a little goofy.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500]   It's MakerBA.se.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.500]   Wow.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.500]   You got the Swedish one.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.500]   Yeah, we did.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.500]   We got the Swedish one.
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.500]   Wow.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   I like it.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.500]   Yeah, it's invitation only at the moment because it's really, really, really,
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.500]   really, really, really important because it's really broken and early and working on it.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.500]   But if you are interested and you want in and you're listening to the show, just tweet
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.500]   at me and tell me that you heard about it on Twig and I will get you in there.
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.500]   So here's what it says.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.500]   You make great things.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.500]   Tell the world what you made.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.500]   So it's for app creators.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.500]   It's for digital creators.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.500]   So not just apps.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   Apps, games, podcasts, shows, anyone that's making any sort of piece of digital culture.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.500]   So we would.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.500]   You would absolutely count.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.500]   Oh, good.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   It's about projects and makers, not companies, not titles.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.500]   Right.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.500]   We're talking about like digital things and their makers.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.500]   And by maker, I don't mean coder.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.500]   I mean everything.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.500]   I mean, we mean everything.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.500]   Designers, writers, project managers, legal help.
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.500]   I mean, investors, everyone that who helped bring an app that you love to fruition, we
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   want to capture in Makerbase.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.500]   And then what will we get out of this?
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.500]   Is it going to be like a crunch base for makers or?
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.500]   You know, some people have made that comparison.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.500]   I mean, one of our lofty goals, and this is me and my co-founder, Anil, at ThinkUp.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.500]   You know, this conversation we've had is like, there's always like a point in your career
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.500]   where you like talk to that person where you kind of like, you get your big break.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.500]   Like somebody takes a chance on you or, you know, gives you, gives you a job or, or, or,
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.500]   or sparks an idea in you.
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.500]   And that that's kind of when your career takes off.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.500]   So our idea is like, if we can make the, like the credit role of behind the apps that you
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.500]   love, transparent, you know, if we can have the liner notes for apps, just like, you know,
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.860]   CDs have them with IMDB for apps, the way that movies has them, that I'll make it easier
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.500]   for people to say, oh, how, you know, who do I need to talk to to find out more about
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   how this happened or who are the people that work together a lot?
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.500]   Like you'll see these kind of power couples or power teams go through several, you know,
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.500]   projects like Evan Biz, you know, we'll go through audio and medium and blogger and, you know,
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.500]   and Twitter.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   So we want to kind of make the, we want to make the network of, of, of creators, of makers
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.500]   and kind of transparent to help people, you know, see the faces behind, you know, what
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.500]   we made and honestly to help, you know, for underrepresented folks to find their pathways
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.500]   in and make those big breaks happen.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.500]   To put it in my terms, it's bylines.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   Yeah, it's bylines, exactly.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.500]   Here's, here's Gina at presume you made this entry.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.500]   I did.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.500]   I did it.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.500]   Everything is editable by everybody.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.500]   So this shows like Wikipedia too.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.500]   It's like Wikipedia.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.500]   The show counts.
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.500]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.500]   The show is a project for sure.
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.500]   Yep.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.500]   Medium count.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.500]   You're writing on medium, Jeff.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.500]   I think I added medium for you.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.220]   And then each person has a role in a project and a role could be like, you know, I made a
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.500]   suggestion on how to make the logo better and the role could be, I founded it, you know,
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.500]   there's like, that's nice.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.500]   Yeah.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.500]   I just say, yeah.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.700]   My latest chapter from the book on medium that was not meant to be a plug, sorry, is about
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.500]   what I think I've talked about in the show is, is what I call credit rate.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.580]   Rather than copyright, the need to give credit to people for whatever deal may come down
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.260]   in the pike in this, in the string of creative, collaborative creation online.
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.660]   And this is, this is a start to that.
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.660]   That's really, really important.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.700]   I think it's a directory though, essentially.
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.700]   Okay.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.700]   And a opens directory.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.140]   You have a good example.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:11.940]   There's also, doesn't, didn't Mozilla have a similar kind of open database of stuff?
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:12.940]   This is good.
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.940]   I like this a lot.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.380]   There are a lot of projects like this.
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.380]   There's like AngelList and GeekList and dribble.
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.060]   I mean, there's a lot of communities for people who do particular things, but this is very
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.820]   maker and project focus.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.180]   So tell me who made super and what that was like.
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.460]   And eventually we like to add like Q and A and, you know, ask questions.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.460]   I like that idea.
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.460]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.460]   And it's really cool.
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.420]   Like we showed this to, to, of Williams actually, and we had added him as like the founder of
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.420]   Blogger.
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.940]   And you can see the edits that people make to their own page.
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.660]   So he actually edited his role in Blogger to add that he had written some code.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.340]   Oh, I actually wrote the code.
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.340]   Right.
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.180]   This was a billionaire and he really wanted to get in there that he had written some like
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.740]   ASP, you know, like very funny.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.620]   Where did you get this avatar of me?
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.620]   Okay.
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.780]   So everything right now we're doing autofills from Twitter primarily.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.340]   So that's, so when I made this entry for you, Leo, this Twitter avatar, that's why I changed
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.500]   my Twitter avatar.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.740]   So yeah, you can click on the edit button anywhere and change it and change it.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.740]   So that's your role.
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.740]   So you go to your page.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.740]   Got it.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.740]   I can edit that.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.940]   There's an edit button on the top right there.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.580]   And again, this is really awesome.
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.580]   Avatar URL can be different.
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.580]   Got it.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.580]   Yeah, we, we have to make obviously uploading or changing images a little bit, a little
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.780]   bit nicer than you are.
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.780]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.780]   Especially that image.
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.500]   That was my Twitter handle, Twitter image for a brief period of time that people have
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.460]   explained to me, it looked like I was dying in a vat of acid or something.
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.420]   It's an amazing photo.
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.620]   I'm not, I'm not vain.
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.620]   Let's put it that way.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.620]   I don't know.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:45.300]   Because that is not a flattering picture of me there.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.980]   All right, I'll fix that.
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.980]   But this is cool.
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.580]   I love this idea and you wrote this all from scratch.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.580]   I did.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.580]   I did.
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.580]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.860]   We were using a bunch of code from, from think up and that framework that I've written
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.540]   when we learned a lot of lessons from think up and we want to make the data entry as,
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.540]   you know, we want to make it fun, right?
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.860]   Because we don't want to give people a job to set up yet another resume.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.860]   But we want this to sort of differentiate itself enough from LinkedIn and from those
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.900]   kind of other networks to make it worthwhile.
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.300]   We want this to be the place where people go to see the liner notes for an app.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.300]   Nice.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.140]   I love that you have these geno touches.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.780]   Roll raised horn.
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:25.340]   There's a definite genus sense of whimsi, whimsy.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.180]   I like, I like writing goofy coffee and then somehow it doesn't get caught.
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:34.940]   I hope you go with a bunch that, that just go in there like, you know, order the tacos.
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.860]   Or do the tacos is all that's a good one.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.260]   Or do the tacos.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.900]   I'm the taco orderer.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.900]   Brought the donuts.
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.900]   Complained incessantly.
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.900]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.900]   I'm going to add bugs.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:46.900]   I heard a catch.
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.900]   Yes.
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.740]   I'll see if I can find it better.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.740]   It is totally.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.420]   Here's my, this is going to be my new avatar photo.
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.420]   I think.
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.420]   What do you think?
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.420]   Oh, you are a beautiful woman.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.420]   I have to talk.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.420]   That is some great.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.420]   I've never seen.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.420]   That's a great photo.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.420]   A lot of work went into that.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.660]   No, this is actually, actually it's very cool.
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.260]   L'Oreal makes a, an iOS app that puts makeup on you.
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.260]   Was that what it is?
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.660]   I thought your wife was tormenting you.
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.780]   No, this is done programmatically.
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.660]   She just had hold still and it's actually kind of amazing.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.540]   She did the same thing to herself, but there's no, that one's not, that one's a little
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.540]   obviously creepy.
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.060]   This is, this is me.
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.060]   That's this is creepy too.
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.180]   You know, it is so well done.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.180]   The shadows and the darkness.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.180]   It looks real.
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.780]   I'm sure that Lisa had like pinned you down and did makeup.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:38.780]   I know.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:46.180]   I'm going to save the image and make it my, my, my, my, my, my new Twitter handle.
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.180]   Twitter profile.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.180]   Isn't that great?
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.180]   All right.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.580]   So nice, nice job on that.
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.580]   Let me go back to the.
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.180]   This was a 20% you said.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.180]   Make your base here.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.620]   Yeah, this was a 20% thing.
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.620]   What does that mean?
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.620]   Well, you know, we were slogging through some like back end projects around payments and,
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.420]   and the Facebook API changes at ThinkUp.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.180]   And honestly, it was, it was hard.
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.220]   And so the, we did make our bases kind of a productive distraction.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.220]   We did Fridays.
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.220]   We did the barge, Gina.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.220]   Yeah, let's write some more code.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.220]   What do you say?
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.580]   This is a, this is a Neil's idea.
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.500]   He had this idea in 2011 and he talked me about it back then.
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.020]   And I remember feeling this twinge of, Oh, I really want to work on that.
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.300]   And, but we were too busy.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.300]   We were too busy with ThinkUp.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.300]   And finally I said to him, listen, let's, let's just build this thing.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.300]   It was his idea.
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.300]   He had talked to a bunch of people about it.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.620]   A few people had actually started it and never shipped.
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.060]   And I was like, let's just do it.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.900]   Uh, so yeah, this was our, this was our Friday, uh, fun day.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.900]   Amazing.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.020]   And it's fairly, it looks, it seems very stable and fast and reliable.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.420]   From your mouth to the, uh, it's really good.
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.980]   I mean, it's a, you know, we have Jacey and things Leo.
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:48.980]   Don't forget.
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:49.980]   You know what?
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.940]   Uh, we've just sent a thousand people there easily.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:53.940]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.180]   And it's handling the traffic very smoothly.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.180]   What's your back end?
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.780]   Oh, this is a straight straight up lamp stack.
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.980]   Uh, you don't run your own servers though.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.340]   No, we've got on the Linno box.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.100]   This particular one, we're on AWS for ThinkUp, but we have our staging kind of play, play
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.980]   sandbox servers on Linno and we actually put the maker based on Linno.
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:13.980]   Oh, Nate.
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.780]   Uh, so, uh, yeah, it's, it's perfectly fine.
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.780]   Like I said, it's invitation only.
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.780]   So people who are going to, who don't have signed and rights are just giving us their
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.780]   Twitter credentials.
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.900]   So there's not, not a lot of, not a lot.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.860]   That's probably why we haven't brought it down yet.
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:26.860]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.580]   Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.300]   But you know, this is great because if you love Gina Trapani, you could come here and,
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.380]   uh, just like you would on IMDB, you'd see every movie that somebody was in.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.340]   You'd see all the products that, uh, projects that Gina's worked on in the days.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.540]   It's not exactly a resume.
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.100]   In fact, because these are all direct links, right?
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.100]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.100]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.300]   It's kind of, it's also like a GitHub for non-gities.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.300]   Yes.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.300]   You know?
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.900]   This is, this is, this is my frustration is that there are all these communities for coders,
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.980]   but I just, you know, we want everybody to learn to code.
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.060]   And I think that that's a good idea, but I, I don't, I've really come to this place where
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:04.860]   I realize that being a coder, like doesn't necessarily mean that you're the one creating,
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.860]   creating this stuff, right?
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.060]   Like there's so much more to coding apps and games and, and, and to create a sort of
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.860]   coder that's generous of you.
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:12.860]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.900]   Well, I mean, as a coder, I'm really privileged.
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.900]   Not much more.
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.900]   Just a little more.
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.900]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.460]   People think I have some sort of superpower.
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.460]   It's like, I have this idea.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:23.300]   And if I only code and I could make it happen, but like, that's why I'm saying it.
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.420]   Look at this.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:29.420]   You made this and you made it fairly quickly, I'm guessing.
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.300]   I just, that's, that's a superpower.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.460]   That's a hell of a superpower.
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.260]   But without writers and designers and even people to do your privacy policy and logo,
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.340]   I mean, there's just, there's so, there's so much else that goes into it.
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.340]   Right.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.820]   And you know, like, did you know that this was PHP?
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.780]   Like, you know, there, there's part, a good product sort of make the technology behind
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.780]   them invisible.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.500]   And I think that that makes a, you know, a different skill set.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.980]   So you should say that because we were talking about Appcamp for girls yesterday on Mac Break
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:59.660]   Weekly and a Kelly Goumont who's a counselor there.
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.780]   They may, they have an app that just came out, but she said that's one of the things that
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.900]   the girls learn at Appcamp is you don't have to be a coder.
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.900]   They need, you need designer.
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.620]   You need all these people.
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.940]   It's no application is just some person writing code.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.780]   No, the real skill to teach is going to be working in teams.
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.220]   I mean, that's, that's what we'll see about journalism is that we don't work in teams.
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.860]   We're lone wolf, we should play more world of warcraft.
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.540]   Oh, that would teach you.
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:27.580]   I mean, there's, there is this like lone wolf kind of mythology around coders as well.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.580]   And that's true.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.180]   And that's not, that's not, it's, it's about your ability to get the right people together
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.140]   and collaborate and lead.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.140]   Right.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.660]   I mean, most founders, sure, have did some ASP coding on blog early on, right?
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.740]   But most founders do, you know, they wear lots of different hats.
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.700]   And I think there's a lot of invisible aspects to do an app.
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.980]   Everything said that you should all learn Lisp right now.
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:53.180]   M A K E R B A dot S E.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.740]   That's not hard to, it's just, it's sweet.
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.540]   How do you say it with a Swedish accent?
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.540]   Make your base.
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.540]   Make your base.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.540]   Make your base.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.300]   All our, all our Swedish viewers, and we have quite a few are just hating us right
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.300]   now.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.300]   That's right.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.300]   How do you get a dot S E?
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.740]   You just go to the Sweden, Nick and.
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.820]   Oh, I, I think we, I'm pretty sure we just used hover.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.580]   You have to submit some little extra paperwork that, that you don't for a dot com.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.260]   But I forget that anymore have to be in that country to use the country code.
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.260]   And no, you don't.
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.780]   I think you have to submit like the tax number of the organization or something.
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.060]   I hope you don't get a Swedish tax bill now.
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.060]   That's real fun.
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.420]   You might get a Swedish tax bill.
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.420]   You're doing business in Sweden.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.420]   Oh geez.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.420]   Oh geez.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.420]   Oh, it's okay.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:39.660]   Because they've got great healthcare there.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.180]   It's wonderful hearing and great song.
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.180]   I love Sweden.
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.180]   I love Sweden.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.180]   I adore.
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.180]   I love it.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.260]   And you're going to Finland, which I also, I'm Scandinavia is great, but it's very different.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.340]   You know, the Finnish do not consider themselves, you know, part of that Scandinavian Norway,
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.980]   Sweden, Denmark thing.
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.540]   There's be Korean.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.540]   There, it's a, yeah, well, it's a russo.
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.380]   It's a very different language.
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:07.220]   And yeah, it's like Korean, which is really bizarre when you say that.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.340]   You're going to Helsinki for what?
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.340]   Newsgeist, Google.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.340]   Newsgeist.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.340]   So they do site.
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.220]   I don't think we talked about this.
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.660]   I don't think we talked about this.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.500]   No, it was last Monday.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:25.780]   So Google has made a friendship pact with so far eight publishers in Europe, the Guardian,
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:33.300]   El Pais, the Republic of the site, Fad set, I'm forgetting who else.
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.860]   Sorry about that.
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.140]   And you know, you know, from the show, if you ever listen to the show, you know how
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:44.620]   the German publishers go after Google, especially Akshen Springer and Burda and Google led by
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.220]   the Guardian pulled together consortium.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:51.980]   I was a part of the meeting at Davos where this was hammered out a bit.
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:58.260]   And so Google is agreeing to work on product development to give a, I'm not crazy for this
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:03.980]   idea, but a 150 million euro innovation fund rather like the French bribery fund, blackmail
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:10.420]   fund and to do training and fellowships and that kind of stuff and have this newscast.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:15.700]   And it's, to me, the success of this will be, as we put it at the Guardian, as I put it,
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:21.260]   whether the real action here happens in Mountain View, whether Mountain View cares about news,
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:27.660]   whether product cares about news, whether they recognize news as part of the mission
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:31.620]   of organizing the world's information and whether they recognize the business models
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:36.620]   around that, whether they come to mutually beneficial real business deals, not just blackmail.
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.380]   And whether they spread this past Europe where they're just putting oil on squeaky wheels,
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:46.420]   but having given those caveats, I'm encouraged that both Google and Facebook are paying attention
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.540]   to news companies right now.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.780]   And so this is a big deal.
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.020]   So they're having this newsgeist thing.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:56.260]   They have one in Phoenix for American publishers, mainly mostly American publishers and journalists
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.300]   and academics and so on.
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.820]   So months ago, another doing the European one, and then so I horned my way in.
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:04.820]   Neat.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.940]   You should be there of all people.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:07.940]   I thought so.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:08.940]   I thought so.
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:09.940]   Yeah.
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.580]   And I think I commend Google because I think this is the way to do it.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:18.980]   You could, you could fight, you can go to court, you can pull your, take your bar up ball
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.980]   and go home.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.820]   But it's always an opportunity to talk and to work out something, I think.
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:25.820]   Yeah, it is.
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:32.020]   And the German publishers, the ones who don't like Google will say, well, we're not cheap.
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:41.100]   I argued that the real goal here is not money, not some bribery payment, blackmail payment.
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.940]   The real goal here is mutually beneficial business deals.
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.180]   And to me, those are going to be based on exchange of data, which is going to be hard
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.700]   in Europe, but I think it's critical.
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.500]   Again, you know, my spiel here.
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.700]   And that Google knows us in ways that publishers simply do not.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.380]   Google knows more about our content than we do.
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:03.220]   And the more that Google can make us smarter and so we can do our jobs better, the more
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:07.180]   benefit that will bring to news companies at their core.
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.940]   So that's the, that's, that's what's going on there.
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:15.700]   Meanwhile, Facebook has met with a bunch of publishers and released four new things that
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:21.100]   we talked about before in December and reportedly they're setting up this new structure where
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.140]   publishers will be able to publish their content directly on Facebook.
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.820]   So people and mobile will not go off and link off from Facebook.
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:32.780]   Reportedly, none of this is known and I don't know, there'll be a generous revenue share,
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:38.500]   even up to 100% for advertising on that news, news content on Facebook.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.420]   There are some big important issues to discuss around this about, you know, Google, I mean,
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.180]   Facebook becomes not just a news stand.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.700]   It becomes an editor of the news.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.180]   It decides what goes where and there are issues to discuss there.
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.820]   But again, I think there's, there's, there's a great starting point to have that discussion.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.100]   I just noticed that it's funny.
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.540]   Facebook's always tweaking their algorithm that I feel like the news feed is better than
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.900]   all for me personally in the last few weeks.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.340]   You know what I like best is the, is the, is the extra relevant.
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.180]   Oh, you know, here's the story and then here's three more that are related to that.
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.740]   I do like that.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.020]   It's working well, I think.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.700]   Yeah, that works really well.
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.260]   They also are doing interest targeting.
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.260]   Go ahead, Jim.
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.220]   I thought they just made an announcement fairly recently that they were actually going to
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:25.100]   dial down the amount of links from brands and publishers and dial up in, you know, your
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.020]   friend like actual news from your friends.
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.020]   Exactly.
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.020]   Yes.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.220]   And which, and they said, we're going to do this and we know that it's going to, you
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.540]   know, hurt our bottom line, but we're going to do it because of what we hear from users.
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.180]   Is that what you're seeing, Leo?
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.540]   Um, like is that what's making your new?
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:42.940]   I think maybe that is it because one of the things I didn't like is, you know, I thought
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.100]   Facebook was going to be away from me to stay in touch with family and friends.
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.060]   To be me, I thought that was the point of it.
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.940]   And they very much moved away from that with the news feed.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.900]   You could still, you know, on the news feed go chronological instead of top stories.
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.540]   But if you look at top stories, it's, for a long time, it was a lot of brands, a lot
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.540]   of crap.
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:07.980]   I was seeing a lot of up worthy style link bait and I just wasn't interested and much
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.180]   more so now it's, it's friends and family.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:15.740]   Although I, I feel like it's very algorithmic because I certainly don't see everything by
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:16.740]   any means.
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.660]   Um, yeah, I'll see like a big announcement of, you know, somebody's having a baby or getting
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.740]   married, but it was like a, you know, a week ago or something, but it just, it, so many
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.620]   people liked it over time that it bubbled up.
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.980]   So it feels like, oh, this is a little bit later, but at least I am seeing it.
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.300]   I had noticed that it's been better.
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.220]   My news feed's been a little bit better in the little time that I spent on Facebook.
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.100]   Anyway, Jeff, I didn't, I didn't mean to cut you off.
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:41.260]   I think that whole thing about publishers hosting their content on Facebook, it just
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.900]   at first glance just seems insane.
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.780]   You know, what, what?
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.780]   Well, yeah.
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.780]   I don't know.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.820]   Talk, talk, talk, talk to me about this, Jeff, because.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.820]   Well, all right.
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.420]   Here's the other problems are obvious, right?
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.900]   Um, uh, you're handing over your content to Facebook.
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.820]   And if you believe content is the only value you make, uh, then that's an issue.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.980]   Uh, I would argue that what, what's more dangerous is if you hand over your relationship
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:09.340]   to your reader to Facebook, but that again is where Facebook, I think, can do something
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.340]   about it.
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.180]   I wrote a post about what Facebook could do for news.
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:17.100]   And my argument is that Facebook can make news publishers smarter about their own users
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.980]   far better than they know so that they can give those users greater relevance and greater
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.900]   value and increase the value of news organizations.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.980]   So I think that's possible.
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.620]   That's not what's been talked about yet.
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.540]   It's not there in the cards yet, but they haven't said what they're going to do yet.
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:36.940]   Now, meanwhile, at one level, you've got to recognize that people are not a lesson, less
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.820]   and less, they are going to go to news sites.
[00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.300]   And so we must go to where the readers are.
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.540]   There's a page based web and now there's a stream based web and Facebook has the stream
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.020]   based web and stream based webs are about attention.
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:56.060]   And so you want to get into that attention stream somehow and, and Facebook recognizes
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:01.180]   the clicking off, especially on mobile from the link on Facebook to open up a browser.
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:05.020]   No matter how fast the site is a bad user experience, you're going to lose traffic a
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.020]   lot of the way.
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.020]   So we'll Facebook.
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:11.220]   So they said, spider to the fly, come here and put your content here.
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:15.860]   Well, then to me, that all matters simply is about business deal.
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:20.540]   If the content is in, I've long argued, you've heard from the show, if content were embeddable
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:25.500]   on these platforms with the business model attached to that content, then there's every
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.460]   reason to let your content fly.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:32.780]   And the business model to me means one, your brand is attached to your, there's revenue
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:36.860]   attached, whether that's your advertising or the host's advertising or a revenue share.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.820]   That's just a matter of negotiation.
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.460]   Three, this is the important part.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.340]   Data attached, analytics attached that you know that, that you know this reader is interested
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.860]   in something and you can give them more relevance as a result.
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.780]   And Facebook doesn't hold on to that information alone.
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.140]   That's, that's, that's the big issue to me.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.140]   And that's unknown.
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.220]   And then four links to you.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.500]   You still have a site, but a site may be more like an archive now.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.940]   A site may become less important.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:04.420]   So, so you find, you know, if you look at Snapchat, discover publishers are going there.
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.940]   They're getting paid for it.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:10.700]   You want to be on Pinterest, mode media, the former Glam just announced a whole big new
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.660]   platform, which, which curates stuff.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.420]   Publishers can be part of that.
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.860]   You put your stuff on YouTube, get distributed.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.900]   I think we're going to get to a point where less and less and less emphasis is put on
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.700]   the site, more and more and more emphasis is put on going to where people are and where
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.700]   they are right now.
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.860]   They don't stay this way, but right now is in streams of attention.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.860]   What do you think about that?
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:36.100]   I just, the money part, Facebook is paying them.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.100]   Their paying, Facebook is paying them to do this.
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.100]   Paying.
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.100]   Well, we don't know.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.100]   We don't know yet.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.500]   That's not been revealed, but there have been rumors that have been reports on verified
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.500]   reports.
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.500]   And I don't know.
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:50.060]   I'm not being privileged to find out.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:54.780]   But as I'm not under any, NDA is if you under anything, but, but there have been reports
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:25:00.180]   that, that I think the way the report says is that the publishers add appearing on the
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:04.620]   distributed content on Facebook, the publisher would keep 100% of the advertising for that.
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.460]   If that's the case, basically what you get is all kinds of new audience for you and your
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.700]   advertisers.
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.700]   What's not to love?
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:15.140]   What's not to love is if Facebook only learns more about your readers than you do.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.980]   And Facebook is the one that controls relevance and Facebook controls that.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:27.340]   What's also not to love is if Facebook, when I was at the Peruja Journalism Festival,
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:32.900]   there was a study there, an academic talking from Oxford talking about how Belinska, biggest
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:39.180]   paper I think in Norway, I think, chat room will correct me, had a picture illustrating
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.340]   60s hippies and had some new people frolicking the beach.
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.860]   Well, of course, Facebook took that down because that's their community standards.
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.580]   They evidently got in trouble for apparently their statue of David.
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.620]   Their community isn't in Scandinavia.
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.620]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.260]   So that's the problem with community standards.
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:59.740]   If you apply them globally, what does that even mean?
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.780]   And you end up with the lowest common denominator or freedom.
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.380]   We're all going to be in Burkus.
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.260]   You know, that doesn't work clearly.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:12.660]   So also at Peruja, Andy Mitchell from Facebook, came to talk where he talked about all these
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.620]   good things Facebook's doing.
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:18.820]   But when he was questioned by a well-known journalism professor, George Brock, and by
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:23.420]   another person about Facebook's responsibility to society, now that it becomes more of an
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:29.100]   editor of journalism, Andy kind of didn't grapple with the question sufficiently and
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.820]   George Brock and Jay Rose and went after him.
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.380]   I think this is a discussion that Facebook has to start.
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.300]   They don't have the answers right now, but there's a discussion to have that what is
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.500]   Facebook's responsibility to society?
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.780]   So there's a money responsibility here.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:48.940]   There's a data responsibility and there's a societal responsibility of free speech.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:54.460]   But if you can work that out, I'm always the optimist, maybe to my fault.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:59.620]   I think that if news could get all kinds of new readers and new relevance on Facebook
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:04.220]   through Facebook with a good business deal, with protection for journalistic standards,
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:08.860]   with protection for the relationship with the consumer, those are a lot of ifs, then
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.020]   I see a positive thing here.
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.700]   Now the other argument that's made is that, okay, let's say they do all of that.
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:17.660]   Let's say it's just hunky-dory, it's group hugs, it's chismut, it's karma.
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.700]   And the fear is that what Facebook give with Facebook could take away.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.380]   Yeah, they take the rules.
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.380]   Right.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.500]   Which we've seen with Twitter, Lord knows and others.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:31.420]   But again, yeah, but I think that that's part of the discussion to have is to say that
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:36.100]   is to say to Facebook, listen, you need to understand some principles here.
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.900]   We need to negotiate some principles about your behavior when it comes to these things
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.500]   that actually matter to society.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.260]   You know, the argument's about Facebook doing experiments, what it would be, is to get
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.260]   them to vote more.
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.580]   And also known as advertising and marketing.
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.580]   And we all do that.
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.580]   It'd be testing.
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.180]   Yeah, it'd be testing.
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:56.820]   But there needs to be a discussion of principles so that when there is a controversy and there
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:02.220]   will be, we can take the discussion back to those principles and test against those principles
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.660]   and see what works.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:10.300]   So I'm optimistic this is doable, but I don't know enough to know where Facebook really
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.300]   is.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.300]   But it's a big deal.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.260]   Yeah, it is a really big deal.
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:18.420]   It feels like this mirrors, I've been having this ongoing discussion with my friends,
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:22.140]   converging a little bit about Medium, which is an obviously an amazing tool.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:27.620]   But it feels like all of my friends who have been this independent bloggers, the Andy
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.780]   Vayo and the Dana Boyd and the Neil Dashers and the Jeff Jarvis is even are writing on
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:32.780]   Medium now.
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.340]   And I was sort of, I was sad.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.340]   I'm sad.
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.340]   Makes me sad too.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.340]   Yeah.
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.340]   It makes me a little sad.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.620]   And I really have to think hard about what's sad about it because everyone loves Medium.
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.220]   And Neil has argued with me, he's an advisor to Medium, that the writing tools are better
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.620]   and he writes more because of Medium.
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:47.620]   And there's community there.
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.620]   He will see his stuff.
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.780]   Yeah, there's distribution, right?
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.780]   Like Medium.
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:51.780]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.500]   Andy Vayo is saying like 10 times the number of people see the stuff that I write on Medium
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.060]   than they ever did on my site, waxy.org.
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:00.860]   And so I can't tell if it's just, it still seems crazy to me and I have yet to write
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.660]   a piece on Medium and part of me is like, I'm afraid that I'm going to like it too much
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.660]   or something.
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.660]   I don't know.
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.660]   Well, you should try.
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:10.700]   I find, Gina, it's a different thing for different uses, right?
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.500]   But Jeff, you always cross post to your own site, right?
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.500]   Not always.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.660]   That's why, because Medium, on Medium, you hold on to your copyright.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.380]   So you can put as many places you want, no problem with Medium.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.380]   That's really important.
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.580]   And they do have an export tool and they do have an embed tool.
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.740]   Do I have a minute to work on my blog?
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:31.860]   What I would love is you could use that, by the way.
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.660]   Well, I'm sorry.
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.660]   The embed tool?
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.660]   Yeah, just something to make your blog a little jazzier.
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:38.660]   Oh, geez.
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.660]   That was mean.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:42.660]   I'm sorry.
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.660]   Why don't you use Gina's framework?
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.780]   That's the other thing.
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.700]   My blog has become more of just a repository or an archive.
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.980]   Well, and that's a perfectly appropriate thing.
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:58.340]   And we give out your blog address because that's where you go.
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.340]   You may see Jeff in other places.
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.820]   All things, Jeff.
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.820]   Yeah.
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.620]   I assume you'll go to Baker Basin by the way.
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.620]   I feel like I'm sort of mourning that.
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.620]   Right?
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.620]   And there's this parallel.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.620]   I agree with you, Gina.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:12.620]   And there's no reason.
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.300]   Is that just because I'm old and dumb?
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:15.660]   Like, you know, I wonder that too.
[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.460]   Not about you, but about me.
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:18.460]   I mean, it's the thing.
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.780]   Like, you should go to the where people are, right?
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.260]   Like, you're a creator of brand new folks that were.
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.260]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.260]   Yeah.
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.260]   And I guess that just--
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.860]   Do you have your own space or do you go to other people's spaces?
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:34.300]   You can go to other people's spaces if, A, you don't lose control of your content,
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.660]   ever, right?
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.660]   Your relationship.
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.660]   Right.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.500]   And I guess posting, as far as I'm concerned, is fine.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.500]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:46.580]   And I guess the other thing would be as long as those other people don't influence your
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:47.580]   content.
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.580]   Right.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.580]   Yes.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:53.860]   And so I put myself in the position of like, what if NBC came to us and said, we'd like
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:59.300]   to take some of your content and use it digitally?
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.540]   If I didn't lose control of the content, that'd be fine.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:07.660]   If they didn't say, tell me, make it 44.3 minutes, that would be fine.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.660]   But--
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:09.660]   That would kill us.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:14.820]   Well, that's the-- and then the other issue is a larger issue, which is, so they could
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:15.820]   say that.
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:21.380]   But you're doing a deal with the devil, and it might be that at some point, this is for
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.580]   sure true of Facebook, all that changes.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.420]   I guess then you could pull back.
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:32.180]   I had this discussion with my class, my entrepreneurial class, just Monday, where the
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.180]   emotions come out first.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.180]   Well, I don't like Facebook does this.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.180]   I don't like Facebook does that.
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:40.260]   And it took me a long time to get things down and say, whoa, everything in life is negotiation.
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.260]   Yeah.
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.620]   And either you get a good negotiation or you get a bad negotiation.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.180]   But you have to go insane.
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.580]   What do they have that I want?
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.180]   What do I have that they want?
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.580]   Where are we complementary?
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.260]   Can we do something in mutual benefit?
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.180]   And it's a matter of negotiation and a matter of a deal.
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.860]   Cold, hard, fought through negotiation.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.700]   And of course, you don't negotiate individually with Facebook.
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:06.620]   But does Facebook give a deal that is good for groups, writers?
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.540]   Does medium give a deal that's good for writers?
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.940]   They're enabling, there's a great thing called mid-century modern.
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:16.860]   Debbie Galant, who was the queen of hyper local bloggers, and now I work with her in the
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:21.300]   ecosystem in New Jersey, she started a new site called "Bid Century and Modern" for people
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.300]   are agely.
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.020]   Oh, well, I best go there.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.020]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.020]   You got big print.
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.020]   Yeah.
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.020]   And I need big print.
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.020]   Big print.
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:33.060]   Is yours about peeing and things like that?
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.060]   No, it's not.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.060]   It's about peeing.
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.060]   No, it's not.
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.060]   No, it's not.
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.060]   No, it's not.
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.060]   No, it's not.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.060]   No, it's not.
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.060]   No, it's not.
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.060]   No, it's not.
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.060]   But Debbie's wanted Debbie's got to kill me for joking.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.060]   Debbie's wonderful.
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.460]   And she basically says, I can make a new business on Medium as a platform that would
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.460]   be interesting.
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.460]   Wow.
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.460]   This is a woman who built Aristonet.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:54.260]   She built a premier hyper local blog, ran it for 10 years, knows how to do it, knows
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.380]   everything that's tough about it.
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.060]   And she's gravitating to Medium because it gives her distribution.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.340]   There's a chance for advertising opportunities.
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.820]   It's elegant and beautiful.
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.820]   It's true.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:07.620]   It's the main thing that people like about Medium is elegant and beautiful.
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.620]   Elle, elegance is amazing.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.220]   And it seems dangerous.
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.060]   It affects how I write.
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.860]   Yeah, that's what I prefer.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.860]   That's how I write.
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.460]   Because the interface is so great.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.460]   Yeah.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.500]   And you want to be prettier.
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:24.060]   You don't want to be as sloppy as I can be in my blog.
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.060]   What the hell is that?
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.060]   I don't know.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.060]   I take it all back.
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.060]   This is the homepage.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.060]   This is the homepage.
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.060]   Click on that.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:33.060]   That the letter to Cheryl from Katie Haffner.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.060]   Katie Haffner lost her husband as well.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.060]   I did not know that.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.060]   I did not know that.
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.060]   I did not know that.
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.060]   Yes, in a similar way.
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:49.060]   And by the way, Cheryl Sandberg's post about the loss of new husband on Facebook, of course,
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:55.060]   because Cheryl's the COO at Facebook was really touching and couldn't have been more beautiful.
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:34:02.180]   You know, we had oddly enough Jason Calicanis on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.180]   And he played poker with Dave Goldberg.
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.480]   Calls him Goldie.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:10.860]   He said on Wednesday, I sat right next to Goldie during the poker game.
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.020]   And he gave a fairy touching tribute.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.180]   I didn't know Goldberg.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:15.180]   Did you guys?
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:16.180]   No.
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:18.940]   No, I only know him as Cheryl's husband.
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:19.940]   Right.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.060]   But he was a mensch.
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:26.020]   I mean, there's just no question if you read the tributes and after I talked to Jason that
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.940]   this was a great guy.
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:31.900]   You know what really frosted my flakes?
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.620]   And I can't remember who it was.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:38.100]   Some blog decided, well, they haven't revealed the cause of death.
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.460]   So it must have been suicide.
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.140]   And that so infuriated me.
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:45.460]   And unfortunately, I think forced their hands.
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:49.060]   They did reveal eventually that it was just a freak accident.
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.180]   He wore a treadmill.
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:56.060]   And alone, apparently in the gym at the resort in Mexico, fell off.
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.380]   They don't know because nobody was there, I guess.
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:59.820]   Hit his head and bled out.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.940]   There's just a freak accident.
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:07.100]   Although kudos to The Washington Post, which told that story, and then said, and by the
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.980]   way, this happens a lot, treadmills are really dangerous.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:11.980]   Be careful.
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:12.980]   We have a treadmill at home.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:19.380]   In fact, had an accident, our 12-year-old got burned because he was riding on a fell
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.380]   off.
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:23.260]   He had a clip on that stops it and the treadmill burned his arm.
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.780]   Not badly, but it was kind of an eye opener.
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:29.580]   These are very powerful engines and can be very dangerous.
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:33.020]   So anyway, I don't know why I brought all that up.
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:35.580]   Well, because I had you click on that piece on me.
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.580]   You were looking at the video.
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:37.580]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:38.580]   Yeah.
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.140]   I mean, I'm glad we mentioned Goldberg.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.900]   My social feed was phenomenal for that moment.
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:48.740]   And that was where Facebook, who wanted to know him, Facebook really lived up to its
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:49.740]   purpose.
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:50.740]   It did.
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.780]   In fact, it's the second time in two weeks it has because the safety center that Facebook
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:36:02.020]   does was such a resource for people in Nepal to let friends and family know they were safe.
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.700]   And it worked amazingly.
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:10.580]   And my friend and our digital photography guy, Chris Markwart, who is a regular there, said
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:14.460]   the reason is everybody in Nepal, in Kathmandu, where they don't have a lot of computers,
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.460]   a lot of infrastructure.
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:19.980]   But a lot of people have smartphones and use Facebook on their smartphones.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:20.980]   That's it.
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:25.820]   And so it actually, you would say, well, Facebook will be useful there, but it's immensely useful
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:26.820]   there.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:27.820]   Two things on Facebook.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.820]   One just on this point.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:34.900]   So I left a little comment on Cheryl's post just a thanker for the generosity of doing
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.780]   it in the midst of her grief.
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:43.540]   And I noticed that Facebook prioritizes the comments on posts according to me as a user.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:44.540]   It's people I know.
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:45.540]   Isn't that great?
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.540]   I would know.
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.540]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.540]   I had no idea of that.
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.540]   Yeah.
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:54.380]   The other thing I mentioned about Facebook, slight change of topic is, as you saw, Zuckerberg's
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:59.300]   video trying to thread the needle on free internet and net neutrality, which I think
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.540]   he did actually pretty well.
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.660]   Did you see that?
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:03.900]   I did not.
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.540]   It's on the rundown under Facebook.
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:06.540]   Okay.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:11.420]   Because the issue with free internet is that if you give it away in Africa or India and
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:17.540]   say, these are the services you're going to get free, including that Facebook, a light
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:22.420]   Facebook, that is a violation that would seem with the principle of net neutrality.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:23.420]   Right.
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:27.980]   So what Zuck argues in there is net neutrality is very important.
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.860]   Net neutrality is about trying to charge people and rip them off.
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.500]   This is about trying to give people free internet.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:37.060]   And we can't afford to give them the whole internet for free, but we can't afford to
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.860]   give them something to start with.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:43.020]   And services make money in the end by basically upselling you.
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.180]   And he opened up internet.org to other developers.
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.500]   Now, whether it's open enough, one we can debate till the cows come home.
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.300]   But it's a very delicate argument.
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.700]   And I think he did it well.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.900]   To your point, looks, the first comment I see is you.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.740]   Because Facebook knows, oh, you know, that's your buddy Jeff.
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:04.380]   So by the way, one of the people who liked that comment was Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.380]   Yeah, it's cool.
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.020]   It's clear he's in here responding to people.
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.020]   Yeah.
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:12.680]   So so my notification on Facebook said Mark Zuckerberg, Prince, a friend of Robert
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.680]   Scoble.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.340]   Oh, Lord, he's he's selling.
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.980]   He's a seller.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:18.980]   That's it.
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:19.980]   Scoble is selling.
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:20.980]   You figured it out.
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:29.220]   He is selling a man of no apparent, you know, I don't want to say use, but no apparent talents
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.220]   who is everywhere.
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:31.420]   It's a Woody Allen movie.
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.620]   You got to see it.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:37.020]   And so though, so you felt like we were not listening to Mark because it's, you know,
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:41.820]   it's video, but it's long, but you feel like he's a response was, you said, threaded
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.820]   the needle.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.820]   He threaded the needle.
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:44.820]   I don't know.
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.940]   I mean, I think it's, I can imagine people coming to me and saying, Oh, but you forgot
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:47.940]   this, forgot that.
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:51.180]   I think it's a very complex discussion, but I'm sure I was very curious to hear what
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:39:00.100]   you two would think about this is a limited free internet, a violation of neutrality.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.100]   And does it does it?
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.100]   Does it?
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:05.620]   I think I think you can the perfect can be the enemy of the good.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:10.420]   I think sometimes, yeah, okay, ideally it would be a free and open internet, but if
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:15.500]   that's not practicable, let's make the first steps and with a, with a, and then this would,
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:20.220]   I would ask Facebook to do with the intent and the goal of making it open eventually.
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:21.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.220]   Right.
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.220]   I agree.
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.940]   And I said that there are, there's two, I said there, you need a discussion of principles.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:32.940]   You need to say that, you know, one thing he said is he has no ads on it.
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:33.940]   That's good.
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.460]   You know, you need to say that you're not going to pull the rug out from people and
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.460]   exploit them.
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.460]   You know, you need to understand what the principles are, but, but yeah, I think that
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:47.420]   on the free end, being able to get people connected in some even limited way is better
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:50.220]   than not be connected.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.820]   I have to say, I have to think that.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:58.780]   And, you know, and the example that Chris Markar gave of, of nay Paul really shows that
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:03.540]   there is value even if it were just Facebook, that there can be some value.
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:04.540]   I mean, it's a can of worms.
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.700]   It can become a can of work.
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.300]   You know, it's one of the things that was like that there has to be a very clear goal
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.220]   toward do, you know, opening it all up.
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.220]   Right.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.500]   So, but, but yeah, let's take a break.
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:16.820]   We're going to come back with more.
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:17.820]   Jeff and Gina.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.980]   It's the roughly band back together.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.780]   Love doing it this time.
[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:22.780]   I got a new watch.
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:23.780]   I want to show everybody.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.340]   It's not the Apple Watch.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.340]   It's actually a pretty good competitor to the Apple Watch.
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.020]   And there's actually the changelogs.
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.020]   Busy, busy, busy.
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:36.340]   Just to talk about, including a big acquisition that a lot of people are applauding for Google.
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.340]   But first, a word from LegalZoom.
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:43.220]   You know, if you're starting your own business, there's certain things you ought to do, but
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:47.020]   it doesn't require a big expensive white shoe law firm to get done.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.020]   LegalZoom is great.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:49.100]   It's not a law firm.
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.260]   It's better.
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.660]   Here are five things you can count on when you use LegalZoom.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:54.820]   First of all, reliability.
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:59.060]   More than a million people over the last decade have trusted LegalZoom to help start their
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.220]   business, including me.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:06.300]   If you're looking to incorporate form an LLC, a nonprofit, get a DBA, LegalZoom will help
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.420]   you get started the right way at a price you can afford.
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:10.420]   Experience.
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.940]   Number two, they've been helping business owners with legal challenges for 10 years.
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:18.500]   You can count on them to know what needs to be done and to do it effectively.
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.860]   Three helpful support, the right people on hand to answer your questions based here in
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.860]   the US.
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.740]   Four legal advice since they're not a law firm.
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:31.060]   LegalZoom did build a network of independent attorneys for most states that are pre-negotiated
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.220]   flat rate, makes it very easy.
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.220]   You can get advice on the best way to get started.
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:39.460]   I wanted to know what state, for instance, Delaware versus California actually was interested
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:43.660]   in doing a nonprofit educational corporation.
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:46.580]   I would have loved to have had somebody to ask about the pros and cons of that.
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.900]   I had to dig up my own answers.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.580]   Now you can get LegalZoom's legal advice even though they're not a law firm.
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:56.900]   Plus they can provide contract review and other useful services, these independent lawyers.
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.180]   Finally, no surprises.
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:04.500]   LegalZoom provides complete transparency, upfront pricing, customer reviews, unedited
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:05.500]   right there on the site.
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.180]   They have a 100% satisfaction guarantee.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.540]   I'm really a fan and I know you'll love it.
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:14.780]   If you're starting a business, I want to pat you on the back and say do it.
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:19.740]   Don't hold back, but make sure you protect yourself with trademarks and the LLCs or
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:22.260]   corporations, all the things you need to do and you can do it all at LegalZoom for much
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.100]   less than you'd think.
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:28.460]   Make the smart choice for your business LegalZoom.com and hey, we'll save you even more when you
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:33.060]   use the offer code TWIG at checkout.
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:38.940]   LegalZoom.com, the promo code is Twig and we thank them so much for their support of
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.540]   this week in Google.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.300]   Had you used anybody who's time full on iOS?
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:46.700]   People I know who have were really fond of it.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:53.860]   It was kind of an interesting artificial intelligence take on time management.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:58.260]   It would go through your calendar, your email, it would look at what you had when you had
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.020]   time to do stuff that you wanted to do.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:04.820]   It would actually say, hey, let me schedule this in for you because you're going to have
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:05.820]   time to do that.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.820]   Well, Google has acquired them.
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:14.140]   The app will stay available for the foreseeable future according to Google, but they're going
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:18.620]   to try to add time full features into Google's existing apps and services.
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.060]   This would be great in Google now.
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.380]   So what does it do?
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.380]   If it's good.
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.700]   Yeah, I haven't used it.
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.700]   I don't know how.
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:30.500]   So like it supposedly figures out times on your most productive or how.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.020]   It uses behavioral science.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:38.140]   It tells us that it's much more effective to change the environment people working indirectly
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.660]   and introducing new tool.
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:42.300]   Is it going to yell at me?
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:43.300]   I hope not.
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.100]   It's going to be like a very productive right now, Jeff.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.100]   Here, let's watch the video.
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.900]   I, you know, the app will watch yells at me to stand up every hour and I've not found
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:50.900]   that annoying.
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:53.020]   And in fact, found that fairly useful.
[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:54.700]   Yeah, because I actually do stand up.
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:59.580]   If you've ever worn a Fitbit, there is value to knowing kind of everything you need to
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:00.580]   do.
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:05.340]   Here's their video and finds good times for you to get things done.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:08.060]   Time full gives you an overview of your day and what you have planned.
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.060]   This guy sounds depressed.
[00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:10.060]   It's a calendar.
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:11.060]   I'm tired.
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:12.060]   I'm tired.
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.060]   I don't want to do this video.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:18.420]   List directly onto your calendar, giving you a suggested game plan for your day.
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.420]   You can drag things around to adjust your schedule.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.260]   But I pretend you check something off.
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.660]   Time full learns more about you and your preferences.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:26.660]   I'm going to try.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:28.860]   It's iOS, which is the issue for me.
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:29.860]   I don't.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:30.860]   Okay.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:31.860]   So you enter to do lists.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:32.860]   Do you schedule your to-dos?
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.300]   You check them off when you do them.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.260]   That's how time full tries to understand when you've been productive.
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:40.940]   So I'm more likely to get to the gym at 11 o'clock in the morning.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:43.500]   But if I wait past six, I'm never going to go with that kind of thing.
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.500]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:45.500]   And then it learns and it gets better.
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.500]   Okay.
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.500]   Which is you're right.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:48.500]   I'm always skeptical of that.
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.500]   Now, Gina, of course, has a very good to-do list.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:51.500]   Gina is a zoo kind of person.
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.420]   I am going to do that text to not person.
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:55.980]   I am a to-do person.
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:45:01.460]   But I was just thinking, it seems like you have to obviously use their to-do like this
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.460]   to-do in this calendar.
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.420]   I wonder how Google is going to incorporate this.
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.260]   Google has its tasks project.
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.100]   It has keep, which is task-y like.
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.820]   I would only use a to-do list program that works with Google.
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:14.820]   Yeah.
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:15.820]   There are many.
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:16.820]   I use any do.
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:17.820]   I use one-do list.
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.260]   There are many that will work with Google tasks.
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.980]   I presume this will start to.
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.380]   I don't know if it did before.
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:24.380]   It's got to, right?
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.380]   Right.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.380]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:29.420]   So you better get to the gym now or, you know, this is a good time to work on that project.
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:33.540]   I'm just not the type to write down like, "I got a code for three hours today."
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:34.540]   No.
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.540]   I'm just going to put a code on my calendar.
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.580]   So it sounds like you have to, you're obviously required to do some of that.
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:39.580]   Right.
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:40.580]   No way.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.580]   No way.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.500]   That kind of happens, says Jeff and Gina.
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:49.220]   So I'm now flashing on this image, Leo, that I can see on the next episodes of Silicon
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:54.020]   Valley, it'll be a meeting everybody's sitting down and suddenly everybody just stands up
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:55.860]   because it's their hour to stand up.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:02.300]   I guarantee you, it's so easy to see to spot what Dan Lyons is putting in that show.
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.300]   Because it's so insider.
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:07.740]   Like, did you love the Mark Cuban guy?
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.780]   Oh, he's amazing.
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:11.700]   That's really so good.
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:12.700]   The season.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.100]   I've been enjoying it.
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:18.660]   Although I fear, as Jason said, this is well on the Twit, that it's way too inside.
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.500]   I mean, we get it because we know that.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:26.180]   So there's a Mark Cuban character who is like the biggest bro ever, billionaire bro.
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:28.700]   And he says, "It's all about ROI, man."
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:29.700]   What?
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:30.700]   Return on investment?
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:31.780]   No, radio on the internet.
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:35.980]   He invented radio on the internet.
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:37.060]   And then it's so funny.
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:42.540]   The best part is where he shows up and he says, "I started with 1.4 billion and now
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:44.540]   I have 1.6 billion."
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:52.020]   And the Piper guy does the math and says, "Given inflation, you're actually losing money."
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.860]   Oh, there was the three comma-clap.
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.420]   There was so many great, he's disrupting fatherhood.
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:01.460]   I mean, there was so many great ones.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:06.620]   My favorite scene was that when they're interviewing coders and Jared says, "So, will
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:09.420]   we to take it that you did not crush it in 2012?"
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:15.820]   No, I had a health problem in 2012, but I wasn't able to 100% crush it.
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:18.100]   I wasn't able to.
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.100]   And the cyborg?
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.020]   Do you love the cyborg?
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:22.100]   They're so great.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.100]   And you know, whatever.
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:26.700]   A lot of people complained about the representation of women on the show, so I loved it that the
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:27.700]   engineer that they hired.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:28.700]   The sima hired a woman.
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.420]   It completely trolled the whole team.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.940]   Oh, she trolled them.
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:38.060]   And then she's going out the door to the guy and says, "I love the Dragon Tattoo."
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:42.420]   I love the girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:46.060]   It's so funny with cringe.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.460]   I mean, there are on point this season.
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.900]   So apparently, time full...
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:55.540]   I'm not sure the chatroom's saying that Dan Arielli, who is the guy, of course, who wrote
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:00.420]   predictably Irrational, and is a behavioral economist, very interesting guy, had something
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:01.420]   to do with Timeful.
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:03.420]   I don't know if that's the case.
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:04.420]   I'm looking at their website.
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.980]   But you know we're not going to be rational enough to use it.
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.340]   Yeah, right.
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:14.340]   I'm always suspicious of Ashton Kutcher as an investor.
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:15.340]   I'm always...
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:16.340]   Oh.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.340]   Oh.
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:18.340]   Oh.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.860]   Looks like he made a big exit.
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:24.860]   I'm always suspicious when they say the computer will do it for you, because they never
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:25.860]   seem to have a very good job.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:29.580]   Although, I have to say that the Google Now is like, "Hey, you've got this place to be.
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.260]   You need to leave in 20 minutes."
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:33.260]   I love Google Now.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.820]   Pretty great.
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:37.500]   That's where the battlefield, by the way, having now...
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.300]   You know, I've used Android Wear for a long time with Momoto 360.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.620]   You have this new one, which really looks pretty.
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.340]   And I've been using the Apple Watch.
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:49.140]   Yeah, I'm that guy with two watches.
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:52.340]   But I have to say that is...
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:56.580]   If there's one advantage Android Wear has, it will be Google Now.
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:58.260]   Because Apple doesn't really do that.
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:59.260]   It can't do that.
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:00.260]   Not yet, right.
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:01.740]   What if you want to be used?
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.380]   Apple calendar and Apple Mail and all that.
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.460]   Well, if you have an iPhone, you don't have a choice of Android Wear.
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:08.460]   You only have a choice of...
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:11.340]   The one I'm saying is, if you don't live in the Google version...
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:12.340]   Right.
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:13.340]   ...you only live in the Apple universe.
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:14.340]   Right.
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.340]   And there's Google Now.
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:16.340]   Apple, click through that.
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:17.340]   Well, I would say...
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.340]   Oh, they could.
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:20.340]   Yeah.
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:21.340]   Yeah.
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.340]   Do you want to see your stuff or no?
[00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:25.340]   Siri completely separate.
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:26.340]   I thought we did something around...
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:27.340]   No, no, it does.
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:28.340]   Microsoft's quit time.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.340]   Microsoft's quit time.
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:30.340]   That does.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.340]   Oh, Cortana, right.
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:32.340]   Cortana is very...
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.340]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:34.700]   ...asked you a lot of questions about yourself and then tries.
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:40.140]   I think Apple, because of their stance that I had plowed, but their strong stance on privacy,
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.940]   is going to have a hard time doing what Google Now does.
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:44.940]   Because it really...
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:45.940]   Yeah, Google has a start.
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:47.140]   ...goes through your email.
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:48.140]   Yeah.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.020]   You know, it looks what you're doing.
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:52.020]   There you are.
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:56.300]   There's all sorts of things that Apple, of course, could do and probably is doing, by
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:58.300]   the way, but isn't...
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.300]   It's good.
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:04.620]   The story recommendations, like the stories that you'd be interested in, is actually quite
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:05.620]   good for me.
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:06.620]   Yeah.
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:09.060]   Like, I find myself flipping over to Google Now as much as I would go to Twitter if I'm
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.580]   just looking for something to read.
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:12.740]   Once again, I'm not getting it.
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:15.140]   No, it's not looking for it.
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:21.180]   All I get is Snowden and Chromebooks.
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:23.620]   My friends, you need to broaden your interests.
[00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:26.820]   Well, no, I look at lots of things.
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.300]   I use the Google Play News app.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:30.780]   I look at all kinds of stuff.
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:31.820]   It knows what I search for.
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.700]   For some reason, it's always Chromebook and Snowden.
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.780]   Last week, tonight, that's not too bad.
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:38.780]   That's not too bad.
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:41.260]   I don't know how it knows that I watched them.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.260]   I did.
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.220]   It does know what you watch.
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.100]   So here's a baseball for me.
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.580]   Here's an article about Colin Kaepernick.
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:49.740]   They know I'm a Niners fan.
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.140]   Here's Classic Rock and Oldies.
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:52.940]   There's some Beatles information.
[00:50:52.940 --> 00:51:00.580]   I don't know who Kamal Nangiani is, but apparently he's not Kunal Nayar, so that's good.
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:01.580]   Here's where I parked.
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:06.980]   Do you have the stories to read, module, except for the ones with the dark header?
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:07.980]   I don't know.
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:08.980]   Yeah, I got that too.
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:09.980]   I want...
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:11.540]   Yeah, stories to read is what is why you can't wind up.
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:13.940]   I've customized the heck out of this thing.
[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:14.940]   We did it last week.
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:23.180]   You weren't here, but we went through this because they've added downloaded apps now.
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.180]   Where would I...
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.180]   Everything else.
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.180]   Okay.
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:29.460]   So there's another module that'll stories to read about that module.
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:30.460]   So it's stories to read.
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:31.460]   Let me see if it can be right.
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:32.460]   Where do you get that?
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:38.020]   I mean, that's part of what is annoying and time full will be equally annoying about
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:46.340]   kind of computer driven decisions is if you let the computer do it, then do you ever
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:47.340]   get to do it?
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:49.380]   And is there a way to override the computer?
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:53.780]   And maybe the computer isn't so smart about me after all.
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:54.780]   I don't know.
[00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:55.780]   Right.
[00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:56.780]   So that's a different color.
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.060]   So that's the top of everything else for me.
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:00.060]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:01.060]   Stories to read.
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:02.060]   So I got a...
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:03.060]   Is there a way chat room?
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.060]   Is there a way to you know to turn that on?
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.060]   There's an orange one.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:06.060]   Is orange good?
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:07.060]   That's sports, right?
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:10.140]   I don't know how long it's going to take me to get home.
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:11.700]   The gray is what I'm getting.
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:12.700]   Anyway.
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:13.700]   No, no, you're right.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:14.700]   You're right.
[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:15.700]   You're right.
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:16.700]   You're right.
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.700]   This is a pretty good list.
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:19.140]   I didn't know for example that Reddit is starting a video division to create original
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:20.140]   content.
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:21.140]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:22.140]   I know.
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:23.140]   I think it's because we failed.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:27.500]   We tried to do a show called Reddit Up and Reddit was very interested.
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.060]   Sarah Lane and Chad Johnson hosted that.
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.620]   They both disappeared after I canceled the show.
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:35.100]   So maybe it's my fault.
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:36.780]   But it just didn't quite work for me.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.740]   We did a bunch of beta test episodes.
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.740]   We tried changing things around.
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.900]   Reddit was immediately in touch and said, "Can we..."
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:45.460]   You know, they're interested.
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:50.820]   They understand that the value of doing a dignity for Reddit.
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:54.140]   And so as soon as we stopped Reddit up, they did an audio thing and now they've just announced
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:57.180]   they're going to do a video production as well.
[00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:59.260]   Is it basically dignity?
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:03.900]   Well that's I think kind of what we were thinking is let's do a dignity where you highlight
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:04.900]   the interest.
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:10.380]   Dignation was really valuable in making dig a success because it was a very engaging
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:15.500]   fun podcast with Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht in which they would highlight great stuff
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:18.220]   on dig and they'd talk about it because the show did so well.
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:22.420]   It drove a lot of traffic to dig and I think that's probably what Reddit's thinking.
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.340]   But I don't know.
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:28.100]   I always imagine that Dignation kind of served the super like the super users of dig but
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:29.100]   no, it did bring...
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:32.100]   Oh, I think you can say that...
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.100]   On the opposite.
[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:35.100]   I don't know for a fact.
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:36.100]   I'll ask Kevin.
[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:37.100]   Well, or both.
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:38.900]   But I think you didn't have to use dig to enjoy a dignity.
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.180]   You say, "Oh, that's the hot stuff this week."
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:45.540]   And they had fun listening to what it was and they'd drink beer and they'd go to bathroom
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:46.540]   room and they'd be...
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.140]   By the way, they're bringing it back.
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:49.140]   Oh, really?
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:50.380]   Well, you know, I'll ask Kevin.
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:52.220]   Kevin's going to be on the new screensavers on Saturday.
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:53.540]   He'll be our guest host.
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:59.460]   But yeah, it was my understanding that he and Alex had talked and that they were going
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:03.220]   to do at least some new episodes.
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:04.220]   If not...
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:05.780]   Kevin's left Google Ventures, right?
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:07.780]   And he's working on his thought.
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:08.780]   I guess so.
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:09.780]   What's he doing?
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:10.780]   He has an assistant there.
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:11.780]   It's really...
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:12.780]   It's really...
[00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:16.580]   You know, once you're in the good old boy network, life changes.
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:18.020]   Yeah, boy, it's not a bad life.
[00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:23.060]   So he still has that email address and he still posts Foundation as a Google Ventures
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:24.260]   thing.
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.260]   But he's got a new startup, Watchville.
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.260]   I don't know.
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:28.260]   I don't know.
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:29.260]   I don't know.
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:30.260]   I'm still waiting for that change.
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.260]   He's on a boat.
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:33.260]   I want to get them at work.
[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:35.260]   How do I get to that at work?
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:36.260]   I don't know.
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.260]   Gina, what is it?
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:38.260]   We're working stiff.
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:39.260]   That's the difference.
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:40.260]   Yep.
[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.260]   We're working stiff.
[00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:43.260]   Some people...
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.260]   I've seen it happen before.
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:46.260]   They just...
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:48.340]   And it's not just because they get money.
[00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:51.740]   We were talking about with Jason also about secret.
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:54.660]   There's a little upset over a secret secret which exited.
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:55:01.560]   This is the anonymous app that was used basically by Silicon Valley insiders to bully other
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.060]   Silicon Valley insiders.
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:06.380]   They shuttered this last week.
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:10.100]   But what I didn't know and what came out in the stories about it is that the founders,
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:15.660]   the two founders, during their A round, their very first round of funding had taken $6 million
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.180]   off the table, $3 million each.
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.860]   And I asked Jason, "Is that usual?"
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:21.460]   I've heard of founders taking money off the table.
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:22.740]   He's just unheard of.
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:23.740]   He said...
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:29.460]   It's not unusual if you've been working for a long time on your startup and you're taking
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:31.420]   another round of funding to take a little bit.
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:33.860]   Kevin took some money on...
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:38.340]   I think on revision three took some money off the table, a million dollars or so.
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:40.180]   But he said, "You never do that in the A round.
[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:41.180]   That's just appalling."
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:46.700]   And now we're starting to hear other VCs upset about that.
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:48.460]   Yeah, the secret thing is weird.
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:52.300]   Yeah, isn't the idea of you taking money off the table after you haven't paid yourself
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.700]   a salary for several years?
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:54.700]   You've run.
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:55.700]   You've run.
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:56.700]   Yeah, you've run.
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:56:00.060]   Well, after you're fully invested in your stock too, you're investing in schedule in
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:01.700]   stocks so you don't run it away.
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:02.700]   Well, this is before the...
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:03.700]   You get fired.
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.180]   This is before the IPO, obviously.
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:10.420]   I also think it's a good sign for society that it died.
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:11.420]   Secret?
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:12.420]   Yeah.
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.420]   Although Yik Yak and some of these other college-based ones...
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:15.420]   Yeah, the ones that always do something.
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:16.660]   ...are worse or something.
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:17.660]   Because that...
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:18.660]   Yes.
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:21.220]   So, secret really ended up just being annoying to Silicon Valley because that's the only
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:23.220]   people who first of all who read it.
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:29.140]   And it was all about people saying bad things about other people in Silicon Valley.
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:35.460]   But Yik Yak and these other ones are whispers are really about kids because they're geographic.
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:39.180]   So you can see all of the people talking about stuff at school.
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:45.540]   Yeah, my wife who works in University Administration was at a conference of other University administrators
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:51.300]   at a panel about the problems that Yik Yak introduced and people in attending the panel
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:54.900]   were on Yik Yak saying things about what was going on.
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.420]   It was very meta.
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:57.580]   It's addictive.
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:02.020]   It plays to our worst kind of side.
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:03.020]   It's tough though.
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:04.780]   I found myself in this weird position with secret.
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:09.140]   I mean, I don't think that the founders acted in good faith and it sounds like the exit
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:12.900]   was bad and I realized that the experience on secret was actually quite bad.
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:18.380]   But I do think that there's a place for anonymity.
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:19.820]   It's really hard to do well.
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:22.820]   I think ask Metaphilter does it because it kind of well is the only place that I've seen
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:25.460]   people be able to sort of anonymously ask personal questions.
[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:30.500]   I think there are people in this world who have legitimate life changing secrets.
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:33.940]   And I do think that there's something there like how can people reach out and talk to
[00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:35.140]   one another about those secrets.
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.900]   I mean, from, you know, I'm in the closet.
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:38.980]   I think I'm a woman.
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:40.660]   I'm here in this country illegally.
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:42.660]   I just got diagnosed with cancer and haven't told anyone.
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:46.820]   People live with like really soul crushing secrets that you could get.
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:49.340]   You can get support from people online.
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.340]   Right?
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:53.500]   And I mean, there's ways to do that through, you know, whatever, throw away handles, whatever.
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.540]   But I think there's something there in the product.
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:57.020]   They're in the spirit of the art.
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:58.980]   But it's the architecture is how you, it's how you make it.
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:02.260]   And if you make it in such a way that people are going to come in and just use it as a
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:08.340]   snark factory, then that's where it's going to become.
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:11.580]   Or if you're not going to devote the resources to get rid of that stuff, which you're probably
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:14.260]   not going to do, then that's the problem.
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:15.980]   So it depends on how it's architected.
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:16.980]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:17.980]   And this is good.
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:19.860]   This kind of goes back to my thing about, you know, that it doesn't take a coder to make
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:20.860]   it up, right?
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:23.540]   Like that designing a product like that, particularly like that, a sensitive product
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:24.860]   is a very difficult thing.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:31.700]   And the moderation required in a setting that, you know, allows anonymity is also tremendous.
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:32.860]   But I don't know.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:35.300]   What I didn't like about the secret thing is that everyone was sort of dismissing it as
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:36.300]   this terrible idea.
[00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:39.540]   And I actually think that there's a little bit of a good, like some good could come out
[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:40.620]   of a situation area like that.
[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:45.300]   If it's done well, it was not done well in the case of secrets.
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:48.340]   But yeah, RIP secret.
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:51.220]   Did you get your project fire invite yet?
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:52.220]   Nope.
[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:53.220]   Did you?
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:54.220]   Nope.
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:55.740]   No, but somebody emailed me, said I got one.
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:57.700]   So they're going house.
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.300]   In fact, I noticed a change in language in the project.
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:01.300]   Fye site.
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:04.180]   This is Google's wireless play, wireless cell phone play.
[00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:12.700]   I noticed on the project, Fye site, they said something like, Oh, no.
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:16.540]   Jason has just showed me something very disturbing from the verge signing up for project
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:19.420]   five will destroy your Google voice account.
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:20.420]   Yeah.
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:25.780]   How do we know that kind of consumes it and that you basically give up a lot of voice
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:26.780]   features.
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:30.380]   And roads you go down, you can't go back on it appears.
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:33.100]   All kinds of bad stuff.
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:36.340]   I know it's going to be thinking twice with I did.
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:37.900]   I'm thinking twice.
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:40.300]   Do they warn you anyway?
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:41.300]   Well, they have it in their hell.
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:45.260]   I mean, I'm sure they do in the onboarding process and everything because I use my Google
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:49.540]   voice number all the time.
[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:52.260]   So here is a here is a page.
[00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:57.060]   I guess somebody got an invite and sent them a screenshot like your Google voice number.
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.060]   Keep it.
[00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:01.520]   No matter if you keep your Google voice number or not, many aspects of Google voice will
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:05.220]   carry over to your project, Fye service, your Google voice credit will be transferred
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:07.700]   automatically to project Fye.
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.540]   Bring your Google voice number to project Fye.
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:12.500]   Actually, I wouldn't mind that or use a different number.
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:16.380]   Your Google voice number will be released when you activate service.
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:19.620]   No getting it back.
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:25.460]   So you either poured it over or you don't and it gets released is how I read that, which
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:32.760]   does it sound like a very good thing for voice faithful Google voice notes that once a voice
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:36.720]   number has been transferred to Fye, you'll no longer be able to receive or send calls
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.520]   or messages through the company's Google voice apps.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.600]   But does hang out still work?
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:47.400]   Because I have I stopped using Google voice apps and say goodbye to your voicemail and
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.400]   call history.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.720]   These will no longer be safe with voice.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.240]   What's you've switched?
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:54.240]   Old messages will be preserved.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.720]   But that's I've already transferred to hangouts on that, right?
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.100]   Most people I would think have.
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:00.500]   Oh, no.
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:06.740]   Any of your existing conveniences like call forwarding blocking automatic voicemail transcriptions
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:12.020]   and cheap international calling are making the move to Fye.
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:15.100]   And if you've already routed messages of voicemails at Google hangouts, these changes
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.340]   may not seem so drastic.
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:22.820]   But if you are still using the plain old Google voice apps, maybe do use another email to
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:25.740]   register for Google Fye.
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:30.860]   It doesn't sound good that we've been waiting for the other shoe to drop, haven't we, on
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:31.860]   Google voice?
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.180]   It's hard to tell for me to tell what this means.
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:36.260]   Yeah, I know exactly.
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.500]   I'm trying to understand it too.
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:43.740]   Somebody just posted in the chat that Russell Holly at Android police basically saying,
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:46.020]   you know, don't worry about it.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.220]   It's not going to destroy your Google voice accounts.
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:52.420]   So we're missing some sort of context area from the verge perhaps.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:53.420]   I trust Russell.
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:55.580]   Russell's been on all about Android many times.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:58.260]   He's a great commentator.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:04.300]   And he regularly is the one on the Android sites that's saying, hey, the sky's not falling.
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.300]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:06.660]   Everybody's freaking out over nothing.
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:10.140]   Let's take a step back and take a closer look.
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:14.220]   Android M, you just got used to L, we just got lollipop.
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.940]   Get ready for meringue pie.
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:19.140]   Marfa's a pan.
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.140]   Marfa's a pan.
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:21.140]   Marfa's a pan.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:28.180]   That would be a marshmallow marshmallow marshmallow marshmallow macaron.
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.940]   I think there's too much ghostbuster temptation here.
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:31.940]   Marshmallow.
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.620]   I want a ghostbuster.
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:34.620]   Look at this.
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:41.380]   This is the article from Android police has features macaroons French style macahole.
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:46.260]   They'll be announcing Android M at Google I/O according to the conference schedule.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.820]   They've since removed that page.
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:51.860]   But here's the screenshot that Android police got.
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:52.860]   Android for work update.
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:56.860]   Android M is bringing the power of Android all kinds of workplaces.
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.060]   Maybe that was just a typo.
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:03.860]   Maybe they meant L.
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:05.340]   L was announced last year at Google.
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:11.060]   Yeah, I'm pretty sure they meant M and they've just, you know, said it often didn't mean
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:12.060]   to.
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.820]   Or maybe they meant to.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:18.220]   Because Google, sometimes it seems like they, you know, this happens and it goes away and
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:23.740]   they know that people are just going to spend the next month obsessing over it.
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:24.740]   Yeah.
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.340]   I'm liking L a lot.
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.180]   But there are still some issues.
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.780]   There's still a memory leak which they have yet to fix.
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:32.780]   Really?
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:33.780]   Apparently.
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:34.780]   You don't have the problem.
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:38.380]   Well, you probably reboot your phone every few days.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:39.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:43.780]   How does that matter first?
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:50.820]   And this comes, you know, mostly from XDA developers and so forth.
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.300]   Let it be.
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.300]   Let's see.
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:59.460]   Here's a green bot article that's probably written in a user speak.
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:04.300]   It manifests somebody in the chatroom says because I have 400 apps.
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:08.620]   Android Lollipop, but this is an old article.
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:09.620]   So I'm not going to.
[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:11.220]   Well, it's from January.
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:17.740]   The issue tracks in the issue tracker in the AOSP bug tracker, it says ramp use of RAM.
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:21.820]   A memory leak causes apps either to run slowly or crash without any warning.
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:26.540]   Android 5.0.1 apparently takes up as much as 1.3 gigs of RAM.
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:29.940]   If you don't have more than two, that could be an issue.
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:33.260]   Ticket for the RAM issue opened on the AOSP tracker a month ago.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:35.940]   That would be end of the year last year.
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:42.180]   But I have also seen others say that neither 5.1 or 5.1 fixed it.
[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:45.460]   Yeah, I see the next results on that.
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:46.740]   Yeah, I reboot.
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:51.940]   I actually do reboot my Android device restart it, you know, just restart it every day or
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:52.940]   so.
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:53.940]   You do?
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:54.940]   Yeah.
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:56.500]   I have noticed and it could be a Samsung thing.
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:57.940]   God knows Samsung's got similar.
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:58.940]   Well, yeah.
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:00.660]   But it could be a Samsung thing.
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:07.940]   They apparently are so testing 5.2 already on the S6 Edge.
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:08.740]   People have seen it.
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:13.900]   But no word about whether that affects it or whether the issue is more of a Samsung issue.
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:18.420]   But yeah, I've noticed that it gets a little less responsive over time.
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.700]   And if you reboot it at all, seems like that could also people are right.
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.820]   I do have a little bit too many apps running.
[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:26.020]   So it could just me me.
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:29.500]   Yeah, I've only had Lolly pop a couple of days on my OnePlus one and I haven't seen
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:32.820]   that, but I forgot to plug it in and it ran out of battery.
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:33.820]   So I changed it.
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:35.820]   I had restarted it for that reason.
[01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:36.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:37.820]   I haven't seen that yet.
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:38.820]   That's interesting.
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:39.820]   I like Lolly pop though.
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:42.380]   Yeah, you're using oxygen on your OnePlus one probably, right?
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:43.380]   No, I know.
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:45.340]   It's a cyanogen 12.
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:46.340]   I guess it's 12.
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.380]   Oh, you got CM 12.
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:49.380]   Yes.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:50.380]   Yeah.
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.220]   See, I put now see, I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:54.700]   Jason and I both put oxygen on our OnePlus ones, right?
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:56.700]   Because it came out first.
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:57.700]   Right.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:58.700]   I just wanted to root it.
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:02.980]   Yeah, to do all that, you know, new recovery and twerp and all that.
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.980]   But I love it.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:08.220]   Yeah, but now I don't think I can put CM 12 probably on it, right?
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:10.420]   Because I think it's a lollipop based.
[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.420]   Could I?
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:12.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:13.700]   Oh, oxygen is as pure as can be.
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:16.020]   It's pure as the lollipop is a it can be.
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:18.020]   It's basically a GP.
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:19.180]   Oh.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:23.420]   There's very, very few customizations on top of it.
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:30.420]   All right, so I'm going to show you how to do it.
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:31.420]   All right.
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.420]   Pure product edition.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:34.420]   Let me see if there's a software update.
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:37.420]   This show I always check for updates.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:39.420]   Your device is up to date.
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:40.420]   Always up to date.
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:41.420]   Damn it.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.420]   Always up to date.
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:43.420]   I hate that about that.
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.420]   But I do like the I like a material design a lot.
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:47.420]   I think it's good.
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:52.420]   You know, I'm not crazy about touch was, you know, Samsung's, it's pretty clean, but Samsung
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:53.420]   is very easy.
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:54.500]   You just press and hold the start button.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:59.460]   You restart and five seconds later, you know, 10th, 30 seconds later.
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:00.460]   You're back.
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:03.620]   Are you finding any value to the curve?
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:07.620]   No, in fact, a little bit it gets in the way because you're touching the screen all the
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:08.620]   time.
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:10.860]   So sometimes I accidentally touch the screen.
[01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.500]   Having said that, this is the nicest.
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.500]   I love this phone.
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:18.780]   I'm going to be so glad now that I have an Android Wear watch that I can go back to using
[01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:20.460]   because I've had to use an iPhone.
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:21.460]   It's been painful.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:25.020]   I wanted that wouldn't last too long.
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.620]   I like actually like the Apple watch.
[01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:31.060]   I don't, I really think that what really has happened is there's very close parity at
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.580]   this point between Android Wear and Apple.
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:35.460]   And I think they're going to go back and forth like this, which pisses me off about the media
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:38.700]   coverage because, you know, when it came out, Apple came out, it was as if Android
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.460]   Wear didn't exist.
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:41.460]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:42.460]   Yeah.
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:43.460]   Yeah.
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.620]   I had the same feeling.
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:48.540]   Have you compared like the heartbeat monitoring and the steps?
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.740]   Are they comparable across the two watches, Leo?
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:55.220]   You know, some people have often, Dr. Mom keeps saying, why don't you wear all of the bands
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:58.660]   and then work out and see what they say.
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:02.300]   And I don't think that matters so much as long as you're consistent with one, right?
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:03.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:05.300]   You're right.
[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.300]   Because really you're comparing yourself to previous days.
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:14.940]   The Apple watch seems to be very, very accurate, I would say.
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:18.380]   Android Wear has been less so, but not horribly less so.
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:19.380]   I haven't.
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:21.380]   I haven't actually done any exercise with it.
[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.300]   So what is what is the, that's the LG one again?
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.620]   Oh, I guess we should talk about it.
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:25.620]   Let's take a break.
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.660]   We'll talk about the urbane.
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:29.300]   Is that urbane or what?
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:32.260]   Actually, I don't, maybe we don't need to, we only have one more, right?
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:33.260]   I could do it.
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:34.820]   We could do a little urbaneify.
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.860]   Is the flat tire going on there or not?
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:38.860]   Yeah, no flat tire.
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:40.980]   LG got rid of that with the, the R.
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:43.900]   As long as you have the bezel, you're okay.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:46.460]   And it's a, what I really like about it.
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:48.940]   And I think the key, well, the bezel doesn't hide it.
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:51.340]   It's just a, it's literally a round LED.
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:54.380]   Hello, what's going on here?
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.220]   Oh, that's kind of cool.
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:57.220]   I love the-
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:00.220]   But you could hide the electronics needed that required the flat tire in the-
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.220]   Underneath there.
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.220]   Maybe.
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.900]   I don't know if you, I think they're just using a different screen nowadays and they don't
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:05.900]   really- How is that it?
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:06.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:07.900]   Let me see if I can get.
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:10.860]   So, comes with some nice watch faces.
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:11.940]   This one's kind of interesting.
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:15.820]   This is called daily that gives you calendar information as well.
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:16.980]   But the big, look at that.
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:18.380]   See, that's my next appointment.
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:22.300]   The big, the big thing that's kind of cool about this is it's an OLED screen.
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:25.060]   So the Moto 360 is LCD.
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:28.420]   And once you get to, once you go OLED, you never go back.
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:33.980]   It just, and it also saves battery because only the white stuff is using juice.
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:38.660]   So I feel like, yeah, the other thing that I like Android Wear better, you notice the
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.140]   Apple watch turns off, it really has to save power.
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:43.260]   So it just goes blank.
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:45.980]   Android Wear has always had this kind of dim version.
[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:47.220]   That's what you're seeing right now.
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:49.260]   So the watch is always on.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:51.140]   You can always see what time it is.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:54.380]   But if you want, if you want to wake it up, you know, you do the little bit of the wrist
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.780]   thing.
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:01.780]   On the other hand, the Apple watch has consent heartbeats, which this cannot do yet.
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:02.980]   I keep pressing too hard.
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:05.100]   I forget it doesn't have force touch.
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.100]   I like this.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:07.100]   This is the stock watch.
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.100]   Oh, right.
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:09.100]   Force touch is an Apple watch thing.
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:10.100]   Yeah, that's an Apple watch thing.
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:11.100]   It detects pressure.
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:12.100]   Yeah.
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:13.100]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.100]   350 bucks on the Airbane.
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:18.260]   The same guts as the G watch are.
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:21.620]   But the OLED screen is gorgeous.
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:22.620]   And I think it's the stylized.
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:24.940]   You know, it's a little, maybe it's a little ostentatious.
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:25.940]   I got the gold one.
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:27.820]   They have a silver one as well.
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:32.660]   But if for 350 bucks you get gold, I think it's a good looking watch.
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:33.660]   It is.
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:34.660]   Yeah.
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:36.820]   How big does it feel versus the, uh, this, the Moto?
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:39.620]   This is a 42 millimeter Apple watch.
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:44.060]   The Moto is about the same size, you know, square versus round.
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:49.900]   This is big, a slender, rested man or woman might not like this.
[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:50.900]   Which I am.
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:51.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:55.780]   And there's no, unlike the Apple watch where you can go 38 millimeters, there's no, there's
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:58.420]   no alternative in the Android wear space.
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.940]   They're all big.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:01.940]   The Apple watch is pretty.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:02.940]   I mean, come on, you can't.
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:03.940]   It is.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:04.940]   That's cool.
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:05.940]   I mean, that one's pretty hip.
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.740]   Like it's pretty hipster, but I like it.
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:08.740]   It's 40.
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:10.940]   Are you saying my specific one is pretty hipster?
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:11.940]   I think so.
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:16.260]   No, no, I mean hipster in a good way.
[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:19.460]   Is it more hipster if I have Mickey on it?
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:21.020]   Now, now, now.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.940]   What about the Mickey face?
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:24.580]   I like the face of that.
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:25.580]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:27.380]   Well, remember Disney and Apple are kind of close.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:28.380]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:34.820]   Um, this is the stainless steel with Milanese loop, which is about 700 bucks as, as displayed
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:36.420]   upon my hairy wrist.
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:41.540]   This is $350 with a leather band, although it's a standard 22 millimeter.
[01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:44.140]   So you can put any watch band you want on there.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.020]   What is the your being going sale?
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:47.020]   It's been.
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:48.020]   I bought it last week.
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:49.020]   You were here.
[01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:50.020]   You did it.
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:51.020]   It still says it didn't appear to be on sale.
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:52.020]   Oh, yeah, it's on sale.
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:53.020]   I bought it last week.
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:54.020]   It's coming soon.
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:55.020]   No, it says coming soon.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:56.020]   Oh, they ran out site.
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.020]   They ran out.
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:59.020]   Oh, they ran out.
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:00.020]   Sorry.
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:06.420]   Oh, um, it also, this is the first watch with the Android wear five.
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:07.420]   Is it five two?
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:08.420]   I guess I guess.
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:09.420]   I believe.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:10.420]   Or five point one.
[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:14.900]   And so that's kind of cool because it has the new card flick, which I can't do examine
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:18.940]   cards, but you can instead of touching it, you can flick the cards like this.
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:19.940]   It also has Wi-Fi.
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:23.540]   Oh, so that is the cars.
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:24.540]   So I'm wrong.
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.540]   It's nope.
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:26.540]   I was stuck.
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:27.540]   I was stuck.
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:28.540]   Yeah, they sold that.
[01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:34.180]   Apparently you can get them elsewhere, including a, I think, 18 team Verizon had them.
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:36.740]   So the silver is in stock.
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:37.740]   Not the gold.
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:39.420]   You you you adores the gold.
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:42.580]   Well, it's a little coppery, but it's, you know, what do you think, Gina?
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:43.580]   What do you think?
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:45.580]   Tacial earth here.
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:47.780]   On the style of that watch.
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:48.780]   Silver versus gold.
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:49.780]   Oh, silver.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:50.780]   I'm silver person.
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:51.780]   Sorry, Leo.
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:55.740]   I would go with the silver, but I think silver looks nice and then has a complimentary
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:57.300]   leather band.
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:03.060]   I really like actually this, this watch a lot.
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:04.220]   You know what it comes down to?
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:05.940]   What are you going to carry an iPhone or an Android phone?
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:06.940]   What do you like better?
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:10.180]   Because the watches are so similar in capability.
[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:13.860]   Do you think these watches are ever going to talk to other, the other operating system
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:14.860]   or not?
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:16.500]   It doesn't seem like there's any financial incentive.
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:19.620]   I mean, it seems like these are accessories to the phone.
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:24.300]   Ports are that Google is going to do a version of Android Wear for iOS.
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:27.900]   Yeah, but it will not be very capable because Apple.
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:28.900]   Because it can't.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:29.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:30.900]   Apple doesn't give you access to all the stuff.
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:35.020]   I mean, certainly the Apple watch will always be the most capable choice for somebody
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:39.060]   wearing using an iPhone.
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.060]   I think they're both good.
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.860]   I think smart watches are of limited utility.
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:49.380]   And nobody should think of a smart watch as something that they have to have.
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:51.340]   It doesn't do more than the phone does.
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:52.340]   Well, I guess it does.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.660]   If you talk about sending heartbeats, I can't do that with the phone.
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:14:01.980]   And having sent Lisa an awful lot of heartbeats now, I think we're kind of over it.
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:04.380]   The other person has to have an Apple phone.
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:10.780]   Yeah, that really seemed more like a marketing thing than actual something.
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:17.660]   It's no longer even romantic, to be honest with you.
[01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:20.140]   So that's that Leo, that's marriage.
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:25.860]   Yeah, maybe the Apple watches like marriage after six months, you couldn't care less.
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:27.860]   No, that's terrible.
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:28.860]   I'm joking.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:30.860]   I'm joking, honey.
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:33.460]   Send another heart quick.
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:36.900]   I am actually joking.
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:39.340]   It's just, you know, of course, Lisa and I work together.
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:44.580]   So if I wanted to send her a heartbeat, I could just press my chest against her ear.
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:47.340]   That would make that would make good show, right?
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:48.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:49.340]   What are you doing?
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:51.140]   Get away from me.
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:52.780]   So anyway.
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:58.580]   What else is new in the Google verse?
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:14:59.580]   Let me look quickly.
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:00.580]   What else?
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.460]   Stuff here, yeah, let's see.
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:07.620]   I think when we talk to think about this idea that the Wi-Fi now is available just as the
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:11.900]   Apple watch can talk to the phone anywhere within the Wi-Fi network.
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:15.500]   This is the first Android where they use that feature and it does have Wi-Fi enabled
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:16.780]   on it.
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:21.020]   And I want to test whether it apparently will use the public internet if it can get on the
[01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:22.020]   Wi-Fi.
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:25.020]   So I'm going to leave my phone home tomorrow or something.
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:28.740]   You're going to phone call on it because one matter of you is Google voice.
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:29.740]   That's okay.
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:36.860]   So I'm going to go ahead and talk about the last I/O item, a twig fan, Matt Guttard.
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:38.060]   This says it before every I/O.
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:39.380]   He looks up Google patents.
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:40.860]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:45.180]   And he found very interesting research and he found a whole bunch that appears to be
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:46.700]   about a newfangled camera.
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:49.740]   Oh, this is worth passing on.
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:58.940]   I found a lot of rumors that Apple was going to have a new style camera with almost like
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:03.660]   the HTC One camera with depth sensing in it.
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:09.420]   And a whole new way of doing this quad core image processor, multiple core image processors,
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:14.060]   portable device, image processing, nothing using sensed eye position.
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:15.060]   Right.
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:17.260]   Hand out imaging device with sister.
[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:18.260]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:20.900]   Oh, these are what you're looking at.
[01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:23.500]   That would make more sense.
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:24.500]   Could be.
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:25.500]   Yeah, could be.
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:31.020]   The problem with patents is especially in a big company.
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:33.340]   Camera separate from processing unit.
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:34.340]   So communication.
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:37.340]   So I don't know.
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:39.660]   Everything is patent everything defensively.
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:40.660]   Yes.
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:42.860]   So it's not necessarily an indicator that they're going to be doing anything.
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:44.140]   No, but I like that.
[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:45.140]   I like the research.
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.140]   That was fun.
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:54.140]   On the other hand, if I file a patent, you can bet that I mean it.
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:58.100]   I think Vic promise that they're working on a new camera.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:00.260]   It was a couple of IOs ago.
[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:02.980]   I feel like it was maybe like right before the last I.
[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:06.940]   Where people were saying, hey, there isn't an Android phone that has the camera or can
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:08.940]   take the photos that the iPhone can.
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:09.940]   You know, what's going on?
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:10.940]   And he actually has a phone.
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:13.180]   Yeah, it was Victor or Eric Schmidt.
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:19.540]   I can't remember which, but basically to the effect of the next Nexus is going to have
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:23.780]   an amazing camera, the Nexus 6, which I'm not sure if I would qualify the Nexus 6 as
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:25.580]   having an amazing camera.
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:28.660]   So it was probably just talking it up a little bit.
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:29.660]   Yeah, he was.
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:30.660]   But who knows?
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:33.300]   That's what the next Nexus needs to have, right?
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.940]   We keep asking for it every year.
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:39.140]   But this is one, this is like a different year from any others in the world of Android
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:44.140]   and the fact that there are cameras on Android phones now that absolutely go head to head
[01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:48.540]   with the other amazing camera phone, which is the iPhone.
[01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:49.540]   The S6.
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:52.420]   The S6 easily goes head to head with the iPhone.
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:54.420]   The LG G-Froer.
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:55.420]   Amazing camera.
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:18:00.420]   So now suddenly we've got a taste of it and we want it on all the other devices.
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:02.380]   So I really hope that that happens with the Nexus.
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:06.980]   I think that Apple will update its camera on the next iPhone, which comes out in the
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:07.980]   fall.
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:09.620]   So it's going to be, you know what?
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:10.620]   Competition.
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:11.620]   Great thing.
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:12.620]   Absolutely.
[01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:13.620]   Love it.
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:14.620]   It's a good photographer.
[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:15.620]   Love it.
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:16.620]   Better cameras, watches, whatever.
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:20.420]   Just to bottom line, take away on any smart watches.
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:22.020]   It's a luxury, not a necessity.
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:25.220]   It might be of value to you if you do the particular kinds of things, smart watches,
[01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:27.020]   are good at, exercise.
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:30.140]   Listen, you know, I mean, there's some value to it.
[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:35.740]   But for the most part, it's a luxury item that really isn't a necessity.
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:40.180]   Your phone does everything in most cases and just fine.
[01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:44.460]   So I'm not wild about this.
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:51.820]   Google is, according to Android police, going to also introduce at I/O voice commands
[01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:57.700]   that will let you control apps entirely through voice.
[01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:01.620]   This would be kind of the big issue with watches I have is they're too small to really
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:03.060]   do anything useful.
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:04.740]   The UI is just too constrained.
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.260]   But it's also too embarrassing to talk to your wrist.
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:09.620]   Well, and I have had phone calls where I'm talking to wrist.
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:10.620]   Hey, talk to the wrist.
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:11.620]   Yeah.
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:13.340]   I mean, it's cool, I guess.
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:14.340]   It's, you know what?
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:20.460]   It's great to be able to answer an Apple watch call and say, like, hey, I'm in the middle
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:21.460]   of a show right now.
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:22.460]   It's like a couple of times.
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:23.460]   Can I call you back?
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:26.140]   And it's quick and it's, and you don't look like too much of a fool.
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:28.260]   You wouldn't want to walk down the street talking to your wife.
[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:29.260]   Maybe you would.
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:30.260]   Maybe we'll get used to it.
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:33.140]   We got used to people talking themselves with Bluetooth earbuds.
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:34.140]   No.
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:37.140]   So you can, you can talk into the Apple watch.
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:38.140]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:39.140]   Can you hear what the other person says?
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.140]   Yeah, you got a conversation.
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:41.860]   There's a speaker on it.
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:42.860]   Yeah.
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:43.860]   It's a phone.
[01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:49.020]   You can make a phone call.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:57.420]   These actions in the new, is this part of, this is part of Android, right?
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:58.420]   Yeah.
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:03.140]   Would be able to allow developers to design apps that use voice commands instead of touch
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:06.620]   input without adding a lot of overhead.
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:11.300]   It'll give users access to their Android device through voice alone.
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:13.900]   There's some new voice actions I have it in the changelog as well.
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:14.900]   I'll find along these lines.
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:18.660]   So I can't tell if this is referring to that or if they're just going to open it up to
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:21.020]   every developer and right now it's just partners.
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.980]   Hey, you want to see the wrist flick on the air band?
[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:25.900]   I got a few, a few cards I can show you.
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.660]   So you see the cards, actually, this is kind of nice.
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:32.300]   This is in the, when it is in the dim mode, the cards just show up as a little bit of
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:35.380]   text at the bottom of the screen, which is kind of nice.
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:38.020]   You know you've got a notification and you can kind of read it.
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:41.220]   When it's in the bright mode, it shows up as most Android wear watches.
[01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:42.220]   And this is the new thing.
[01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:44.740]   Instead of swiping, you can do the wrist flick.
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:45.740]   Oops.
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:46.740]   Oh.
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:49.740]   And you go to the next one like that.
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:51.220]   Actually, I'm going to have to.
[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:53.060]   Carpal tunnel awaits.
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:54.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:57.820]   You know what it's, you know, and it's for a certain resource.
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:01.500]   I'll wait until you're, I'm telling you Nick Bilton is going to write the story about,
[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:04.940]   about, about, uh, uh, Android wear syndrome.
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:05.940]   Yeah.
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:07.440]   It's for strap hangers.
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:10.900]   If your other hand is busy, you can look at the watch and you can go like that.
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:11.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:12.900]   Okay.
[01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:13.900]   Okay.
[01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:14.900]   I see it.
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:15.900]   Yeah.
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:16.900]   I don't mind that.
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:20.140]   I mean, you don't have to use it and you could certainly turn it off.
[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:22.140]   No, I like it.
[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:23.140]   I'm jealous.
[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:24.140]   No, I want it.
[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:29.060]   Voice actions, the session and that this is people saw the session because I guess all
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:30.660]   the sessions are up now.
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:35.500]   Voice access is called your app now available hands free.
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:38.780]   What are they going to give you guys?
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:40.980]   You're going, you're going, Oh, you're not going.
[01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:41.980]   I'm not going.
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.100]   I was wondering what the, what the coverage plan is.
[01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:47.540]   If I can help, I watch on the live stream.
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:51.140]   If you want to get home and yeah, I'd be happy to, I'd be happy to be one of your
[01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:52.140]   conversations.
[01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:53.140]   I'll be there.
[01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:54.140]   So I'll be live.
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:55.140]   Oh sweet.
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:56.140]   You'll be there.
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:57.140]   Jeff.
[01:21:57.140 --> 01:21:58.140]   Good.
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:21:59.140]   Oh, you're not going to go either.
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:00.140]   Go ahead.
[01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:01.140]   I'm going.
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:02.140]   This was an oboe.
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:03.140]   Oh yeah.
[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:04.140]   Yeah.
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:05.140]   Yeah.
[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:06.140]   And Jason's going in my kelkins.
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:07.140]   Jason.
[01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:09.140]   How's going in my kelkins going from our team?
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:10.140]   So, um, this is coming up when June is soon now actually, like the end of the month.
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:11.140]   Yeah.
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:12.140]   Time flies.
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:13.140]   Yeah.
[01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:15.820]   So, uh, those who live coverage as we always do have the keynote as long as they stream
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:18.860]   it, which I think they will, are they doing three days of keynotes again?
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:20.700]   No, just one, one long keynote.
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.700]   One very, very long.
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:25.100]   So it's Thursday and Friday this year, uh, the potty, basically.
[01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:27.300]   Go to the potty before the keynote.
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:28.300]   Yeah.
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:29.300]   Yeah.
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:30.300]   Yeah.
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:31.300]   Thursday and Friday, Thursday morning will be the keynote, basically.
[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:32.300]   All right.
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:33.300]   All right.
[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:34.300]   So we'll be doing that.
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:38.820]   We'll be here live covering, uh, and, uh, Jeff and Jason Howell and Mike Elgin will be
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.460]   in the event.
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:42.660]   So we'll get your, so we're going to do something afterwards.
[01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:47.300]   If you want, I, I got really cause twigs on Wednesday, I think it'll be, you, you can
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:49.220]   just enjoy yourself.
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:50.220]   No need to cross any.
[01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:51.220]   Happy to work.
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:55.420]   No, no, we'll be crossing the bridge on Wednesday and seeing you, but oh, that's right.
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:56.420]   Okay.
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:57.420]   Oh, you're going to go on studio Wednesday.
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:58.420]   Cool.
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:22:59.420]   Yeah.
[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:00.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:01.420]   It'll be there.
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.420]   Nice.
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:03.420]   I'm going to the val.
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:05.820]   I'd be going to the valley on Monday or Tuesday.
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:06.820]   No fun.
[01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:11.260]   And then Wednesday up to you and then, uh, I'll go.
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.260]   Good.
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:18.340]   Um, so Leo, I am, uh, I am doing during the, I'd be happy to be, if you're going to do
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:21.780]   lead, do, be a studio, whoever's in studio, I'd be happy to call in.
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:25.060]   It'd be you, me and whoever else we can wrangle into it.
[01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:26.740]   Uh, and we'll cover live.
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:30.060]   And Jeff, what do you think you and Jason, Oh, no, Jeff, you're not going.
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:31.460]   No, Jeff is going.
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:32.460]   Jeff is going.
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:33.460]   I am going.
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:34.460]   It's okay.
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:35.940]   Leo, I'm old too.
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:37.980]   I forget things I heard two minutes ago too.
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:38.980]   It's okay.
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:39.980]   Leo.
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:40.980]   It's all right.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:41.980]   What?
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:47.780]   Uh, so, uh, Jeff, what do you think you, Jason and Michael will be getting?
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:48.780]   More cardboard?
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:53.220]   I wonder if they're going to, if this might be the year they surprise us and say, sorry,
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:55.380]   guys, games over.
[01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:57.780]   I think it's a bad trend that they said it.
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:58.780]   Yeah.
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:02.420]   We've said that before and I don't, I mean, it's lovely to have and it's great to really
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:05.420]   see the gadgets and they get to show it off.
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:08.180]   But, um, and I think, I think that it helps them.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:12.660]   I mean, I think people pay more attention to Chromebooks, apart because of, of, of giving
[01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:13.660]   away the pixel.
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:14.660]   Right.
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:17.380]   Um, they didn't know, use them, but I think they said, Oh, there's this.
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:20.020]   The end top is hopeful that the new pixel will be available.
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:22.660]   Of course, I've already had mine, but that's okay.
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:24.620]   I meet you the same thing last time.
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:25.620]   Absolutely.
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:32.380]   Um, I wonder whether, I mean, the problem is they can't give five to everybody.
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:33.380]   Right.
[01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:36.980]   Well, apparently many people won't want it.
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:37.980]   Yeah.
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:45.100]   So, uh, and they haven't generally, I mean, maybe they've done this with a phone with phones
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:52.060]   in the past, but they haven't really duplicated, uh, a handout year to year.
[01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:53.740]   So like, Oh, it's not going to be another watch.
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:54.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:56.340]   So I wouldn't expect another watch necessarily.
[01:24:56.340 --> 01:25:01.380]   I actually wouldn't expect another Chromebook unless they feel like they, they really want
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:03.700]   to get everyone inspired on making more chromatic.
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:09.460]   Which could be, it could be an ACE's flip and ACE's flip would be an ACE's flip.
[01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:10.460]   What's that?
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:11.460]   The Chromebook.
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:12.780]   Oh, the ACE is flip.
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:13.780]   That's the tablet.
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:14.780]   Come on.
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:15.780]   I'm waiting for it.
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:16.780]   It's coming out soon.
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:17.780]   Oh, it's a test.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:18.780]   Is it a convertible?
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:19.780]   Yeah.
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:20.780]   Yeah, it's cool.
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:21.780]   Oh, you don't know.
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:24.100]   You don't want it's going to be is what's, what's the little, uh, the Chromebook, the Chromebook
[01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:26.700]   kind of stick, Chromebook on a stick.
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:27.700]   Yeah.
[01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:28.700]   Yeah.
[01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:29.700]   You know what I mean.
[01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:30.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:31.700]   That's what they'll give away.
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:32.700]   That's what they'll give away.
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:33.700]   Sure.
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:34.700]   Yeah.
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:35.700]   Yeah.
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:36.700]   Yeah.
[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:37.700]   Under a hundred bucks.
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:38.700]   We don't, it might even be a lot under under.
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:39.700]   All right.
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:41.700]   And they set the heart, the bar high with cardboard.
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:44.900]   Were they, how are they going to talk cardboard this year?
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:46.700]   Cardboard turned out to actually be really great.
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:48.700]   The most thing you could have got.
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:50.700]   That was, it was better than a Chromebook.
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:51.700]   One of the most memorable.
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:52.700]   Yeah.
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:57.340]   I mean, Nexus Q, the Chrome box, I really gave us the, the, the one year they gave us the,
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:58.620]   the, actually the Chrome box.
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:02.980]   The Pixel was amazing, you know, but the cardboard was, you know, because it was a piece of cardboard
[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:05.980]   but such a cool piece of cardboard that really stuck out.
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:06.980]   Right.
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:13.180]   A TAP apparently is, has, has some sessions that, you know, where they say they're going
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:18.020]   to show off wearables in quotes, wearables that we hope will blow your socks off.
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:19.420]   I mean, IO is all about.
[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:20.420]   Wait a minute.
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:21.420]   That means they're shoes.
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:22.420]   Wait a minute.
[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:23.420]   See, I'm not kidding.
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:24.420]   See?
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:25.420]   Wait a minute.
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:26.420]   So I'll, I'll say.
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:27.420]   Who knows your socks off.
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:30.780]   Maybe it's like a house arrest band.
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:32.580]   We can only hope.
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:35.100]   Why would you want to wearable in a shoe?
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:36.100]   It's get smart.
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:40.860]   A shoe phone, a shoe phone, get smart.
[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:42.420]   Is sports illustrator used to have a sneaker phone?
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:44.540]   I like that idea.
[01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:45.540]   It sounds silly.
[01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:46.540]   I do.
[01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:47.540]   But there's something to this.
[01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:51.100]   IBM used to have a thing that would be in your shoe.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:56.020]   And then when you shook hands with somebody, you would make a connection between his shoe
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:27:01.740]   and your shoe and it would transfer his business card to you from, from it by the handshake.
[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:02.740]   Oh my God.
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:03.740]   You gotta be kidding me.
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:05.060]   They showed it at Comdex.
[01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:06.060]   People were using it.
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:09.460]   That was a, maybe that's what it is.
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.460]   I don't know.
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:14.900]   Levitation shoes.
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:17.300]   Most accurate, a step tracker out there.
[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:18.300]   Okay.
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:19.300]   It's in your shoe.
[01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:20.300]   Well, of course, that's right.
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:22.100]   I keep things worked with the Nike.
[01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:23.100]   I keep that.
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:24.100]   Right.
[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:25.100]   Right.
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:26.100]   Yeah.
[01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:29.780]   And you know, the giveaways that IO aren't just giveaways to, you know, give you stuff.
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:34.140]   Really Google is also doing it because they want to spur development in a particular
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:36.300]   area or a particular direction.
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:37.300]   Right.
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:40.620]   So, you know, maybe, maybe there are, is some sort of wearable that we haven't thought
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:44.300]   about that Google would hand out because it's a different type of wearable.
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:49.820]   Also not to mention, um, play services update allows for multiple wearable devices to connect
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:53.140]   to one, uh, smartphone at a time, right?
[01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:56.380]   No one's, well, except for you, Leo, you're wearing two watches at the same time.
[01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:57.380]   Well, I see.
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:00.740]   I'm not saying that, but you might have different wearable devices in other ways.
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:01.740]   You have to have fun.
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:02.740]   Yeah, that's what it's for.
[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:03.740]   You have one.
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:04.740]   That's what it's for.
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:05.740]   One in your shoe.
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:06.740]   One in your sports jacket.
[01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:07.740]   Well, if you, whatever it happens.
[01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:08.740]   And an Android.
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:09.740]   Right.
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:10.740]   That would make sense.
[01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:14.100]   So maybe there are other wearables that we don't know of yet.
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:18.020]   And you know that there will be plenty of nerds at IO wearing both Android WearWatch
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:22.300]   and Google Glass and have a tablet, a Chromebook and a phone on them.
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:23.300]   You know that.
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:25.300]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:29.260]   We're not going to do the, uh, I don't think we'll do the, uh, change log.
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:33.260]   I don't want to make Gina feel like that's just got to do that every time she comes.
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:34.820]   Oh, I'm.
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:35.820]   There's not that much.
[01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:36.820]   There's like a couple of things.
[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:37.820]   It's not that much.
[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:39.820]   And we talked about the voice actions, which was, which was really, really, really, really
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:40.820]   good.
[01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:41.820]   Yeah.
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:42.820]   That was one of them.
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:43.820]   Yeah.
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:44.820]   That was one of them.
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:45.820]   Yeah.
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:46.820]   That was one of them.
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:47.820]   Yeah.
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:48.820]   You want to talk about that collections?
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:51.820]   Yeah, we could, we could talk about that new Google plus feature.
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:53.820]   And I actually haven't gotten it yet, but I think Jason got it.
[01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:54.820]   We were showing it last time.
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:55.820]   And I'm going to talk about it.
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:56.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:57.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:28:58.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:28:59.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:00.820]   I'm going to talk about it.

[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:02.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:03.820]   I'm going to talk about it.

[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:33.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:34.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:35.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:36.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:37.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:38.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:39.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:40.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:41.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:42.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:43.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:44.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:45.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:46.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:47.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:48.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:49.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:50.820]   I'm going to talk about it.
[01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:51.820]   I think that's telling, isn't it?
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:55.820]   I put up a picture of fried cod skin from Copenhagen.
[01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:57.820]   Boy, was it good.
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:30:58.820]   Okay.
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:30:59.820]   Follow Jeff on Google Plus.
[01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:01.820]   You'll see fried cod skin.
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:02.820]   Follow me on Google Plus.
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:08.500]   You'll see comparison of Android Wear versus Apple Watch.
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.740]   Which would you rather see?
[01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:11.740]   Fried cod skin.
[01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:12.740]   Follow me.
[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:18.940]   You'll see the fanciest toilet paper in the world.
[01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:20.420]   Oh, well.
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:21.420]   I like Google Plus.
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:23.420]   It's my home page on my browser.
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:27.620]   I have it on all of my -- look, you can even see it's on the front page of the S6 and the
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:28.620]   iPhone.
[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:36.820]   I mean, this is the first edition right around a year to Google Plus.
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:37.820]   edition.
[01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:39.420]   First new feature given to it.
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:40.420]   That's a good point.
[01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:41.420]   Since Vic left.
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:42.420]   Since Vic left.
[01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:46.820]   All we've seen up until now is features being redirected to other places.
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:47.820]   Maybe.
[01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:48.820]   Have we seen new photo?
[01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:52.300]   Possibly, we've seen minor updates to photos.
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:32:00.140]   But even photos is being extracted out of Google Plus and sent to its own home.
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:01.140]   So.
[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:06.460]   I'm totally happy with Google Plus powering the comments on apps in the Play Store and
[01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:07.620]   on YouTube.
[01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:11.540]   And maybe even if somebody wants to embed comments in their website.
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:16.100]   But yeah, I think that the kind of social network -- well, I don't want to say this.
[01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:17.820]   I feel like I'm going to upset our viewers.
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:21.020]   There are a lot of people in the community that love Google Plus.
[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:22.020]   I love it.
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:26.300]   And I prefer social networks that are kind of dying.
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:27.300]   And so.
[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:29.860]   Well, I do.
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:33.260]   I stayed on "Friend Feed Long" after the mojo had gone.
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:34.260]   Yeah, you did.
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:36.660]   I kept on secret.
[01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:37.660]   I thought, you know what?
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:38.660]   I felt so bad.
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:41.740]   I would only look at secret while I was on their can.
[01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:42.740]   No.
[01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:45.900]   I felt perfectly appropriate.
[01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:48.260]   And I would always feel dirty afterwards.
[01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:51.340]   So I deleted it from my phone.
[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:52.340]   No toilet.
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:55.060]   No toilet so you could fix that.
[01:32:55.060 --> 01:33:02.100]   No, but wash and toilet so you could fix that secret stink.
[01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:04.780]   I think I should probably go home now.
[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.460]   We still have two ads.
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:07.460]   Two?
[01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:08.460]   Yes.
[01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:09.460]   Oh, I thought I did two.
[01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:11.860]   All right, here we go.
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:12.860]   Let's do one right now.
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:13.860]   We do.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:15.860]   There's lots more to talk about.
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:18.660]   Our show today brought to you by SmartThings.
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:20.380]   Actually, this is a great topic.
[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:22.220]   I like talking about the Smart Home.
[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:24.780]   And when I do go home, you know my home will welcome me.
[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:25.780]   Because I have SmartThings.
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:28.100]   My home will play some soothing music.
[01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:34.820]   We'll put on sunset on my hue lights.
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:37.540]   You know, it knows I'm there thanks to SmartThings.
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:39.580]   SmartThings was a Kickstarter project.
[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:43.580]   In fact, one I believe that Ms. Tripani invested in.
[01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:47.060]   The idea was simple to take all of the smart devices you have in your home.
[01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:51.100]   You Schlage locks your quickset locks your dropcams, your nest and honey well thermostats,
[01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:52.100]   all that stuff.
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:57.020]   And instead of just each of them talking to their own app on your phone, they all talk
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:34:00.300]   to the SmartThings hub, which then talks to the SmartThings app on your phone.
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:04.420]   And suddenly you can roll everything simply and easily.
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:08.500]   This is the right way to do smart things.
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:11.980]   Once you have the SmartThings hub in the free app, you can add as many devices as you
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.460]   want to customize your smart home.
[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:16.060]   And it works with so many things.
[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:19.580]   In fact, there's a list on the SmartThings page that just goes on.
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:23.860]   Z-Wave, ZigBee, local area network, cloud to cloud.
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:28.380]   All the protocols are handled by SmartThings.
[01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:29.980]   We love it and you'll love it too.
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:30.980]   So here's the deal.
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:32.940]   Visit smartthings.com.
[01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:34.220]   Take a look at their solution kits.
[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:37.660]   These are good because they kind of, you know, if you've kind of seen, what can I do?
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:40.900]   Like there's the energy saver kit that will, you know, turn off things when you're not
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:43.100]   around, not moving.
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:47.660]   There's the lighting automation kit that will, there's water detection.
[01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:49.700]   That's actually great for the vacation home.
[01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:52.220]   If the pipes burst, you'll know.
[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:53.220]   Here's the deal.
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:57.320]   Go to smartthings.com and get 10% off any home solution, home, I'm sorry, home security
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:00.820]   or solution kit and free shipping in the US.
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:03.220]   Smartthings.com/twit.
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:05.900]   And don't forget to use that offer code TWIT.
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:11.180]   Visit smartthings.com/twit.
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:12.340]   We love it.
[01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:13.340]   Use it.
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:15.060]   It's part of my smart home.
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:16.620]   I don't know if you know, it's nice.
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:18.380]   It actually doesn't feel like a smart home.
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:20.660]   It just feels like things just work.
[01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:23.180]   It's not like the home is like alive.
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:26.620]   Smartthings just makes it kind of all just work, which I actually, to me, that's even
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:27.620]   better.
[01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:28.620]   It's a great product.
[01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:31.100]   I'm glad that they are sponsoring us.
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:32.100]   Cloud Bigtable.
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:33.100]   Oh boy.
[01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:35.420]   Can you play this to me?
[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:36.420]   No.
[01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:37.420]   No.
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:38.420]   No.
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:40.780]   A highly scalable, performant, no SQL database.
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:49.380]   You know, I, you know, this is really geeky, but I was playing with a JavaScript framework
[01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:53.100]   called Meteor and I was asking around about it and they said, "Oh, it's nice.
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:55.300]   Yeah, it's great except it uses Mongo."
[01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:56.740]   I said, "What's wrong with Mongo?"
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:58.900]   "Oh, you don't know?"
[01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:04.660]   MongoDB, which is another very popular DB, no SQL, no SQL database.
[01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:07.260]   Apparently, has loses data all the time.
[01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:08.260]   Oh, really?
[01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:09.260]   I didn't know this.
[01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:11.420]   I didn't know that either.
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:13.660]   But people who develop with it say, "Oh."
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:14.660]   Oh.
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:19.180]   So that's not a good thing in a database, missing data.
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:22.100]   Generally, with a database, you do want the data to be there.
[01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:25.820]   And I hope I'm not, I hope I'm not besmirching Mongo because I like Mongo.
[01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:27.620]   I think Meteor is great and it uses Mongo.
[01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:31.820]   It's very easy, but you're not using Mongo, are you?
[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:32.820]   We're not.
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:33.820]   We're old school.
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:34.820]   My SQL.
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:36.820]   Very old school.
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:41.420]   But I think I'm ready to move into NoSQL because that's the new hotness.
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:44.820]   It's kind of faster because it's less overhead.
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:52.420]   Anyway, Cloud Bigtable is Google's NoSQL database and it is to use a buzz term or two,
[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:56.660]   highly scalable and performant.
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:59.460]   Performance should not be a word.
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:03.780]   It's a now and it's an adjective that sounds like a now.
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:08.020]   And it's made up, I think.
[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:12.820]   Anyway, this is nice that Google releases this kind of thing.
[01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:18.260]   Gmail runs on Bigtable, Google Search runs on Bigtable, Google Analytics runs on Bigtable.
[01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:22.740]   That should be enough to tell you Bigtable is fast and effective.
[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:28.740]   Single-digit millisecond latency, twice the performance per dollar and can be integrated
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:32.980]   with all existing applications in the Hadoop ecosystem.
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:34.980]   There I said it.
[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:36.860]   All right, moving on.
[01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:38.860]   There you go.
[01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:45.380]   This is an interesting article from The Verge, eight Cloud Photo Sharing Services.
[01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:49.420]   This is what PC Magazine used to do this kind of thing.
[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:56.220]   It's what the big publication should be doing, comparing multiple, only a company with a
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:59.660]   lot of resources can compare them all.
[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:01.260]   And that's what they've done here at The Verge.
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:02.860]   Casey Newton, love him.
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:06.460]   All-time greatest album, The Best Way to Manage Your Photos in 2015.
[01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:12.300]   And the point Casey made is that really everything has now reached some sort of feature parody.
[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:15.100]   So which one should you pick?
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:21.980]   Amazon just started their service.
[01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:27.940]   If you've got Prime, it's kind of unlimited storage for Prime members.
[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:33.700]   I could tell you right now, do not use Apple's Cloud Drive.
[01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:34.700]   It's just crazy.
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:37.700]   iCloud Photo Library does not work.
[01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:38.700]   Photos, right?
[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:39.700]   It sounds just photos.
[01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:40.700]   Photos.
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:43.460]   And it's just been a nightmare for me.
[01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:46.820]   And you've lost, you lose some photo album metadata from the old rival.
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:49.340]   It's probably running on MongoDB.
[01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:54.260]   I mean, you got it.
[01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:56.140]   But Casey said Apple has never been great at the cost.
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:39:00.340]   And Apple charges more, really, for storage than I think anybody else does.
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:01.900]   It's a buck for 20 gigs a month.
[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:03.340]   A buck a month for 20 gigs.
[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:07.340]   Dropbox and Carousel, I do use.
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:08.340]   It's pretty cool.
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:12.340]   Flickr is now giving you a terabyte for free, so why not?
[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:14.540]   My Flickr is just so abandoned, though.
[01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:15.540]   It's so sad.
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:18.460]   There's no one on there anymore.
[01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:19.700]   It might not work anyway.
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:20.860]   Yeah.
[01:39:20.860 --> 01:39:22.860]   So which is your favorite each of you?
[01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:24.780]   Well, I do -- so here's my recommendation.
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:29.980]   Use a couple because many of them are very inexpensive.
[01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:31.220]   I use Dropbox.
[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:32.740]   I use Flickr.
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:35.260]   I use Google+, and I use OneDrive.
[01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:37.060]   You forgot where a photo is?
[01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:41.540]   No, they all -- so every picture I take on my camera phone uploads to OneDrive, Google
[01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:45.220]  +, I actually do not automatically upload a Flickr.
[01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:47.020]   OneDrive, Google+, and Facebook.
[01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:48.020]   Wow.
[01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:49.020]   And that way, I don't have to worry everything.
[01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:50.620]   But they're all private, but they're all safe.
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:55.460]   And because they offer basically all offer free unlimited storage, OneDrive free unlimited
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:40:00.500]   storage if you have a office subscription.
[01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:02.580]   And Dropbox, I have a huge amount of Dropbox.
[01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:05.020]   So I don't know what this picture life is.
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:06.020]   What do you do?
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:07.500]   I use Smugmug too.
[01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:08.500]   Love Smugmug.
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:09.500]   Oh, wow.
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:10.500]   Yeah.
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:14.780]   I only -- I turn on auto upload to Google, to Google photos.
[01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:15.780]   Right.
[01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:16.780]   Right.
[01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:17.780]   So that's for storing.
[01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:19.780]   And then to share, I -- it's Instagram.
[01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:20.780]   That's where my friends are.
[01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:28.540]   All of them that we just described have automatic uploading on iOS and Android.
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:32.140]   So that's -- and the prices do vary.
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:37.260]   Yeah, I worry about this a lot though, because now that I'm taking pictures of my kid, and
[01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:40.340]   she's changing so much and -- you do want to save these, yeah.
[01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:43.340]   -- I'm going to get to kick myself for losing her newborn photos.
[01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:45.140]   This is a great article.
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:46.140]   Yeah.
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:49.500]   And I'll thank you, Casey, for doing this, because this is the most important one, price
[01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:50.500]   comparison.
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:58.220]   So you can see -- so if you -- but if you downloaded it to a physical drive, Gina, you
[01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:02.380]   still have a compatibility -- I just got a question from an old friend of mine today
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:06.780]   for the early days of Epicurious, and she's trying to get stuff off the old 20-year-old
[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:07.780]   zip drives.
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:08.780]   Oh, man.
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:09.780]   That was a mistake.
[01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:10.780]   I like it.
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:17.100]   I've accepted that it being uploaded to Google, it has a better chance of lasting 20 years
[01:41:17.100 --> 01:41:20.540]   than if I have it on the sort of external hard drive here.
[01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:21.540]   Of course it does.
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:22.540]   I've accepted that.
[01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:24.900]   There was a long time when I was gluing myself into thinking that I needed to just keep stacks
[01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:25.900]   of hard drives in my home.
[01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:26.900]   No.
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:27.900]   That's insane.
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:28.900]   Terrible one, right.
[01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:31.460]   By the way, how would you get stuff off an old zip drive?
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:33.700]   You have to find somebody with a zip drive.
[01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:38.340]   Well, yeah, you need a zip drive or -- and fortunately, zip drives, the interfaces on
[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:40.060]   zip drives are parallel, right?
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:42.100]   Maybe they had some USB ones, I don't know.
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:43.100]   And I love zip drives.
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:44.100]   Oh, but you're right.
[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:46.900]   You're going to go to a -- she's going to go to a data service.
[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:52.900]   There are services, there are lots of them that keep all of this stuff so that they can
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:54.620]   -- and it won't be cheap.
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:57.500]   No, it won't be.
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:03.680]   So if you put it on a proprietary medium, it's then your duty to constantly check to
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:06.180]   make sure that everything still works.
[01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:07.740]   That's why the cloud is really the solution.
[01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:11.100]   The cloud eliminates this issue.
[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:12.100]   So much so.
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:14.180]   So apparently there are USB zip drives.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:15.540]   That's good news.
[01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:17.540]   If it's still working.
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:18.540]   [laughter]
[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:19.540]   Jesus.
[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:20.540]   [laughter]
[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:21.540]   It could be worse.
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:23.940]   Yeah, I say shit to launch a store, photo storage service.
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:33.020]   I feel like they -- Oculus Rift will ship in early 2016, according to the Guardian early
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:36.260]   next year.
[01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:38.580]   That's Facebook bottom.
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:41.740]   We had the developer edition because I did the Kickstarter.
[01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:43.140]   Chris has that right now.
[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:44.300]   You're still doing stuff with that, Chris?
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:46.660]   You're still developing virtual reality game?
[01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:49.580]   You just play with it.
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:51.540]   You just play with it.
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:53.340]   And gotten sick a lot.
[01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:54.340]   That's encouraging.
[01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:55.340]   That's by the --
[01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:56.340]   Just about every week.
[01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:58.660]   I'll go put it on for 15 minutes or something.
[01:42:58.660 --> 01:42:59.660]   And vomit.
[01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:00.660]   And vomit.
[01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:01.660]   Yes.
[01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:02.660]   That's why I gave it to you.
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:03.660]   [laughter]
[01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:06.820]   That's exactly why I gave it to you.
[01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:09.780]   Actually this is not more than just an article in the Guardian.
[01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:11.460]   This is a tweet from Nate Mitchell.
[01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:15.540]   "Extremely excited to announce that the Oculus Rift will be shipping Q1 2016.
[01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:17.420]   We can't wait to get it in your hands.
[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:23.220]   No price has been confirmed."
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:29.540]   I like augmented reality, but quite a bit of disappointment over Microsoft's demonstration
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:30.820]   of the HoloLens.
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:33.540]   It's AR visor slated for release.
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:34.540]   They do this year.
[01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:36.460]   They showed it at Build last week.
[01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:40.780]   And Paul Theratmario Foley used it and said it's different from the one they showed in
[01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:43.380]   Seattle a few months ago.
[01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:47.220]   The field of view is narrowed to just this little slit.
[01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:49.780]   That's not good.
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:52.500]   What do you think of this, guys?
[01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:53.500]   #talkpay.
[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:56.180]   Ah, yes.
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:44:05.860]   So traditionally in business, you're told that it's rude to talk amongst your fellow
[01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:08.780]   employees about what you make.
[01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:09.780]   But in fact --
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:10.780]   Is it rude?
[01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:11.780]   Is it about rudeness?
[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:12.780]   Or is it about --
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:13.780]   What was it about?
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:14.780]   Well, you're kind of inviting drama.
[01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:15.780]   There's potential drama, right?
[01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:16.780]   There's lots of potential drama.
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:17.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:21.540]   But it's also, from an economic point of view, this smart thing, the sensible thing to do,
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:25.060]   because then you know if you're getting underpaid.
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:26.060]   Yeah.
[01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:28.780]   So I think this happened on, I think it was Friday.
[01:44:28.780 --> 01:44:29.860]   I was actually at a conference.
[01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:33.780]   I was at seven on seven on Friday, and I was kind of heads down with my -- doing my thing
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:34.780]   there.
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:37.660]   So I missed the whole hashtag, which I couldn't believe it.
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:39.940]   I thought it was a fantastic idea.
[01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:45.100]   I mean, in terms of equal pay, you know, it's really important.
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:48.700]   I mean, being transparent about what people make, it helps people who are just getting
[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:49.700]   into the industry.
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:53.300]   It helps, you know, people figure out, am I getting paid fairly?
[01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:54.780]   Did I screw up my negotiation?
[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:57.140]   I mean, this is, you know, which a lot of people do.
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:01.620]   I mean, from an employer's standpoint of view, it's scary.
[01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:05.180]   But I think it's one of these, you know, public parts things, where it's like the more transparent
[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:07.540]   we are about this, the better it is for everybody.
[01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:10.380]   I wear two hats on this because as an employer --
[01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:11.380]   It's scary.
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:18.220]   Well, it's not so -- truthfully, it's not so much that I worry about people negotiating
[01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:22.300]   a different amount, because I hate it when people say, "Well, this guy," and people sometimes
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:23.300]   do.
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:24.300]   This guy makes more than me.
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:25.300]   I should make more.
[01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:29.260]   Because I pay each person what I consider to have a fair amount given our needs, their
[01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:31.020]   abilities, that kind of thing.
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:36.540]   I'm never trying to negotiate somebody down just for saving money.
[01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:38.740]   We try to pay them a fair amount of money.
[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:44.660]   But it often comes up, you know, and it is a source of strife.
[01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:47.540]   People will hate other people because they're getting more money.
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:50.460]   Yeah, they feel resentful and they're being valued more.
[01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:52.340]   You're closer to this person.
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:54.180]   Yeah, you think more highly of them.
[01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:55.620]   It gets very personal.
[01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:56.620]   It's very vulnerable.
[01:45:56.620 --> 01:46:00.300]   So a lot of people in that talk pay hashtag saying, like, "I'm scared.
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:01.300]   I can't do this.
[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:02.300]   I don't know what's keeping this."
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:04.180]   Well, doing it anonymously would be good.
[01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:05.180]   Yeah.
[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:07.900]   You know, having an -- maybe -- how does the talk pay account work?
[01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:10.540]   How do you get the -- no, no, it's just a hashtag, so it's your account.
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:11.540]   There's also an account.
[01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:12.540]   Oh, she's not a -- Oh.
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:13.540]   It is an in the last.
[01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:16.340]   It was a bot, and I feel like it was maybe it accepted DMs.
[01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:17.540]   Oh, that would be good.
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:19.180]   I'm not sure how the bot worked.
[01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:20.180]   It's anonymous.
[01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:23.860]   DMs were -- or watched the hashtag and then retweeted them.
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:25.420]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:26.660]   But the bot, yeah, I thought the bot was great.
[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:29.580]   I mean, it was fascinating looking through the tweets and --
[01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:30.580]   Did you learn anything?
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:31.580]   -- different careers.
[01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:37.420]   I mean, I think -- I mean, yeah, I mean, there were definitely salaries I thought I was surprised
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:38.740]   that seemed lower than I thought.
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:39.980]   There were salaries I thought were higher.
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:42.620]   I mean, you know, they just -- it just runs the -- right.
[01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:44.060]   -- you know, it runs the continuum.
[01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:48.060]   And it really so much has to do with, like, time and place and situation and, you know,
[01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:50.740]   negotiation and confidence and, you know, all those things.
[01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:51.740]   All was the company.
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:54.660]   You remember, G, what was the company about two weeks ago that announced that they wouldn't
[01:46:54.660 --> 01:47:01.540]   negotiate with employees because it was a matter of gender inequality and pay?
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:03.180]   -- Well, right.
[01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:05.380]   I mean, this is -- this is one of the things about gender.
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:09.420]   The wage gap between genders is that, you know, men are -- or sort of socialize, you
[01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:10.420]   know, this is the general theory.
[01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:15.020]   Men are socialized to be more confident to negotiate more aggressively and women negotiate
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:16.020]   less aggressive.
[01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:17.260]   They're willing to just say, "Hey, great.
[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:20.420]   You know, like, I'll take whatever you offer me, whereas, you know, employers lowballing."
[01:47:20.420 --> 01:47:21.420]   Right?
[01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:22.700]   So I don't know -- I haven't heard this.
[01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:27.220]   I know Buffer, which is a company that does, like, social media stuff, they actually publish
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:31.980]   their entire company from CEO all the way down of everybody's salary and their formula
[01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:34.660]   for figuring out that salary.
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:37.700]   And so they've been super transparent about salaries.
[01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:40.700]   So names and amount people were using, which I thought was really interesting.
[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:41.700]   -- Oh, I know.
[01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:42.700]   It was Reddit.
[01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:43.700]   It was Reddit.
[01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:44.700]   It was a subreddit.
[01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:45.700]   -- It was a subreddit.
[01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:46.700]   -- Yeah.
[01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:49.700]   -- All the more important given who the CEO Reddit -- or who the -- yeah, CEO is still.
[01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:50.700]   -- Ellen Powell.
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:51.700]   Yeah.
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:54.700]   -- Is still an interim CEO.
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:48:01.700]   It said, "No longer negotiate salary on a crystal talent."
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:03.700]   -- Yes and no.
[01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:05.700]   I'm a public employee.
[01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:07.700]   So your income is public.
[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:09.700]   -- Public is going to be.
[01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:12.260]   In fact, somebody pointed out in the Army, it's public.
[01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:13.260]   You know what pay grade you are?
[01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:14.700]   You know exactly what you get.
[01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:15.700]   -- Yeah.
[01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:16.700]   -- That seems great.
[01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:17.700]   -- And --
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:18.700]   -- Yeah.
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:21.700]   But the problem with this is then there's a different issue now.
[01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:22.700]   We'll get in all kinds of trouble.
[01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:23.700]   And I am a liberal.
[01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:25.700]   I'm a Hillary Clinton liberal before I say what I'm about to say.
[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:26.700]   Please keep that in mind.
[01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:28.700]   -- Please keep that in mind.
[01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:29.700]   -- Please keep that in mind.
[01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:30.700]   -- What is a Hillary Clinton liberal?
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:32.700]   Because that doesn't sound liberal at all to me.
[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:33.700]   -- Oh, oh, oh.
[01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:35.700]   Let's keep going, Jeff.
[01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:36.700]   Just keep it up.
[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:37.700]   -- Believe me.
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:40.700]   I'm a liberal for the last -- somebody for the last eight years tends to say I told you so.
[01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:41.700]   But that's another question.
[01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:42.700]   -- Yeah.
[01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:43.700]   -- Though he's gotten better.
[01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:44.700]   He's gotten a lot better.
[01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:47.700]   -- Where was it?
[01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:51.700]   Oh, so I'm not a happy union guy.
[01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:55.700]   Because the union basically puts a ceiling on what I could negotiate.
[01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:56.700]   Myself, my own value.
[01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:57.700]   -- Isn't that funny?
[01:48:57.700 --> 01:49:04.700]   -- But it does that, Jeff, I should point out, to provide an equitable playing field for everybody.
[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:08.700]   -- I've been in a horrible union in my limited career.
[01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:13.700]   I mean, the newspaper guild was just always awful.
[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:21.700]   And so I'm not -- yes, they exist in some places for good value.
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:22.700]   I don't question that.
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:23.700]   I'll salute that flag.
[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:26.700]   But I rather resent having to pay my dues.
[01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:28.700]   And I don't get anything for it.
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:30.700]   And I'd rather be on my own.
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:33.700]   But I can't.
[01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:35.700]   This is going to be a flame in certain corners.
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:41.700]   -- As a public employee, I mean, state employee, you know, have it going into a career, say, in the military,
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.700]   where everybody's salary is transparent.
[01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:45.700]   And you know that going in.
[01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:49.700]   And there's just an expectation, it's just a matter of what level or what title that you get.
[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:54.700]   -- Just getting alert from the New York Times, Hillary Clinton to court donors for a super pack.
[01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:58.700]   -- Oh, look at that.
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:01.700]   I love smart watches.
[01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:03.700]   [laughter]
[01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:04.700]   That's nice.
[01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:05.700]   Anyway, I'm sorry.
[01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:06.700]   I didn't mean it ever works.
[01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:07.700]   You're sorry, Judy.
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:11.700]   But to be in a job, be in a private job where people aren't necessarily talking about their pay,
[01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:17.700]   and maybe being the only person on your team who reveals your pay or being concerned that you're overpaid or underpaid.
[01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:23.700]   You know, like I saw one woman say, "I'm only going to reveal my pay and talk pay if one of my male colleagues does it first."
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:27.700]   You know, if we kind of do it together, that was interesting to see that dynamic.
[01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:29.700]   -- See, I don't want the opportunity to negotiate.
[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:32.700]   -- What this structure does here is it takes away my opportunity to negotiate.
[01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:35.700]   And obviously, I make a lot less money than I used to make.
[01:50:35.700 --> 01:50:39.700]   I do this because I have a mission now, and I'm giving back and that kind of stuff.
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:42.700]   And I get benefits, and I get other benefits of plenty.
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:46.700]   So I knew what I was getting into, absolutely.
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:51.700]   But I don't like not being able to negotiate my own value.
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:52.700]   -- Yeah.
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:53.700]   -- Right.
[01:50:53.700 --> 01:50:54.700]   -- It's fascinating, isn't it?
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:57.700]   I mean, I brought this up knowing it was challenging.
[01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:02.700]   Fascinating.
[01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:05.700]   And this is transparency in action.
[01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:08.700]   You can't really keep a lid on information anymore because of the internet.
[01:51:08.700 --> 01:51:09.700]   -- Yeah.
[01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:14.700]   -- And you can't keep a lid on a pay-per-view boxing match either, apparently.
[01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:16.700]   -- Oh, isn't this great?
[01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:18.700]   -- You know, all right, well, okay.
[01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:26.700]   So people apparently were using Periscope and Meerkat to stream the $90 pay-per-view Mayweather Pecayo.
[01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:28.700]   How do you pronounce his last name? Pecayo?
[01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:31.700]   -- That shows how little I know. Pecayo, Pecayo.
[01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:33.700]   Pecayo, Pecayo, Pecayo.
[01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:39.700]   And I actually just-- because I wasn't going to pay 90 bucks for it because I don't like to watch people hit each other for $180 million.
[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:46.700]   But I did just check to see, and I could watch the fight on a number of streams on both Meerkat and Periscope.
[01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:55.700]   But really, is that-- I mean, is that taking money out of Comcast's pocket really, or HBO's pocket, or time over?
[01:51:55.700 --> 01:52:03.700]   No, because if you want to watch the fight with buddies, you're not going to say, "Oh, come on, let's all sit around the phone and watch it."
[01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:05.700]   You go to a bar that's airing the fight.
[01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:07.700]   You go to a bar that's stealing it. No.
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:11.700]   Or you pay 90 bucks, and you invite friends over, and they throw money in the hat.
[01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:14.700]   This isn't-- this is not taking money at anybody's pocket.
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:18.700]   I don't think. And yet, everybody's all--
[01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:24.700]   -- They'll stay on a matter of principle. They have to fight it because any violation of their copyright, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:27.700]   That's BS. Yeah.
[01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:30.700]   It's silly. Yeah?
[01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:34.700]   Yeah, I mean, there's live blogs. I mean, there's so many ways to keep on top of--
[01:52:34.700 --> 01:52:36.700]   This is another example, yeah.
[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:40.700]   Mm-hmm. But, yeah, I wouldn't want to give that guy money, so I would have just watched the stream.
[01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:42.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:44.700]   I don't watch fights.
[01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:48.700]   Yeah, I'm not-- BB, not a real man. I don't watch fights.
[01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:55.700]   According to the Wall Street Journal, YouTube considered building something like "Myrcat" or "Parascope."
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:58.700]   This is-- they did well should have.
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:00.700]   This is so interesting.
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:01.700]   Kicking themselves.
[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:02.700]   Mm-hmm.
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:03.700]   But they did--
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:04.700]   You said that.
[01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:08.700]   --because they were tied up dealing with lawsuits, potential lawsuits.
[01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:14.700]   YouTube was engaged in a legal vam battle with Viacom at the time over the use of Honor Authorized Copyrighted Material.
[01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:19.700]   I mean, this is a thing, like, YouTube really paved the way for a lot of this, and they were--
[01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:20.700]   They were--
[01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:24.700]   I mean, it's hard to believe that Google didn't have the resources to build something like this
[01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:25.700]   because they were fighting.
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:26.700]   No.
[01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:28.700]   But this is an interesting take.
[01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:35.700]   It makes more sense, though, that they were foreseeing a day when Mayweather and Pacayano would be fighting,
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:38.700]   and that they would have that massive piracy problem.
[01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:42.700]   And I think given that they were fighting with Viacom, they thought,
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:45.700]   "We're not going to give one more way to pirate stuff."
[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:50.700]   Because you can't do content idea on live streams, right?
[01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:53.700]   Well, I mean, it's live and it's over.
[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:55.700]   Right.
[01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:56.700]   So--
[01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:57.700]   Right.
[01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:04.700]   --YouTube claimed it qualified for protection from liability because it removed clip from its site per the DMCA.
[01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:05.700]   Right.
[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:12.700]   Parascope says it does the same thing, but it's meaningless because it's-- I mean, Parascope gives you 24 hours to watch it later,
[01:54:12.700 --> 01:54:13.700]   so I guess it's not meaningless.
[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:14.700]   Mircat can't.
[01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:15.700]   It doesn't.
[01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:20.700]   So they're just-- what are you going to do if you're a copyright holder against live streaming video?
[01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:25.700]   I was talking to-- so I brought this up with my students.
[01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:33.700]   And one of them said he watches a whole bunch of football matches from people who were in the stands.
[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:34.700]   Oh.
[01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:35.700]   I said, "Is there a decus?"
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:36.700]   It's a little tiny people.
[01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:39.700]   He said, "But be some of the commentary is great because the guy's taught--"
[01:54:39.700 --> 01:54:40.700]   Right.
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:41.700]   --you get your-- everybody's--
[01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:42.700]   It's a good show.
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:43.700]   --to his own show.
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:45.700]   --Al Michaels in the stands.
[01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:46.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:47.700]   They twitch.
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:48.700]   Yeah.
[01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:49.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:51.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:58.700]   One of Twitch took-- you know, were ABC sports, right?
[01:54:58.700 --> 01:54:59.700]   Or ESPN?
[01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:00.700]   Well, they're playing real games.
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:01.700]   Now, the quality is awful.
[01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:03.700]   With a ball.
[01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:04.700]   Yeah.
[01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:05.700]   Same thing.
[01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:06.700]   Yeah.
[01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:12.700]   Ustream, which has the same issue in this same article in the Wall Street Journal's Brad Huntsville, their CEO, says,
[01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:16.700]   "We can delete pirative material within 10 seconds of the broadcast beginning.
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:22.700]   We have fingerprinting technology that'll do that."
[01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:28.700]   Last month, HBO sent takedown notices to Periscope after users broadcast Game of Thrones.
[01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:31.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:35.700]   And HBO says, "We want app developers to have tools in place to prevent this."
[01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:38.700]   It seems like that would be a business opportunity for somebody.
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:41.700]   Well, there's a business opportunity right there for HBO and ESPN in a company.
[01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:48.700]   Imagine if you could share a broadcast that you do have the rights to with a friend, with your own commentary.
[01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:50.700]   It becomes marketing.
[01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:51.700]   Yeah.
[01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:53.700]   This is the shared economy.
[01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:54.700]   You set the rules.
[01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:57.700]   People will do it within the rules.
[01:55:57.700 --> 01:56:01.700]   We need some overarching thing.
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:04.700]   Because really, this stuff is going to happen.
[01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:05.700]   It's just going to happen.
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:06.700]   Yep.
[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:08.700]   So you've got to find business models that take advantage of.
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:09.700]   That's it.
[01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:14.700]   This goes back to what you said about putting your content in the Facebook.
[01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:16.700]   It's going to become inevitable.
[01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:19.700]   So how do you negotiate a mutually beneficial arrangement for that?
[01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:24.700]   And if your users want to do this and they'll market you and they'll add value to it,
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:28.700]   if you're smart, you're going to find a way to make that work.
[01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:29.700]   Right.
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:32.700]   HBO now, HBO, Breaking Away from the cable companies.
[01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:33.700]   Right.
[01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:34.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:56:34.700 --> 01:56:39.700]   Every part of me for this man for himself.
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:42.700]   Are you a court cutter, Gina?
[01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:43.700]   No, we have cable.
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:45.700]   We just didn't pay for the extra.
[01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:46.700]   But we did.
[01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:47.700]   But we got HBO now.
[01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:48.700]   I can't.
[01:56:48.700 --> 01:56:53.700]   My better half enjoys live sports too much and just doesn't want to deal with the hassle of.
[01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:54.700]   That's right.
[01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:55.700]   It was up to me.
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:59.460]   I would be completely just dreaming.
[01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:02.620]   Would you ever cut off Leo?
[01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:08.740]   Fortunately, I can afford to have the top cable tier.
[01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:12.660]   So there's never a lack of television.
[01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:15.940]   I don't watch much live.
[01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:17.340]   And I record some.
[01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:20.780]   But I'm now with all this traveling.
[01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:21.780]   I'm doing.
[01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:25.780]   I download the download and download on my Nexus 7 on planes.
[01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:27.780]   And that's how I'm watching the whole series.
[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:29.140]   That's what I'm addicted to.
[01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:34.500]   I will go through the weeks at a time of Turner Classic movies.
[01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:38.380]   Because it's ad-free and DVR like old movies.
[01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:41.180]   In case I ever want to watch them.
[01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:42.420]   Just kind of having them there.
[01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:45.420]   And sometimes these old movies are not really available in other forms.
[01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:52.300]   Old friend of mine, Peter Travers, who's the movie critic at Rolling Stone.
[01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:58.340]   When I worked with the People magazine many, many years ago and VHS tapes had just emerged.
[01:57:58.340 --> 01:58:00.860]   This is how old we are, Gina.
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:04.140]   Peter prided himself on having every movie ever made.
[01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:06.020]   He would constantly get new movies.
[01:58:06.020 --> 01:58:09.540]   And so, you know, the poor guy, I made it to ask him.
[01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:10.540]   What's the use?
[01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:11.540]   Whatever happens?
[01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:13.740]   His wife hated it, filled up the entire face.
[01:58:13.740 --> 01:58:15.460]   Really, it's a hoarder mentality.
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:16.620]   Because you can't watch them.
[01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:17.620]   It was at the time.
[01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:19.140]   He was a movie critic.
[01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:21.180]   He was a student of movies.
[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:22.660]   He always had it and he could go back.
[01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:25.780]   He wanted the ability to just at any moment go to his life.
[01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:28.700]   Yes, and go find a scene and know from it, which is fine.
[01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:31.260]   But become digital.
[01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:32.620]   All that work to nothing.
[01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:33.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:33.620 --> 01:58:38.020]   I had a friend who taped every VHS taped every episode of Cheers.
[01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:40.940]   Because he didn't want to live life, a life in which he couldn't at any time.
[01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:43.700]   I'm sorry that it was the best show ever made.
[01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:44.700]   Oh, wow.
[01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:45.700]   It's day.
[01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:46.700]   It's day.
[01:58:46.700 --> 01:58:47.700]   Yeah, it was a good show.
[01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:48.980]   It was a good show.
[01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:50.180]   So he loved it so much.
[01:58:50.180 --> 01:58:52.780]   He had it, but a closet full of Cheers tapes.
[01:58:52.780 --> 01:58:56.820]   Well, and I have the worst is like the zip drive thing earlier.
[01:58:56.820 --> 01:59:00.020]   Thank you so much for giving me an answer, which I've sent to my friend.
[01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:01.020]   Oh, good.
[01:59:01.020 --> 01:59:02.020]   Oh, good.
[01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:03.820]   You can still buy a USB zip drive so you can still do it.
[01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:09.820]   Anyway, so yeah, I've got a huge box in the basement of me on tape.
[01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:13.660]   All my appearances on, you know, CBS News overnight with Charlie.
[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:15.900]   Rose talking about some sort.
[01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:18.300]   I got all that because it's just so special.
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:20.220]   You're on TV.
[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:21.460]   So I'm going to throw it out.
[01:59:21.460 --> 01:59:24.300]   I don't, you know, I mean, the moonlight.
[01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:32.660]   My moonlight is the best one, but you know, some interview on WXYZ.
[01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:34.060]   I don't know why I still have that.
[01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:35.060]   That's a huge deal.
[01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:37.100]   Even being on TV now was a big deal.
[01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:40.380]   It's less of a big deal now because it's like what's TV, but that's awesome.
[01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:43.540]   My dad taped everything on TV because it was an amazing thing in the VCR.
[01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:44.540]   Right.
[01:59:44.540 --> 01:59:47.260]   It was like, hold on to this thing and rewatch it.
[01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:52.620]   Although I have to tell you, the idea of a movie critic rewinding and fast-folding of
[01:59:52.620 --> 01:59:54.700]   VCR tape to find a scene.
[01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:55.700]   I find hilarious.
[01:59:55.700 --> 01:59:56.700]   He's a huge certificate.
[01:59:56.700 --> 01:59:59.500]   Let me just go off and show you something and say, hold on.
[01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:04.460]   I think it bothers me and it really does bother me is how much we should have access
[02:00:04.460 --> 02:00:06.100]   to everything now, right?
[02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:07.900]   How much stuff is not online?
[02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:08.900]   I'm not.
[02:00:08.900 --> 02:00:11.300]   I can't get even if you for love or money.
[02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:13.180]   It's not like it's not just not on Netflix.
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:14.180]   It's not anywhere.
[02:00:14.180 --> 02:00:15.180]   You can't buy it.
[02:00:15.180 --> 02:00:19.540]   This is the first issue of entertainment weekly.
[02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:20.540]   Wow.
[02:00:20.540 --> 02:00:22.380]   Is that Katie Lang on the cover there?
[02:00:22.380 --> 02:00:23.380]   That's Katie Lang.
[02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:24.380]   Yeah.
[02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:26.380]   Because they were sure they're nice.
[02:00:26.380 --> 02:00:28.660]   Yeah, I did Katie, but first issue.
[02:00:28.660 --> 02:00:32.700]   They didn't tell me they bought a retail position in all kinds of supermarkets.
[02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:35.500]   So this was not exactly a newsstand in the hit.
[02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:38.820]   So anyway, so the back of the magazine.
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:40.500]   I respect you for that, Jeff.
[02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:41.500]   That's awesome.
[02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:47.540]   Well, yeah, I invented this silly little thing.
[02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:48.980]   What happened to it?
[02:00:48.980 --> 02:00:50.780]   That's weird.
[02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:52.100]   It changed.
[02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:55.300]   We were looking for Indiana Jones, I think.
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:57.540]   So I had these hard cards.
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:01:00.540]   I remember those, right?
[02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:01.540]   And you can tear them out.
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:04.460]   Now, the original idea in the original prototype, sorry.
[02:01:04.460 --> 02:01:06.820]   I'm just going back to the prototype here.
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:08.780]   This is the prototype of E.W.
[02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:13.420]   This is an early cover of E.W.
[02:01:13.420 --> 02:01:14.420]   Nice.
[02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:18.500]   So the original idea back in the back was the hard card.
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:19.940]   It was a perforated hard card.
[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:23.300]   And you see those things with the blue all here?
[02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:24.300]   Yeah.
[02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:26.660]   Those were the size of video tape.
[02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:27.660]   VHS tapelet.
[02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:28.660]   VHS.
[02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:32.660]   So you could, you know, watch Glory, Glory, your passion and paradise.
[02:01:32.660 --> 02:01:33.740]   You're insane.
[02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:36.700]   And check it off and you could you could glue those onto your VHS tapes.
[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:37.700]   Yeah, I have a tape here.
[02:01:37.700 --> 02:01:38.700]   We'll put that.
[02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:39.700]   That's for geeky.
[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:40.700]   Wow.
[02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:41.700]   That's great.
[02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:42.700]   That's great.
[02:01:42.700 --> 02:01:44.700]   I know I would have totally bought that just for those.
[02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:45.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:46.700]   That is really clever.
[02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:47.700]   I don't want to stick these onto my tapes.
[02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:48.700]   Isn't that the way?
[02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:49.980]   While I'm doing this.
[02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:54.620]   So this was one of the covers that we did for prototype only.
[02:01:54.620 --> 02:01:56.660]   Rosanne Barr.
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:01:59.660]   And my favorite, Candace Bergen.
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:00.660]   Kiss Cosby goodbye.
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:01.660]   Kiss Cosby goodbye.
[02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:03.900]   Kiss Cosby show is going off.
[02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:05.460]   His kinder, gentler days are passed.
[02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:06.460]   Sweetest out.
[02:02:06.460 --> 02:02:07.460]   Sasses in.
[02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:10.020]   These brash and brainy women of TV.
[02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:14.180]   Well Cosby, I'm now proud to say I can also go over there and get my kiss.
[02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:15.180]   He did.
[02:02:15.180 --> 02:02:16.180]   Oh yeah.
[02:02:16.180 --> 02:02:17.180]   He managed this.
[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:19.700]   This only went out as junk mail and test.
[02:02:19.700 --> 02:02:21.100]   He managed to get a copy of it.
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:23.140]   He managed this is long before Quark.
[02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:26.900]   He managed to get someone to remake it and have it say kiss Jarvis.
[02:02:26.900 --> 02:02:27.900]   Kiss Jarvis.
[02:02:27.900 --> 02:02:28.900]   Goodbye.
[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:29.900]   Oh, that's an honor.
[02:02:29.900 --> 02:02:31.380]   But I left EW.
[02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:32.380]   That is an honor.
[02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:33.380]   I have.
[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:34.380]   What I'm doing this.
[02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:35.380]   Hold on.
[02:02:35.380 --> 02:02:36.380]   Wow.
[02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:38.780]   That's made an enemy for life.
[02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:39.940]   That's fantastic.
[02:02:39.940 --> 02:02:41.140]   That is quite the honor.
[02:02:41.140 --> 02:02:42.620]   And by the way, Jeff was right, right?
[02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:46.980]   That kind of sweet, sugary, feel-good show was dying by the 90s.
[02:02:46.980 --> 02:02:49.900]   It is also nice now to have hate.
[02:02:49.900 --> 02:02:52.900]   I said, no, I'm a special owner to have a hate mail from Bill Cosby.
[02:02:52.900 --> 02:02:53.900]   Yeah, no kidding.
[02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:54.900]   Yeah.
[02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:56.300]   So I have this framed.
[02:02:56.300 --> 02:02:57.300]   That's hate mail.
[02:02:57.300 --> 02:02:58.300]   What does it say?
[02:02:58.300 --> 02:03:01.140]   Well, it just says he sent me a tin cup to mix better for here.
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:02.700]   This is after I was saying he was downhill.
[02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:03.940]   This is in Jesus.
[02:03:03.940 --> 02:03:10.980]   He just said, where are the flowers for my funeral?
[02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:14.660]   And he gave you a tin cup because you're blind?
[02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:16.820]   Oh, because it was to beg because he was to beg.
[02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:20.300]   He mixed the metaphor, but he would beg because Bill Cosby was so poor.
[02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:21.300]   It's been that.
[02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:24.860]   At least it sounds like you kind of had a sense of humor.
[02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:26.740]   But yeah, I said this with the cover.
[02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:28.100]   He said, I found you, you little devil.
[02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:29.340]   I was wondering where you were.
[02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:32.140]   Oh, he was gushing around with you.
[02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:33.140]   Yeah, he was.
[02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:35.140]   He was really a testament to your power.
[02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:37.540]   No, it was testament to his ego.
[02:03:37.540 --> 02:03:38.540]   Yeah.
[02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:42.540]   Nobody criticized you because now now it's an honor.
[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:45.020]   Now people say, oh, because we didn't like you.
[02:03:45.020 --> 02:03:46.020]   That's good.
[02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:47.020]   Before it was kind of shocking.
[02:03:47.020 --> 02:03:48.260]   Like the world's nicest guy.
[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:49.260]   I didn't like you.
[02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:50.260]   You schmuck.
[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:51.420]   You must be a terrible human.
[02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:52.420]   Must be.
[02:03:52.420 --> 02:03:54.020]   While I'm on my ego parade.
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:55.180]   Well, I don't know one last thing.
[02:03:55.180 --> 02:03:58.420]   So Murphy Brown, I like Murphy Brown too, but I too.
[02:03:58.420 --> 02:03:59.980]   I should show.
[02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:06.660]   And then there's an episode in the show where they make up a credit character and they say
[02:04:06.660 --> 02:04:09.100]   Jeff Jarvis, the producer guy, the network guy.
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:10.100]   Yeah.
[02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:14.100]   He said, Jeff, Jeff Jarvis, he's a bottomless pit of hate.
[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:15.100]   Wow.
[02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:16.100]   Wow.
[02:04:16.100 --> 02:04:19.980]   That's sitting at home on the couch for the night.
[02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:20.980]   Wow.
[02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:22.820]   You're watching it live and suddenly you hear that.
[02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:24.780]   So that's my ego parade for the night.
[02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:26.940]   We can make a new feature here with the theme song.
[02:04:26.940 --> 02:04:29.860]   Jeff's ego parade.
[02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:35.620]   I've been to people's houses where they have ego walls and they're stuffed with rewards
[02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:37.580]   and stuff like that.
[02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:38.940]   I don't have any awards.
[02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:39.940]   You most have awards.
[02:04:39.940 --> 02:04:41.180]   You have to have Amisely, all right.
[02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:43.580]   Yeah, but I don't have an ego wall.
[02:04:43.580 --> 02:04:45.620]   I guess in a way I do in my office, but it's not.
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:47.860]   It's more than that is stuff.
[02:04:47.860 --> 02:04:48.860]   Junk junk.
[02:04:48.860 --> 02:04:51.300]   That's the story.
[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:54.020]   It's Murphy Brown, bottomless pit of hate.
[02:04:54.020 --> 02:04:55.020]   You were you were troll.
[02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:56.020]   You trolled them.
[02:04:56.020 --> 02:04:57.020]   They were trolling you back.
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:04:58.020]   You told Murphy Brown.
[02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:04.140]   You told me you had to have TV shows to do it.
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:05.140]   Everyone can do it.
[02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:06.140]   Somewhere in my basement.
[02:05:06.140 --> 02:05:08.980]   Somewhere in my basement is a VHS tape.
[02:05:08.980 --> 02:05:10.340]   You have that tape.
[02:05:10.340 --> 02:05:17.700]   Which I can't watch because I actually do have one last VHS equipped tube TV.
[02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:18.700]   Wow.
[02:05:18.700 --> 02:05:20.900]   Do you read any TV critics now?
[02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:21.900]   Jeff at all.
[02:05:21.900 --> 02:05:27.260]   Do you read a Steppenwall or do you you're out of the business and like to watch it for
[02:05:27.260 --> 02:05:29.020]   all opinions?
[02:05:29.020 --> 02:05:31.540]   It must be nice just to watch a TV show.
[02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:35.020]   Taking notes and make you forming an opinion.
[02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:39.140]   My single worst week was when I had to watch AD Dimini series.
[02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:41.100]   Oh, I remember that.
[02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:42.100]   And I had a policy.
[02:05:42.100 --> 02:05:43.580]   I didn't fast forward.
[02:05:43.580 --> 02:05:45.620]   When I watched it, I watched it.
[02:05:45.620 --> 02:05:49.700]   Sometimes I wish I were a TV critic or I had a bully pulpit because then sometimes the
[02:05:49.700 --> 02:05:52.140]   watch is showing this just like mad men.
[02:05:52.140 --> 02:05:54.020]   Okay, there's there's an actor on mad men.
[02:05:54.020 --> 02:05:56.340]   He plays the kid who went off to Vietnam.
[02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:57.580]   So it can't act.
[02:05:57.580 --> 02:06:01.060]   I mean, he's like he really just can't act.
[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:03.380]   And he's the writer's son.
[02:06:03.380 --> 02:06:04.380]   You're kidding.
[02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:05.740]   He's Matthew Winers son.
[02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:06.740]   Yeah.
[02:06:06.740 --> 02:06:11.100]   Oh, and that explains it because he's horrible and it ruins the show for me.
[02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:12.100]   Oh, man.
[02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:13.100]   It's he's horrible.
[02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:14.100]   It's true.
[02:06:14.100 --> 02:06:16.980]   Anytime he came on, I had a hard time cutting seriously.
[02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:17.980]   He's flat.
[02:06:17.980 --> 02:06:18.980]   Oh, now I understand it.
[02:06:18.980 --> 02:06:19.980]   I thought a whole lot of sense.
[02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:20.980]   That makes a whole lot of sense.
[02:06:20.980 --> 02:06:23.780]   I felt bad because I thought, oh, they were stuck with him when he was a child actor.
[02:06:23.780 --> 02:06:24.780]   They didn't matter so much.
[02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:25.780]   They didn't know.
[02:06:25.780 --> 02:06:28.580]   They grew up and now he's an adult and they still have to use him because he's the adult
[02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:30.340]   version of the child actor.
[02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:33.020]   Frankly, frankly, the daughter ain't that great either.
[02:06:33.020 --> 02:06:35.220]   But at least she's you know, she's got something going on.
[02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:37.300]   He's like, he's like wooden.
[02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:39.060]   He was better this season.
[02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:40.060]   Matthew Winers son.
[02:06:40.060 --> 02:06:41.220]   Let's not say it a whole lot.
[02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:42.220]   Yeah.
[02:06:42.220 --> 02:06:43.220]   Yeah.
[02:06:43.220 --> 02:06:44.220]   Yeah.
[02:06:44.220 --> 02:06:45.220]   I'm watching poor January Jones try to act with him.
[02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:47.500]   Well, you know, she I saw this interview with her.
[02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:50.300]   She's like, you know, I've known this kid since he was six years old.
[02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:51.740]   He's Matthew's son.
[02:06:51.740 --> 02:06:54.220]   And I have to do this scene with him where we're like, we almost kiss.
[02:06:54.220 --> 02:06:55.220]   She's like it was the most uncomfortable.
[02:06:55.220 --> 02:06:57.980]   He was like, she he was uncomfortable because now he's a grown up.
[02:06:57.980 --> 02:06:58.980]   Right.
[02:06:58.980 --> 02:07:00.740]   And stands like what was going on between us.
[02:07:00.740 --> 02:07:04.500]   I'm uncomfortable because I've known him since he was a child and he's not bad.
[02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:05.500]   He's my boy.
[02:07:05.500 --> 02:07:07.580]   That that discomfort really came through the screen.
[02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:09.380]   It was perfect.
[02:07:09.380 --> 02:07:11.140]   It was that was such an uncomfortable scene.
[02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:13.180]   Oh, it was horrible.
[02:07:13.180 --> 02:07:14.180]   Yeah.
[02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:17.660]   I was I always found him a delightfully weird looking kid.
[02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:21.380]   Like I was like, oh, it's like this kid is great because he's just so weird.
[02:07:21.380 --> 02:07:22.380]   Yeah.
[02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:24.740]   And I guess bad, but also weird, but.
[02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:25.740]   It was fine as a kid.
[02:07:25.740 --> 02:07:27.260]   It didn't bother me, but it bothered me.
[02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:28.420]   It's as an adult.
[02:07:28.420 --> 02:07:29.420]   Yeah.
[02:07:29.420 --> 02:07:33.020]   So there's when you wish you had some bully pulpit, but I guess we do.
[02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:34.020]   Yeah, we do.
[02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:35.980]   This is exactly we do.
[02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:39.700]   We have this and you have Twitter and you have a little boy and you have a little teeny
[02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:43.620]   boy, bully, bully, because this could this possibly be true.
[02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:48.340]   Valvey in our chat room says there's an increasingly credible rumor that Don Draper will become
[02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:51.740]   DB Cooper in the last episode.
[02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:52.980]   I like that.
[02:07:52.980 --> 02:07:55.060]   I hope they do that.
[02:07:55.060 --> 02:07:56.460]   That would be great.
[02:07:56.460 --> 02:07:59.420]   When did when did DB Cooper jump out of the plane and disappear?
[02:07:59.420 --> 02:08:05.860]   Remember, he was the guy who hijacked a plane got a lot of money and just and then disappeared
[02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:08.500]   and no one knows what happened to him.
[02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:13.780]   1971 it could happen there in 1970 right now.
[02:08:13.780 --> 02:08:15.740]   That could happen.
[02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:18.460]   That sounds like a like a Dallas shower scene.
[02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:21.260]   It does, but I would like it.
[02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:24.180]   That seems like something that would happen with Don Draper.
[02:08:24.180 --> 02:08:25.180]   It's also me.
[02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:27.500]   It's like a look at the look at the drawing.
[02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:28.740]   Oh my God.
[02:08:28.740 --> 02:08:30.340]   He looks exactly like him.
[02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:31.340]   Wow.
[02:08:31.340 --> 02:08:37.460]   No, actually, actually what he's going to do is join the army in invade Texas.
[02:08:37.460 --> 02:08:38.460]   That's a funny story.
[02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:42.060]   It has nothing to do with this weekend Google, but that is a funny story.
[02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:43.060]   Wow.
[02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:44.060]   On earth.
[02:08:44.060 --> 02:08:45.700]   There's nothing about that stupid.
[02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:49.900]   Well, it's just sometimes you read these things and you just shake your head.
[02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:52.900]   I think we're done with all of the items.
[02:08:52.900 --> 02:08:57.900]   Anything in the rundown that you wanted to talk about that we didn't get to?
[02:08:57.900 --> 02:08:58.900]   Oh, I'll spare you.
[02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:04.900]   I'll spare you an Eurotechno panic rant about them going after American commerce companies
[02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:05.900]   now, but I'll spare you.
[02:09:05.900 --> 02:09:06.900]   Well, I saw that article.
[02:09:06.900 --> 02:09:10.900]   It sounded like they were going to create their own digital neighborhood.
[02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:13.900]   Yeah, they're only talking about that, but they're also they can't just do it on their
[02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:14.900]   own make their own damn business.
[02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:17.900]   They're they have to use it as an excuse to attack American companies.
[02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:24.900]   EU plans unveils plans to unite fragmented online markets, cracked down on possible abuses
[02:09:24.900 --> 02:09:27.900]   by US based companies.
[02:09:27.900 --> 02:09:29.900]   What does that even mean?
[02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:35.900]   Jean Claude Juncker says the European Union plans to unite the region's online markets.
[02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:40.900]   Do they not understand that the Internet is just kind of the bits?
[02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:41.900]   Right.
[02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:42.900]   Nope.
[02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:43.900]   Nope, they're not.
[02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:48.900]   They're just wow.
[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:50.900]   What?
[02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:51.900]   What?
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:52.900]   All right.
[02:09:52.900 --> 02:09:53.900]   You're up.
[02:09:53.900 --> 02:09:54.900]   You're up.
[02:09:54.900 --> 02:09:55.900]   You're up.
[02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:57.900]   You're bad.
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:09:59.900]   You're up.
[02:09:59.900 --> 02:10:00.900]   I'm not.
[02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:02.900]   No hugging.
[02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:04.900]   No teaching.
[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:06.900]   That was Larry David's mantra for Seinfeld.
[02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:12.900]   Because all the shows like the Cosby show hugging teaching lesson.
[02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:14.900]   Oh, no hugging.
[02:10:14.900 --> 02:10:15.900]   No teaching.
[02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:16.900]   I love that.
[02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:17.900]   Right?
[02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:18.900]   That's so Larry David too.
[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:19.900]   Isn't it?
[02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:20.900]   Yeah.
[02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:21.900]   It's very strange.
[02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:25.900]   It's very surreal to see him on the steps at the Met Gala.
[02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:27.900]   Just standing there.
[02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:28.900]   No date.
[02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:29.900]   Oh, I saw.
[02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:30.900]   He was wondering what he's doing.
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:31.900]   Yeah.
[02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:32.900]   Whose dress did you see?
[02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:33.900]   Rihanna's dress.
[02:10:33.900 --> 02:10:34.900]   That cape.
[02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:35.900]   Wow.
[02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:37.900]   And then the butt twins.
[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:39.900]   The Kardashian Beyonce.
[02:10:39.900 --> 02:10:44.900]   Those new dresses that just don't leave a lot to the imagination.
[02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:46.900]   Oh, yeah.
[02:10:46.900 --> 02:10:51.900]   I'm going to wear a butt dress next time when I get made up like that.
[02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:52.900]   You're makeup.
[02:10:52.900 --> 02:10:53.900]   Yeah.
[02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:54.900]   It's going to say Lori Al needs a new, a new app.
[02:10:54.900 --> 02:10:56.900]   How do you look in a butt dress?
[02:10:56.900 --> 02:10:58.900]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.
[02:10:58.900 --> 02:11:02.900]   We'll get our picks and a number and tool and all that coming up.
[02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:05.900]   Back of the book, as I call it in just a bit.
[02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:09.900]   But first of all, from FreshBooks, the super simple cloud accounting and invoicing solution
[02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:12.900]   that will change your life.
[02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:16.900]   Here's a question for all you fearless entrepreneurs running a small business.
[02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:21.900]   If you started fresh this minute right now, how much time would it take to catch up on all your invoices,
[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:25.900]   organize all your receipts, figure out which client owes you what and when.
[02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:29.900]   That's overwhelming even to think about.
[02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:32.900]   I used to go through that though.
[02:11:32.900 --> 02:11:33.900]   I would have to send bills out.
[02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:38.900]   I told you this when I worked in Canada and I just put it off and put it off and it was.
[02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:40.900]   It gets more overwhelming each month.
[02:11:40.900 --> 02:11:42.900]   But of course, if you don't invoice, you don't get paid.
[02:11:42.900 --> 02:11:45.900]   If you don't collect receipts, you don't get reimbursed.
[02:11:45.900 --> 02:11:50.900]   If you don't record your time and hours, they don't know what you've done.
[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:52.900]   FreshBooks is a super simple solution.

[02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:03.900]   Pay me.
[02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:05.900]   It turns out clients like to pay you.
[02:12:05.900 --> 02:12:08.900]   If it's easy for them, you get paid faster with FreshBooks.

[02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:20.900]   It will also, the app also lets you keep track of your billable hours.
[02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:22.900]   You just press a button, start time tracking.
[02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:24.900]   It's so great.

[02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:46.900]   business person who has to do their own invoicing.
[02:12:46.900 --> 02:12:48.900]   Getting started is easy.

[02:12:55.900 --> 02:12:58.900]   I'm not talking, you know, this is not some big elaborate thing.
[02:12:58.900 --> 02:13:00.900]   It's lightweight, it's fast, it's easy.
[02:13:00.900 --> 02:13:02.900]   Oh man, do I love it.
[02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:06.900]   When they ask you how did you hear about us, if you're doing a favorite mention, Twig,
[02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:08.900]   in that field there, that'd be nice.
[02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:11.900]   FreshBooks.com/twig.

[02:13:12.900 --> 02:13:15.900]   Start your trial right now.
[02:13:15.900 --> 02:13:21.900]   Social PC honor chairman says, I use FreshBooks to reverse invoice my family members for tech support.
[02:13:21.900 --> 02:13:22.900]   You could do that.
[02:13:22.900 --> 02:13:23.900]   Send them an invoice.
[02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:29.900]   Three hours on the phone explaining to you where the start menu is, $500.
[02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:31.900]   You can do that.
[02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:32.900]   Why not?
[02:13:32.900 --> 02:13:38.900]   My lawyer, when I used to have one, the honorable Harry Weindraub Esquire used to always see
[02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:40.900]   on the bill, telephonic communication.
[02:13:40.900 --> 02:13:41.900]   Oh Lord.
[02:13:41.900 --> 02:13:42.900]   The call.
[02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:44.900]   And those are expensive, man.
[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:46.900]   They pick up the phone, the bills.
[02:13:46.900 --> 02:13:47.900]   The timer starts.
[02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:48.900]   You need to start.
[02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:50.900]   You got to have them.
[02:13:50.900 --> 02:13:51.900]   I have them.
[02:13:51.900 --> 02:13:52.900]   Lots of them.
[02:13:52.900 --> 02:13:53.900]   I'm more than one lawyer.
[02:13:53.900 --> 02:13:54.900]   Did you know that?
[02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:55.900]   I'm many lawyers.
[02:13:55.900 --> 02:13:56.900]   And each of them-
[02:13:56.900 --> 02:14:00.900]   The other way, did we ever talk about is the, I don't want to jinx it.
[02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:01.900]   Podcast troll.
[02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:02.900]   Yeah.
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:03.900]   Ding dong.
[02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:04.900]   The troll is dead.
[02:14:04.900 --> 02:14:05.900]   He's dead.
[02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:06.900]   It's dead.
[02:14:06.900 --> 02:14:09.900]   Well he had, you know, they had kind of gone away anyway.
[02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:15.900]   This is the company that had claimed that they patented podcasting and went after the
[02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:21.900]   networks and Adam Corolla and some other smaller podcasts sued them in East Texas.
[02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:25.900]   That's of course a hotbed of podcasting.
[02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:33.500]   And Adam, not, you know, raised money online, crowdfunded some money to fight them.
[02:14:33.500 --> 02:14:34.740]   He said, "I'm going to fight them."
[02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:35.740]   They tried to settle.
[02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:36.900]   He said, "Nope, we're going to court."
[02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:39.180]   Finally, they just said, "All right, forget it."
[02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:40.180]   They dropped it.
[02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:43.740]   And the troll themselves said, "The reason we dropped it is we realized podcasters really
[02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:45.900]   don't make that much money.
[02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:52.860]   We were misinformed."
[02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:57.500]   But then as part of it, and we were involved in this, I can tell you now, you know, because
[02:14:57.500 --> 02:14:58.500]   I think it's over.
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:00.540]   Lisa said, "Must not ever talk about this."
[02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:03.740]   But you know, when you have legal stuff going on, you don't want to talk about it.
[02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:08.460]   But in fact, our lawyers told us that they will, the podcast troll will record anything
[02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:10.060]   you say and use it against you in court.
[02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:11.460]   So you got to be very careful what you say.
[02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:13.140]   So I just kind of clammed up.
[02:15:13.140 --> 02:15:19.500]   But we hired a firm known for defending patent trolls against patent trolls.
[02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:24.100]   The principal of the firm, who was great, I loved her, had knew that judge, because there's
[02:15:24.100 --> 02:15:26.300]   one judge in Tyler, Texas.
[02:15:26.300 --> 02:15:27.740]   She knew that area.
[02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:31.500]   She persecuted, prosecuted cases there, had won cases there.
[02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:33.060]   She was really great at San Francisco.
[02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:38.660]   If anybody needs a good attorney in a patent lawsuit, this one is the best.
[02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:41.340]   I can't remember her name off the top of my head, but...
[02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:42.780]   So this cost you money?
[02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:44.700]   Oh, lots of money.
[02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:47.780]   So we had them come in.
[02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:52.020]   And one of the things we talked about is something called an inter-partase action that
[02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:54.900]   you can do with the patent and trademark office.
[02:15:54.900 --> 02:15:59.500]   If you think the troll's patent is invalid, you can actually go to the patent and trademark
[02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:02.140]   office and contest it.
[02:16:02.140 --> 02:16:05.300]   But our attorney at the time said, "It's a mixed bag.
[02:16:05.300 --> 02:16:08.100]   If you win, great, the whole thing's gone.
[02:16:08.100 --> 02:16:11.020]   If you lose, you've really screwed yourself in court."
[02:16:11.020 --> 02:16:13.020]   That you strengthen your opponent.
[02:16:13.020 --> 02:16:14.020]   Right.
[02:16:14.020 --> 02:16:17.620]   Because your opponent says, "Look, they even filed a claim against it."
[02:16:17.620 --> 02:16:22.020]   And the patent and trademark office reasserted our patent.
[02:16:22.020 --> 02:16:23.740]   So we declined, we decided not to do that.
[02:16:23.740 --> 02:16:26.580]   It's the cheapest way to go.
[02:16:26.580 --> 02:16:29.260]   But we decided, "Yeah, I don't want to take that chance."
[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:32.700]   We felt pretty strongly that we would be able to go down to Tyler, Texas.
[02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:33.700]   I was going to have...
[02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:35.260]   We had a whole strategy.
[02:16:35.260 --> 02:16:39.820]   We were going to have a barbecue on the courtyard, the square...
[02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:41.660]   The courthouse is on a square outside the square.
[02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:44.780]   By the way, the patent trolls, offices are on the square as well.
[02:16:44.780 --> 02:16:52.820]   We were going to have a barbecue and invite all the West Texas podcasters, including...
[02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:55.460]   Including I said, "Okay, I guarantee you there's churches in that town."
[02:16:55.460 --> 02:16:56.460]   The podcast.
[02:16:56.460 --> 02:17:00.860]   So we were going to invite all the ministers from those churches, all the podcasters down.
[02:17:00.860 --> 02:17:04.420]   We were going to invite the jurors to come have barbecue with us so they could meet these
[02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:07.580]   people and understand that it isn't in fact...
[02:17:07.580 --> 02:17:12.220]   This is why it works in Tyler, Texas, in these jurisdictions.
[02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:13.220]   They don't like big companies.
[02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:14.220]   They don't like big business.
[02:17:14.220 --> 02:17:16.180]   They don't like them taking from a little guy.
[02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:20.820]   So the patent troll positions himself as a little guy who's being taken advantage by
[02:17:20.820 --> 02:17:21.820]   the big guy.
[02:17:21.820 --> 02:17:22.820]   GM has...
[02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:24.580]   I invented windshield wipers.
[02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:27.540]   GM has just came in and steamrolled over my rights.
[02:17:27.540 --> 02:17:28.540]   They win.
[02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:29.540]   That's why you win.
[02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:30.540]   Because it's a jury trial.
[02:17:30.540 --> 02:17:31.980]   The jury says, "That's terrible.
[02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:33.580]   We can't allow that."
[02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:36.740]   So we wanted to make sure they understood that that's not the case with podcasting.
[02:17:36.740 --> 02:17:37.740]   We had a great strategy.
[02:17:37.740 --> 02:17:38.740]   I was ready.
[02:17:38.740 --> 02:17:39.740]   I was...
[02:17:39.740 --> 02:17:40.740]   I was...
[02:17:40.740 --> 02:17:41.740]   I was all ready.
[02:17:41.740 --> 02:17:42.740]   And they never sued us.
[02:17:42.740 --> 02:17:46.180]   They sent us a letter asking for $3.5 million.
[02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:47.180]   We just...
[02:17:47.180 --> 02:17:52.100]   He said, "Where'd you get that number?"
[02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:55.220]   I said, "But that's still a gulped letter when you get it."
[02:17:55.220 --> 02:17:56.220]   Yeah.
[02:17:56.220 --> 02:17:57.220]   Yeah.
[02:17:57.220 --> 02:18:03.100]   The funny thing is that these guys weren't the best patent trolls ever because the trick
[02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:07.900]   in patent trolling is to ask for something that's less than the cost of a court case.
[02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:08.900]   Not more.
[02:18:08.900 --> 02:18:09.900]   Right.
[02:18:09.900 --> 02:18:11.740]   If you ask for $3.5 million, I'm going to say...
[02:18:11.740 --> 02:18:12.740]   Our attorney said, "It costs you..."
[02:18:12.740 --> 02:18:13.740]   He said, "It costs you..."
[02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:14.740]   Yeah.
[02:18:14.740 --> 02:18:16.780]   Our attorney said, "It'll be about a million and a half dollars if you go all the way
[02:18:16.780 --> 02:18:17.780]   with this."
[02:18:17.780 --> 02:18:19.500]   Some of that's still cheaper than three...
[02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:24.180]   You're supposed to ask for half a million so that the business person says, "Well, I
[02:18:24.180 --> 02:18:25.860]   shouldn't be giving them this tip."
[02:18:25.860 --> 02:18:28.660]   The business says, "Well, I guess I have to make it...
[02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:30.260]   Even though we know this is not...
[02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:33.500]   We can't take the chance that we're going to have to go to court and pay damages plus
[02:18:33.500 --> 02:18:37.020]   the amount of money they want, so we'll just settle for a smaller amount."
[02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:38.020]   That's how you're supposed to do it.
[02:18:38.020 --> 02:18:39.620]   These guys were pretty inept.
[02:18:39.620 --> 02:18:46.620]   Anyway, thank goodness the Electronic Frontier Foundation decided to pursue this inter-partase
[02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:49.140]   disputation of the patent with the trademark office.
[02:18:49.140 --> 02:18:50.140]   We gave money.
[02:18:50.140 --> 02:18:51.460]   They did a crowdfunding.
[02:18:51.460 --> 02:18:54.220]   They raised a lot of money to do that.
[02:18:54.220 --> 02:18:58.340]   I was nervous, but we helped them with prior art.
[02:18:58.340 --> 02:19:02.620]   We had done a lot of prior art research and we knew a lot of people in early days of podcasting
[02:19:02.620 --> 02:19:04.140]   and so forth.
[02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:08.540]   Their patent claimed they invented podcasting in the mid-90s when, in fact, there were
[02:19:08.540 --> 02:19:11.540]   people before then doing it.
[02:19:11.540 --> 02:19:17.380]   It wasn't called podcasting, but their patent was basically on how you can create an online
[02:19:17.380 --> 02:19:21.220]   playlist that people could then use this program to go out and get the playlist and
[02:19:21.220 --> 02:19:23.900]   get any updates to the playlist.
[02:19:23.900 --> 02:19:28.300]   We showed that many others had done that before then.
[02:19:28.300 --> 02:19:33.220]   Anyway, the US patent trademark office just about a month ago said, "Yep, that's a bad
[02:19:33.220 --> 02:19:35.100]   patent and overturned it."
[02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:37.180]   Now it's not dead.
[02:19:37.180 --> 02:19:39.940]   In theory, they could go again, but I think that they probably don't.
[02:19:39.940 --> 02:19:41.180]   They've learned that you have no money.
[02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:42.180]   That's right.
[02:19:42.180 --> 02:19:43.180]   There's no money.
[02:19:43.180 --> 02:19:44.180]   Double whammy.
[02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:45.180]   $3.5 million.
[02:19:45.180 --> 02:19:46.740]   What are you crazy?
[02:19:46.740 --> 02:19:48.820]   I couldn't write a check for that if I wanted to.
[02:19:48.820 --> 02:19:51.220]   What are you nuts?
[02:19:51.220 --> 02:19:55.620]   So yes, so we hadn't talked about that so much, but thank you EFF for pursuing that, doing
[02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:56.620]   a great job.
[02:19:56.620 --> 02:19:59.660]   I'm blessed to have that.
[02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:11.540]   If you ever need a good law firm in a patent case, I'm probably going to find this.
[02:20:11.540 --> 02:20:13.420]   I should give them a little love.
[02:20:13.420 --> 02:20:22.940]   I'll go back through my emails and I'll find their names.
[02:20:22.940 --> 02:20:25.620]   Lisa's probably going crazy right now.
[02:20:25.620 --> 02:20:26.620]   Shut up.
[02:20:26.620 --> 02:20:27.620]   Shut up.
[02:20:27.620 --> 02:20:28.620]   Shut up.
[02:20:28.620 --> 02:20:30.700]   I talked to a lot of other podcasters.
[02:20:30.700 --> 02:20:34.580]   They went after a lot of people.
[02:20:34.580 --> 02:20:36.340]   Personal audio was the name of the company.
[02:20:36.340 --> 02:20:38.540]   Nothing like a common enemy to bring together a community.
[02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:46.580]   Yeah, I talked to a lot of podcasters and we were all thinking what to do, but since
[02:20:46.580 --> 02:20:55.300]   we had the resources to hire an attorney, we did just in case and to plan going forward.
[02:20:55.300 --> 02:21:01.580]   I cannot find the, this goes back to 2012.
[02:21:01.580 --> 02:21:03.140]   Wow.
[02:21:03.140 --> 02:21:04.140]   Yeah.
[02:21:04.140 --> 02:21:10.380]   I'm sorry, well, you know what?
[02:21:10.380 --> 02:21:11.380]   You can send me an email.
[02:21:11.380 --> 02:21:17.580]   I'll find the information and send you her name if you need them.
[02:21:17.580 --> 02:21:19.340]   But I had nothing to do with killing the trolls.
[02:21:19.340 --> 02:21:21.420]   The trolls were killed.
[02:21:21.420 --> 02:21:31.540]   Thank you very much by Adam Corolla who continued to fight the fight and by the EFF who did
[02:21:31.540 --> 02:21:36.500]   a great job and did the right thing as it turned out.
[02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:38.340]   We didn't have the nerve to do it.
[02:21:38.340 --> 02:21:40.780]   Pursuing an interpartase judgment.
[02:21:40.780 --> 02:21:46.460]   I'm, gosh, I hope it's okay to talk about that.
[02:21:46.460 --> 02:21:48.220]   I hate to do that.
[02:21:48.220 --> 02:21:50.420]   You asked, you know me.
[02:21:50.420 --> 02:21:52.420]   I'll talk about anything, but anyway.
[02:21:52.420 --> 02:21:54.420]   I didn't mean to.
[02:21:54.420 --> 02:21:56.220]   I should be like about you.
[02:21:56.220 --> 02:21:57.940]   I shouldn't sometimes.
[02:21:57.940 --> 02:22:00.420]   The legal stuff I'm supposed to shut the heck up on.
[02:22:00.420 --> 02:22:03.140]   I think this is old now.
[02:22:03.140 --> 02:22:05.660]   By the way, you don't want to hear it now.
[02:22:05.660 --> 02:22:06.660]   Yeah, look at that.
[02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:07.660]   We're all back real.
[02:22:07.660 --> 02:22:08.660]   Yeah, grow back.
[02:22:08.660 --> 02:22:13.780]   An eight to an inch a week, quarter of an inch, I mean a half an inch a month, been
[02:22:13.780 --> 02:22:16.340]   four months, two inches.
[02:22:16.340 --> 02:22:19.420]   Cheetah, Trippani, do you have a tip of the week for us?
[02:22:19.420 --> 02:22:20.420]   I do.
[02:22:20.420 --> 02:22:21.420]   I do.
[02:22:21.420 --> 02:22:26.380]   Google Maps for Android is getting some Google Now love it.
[02:22:26.380 --> 02:22:29.980]   Now because Google goes through your email and knows what's on your calendar, you can
[02:22:29.980 --> 02:22:37.020]   now search for my events and get a map of your upcoming events.
[02:22:37.020 --> 02:22:40.100]   You can search for my reservations and see a map of reservations.
[02:22:40.100 --> 02:22:47.060]   You can see my flights and see results related to your specific events mapped placed right
[02:22:47.060 --> 02:22:48.060]   on the map.
[02:22:48.060 --> 02:22:49.060]   It's pretty cool.
[02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:52.300]   I tried it and it worked for me.
[02:22:52.300 --> 02:22:58.180]   Yeah, it's just kind of more evidence that Google knows all about you and can at least
[02:22:58.180 --> 02:23:01.500]   show, you know, can show you where you're, you know, when your stuff is happening in
[02:23:01.500 --> 02:23:04.740]   an agenda view or now and now in a geographical view in Google Maps.
[02:23:04.740 --> 02:23:06.620]   I think that's just on Android at the moment.
[02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:09.180]   It's version nine, eight, I believe of maps.
[02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:10.180]   Nice.
[02:23:10.180 --> 02:23:11.180]   Very handy.
[02:23:11.180 --> 02:23:12.180]   Jeff, you have a number?
[02:23:12.180 --> 02:23:13.180]   I want to cheat.
[02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:21.980]   The first one I have there, Google Doodle had its first original song about journalist
[02:23:21.980 --> 02:23:22.980]   Nelly Bly.
[02:23:22.980 --> 02:23:25.660]   It's all you need to do.
[02:23:25.660 --> 02:23:27.700]   I loved that Google Doodle.
[02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:28.700]   It was a great song too.
[02:23:28.700 --> 02:23:29.700]   Well, it was.
[02:23:29.700 --> 02:23:30.700]   It was a scary thing.
[02:23:30.700 --> 02:23:31.700]   Yes.
[02:23:31.700 --> 02:23:32.700]   Let's hear it because I didn't hear.
[02:23:32.700 --> 02:23:33.700]   I didn't know there was a song.
[02:23:33.700 --> 02:23:36.700]   I just, I clicked the link because then I read all up on Nelly Blyho.
[02:23:36.700 --> 02:23:37.700]   I didn't know anything.
[02:23:37.700 --> 02:23:44.900]   It's a girl power song.
[02:23:44.900 --> 02:23:45.900]   Yeah.
[02:23:45.900 --> 02:23:46.900]   She was amazing.
[02:23:46.900 --> 02:23:47.900]   She was.
[02:23:47.900 --> 02:23:48.900]   She was.
[02:23:48.900 --> 02:23:50.140]   She did a round though.
[02:23:50.140 --> 02:24:09.020]   She did a round the world in 72 days.
[02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:16.020]   Yeah.
[02:24:16.020 --> 02:24:29.820]   I was a journalist in the late 19th century when women just did not do those kinds of things.
[02:24:29.820 --> 02:24:30.820]   No.
[02:24:30.820 --> 02:24:31.820]   Yeah.
[02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:32.820]   And she was super feminist.
[02:24:32.820 --> 02:24:33.820]   I mean, she was like great.
[02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:34.820]   She was great.
[02:24:34.820 --> 02:24:40.740]   I spent my childhood going to a park in Brooklyn called Nelly Bly and I had no idea that it
[02:24:40.740 --> 02:24:44.460]   was like I didn't know who was named after until years and years later.
[02:24:44.460 --> 02:24:45.460]   It's so funny.
[02:24:45.460 --> 02:24:48.460]   Do you talk about her teach her about her, Jeff and Joe?
[02:24:48.460 --> 02:24:49.460]   No.
[02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:50.540]   In fact, I had a fun to yell at me.
[02:24:50.540 --> 02:24:54.420]   I said I was going to teach a new one in credit course this fall and putting journalism
[02:24:54.420 --> 02:24:55.420]   in context.
[02:24:55.420 --> 02:24:56.420]   Guess what?
[02:24:56.420 --> 02:24:57.420]   Gutenberg.
[02:24:57.420 --> 02:25:02.180]   And I said something to a funner, but I was teaching teaching history.
[02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:03.180]   No, don't do that.
[02:25:03.180 --> 02:25:04.260]   No, we're on the old fronts.
[02:25:04.260 --> 02:25:06.260]   No, I think Gutenberg.
[02:25:06.260 --> 02:25:07.260]   Nelly Bly was a pen name.
[02:25:07.260 --> 02:25:08.900]   Her real name was Elizabeth Cochran.
[02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:09.900]   Seaman.
[02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:11.620]   She also had some patents.
[02:25:11.620 --> 02:25:16.740]   Speaking of patents to her name for a milk can and something else.
[02:25:16.740 --> 02:25:18.740]   She was an inventor.
[02:25:18.740 --> 02:25:22.940]   She faked mental illness and stayed in an institution.
[02:25:22.940 --> 02:25:23.940]   Yeah.
[02:25:23.940 --> 02:25:24.940]   That's amazing story.
[02:25:24.940 --> 02:25:26.500]   And days in a man house.
[02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:27.500]   Amazing.
[02:25:27.500 --> 02:25:31.140]   Very brave, brave woman.
[02:25:31.140 --> 02:25:32.940]   And striking looking at what we're doing.
[02:25:32.940 --> 02:25:33.940]   Quite beautiful.
[02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:36.700]   Yeah, really.
[02:25:36.700 --> 02:25:39.140]   So I was really thrilled.
[02:25:39.140 --> 02:25:41.900]   That's the first Google Doodle I've really learned something about.
[02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:42.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:44.340]   That's why I wanted to do it today.
[02:25:44.340 --> 02:25:45.500]   A, it's pretty, so on.
[02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:46.980]   B, it's a good subject.
[02:25:46.980 --> 02:25:48.900]   And C, it's just well done.
[02:25:48.900 --> 02:25:52.260]   And D, it's journalism, so I get extra credit.
[02:25:52.260 --> 02:25:53.260]   Yeah.
[02:25:53.260 --> 02:25:58.740]   Pretty amazing woman.
[02:25:58.740 --> 02:26:00.740]   She had a...
[02:26:00.740 --> 02:26:02.420]   She died when she was 57, by the way.
[02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:06.660]   A lot of... she was very young during her great successes.
[02:26:06.660 --> 02:26:08.340]   Anyway, yeah.
[02:26:08.340 --> 02:26:09.340]   Nice Google Doodle.
[02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:10.340]   Yeah.
[02:26:10.340 --> 02:26:11.340]   Was that your number?
[02:26:11.340 --> 02:26:12.340]   I wasn't paying...
[02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:13.340]   That was my number.
[02:26:13.340 --> 02:26:14.340]   It was my first song.
[02:26:14.340 --> 02:26:15.580]   That means the number was one.
[02:26:15.580 --> 02:26:16.580]   The number was one.
[02:26:16.580 --> 02:26:17.580]   It was a change.
[02:26:17.580 --> 02:26:18.580]   It was a change.
[02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:19.580]   It was a change.
[02:26:19.580 --> 02:26:21.980]   I like it.
[02:26:21.980 --> 02:26:26.620]   I guess I should make the L.J. or Bain in my tool a week, although I've only just started
[02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:27.620]   playing with it.
[02:26:27.620 --> 02:26:28.620]   I have to say I love it.
[02:26:28.620 --> 02:26:31.420]   By the way, Lisa texted me and said, "Talk all you want about patent trolls.
[02:26:31.420 --> 02:26:32.420]   Suck!"
[02:26:32.420 --> 02:26:33.420]   Okay.
[02:26:33.420 --> 02:26:34.420]   Yeah.
[02:26:34.420 --> 02:26:35.420]   Yeah.
[02:26:35.420 --> 02:26:36.420]   Yeah.
[02:26:36.420 --> 02:26:37.420]   Yeah.
[02:26:37.420 --> 02:26:38.420]   Yeah.
[02:26:38.420 --> 02:26:39.420]   Yeah.
[02:26:39.420 --> 02:26:40.420]   So she was listening.
[02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:42.420]   Hi, sweetie.
[02:26:42.420 --> 02:26:44.740]   There were some other things I wanted to talk about.
[02:26:44.740 --> 02:26:49.420]   Actually, I really think the tool of the week should be Gina's tool, which is pretty darn
[02:26:49.420 --> 02:26:50.420]   amazing.
[02:26:50.420 --> 02:26:51.420]   Really cool.
[02:26:51.420 --> 02:26:52.420]   Thank you.
[02:26:52.420 --> 02:26:53.420]   Wow.
[02:26:53.420 --> 02:26:54.420]   Yeah.
[02:26:54.420 --> 02:26:55.420]   Let's make it a make it the tool of the week.
[02:26:55.420 --> 02:26:57.340]   We were talking about it earlier.
[02:26:57.340 --> 02:26:59.540]   Give me the URL again.
[02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:01.820]   It's makerba.se.
[02:27:01.820 --> 02:27:02.820]   Makerbae.se.
[02:27:02.820 --> 02:27:03.820]   Yeah.
[02:27:03.820 --> 02:27:04.820]   Makerbae.se.
[02:27:04.820 --> 02:27:05.820]   Yeah.
[02:27:05.820 --> 02:27:06.820]   And remember it's Makerbae's.
[02:27:06.820 --> 02:27:07.820]   Makerbae's.
[02:27:07.820 --> 02:27:08.820]   You're the one you are.
[02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:10.660]   And it's a beta right now.
[02:27:10.660 --> 02:27:14.300]   So you can't, you could just, what do you just sign in and then you send out invites
[02:27:14.300 --> 02:27:15.300]   or something or?
[02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:16.300]   Yeah.
[02:27:16.300 --> 02:27:17.300]   It's limited preview.
[02:27:17.300 --> 02:27:19.020]   So someone else has listed you, then you can sign in.
[02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:23.460]   If you get put on the wait list, tweet at me and say you heard about it on twig and I
[02:27:23.460 --> 02:27:27.060]   will get you in and I will let you now tweet you back if you're in.
[02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:31.300]   And actually I've just spent the last 10 minutes giving us handing out invites to twig listeners.
[02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:32.300]   Nice.
[02:27:32.300 --> 02:27:34.100]   So Leo, I updated your photo there.
[02:27:34.100 --> 02:27:35.100]   Thank you.
[02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:36.100]   See your current avatar.
[02:27:36.100 --> 02:27:37.100]   Which is also crappy.
[02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:38.100]   Thank you.
[02:27:38.100 --> 02:27:40.100]   Yeah, it's a complete video.
[02:27:40.100 --> 02:27:43.500]   But you can see who did it too, which is kind of like Wikipedia in that regard.
[02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:44.500]   Yeah.
[02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:45.500]   Yeah.
[02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:47.700]   And you can, if you click on the word updated, you'll even see like the diff.
[02:27:47.700 --> 02:27:48.700]   Yeah.
[02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:49.940]   This is really sweet.
[02:27:49.940 --> 02:27:53.060]   I don't, how long you must have been working on this for a while.
[02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:54.060]   It's been.
[02:27:54.060 --> 02:27:55.060]   That is awesome.
[02:27:55.060 --> 02:27:59.540]   And so since January, we've been, it's pretty thrown together, which is why it's unlimited
[02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:00.540]   preview at the moment.
[02:28:00.540 --> 02:28:03.740]   And it obviously is lacking design and we don't even finish our logo.
[02:28:03.740 --> 02:28:04.740]   No, I like the design.
[02:28:04.740 --> 02:28:05.740]   Leave it.
[02:28:05.740 --> 02:28:06.740]   Leave it.
[02:28:06.740 --> 02:28:07.740]   It's clean.
[02:28:07.740 --> 02:28:08.740]   It's like medium.
[02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:09.740]   Oh, thank you.
[02:28:09.740 --> 02:28:10.740]   Well, that's a compliment.
[02:28:10.740 --> 02:28:11.740]   Yeah, it's beautiful.
[02:28:11.740 --> 02:28:12.740]   Yeah.
[02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:14.740]   So if you're listening, you want in, just tweet at me, I'll get you in.
[02:28:14.740 --> 02:28:18.700]   I'm going to grab some dinner, but then later on tonight I'll send that invites.
[02:28:18.700 --> 02:28:19.780]   But yeah, you can search for projects.
[02:28:19.780 --> 02:28:20.780]   You can search for makers.
[02:28:20.780 --> 02:28:24.620]   You can see what people worked on and how they traveled through their career.
[02:28:24.620 --> 02:28:29.140]   And that's our hope is that we're helping people on board if they want to get involved
[02:28:29.140 --> 02:28:30.140]   in tech.
[02:28:30.140 --> 02:28:32.620]   Yeah, that, yeah, that that's our talks.
[02:28:32.620 --> 02:28:33.620]   There we go.
[02:28:33.620 --> 02:28:34.620]   There we go.
[02:28:34.620 --> 02:28:35.620]   There we go.
[02:28:35.620 --> 02:28:36.860]   People are already putting stuff.
[02:28:36.860 --> 02:28:38.700]   You can Google right at the top there.
[02:28:38.700 --> 02:28:39.700]   Right there.
[02:28:39.700 --> 02:28:40.700]   Look at that.
[02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:41.700]   Nice job.
[02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:43.860]   Thank you.
[02:28:43.860 --> 02:28:47.700]   So again, maker base is the word to remember, but it's dot sc.
[02:28:47.700 --> 02:28:50.060]   So m a k b a dot sc.
[02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:51.820]   Gina, it's your panty.
[02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:53.820]   It's now have to wait a month.
[02:28:53.820 --> 02:28:56.420]   No, three weeks because we're going to do IO together.
[02:28:56.420 --> 02:28:57.420]   Oh, yeah.
[02:28:57.420 --> 02:28:58.420]   Right.
[02:28:58.420 --> 02:28:59.420]   Which is like the 20.
[02:28:59.420 --> 02:29:01.060]   So that's like 20, 20 days, 20 days.
[02:29:01.060 --> 02:29:02.500]   We're out there in three weeks.
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:03.500]   Yeah.
[02:29:03.500 --> 02:29:06.140]   And as soon as Marissa Meyer buys maker base, you'll be rich and you could just do the
[02:29:06.140 --> 02:29:10.300]   show all the time from your lips to your.
[02:29:10.300 --> 02:29:11.300]   Check book.
[02:29:11.300 --> 02:29:12.300]   You know what?
[02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:13.300]   Somebody is going to buy this.
[02:29:13.300 --> 02:29:14.300]   This is really cool.
[02:29:14.300 --> 02:29:15.300]   Yeah, this is really cool.
[02:29:15.300 --> 02:29:17.740]   And I'm going to put all my stuff in there and everything.
[02:29:17.740 --> 02:29:18.740]   That is great.
[02:29:18.740 --> 02:29:19.740]   Oh, thank you.
[02:29:19.740 --> 02:29:20.740]   I appreciate that.
[02:29:20.740 --> 02:29:21.740]   Yeah.
[02:29:21.740 --> 02:29:22.740]   Thank you.
[02:29:22.740 --> 02:29:23.740]   You know, it's cool.
[02:29:23.740 --> 02:29:27.300]   I put in all our shows and all the hosts of our shows, then they will automatically be
[02:29:27.300 --> 02:29:28.660]   allowed to go in.
[02:29:28.660 --> 02:29:29.660]   Exactly.
[02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:34.660]   So if you're in my friend, we want people to invite their collaborators, their co-writers,
[02:29:34.660 --> 02:29:36.620]   their co-authors, their producers.
[02:29:36.620 --> 02:29:37.620]   Yeah.
[02:29:37.620 --> 02:29:40.860]   Anyone who you work with, you've enjoyed, you've made stuff with.
[02:29:40.860 --> 02:29:41.860]   Yep.
[02:29:41.860 --> 02:29:42.860]   Put them in.
[02:29:42.860 --> 02:29:43.860]   Absolutely.
[02:29:43.860 --> 02:29:45.020]   This has been the best week of my life.
[02:29:45.020 --> 02:29:49.980]   Friday, we have this amazing Windows weekly with all of these great Windows podcasters
[02:29:49.980 --> 02:29:54.100]   and I think 50 fans and we drank beer and whiskey and stuff.
[02:29:54.100 --> 02:30:00.380]   Saturday, we unveiled the new screensavers and these already, the fast-lations, the fastest
[02:30:00.380 --> 02:30:02.860]   growing show we've ever done by far.
[02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:03.900]   Oh, that's great.
[02:30:03.900 --> 02:30:04.900]   I can't tell you down.
[02:30:04.900 --> 02:30:08.860]   I don't want to tell you down a lot of numbers yet because they're not complete, but they're
[02:30:08.860 --> 02:30:09.860]   astounding.
[02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:10.860]   Yes.
[02:30:10.860 --> 02:30:14.580]   Really best launch ever.
[02:30:14.580 --> 02:30:17.220]   On Monday, I interviewed Neil Young.
[02:30:17.220 --> 02:30:18.220]   That's right.
[02:30:18.220 --> 02:30:19.220]   Congratulations on that.
[02:30:19.220 --> 02:30:23.340]   Hey, Gina Trappani comes back, the highlight of all of it.
[02:30:23.340 --> 02:30:27.180]   I tell you, I'm going to announce my retirement here and now.
[02:30:27.180 --> 02:30:29.380]   It doesn't get any better than this.
[02:30:29.380 --> 02:30:30.380]   Very far, none.
[02:30:30.380 --> 02:30:31.380]   All pistons.
[02:30:31.380 --> 02:30:32.380]   It's great.
[02:30:32.380 --> 02:30:33.380]   I'm so happy.
[02:30:33.380 --> 02:30:34.380]   I'm so glad.
[02:30:34.380 --> 02:30:35.380]   So happy.
[02:30:35.380 --> 02:30:36.380]   Thank you, Gina.
[02:30:36.380 --> 02:30:37.380]   All the best.
[02:30:37.380 --> 02:30:38.380]   Thank you.
[02:30:38.380 --> 02:30:39.380]   Good luck.
[02:30:39.380 --> 02:30:40.380]   Thank you.
[02:30:40.380 --> 02:30:41.380]   Thank you.
[02:30:41.380 --> 02:30:42.380]   And I'll see you in a few weeks for Google I/O.
[02:30:42.380 --> 02:30:43.380]   May 28th, 29th.
[02:30:43.380 --> 02:30:44.380]   Yeah.
[02:30:44.380 --> 02:30:45.380]   28th and 29th.
[02:30:45.380 --> 02:30:46.380]   Yep.
[02:30:46.380 --> 02:30:47.380]   Jeff Jarvis, are you going anywhere?
[02:30:47.380 --> 02:30:48.380]   You're going to Finland?
[02:30:48.380 --> 02:30:50.740]   And then I'm coming to Google I/O?
[02:30:50.740 --> 02:30:55.740]   Will you be the-- oh, I guess our segues came.
[02:30:55.740 --> 02:30:56.740]   All right.
[02:30:56.740 --> 02:30:59.140]   I'm going home to ride a segway.
[02:30:59.140 --> 02:31:00.140]   Apparently the--
[02:31:00.140 --> 02:31:02.420]   Apparently you didn't buy one.
[02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:03.420]   I bought two.
[02:31:03.420 --> 02:31:04.420]   And apparently the guy delivering them--
[02:31:04.420 --> 02:31:05.420]   No.
[02:31:05.420 --> 02:31:06.420]   Yeah.
[02:31:06.420 --> 02:31:07.420]   Apparently the guy delivering them--
[02:31:07.420 --> 02:31:08.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:09.420]   Say no to me.
[02:31:09.420 --> 02:31:11.420]   He had a crack problem.
[02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:12.420]   Yeah.
[02:31:12.420 --> 02:31:13.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:31:13.420 --> 02:31:19.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:21.620]   Jeff, will you be here next week?
[02:31:21.620 --> 02:31:23.500]   Or will you be in Helsinki?
[02:31:23.500 --> 02:31:24.660]   I'll say-- no, I'll be on the show.
[02:31:24.660 --> 02:31:25.660]   There's no cracker, cracker, cracker.
[02:31:25.660 --> 02:31:29.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:31:29.220 --> 02:31:30.580]   We do the show.
[02:31:30.580 --> 02:31:31.580]   It's the last show of the week.
[02:31:31.580 --> 02:31:33.660]   And I'm always punchy when I do the show, which
[02:31:33.660 --> 02:31:35.780]   makes it a little bit looser.
[02:31:35.780 --> 02:31:36.780]   What's going on there?
[02:31:36.780 --> 02:31:37.780]   Is there a gradual fade?
[02:31:37.780 --> 02:31:38.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:31:38.780 --> 02:31:40.620]   It kind of fits-- it does.
[02:31:40.620 --> 02:31:41.620]   It could be.
[02:31:41.620 --> 02:31:42.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:31:42.620 --> 02:31:43.620]   That wasn't intentional.
[02:31:43.620 --> 02:31:44.620]   I'm going to see--
[02:31:44.620 --> 02:31:47.620]   I'm going to have Lisa feed this into the L'Oreal makeup
[02:31:47.620 --> 02:31:48.620]   creator and see what's--
[02:31:48.620 --> 02:31:50.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:31:50.620 --> 02:31:52.820]   What happens?
[02:31:52.820 --> 02:31:56.060]   We do the show Wednesday afternoons 1 p.m.
[02:31:56.060 --> 02:31:57.060]   Pacific 4 p.m.
[02:31:57.060 --> 02:31:58.860]   Eastern time 2000 UTC.
[02:31:58.860 --> 02:32:01.620]   I want you to watch live because probably all the good stuff
[02:32:01.620 --> 02:32:02.860]   will be edited out.
[02:32:02.860 --> 02:32:05.500]   But if not, if you can't get the on-demand audio and video
[02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:07.180]   after the fact, then that's always available.
[02:32:07.180 --> 02:32:10.180]   Twitter.tv/twigger, wherever you get your shows,
[02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:11.060]   do subscribe.
[02:32:11.060 --> 02:32:12.780]   You know, I was looking at stats.
[02:32:12.780 --> 02:32:16.180]   And for a long time, like the first eight, nine years
[02:32:16.180 --> 02:32:18.740]   of the Twitter network, 90% of the shows
[02:32:18.740 --> 02:32:19.740]   were downloaded on iTunes.
[02:32:19.740 --> 02:32:21.780]   It was just by default.
[02:32:21.780 --> 02:32:22.620]   That's gone way down.
[02:32:22.620 --> 02:32:24.700]   It's like 30% now.
[02:32:24.700 --> 02:32:26.940]   And the podcast clients on various platforms
[02:32:26.940 --> 02:32:29.100]   have just taken over.
[02:32:29.100 --> 02:32:31.220]   So that's subscribe in your podcast client
[02:32:31.220 --> 02:32:32.500]   or use one of the great Twitter apps.
[02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:33.220]   They're wonderful.
[02:32:33.220 --> 02:32:35.460]   And we've got some exciting news coming on our Twitter apps.
[02:32:40.460 --> 02:32:42.700]   I guess it's time for T&2, so I better wrap this thing up.
[02:32:42.700 --> 02:32:43.420]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:32:43.420 --> 02:32:45.620]   We'll see you next time on Twig.

[02:32:49.100 --> 02:32:52.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
